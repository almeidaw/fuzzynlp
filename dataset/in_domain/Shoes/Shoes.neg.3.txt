 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 So I bought my pair of Bronx shoes from a shoe store , not Amazon , but they are the same model . I really like the style , and they are very comfortable . I liked everything about the shoes until one of the eyelets came apart and scratched a hole through the shoe tongue about five months after I bought them . No problem , I thought , Bronx is supposed to be great about repairing or replacing shoes . Well , that is not the case . I emailed Bronx , and they were not helpful at all . So , this is a great shoe , but it seems to have a manufacturing defect wherein the holes that the laces go through come undone and a little metal wire will poke through . I did n't use these as football shoes or anything , just light to normal use . Well , it was all too bad , because I wanted to love them . Would not recommend for the price .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy

 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 Surprise ... A CD shows up not a pair of shoes.The title of the CD `` the day the colors died '' by Bloomsday , I think some how the description and title are confused.Too bad because I wanted shoes not a CD!My bad for not checking the whole description etc. .

 I tried to wear these shows for a while but theu are way too narrow for my foot . Have given them to Goodwill .
 I received a pair that was not a pair . One was 9 for children and the other one was for adults !!!! Impossible to wear them . I did n't have time to send it back and do all the work it implied . Then I kept them and lost my money & iexcl ; & iexcl ; Never again I will buy shoes by internet mail !

 Heel height is advertised as 3 inches . The cork part is 3 inches but the lining adds another 1/2 inch which was more than I could handle . Wish the description had given actual height of heel . These shoes are beautiful and fit well . I will not wear them .

 The description say lots of padding in the footbed ... well it DOES N'T HAVE ANY ! Secondly , the size I ordered said 71/2 medium ... well this shoe is a narrow ! The shoe style is beautiful ! And like the other review it is hard to get on ... So mad I have to pay shipping back-after the shoe was described in an dishonest way from -LSB- ... -RSB- ! I will never trust -LSB- ... -RSB- AGAIN !
 I do n't get these boots ! I could n't even get the boot on so I ca n't tell you how they feel . I would not recommend these . RETURNED !

 I have several pairs of Cordani shoes , but these are really strange . It 's like they are made for paws and not feet . The length is normal , but the thong and back support straps are so long , they barely stay on my feet .
 I have several pairs of Propet shoes and have considered them to be great for people with foot problems . These sandals are among the most comfortable I have ever worn and until today I would have given them 5 stars.However , as I was walking down the street today , the stitching came loose all around one whole side of the right one . There are also cracks in the sole and heel , I have had the shoes a few years , but have not worn them that much . The name is still clear in the bottom of the shoe , the size information is not worn off , etc. . They look almost new . I have never had a shoe fall apart while I was walking along.I phoned customer service at Propet and was give a run-around . I was told the shoes have a 6-month warranty , so nothing could be done . The woman said it was just `` policy . '' That kind of answer makes me see red because policy is established by a company , not handed down from God . It 's a way to dismiss the concerns of the person making a complaint.She suggested I write a letter , which I certainly will . If I do not get some satisfaction , I will not purchase Propet shoes again .
 I received this on a Thursday and used it the next day . The zipper separated , I used it one time . It is very cheaply made , not worth the money . I emailed the company and did n't get a response back . I will never buy anything from this seller again . The shipping was as much as the Id Holder , and it is very light . What a waste of money ! So I 'm out my money and an Id Holder ...
 its not at all good , i dont know why reebok has such weird modelits so hard inside
 I recieved the burg . eel skin cig . case - very nice to the eye - but the first day I rused it , the front pouch already ripped - looks nice and classy - but is cheaply made.New Ladies EELskin Cigarette Case Lighter Holder Wallet #MWE 342
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!

 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 Two days over due , shipper blames sellers , and I am barefoot ! Need these shoes tomorrow , now I will look like a fool ! Thanks so much !! : - -LRB-
 These are the most uncomfortable shoes ever !! I tried to wear them once to the office and had to run out the the nearest shoe store and get another pair of shoes to get me through the day !
 The shoe sole was great , but the surface material was too flimsy and tore off a different places within a few days . This shoes is not for regular work-out , but only for casual wear .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 The right boot had a fold in the inner liner of the leather upper , digging in to a toe . There is also a defect of the finish on the leather right at the tip of the toe . I am returning the boots . Quality control should be better for such obvious flaws . Made in China .

 This product came on time , looked very nice , but fell apart within a month or less .
 Appeared to be nice however after wearing once for about 6 hours both inserts are peeling out . Very poorly made and really not worth the money .

 I really like the look of this shoe for work , especially the low heel . But , I wore them one day and have the worst blisters on my heels . They are so bad I ca n't even wear normal shoes , and its been 5 days . Conseidering the brand I expected them to be the most comfortable shoes ever . I wore them without stockings , so that may be the problem . Hopefully I can break them in and will be able to wear them again because they were such a great deal !
 Smart looking shoes , painful to wear !!! . If you have delicate feet , these shoes are definitely not for you , first time I wore them , I developed awful blisters . I do not have wide feet but these shoes are really narrow . If you normally buy Naturalizer for their reputation of being comfortable , you should not buy these shoes .
 I recently bought the Converse Desert 8 '' Tactical boot and the zipper broke on the second use . I attempted to communicate with Converse and they failed to respond after the 1st email . My conclusion is that Converse does NOT stand behind their product and that these are Cheap MADE IN CHINA crap and not worthy their customer support . Consequently , I will NEVER buy anything made by Converse again . I make below minimum wage and it took me forever to save up for what I thought were quality boots .

 These shoes may be comfortable , but it 's also comfortable to wear your pajamaas to work and sweat pants to a wedding ... . these shoes , made in China look -LRB- and even smell -RRB- like cheap plastic . The sole and heel is a rubber which I found unattractive . Given that the shoes are supposed to look like leather , and are relatively dressy shoes that one would wear with Dockers or a suit , I think they do n't successfully do what they 're supposed to do , beyond being comfortable . Comfort and nice appearance are not a necessary tradeoff!Even at this highly discounted price -LRB- there 's a reason they 're so cheap -RRB- , you can do better !! Keep on shopping ...

 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 this shoe is just perfect with everything but when you walk with it for a long time your toes will hurt w/the wooden sole ... Just to painful . . good for short distance walking .

 The shoe was defective due to the inner sole being totally lifted . Amazon sent a replacement but it had the same defect . Product looks good but not as comfortable as other kid brands such as UMI or Stride Rite .
 I ordered a pair of these and they fit well and looked great . However , within one week the uppers were splitting away from the sole at the toe and tongue was seperating from the side of the shoe . Might work well for someone who does n't walk a lot , but I 'm constantly moving around and these wo n't hold up to that kind of wear .
 I found these shoes to be rather uncomfortable . They were narrow and hurt when I walked in them a lot . I got the brown.The leather was stiff too ... love the Ak Anne Klein MANNY , much softer more supple leather .

 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes .

 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .

 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .

Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

 These shoes fit great and are very comfortable . Unfortunately I have wore them for 1 month and they are literally falling apart already . The rubber strip that runs above the sole and holds the sole to the upper shoe has come undone and is hanging off of the shoe now . It 's only a matter of time before the entire sole comes off . I have n't even done any sort of work in these shoes , just wore them to and from my desk job . I will be returning these and avoiding skechers shoes from now on .
 First order arrived with left shoe being at least one full size larger than right shoe . Neither shoe was accurate 10.5 D as ordered . Returned and received shoes that were inconsistent in size again and were poorly constructed . Quality has declined in this shoe and it is very disappointing . Seam stitching was crooked and overall quality was not worth the price .
 I bought these for my husband who has always worn Sebago loafers , usually purchased at Nordstroms . I purchased these online to save a trip to the mall . He wore them 2 times and on the second time -LRB- several months apart as he dose n't dress up too often -RRB- , the top stitching came undone ! In 20 + years of wearing this brand that has never happened . I 'm unsure if Amazon is selling the rejects of Sebago 's or not . Amazon says it 's too late to return , but they are clearly defective and their return policy stinks ! I wo n't be buying shoes off here again !
 These shoes are ok for the price , but the uppers are 100 % corrected grain -LRB- i.e. cheap , inferior leather which has been sanded down and built back up with laquers and polishes -RRB- . They were full of unsightly creases after the first day I wore them . The leather soles also wear much faster than my other leather soled shoes -LRB- i.e. Allen Edmonds , Alden , Johnston & Murphy -RRB- . Also , the `` penny '' holding part of these penny loafers has been glued to the upper , so you ca n't actually put any pennies in them -LRB- not that you 'd want to , but still demonstrative of cheap construction -RRB- . The fit is good -- I needed a `` B '' width , and these things do n't slip off my heels.The comfort is ok -- what you would expect in a penny loafer , but not otherwise outstanding -LRB- as is the case with a cork-soled AE -RRB- . Bottom line
 I recently bought the Converse Desert 8 '' Tactical boot and the zipper broke on the second use . I attempted to communicate with Converse and they failed to respond after the 1st email . My conclusion is that Converse does NOT stand behind their product and that these are Cheap MADE IN CHINA crap and not worthy their customer support . Consequently , I will NEVER buy anything made by Converse again . I make below minimum wage and it took me forever to save up for what I thought were quality boots .

 God Awful boots , I wear up to 4 pairs of boots per year . I work in Industrial maintance and I Hike when I can . And those Boots were sooo Uncomfortable I gave them away I should of got my money back . The top of boot is not form fitted and is abrasive and uncomfortable also .
 This is the poorest boot that I have ever purchased . The right sole was rounded and the boot for a wide is very narrow . I returned them for a refund .

 I use to work extensively on mountain tops doing remote communication site work . I needed something that would keep my feet relatively dry and provided great traction . These shoes were great ! The problem was they were and are cheaply engineered and do not last under even normal walking conditions . The sole wears away , the tread disappears , nothing on this shoe is built to last and at a price of over 100 dollars its not worth it . I initially thought that the reason my Keen Targhees were wearing out was that I was that rough on them . So I bought 2 pairs at the same time and used 1 set for just driving shoes / walking downtown and the other for mountain trips . It did n't matter which I did they lasted about the same time plus or minus a month . The only noticable difference was my mountain set was weathered just a bit more from the inclimate weather I subject them to . But all of the typical failures were prevalent on both sets . If you are in to shelling out 100 + dollars every 6 months for these then go right ahead . I have seen so many reviews just like mine that you 'd figure Keen would do something about it by now . Alas its been 4 years since I bought my first pair and they are still being put together the same and failing the same . - The Alaskan Keen Reviewer
 Keen make a great product , but in ordering them on line , I 'm never sure which size to order . I normally wear a size 8 and for the Alamosa 's I ordered , this was fine . The Targee 's however were too small in an 8 , as were the Syskyu 's . I finally ordered a pair os Syskyu 's in 8.5 and so far seem to do OK ; but I have n't had them very long.The Targee 's I ordered were also a lot darker in color than pictured .
 i too thought the kleen Targhee hiking boots were built to last based on their looks and feel but soon found out otherwise . i couldnt belive just how fast the bottom tread disappeared . soon after came the inner linings , tearing at the seems on both shoes about the same time . i wore them everyday for approx . six months . i almost bought another pair but reminded myself just how short there life span was . I cant make that same mistake twice otherwise that would be shame on me .
 It 's been exactly one year since I bought them . As some reviewers pointed out , they were comfortable out of the box . I used them almost every day except summer time in Chicago . The thread is half of the original now . They did not have waterproofing from the beginning.Before this pair I had New Balance walking shoes that served me almost 5 years . There is no way I 'll buy Keen 's junk again .
 This was my second pair of Targhee II 's , and this pair fell apart quicker than the first pair . They felt great for about the first month , before the sole started to wear quickly , as well as the shoe losing it 's cushioning properties ...
 I 've been wearing these boots in the snow and mud . The front ends -LRB- toe ends -RRB- of the shoes are wet inside after walking in the snow for several miles . I do n't agree with the Keen website that says , `` The shoe is revamped with the KEEN.DRY waterproof breathable membrane to keep your feet dry and comfortable '' nor do I agree with the amazon.com description above that there is a `` waterproof barrier '' . These boots are not waterproof . -LRB- My previous boots had Goretex lining and they were waterproof . -RRB- I bought a bigger size than usual . From the Keen website
 Clunky and stiff - I found them to be most uncomfortable . They seemedto have a shape different from my feet .
 The shoes are comfortable out of the box . However , the colors do n't match the images on line . I got the `` Dark Earth / Madder Brown '' -LRB- a soft reddish brown -RRB- and that is what it says on the box but it looks more like a mix of all the other shoes . I like the shoes but I am not sure what I will get if I return them . Function is more important than looks . Anybody else have this problem ?
 I bought these at Dicks . The back of the shoe was very loose and rubbed against my heel . I ended up returning them . They just fit funny . I am 11 and 1/2 and bought this size . 11 was not a good fit so it had to be the shoe . The shoe looked good and I wanted them to work but they did not .
 I ca n't recommend this shoe as being functional or comfortable in the long run . A number of flaws include :1 -RRB- the sole of the shoe began to peel of starting at the side `` fingers '' after just 3 months of use around 3 times per week through woods , creeks , beaches , stone , and pavement .2 -RRB- the fabric in the inside of the shoe heel area began to come undone at 3 months also .3 -RRB- the sole of the shoes on my size 13 's curves upward forcing the toes to be bent up , unnaturally , after extended use it can make them feel almost like they are broken the next day .4 -RRB- When I first tried on this shoe it felt great , with a solid looking construction and overall good look to it ; however after hikes of as little as six miles , my pinky toe 's begin to get pushed into a triangular cylinder with its two neighbors beginning to experience the same . At around 9miles I have experienced painful blisters such that I had to take them off and use a back up pair of sandals instead . So far after a day or so my toes go back to their normal shape .5 -RRB- I like a lowtop shoe better than a hightop but these should be 1/2 inch to an inch higher . I feel this would prevent that much less water , dirt , sand , leaves , twigs from entering the shoe .6 -RRB- the tung of the shoe is generally dysfunctional and good at capturing bits of plant and holding it there .7 -RRB- amazingly this is the slipperiest shoe I ever recall wearing , obviously on algae covered rocks but also on other wet rocks and even cement with a film of fall leaf juice , w/o the leaves.I shot an email to the keen group letting them know that I was pissed off about the shoe falling apart -LRB- it is the most expensive shoe I have purchased , paying ~ $ 98 including tax -RRB- . They replied and said to either try and return it or to fill out a return request thing . So I took them to my local store of purchase asked if the shoes had a warranty , they looked it up and said `` 1 year on the tread , 2 years on the water proofing '' They called up the keen talked to them for a second explaining the flaws I told them about -LRB- #s 1 and 2 above -RRB- took my old shoes and gave me a new pair . So one thing I can say is that keen and my friendly store people have excellent customer service . I have had the new shoes for about a month with the same complaints -LRB- 3-7 above -RRB- . honestly I wish I had a better shoe . I 'll probably be exchanging these in a few month , like 2 more , because a new area of the fabric is becoming `` fringed '' where the synthetic fabric meets the leather on the outside of the shoe . I think this happened while working under my truck.I wish I could recommend another shoe , perhaps a shoe that is made by fairly paid workers instead of a prison camp in china ? -LRB- this would be complaint # 8 however it is a likely assumption but I have not looked for specific proof , further more it seems nearly all shoes are made by such regimes a major problem of foreign policy , expensive crappy products -RRB- best prospects !
 Do n't make the same mistake I did and buy these shoes.Based upon good reviews and reputation of the brand , I bought them and they are painful shoes to wear.Heavy and the top of the shoe bend in onto the top of your foot .
 Please pay close attention to review below as it is 100 % on the mark . Other people have commented on these Keen 's all over the internet . Yes , they are wonderful , comfortable shoes right out of the box , perhaps some of the most comfortable shoes you will put on your feet . However , as the reviewer below points out , they will only last you 6 months of everyday wear . They literally come apart at the seams and the soft rubber on the soles just peals away . If you can afford to replace these every 6 months , then go for it . Keen needs to do some serious work with the Chinese factory that makes these things to improve quality and increase the longevity of the product . `` I use to work extensively on mountain tops doing remote communication site work .

 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .

 although a cute shoe , it fits a little more narrow than other charles david shoes i own . also , the vendor sent me the wrong size . there was a sticker covering the real size on the bottom of the shoe and came 1/2 size too small .
 These shoes are cute like the other reviewer said and it is narrow . But i do n't recommend wearing these shoes for more than an hour . Beneath the circle and the straps the material is not smooth and will burn through your skin if you wear them for too long . The top views of the shoes are more accurate than the first picture .

 After many calls and emails with EastBay , they were not able to successfully deliver shoes to me after 4 weeks . I cancelled the order and made a local purchase . The shoes likely would have been fine - EastBay 's ability to deliver the shoes to me was non-existent . This is the first time I have had any online purchase delivery issues with many purchases over the years from Amazon , Ebay and other online retailers . Quite disappointing .
 These shoes do not have the moving air pocket that the old classic DMX has . I would not reccomend them
 Customers ! Beware ! This bag is made of % 100 PVC ! Which is pure plastic NOT leather ! I could find a piece of plastic way cheaper than $ 150 .
 This is not patent leather as Amazon states but 100 % PVC -LRB- there is a label inside the bag stating it -RRB- . The bag looks beautiful but for pure plastic $ 150 is way too much .
 Ca n't find it in black , ca n't find it in red , Bloomingdales is always out , Maxx New York is always out , Amazon is always out . Any idea when you may have it back in stock ??? Since November it has been unavailable . Why carry it at all on the site if it 's never available . I 'm sure it 's a gorgeous bag ... too bad no one can get one !!!
 The style is ok . The quality is poor . The left shoe is much narrower than the right one . Be careful ! Do n't waste your money .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 I tried on a size 12 in the Super Runner 's Shop in NYC which felt like I was walking on a soft marshmellow cloud but the size was a tad tight . Searched various runners stores in NYC for a twelve and a half to no avail and ended up ordering on line , size twelve and a half . They are n't the same and although the fit is good , they 're way too hard.I gave them to my stepson and ended up with a pair of Brooks instead

 Despite of how cute they look , I decided to give them only 2 stars . There is no padding for your feet and the shoes make loud noises clicking the floor . If you like to pamper your feet , do n't get them .

 I have a hard time finding shoes that fit with my high arches . I hesitate to order tennis shoes because most of them are poorly designed -- they are designed to kill your ankles , rub them raw when walking , and damage your achilles tendon . This shoe is just another example
 My Mom wanted these shoes . She has a terrible time getting shoes that fit her feet . Aways before there was no problem but this time the quality was definitely poorer ! The part of the shoe that fits around her ankle is loose and does n't fit well . . she is quite disappointed ! and they are made in China ... that bites too ! She does n't plan on buying another pair !
 I purchased these shoes because they came wide , and I have a wide forefoot and bunions . Unfortunately , the heels on these shoes are as wide as the front of the shoe , and I could not lace them up enough to keep the heels from slipping . I have never seen such a wide heel on any shoe . Why do shoe makers assume your entire foot is wide ? These shoes might work for someone with swollen feet or a very wide foot all over , but they did not fit me at all in the heel . They are not as clunky as many wide shoes , and the leather was soft . I am returning the shoes , and continuing my quest for a wide , decent-looking shoe with a normal heel width .
 I normally wear an extra wide shoe . I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it .
 I really wanted to make the Rocket Dog shoes work . They 're stylin and eco-friendly -LRB- the white hemp version is -RRB- . Problem is Rocket Dog does n't realize guys wo n't wear shoes that do n't fit.I 'm normally a size 11-12 , so I ordered one of each . Did n't fit . Returned and ordered a 10.5 . Did n't fit because the shoes still slipped quite a bit when walking . I could tell they would end up giving me blisters on my heel if I did any serious walking . Returned and ordered a 10 . This time they were too small and compressed my toes.Whoever is in charge of sizing @ Rocket Dog should be fired . I 've never been so frustrated with fitting shoes . If you really want these , find them in a store somewhere and try them on . DO N'T ORDER THEM ONLINE or you 'll be spending lots of money on return shipping .
 they looked ok in the picture . but on the feet they felt simply awful . i just tossed them .

 I personally do not like , as I saw them potresen.Te are some more artificial leather that looks like a raincoat.A customer read above is very happy in Kabul , but I am afraid that if you pull them out of the box to crack the skin , so hurry to sell them to anyone in Kabul who will like them.I thought that SWAT is a proven company and sell only quality goods and are therefore sympathetic to the price , but it turned out that for less money you can not buy quality .

 I 've been buying a new pair of Tevas every year for the past 4 years because I 've loved & used them so much.I ordered a 7 again this year , but it was too small . I ordered a 7.5 and that was too big . They must have changed manufacturers , or changed something about the shoe.I 've been looking in brick-and-mortar stores as well , hoping the shoes shipped from Amazon were just a bad batch . No luck yet though.I will be really disappointed if I ca n't find any that fit next year .
 Due by 2/24/12 - 2/29/12 ... . arrived 03/03/2012 . LATE and extremely disappointed , will NOT purchase from supplier -LRB- HEART & SOLE SHOES -RRB- again . The correct item -LRB- color/size -RRB- was shipped correctly - so i gave it 2 stars . Amazon is usually better than this.The actual sandal was comfortable and acceptable . It deserves 5 stars . I have bought 7 pairs -LRB- from other people -RRB- and I do LOVE the flip-flops .
 Wore them once . Thought they felt good . They looked really nice . Woke up the next morning and could n't walk . Have been limping ever since -LRB- 3 weeks so far -RRB- . Thumbs down for lousy arch support .
 Teva 's are very comfortable , but do n't leave them in the sun ! They shrink ! I left my new sandals in the back of my Jeep while I was at work one day . When I came out the top portion of the sole had shrunk and curled up . Did n't realize they were so fragile ... not happy . $ 30 bucks wasted .
 Very uncomfortable to wear . I did not realize from the photos before purchased , that this was a `` thong '' - thought it was a criss/cross flip flop . Not only is it a thong , but a coarse and narrow thong material is utilized , making them quite painful and uncomfortable - cutting between the toes . Teva has a good name , but this flip flop is a disappointment - only good for bath to bedroom to dress . Too bad , as they are quite attractive
 I have VERY narrow feet . I ordered these and actually had trouble wedging my foot in . Once I did , wearing them was impossible due to the straps rubbing blisters on the tops of my feet . I had to send them back .
 I had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes . This makes it really uncomfortable and I have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap . Nice colors , not very cushy sole because it 's so thin and overall very sorry I bought them without trying first .
 Have bought several pairs of this exact sandal in the past few years . The pair I received was too wide to wear-so I had to return it . Not happy . Will not buy this product online again -- Not consistent sizing .
 I bought these sandals because of the name and users recommendations . I found then to be uncomfortable due to the material between my toes.I offered them to my daughter and she also found the material uncomfortable .
 The pair I received were a beautiful color -- just what I was looking for , but one of the sandals was not manufactured properly , one of the bands that crosses over the foot was way too long , so it did n't fit properly . I was disappointed to have to send it back , bc there were no others to get a replacement .
 This is the 2nd pair of these sandals I 've ordered . I LOVED the first pair . They were so comfortable , light weight , fit secure on my feet and provided arch support . So I ordered another pair of the exact same sandal for this season . I do n't know what 's happened in the manufacturing process but the quality has definitely suffered . The straps were all over the place , some were way too loose , others too snug . They were not comfortable mainly due to the way the straps were sewn , so I sent them back to Amazon and requested a refund . Have not received yet . I also ordered a pair of the Mandalyn Wedge Ola flip flop at the same time . Again , I have had another pair of those , and the new ones were not as comfortable . Foot bed was harder than first pair , straps not uniform as to fit . TEVA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR QUALITY ???
 This Teva style looks pretty nice for a flip flop . The strap configuration is the whole thing , the only thing I can see that distinuishes it from a $ 1.99 drugstore version.The third time I wore mine , the strap on one came loose . This means the main strap over the foot that holds the sandal on slipped out of its mooring 1/2 or 3/4 inch , from where it connects to the body of the shoe . I was just walking down a cement sidewalk with my dog.From that moment , the whole shoe is much too loose , and easy to trip with . Insecure . And the whole reason I chose this style was to have a more secure flip flop on my feet.I just could not face writing the company and shipping it back and paying $ 5 more to return an $ 18 item . Would not buy again . Disappointed in Teva .
 I was sure with all the good reviews that these sandals would be awesome . Well for me ... they are not . I do not like the way they feel at all . They are cushy on the bottom which is nice but they are just not comfy . The straps are not comfy . Sadly . . I threw my money away on these since I had to wear them to find out I do not like them . Poor me . .
 I purchased the sandals for myself but was not able to wear them because they run narrow , I even went a size up because I have wide feet . . I ended up giving them away to someone with a narrow foot . .
 I like flip flops . These were cute and on a good sale . For me , the sensation of webbing wrapped around my big toe was n't comfortable - or was it just too tight around the toe for my liking ? Had to return them , since I knew they would n't get worn .
 shoe is not supportive . Even if it is a Teva . I am need support for arches . It is very cute but if you need stablization even with extra strapes this is not it .
 These fit a little small for the size , even from other Chacos . I ended up returning them since the straps seemed tight .
 I have been wearing these Teva sandals for three years now , and I have to say that I was really disappointed with this year 's crop of sandals . I used to love these sandals because the bottom part of the flip flop was so squishy and comfy and because they fit my narrow feet so perfectly . They were by far the most comfortable shoes I 've ever owned . I would wear mine every day throughout the summer , until I wore the heels through!But this year , its seems that Teva decided that the fit was too narrow for the majority of their customers so they decided to make the fit a bit wider , the straps a bit looser . I tried on multiple different styles and colors while I was at the shoe store , and it seems that they 've all be changed to fit this way . Unfortunately , this completely changed the comfortability of the sandal for me . Though they fit length-wise like they used to , they now feel like they 're about two sizes too big for me and flop around way too much . Where before I would have rated these shoes 5 + stars , I can now only give them 2 stars . They are no longer my favorite sandals , and I really wish that Teva had n't decided to mess with a sandal that would have been my favorite go-to summer sandal for years to come .
 I have very narrow feet and bought a pair of these a few years ago . They fit perfectly . Now they 're old and not very supportive so I went to get another pair . The straps are so loose on the new ones that they barely stay on my feet . I was so disappointed . If you have narrow feet the 2011 version of these probably wo n't fit . I 'm sad that shoes for wide feet have taken over the world . I am stuck with my old ones until they fall apart .
 I ordered these shoes because I loved the way they looked . When I received them , I was shocked at how comfortable they were ! However , the reason why I gave these shoes only two stars was because of their tightness . I wear a size 7 and I am always true to size , however , these shoes felt extremely tight , even after attempting to stretch them out . In addition to feeling quite snug , every time I walked in them , I felt as if my feet were slipping out the back little by little each step . Also , these shoes do not offer much support . If you want a shoe this in this style , I recommend checking out Rafters Antigua Sandals .
 I normally wear an extra wide shoe . I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it .

 I 've got these shoes and they look good , but after some minutes of constant using you will feel the hardness of the sole and they will become uncomfortable.Recommended only for using occasionally and for some minutes . Otherwise you will end with feet pain .
 I love the way my shoes look and fit . However , the right sole came unglued within 2 weeks . I was very disappointed because they are unwearable . I usually have good luck with Roos , and maybe I got a bad pair , but do n't say you were n't warned !
 I ordered this product thinking it 'll look like the Steve Madden ones I have seen everywhere . This seemed to look exactly like the more expensive counterpart and it was n't ! i got the shoes and returned them immediately ! the quality was SOOOO bad ... it looked like it was falling apart -LRB- stitching on the inside and outside of the shoe -RRB- from the second I got it . I would never ever buy shoes from this company ever again . I returned it and bought the real Steve Maddens instead .
 I bought the shoes 10/10 . Looked good , felt good but the buckle was different from the originals . 4/11 the buckle stud broke off , rendering the entire pair useless , as the strap can not stay closed now . A complete waste of money and , of course I do n't have the original shipping box . Who actually saves garbage ?
 I have no issue with the buckle -- it is easy to adjust -- just search on the reviews , here . But , after a screw fell out , I tightened all of the remaining screws only to discover that three of the screws on the opposite shoe simply turn without tightening . I 'm sorry to say this because I really loved these shoes in the past , but this newer version is junk .
 I wore Dr. Scholls Exercise Sandals for about 10 years and loved them . I was hoping for the same sandal when I ordered these . My foot size has not changed over the years , but these sandals do n't fit correctly . The `` ball '' does n't hit at the right place and the leather rubs my foot . Also , I ca n't adjust the strap . I 've read and re-read the instructions , but nothing I do will release the buckle so that I can tighten the shoe . The leather is stiff and uncomfortable .
 I read the instrutions here on how to adjust the buckle but they do not work for me . I 'm about to send these sandles back . Can anyone explain , very simply , how to move the buckle so I can make these shoes fit tighter ??
 I truly never understood what was so great about these shoes . Before I got them and wore them , I liked them better . . After wearing them , I realized they were just plain . . clunky . I clunk around in them all day . I have n't worn them in a while , needless to say . They ok in the comfort department , but not great . And , as some other reviewers mentioned , I was never able to get the hang of easily adjusting the strap . I only tried a few times , because , again , I did n't wear them all that much , but still . There are cuter shoes in the world that do n't make you feel so dumpy and frustrated .
 I recently ordered the `` Original Dr. Scholl 's Exercise Sandals . '' They came today , and I plan to return them for a very important reason
 I also purchased a pair thinking they were the original sandals that I had worn and loved for so many years . Not only is the wood not well shaped anymore but the leather upper on any of the design sandals is thin fabric and thus flimsy . The best part of the original sandals was the great toe grip . That is what made this sandal famous and gave us all such wonderful calves ! The new ones are almost flat . I also sent mine back but beware ... check this before you buy . I had to pay a restocking fee to send them back ! So you pay shipping , then hate them and send them back paying more shipping AND a restocking fee . Might as well have kept them . I am very disappointed and wrote to Dr Scholls to let them know .
 The name of these is very misleading ; these are not at all the * Original * exercise sandals . I 've worn Dr , Scholl 's sandals for 35 years and far as I can tell , the only `` original '' element in these is materials -- wood and leather .1 . As many others have noted , the toe ridge has almost disappeared so you do n't have anything to grip . As someone with ankle stability issues , I ca n't wear shoes that slip around when I walk . That was never a problem in the past but this `` updated '' -LRB- aka cheaper to make -RRB- design does n't provide the support I need . I found that I was scuffling more and sure enough , the front of the shoes showed wear where I had previously never had a problem .2 . Something is really wrong with the buckle design . It 's not only hard to adjust , but I think there is one less hole so I was n't able to get as snug a fit as I used to have -LRB- I wear a B width so it is n't as though I have narrow feet -RRB- .3 . The leather is not as good quality as my old ones . It 's stiffer and when combined with the looser fit -LRB- 1 & 2 -RRB- , I ended up with marks on my feet just below the big toe.Looking at the reviews here and elsewhere , I see that repeat customers have been complaining about the redesign for quite some time now . I guess the company figures it 's more profitable to churn through new buyers rather than keep a loyal following . They are trading on the reputation of the actual original to lure unsuspecting buyers . It 's another case of a reliable old standard abandoned .
 It 's just like some of the reviewers were saying
 The right shoe does not wear well at all , I feel there might be a problem with the strap , I developed a blister on my toe which started within thirty minutes of wearing -LRB- I had to purchase a pair of flip flops to change because of the horrible pain -RRB- the left shoe is fine but because of the problem with the right I am unable to wear them . I am updating this review I bought this product last year and received horrible blisters , I tried again this year and the same thing . As of this writing the seller has not made ANY attempt to contact me .
 I originally wore this shoe in my early teens and it was fantstic . . However , these are definatley not made the same way and they rub blisters on the feet . .
 These were a bit of a disappointment in that I remember wearing these as a teenager and LOVING them . . I liked the idea of wearing wood , plus I used the muscles in my legs so it kept them in shape , but they seemed -LRB- after 30 some odd years -RRB- heavier and if you do n't get the leather , they look a bit cheap . Plus , my foot kept sliding off of them so , the rubber worked better for me .
 Like Denise above , my foot slides forward too and I can not adjust the strap either . I tried everything , even prying open the thing that looks like it would release the buckle , to no avail . All I ended up doing was making a mark on the metal ! I have n't worn them outside , so will probably take them back , which is a shame because they are absolutely darling ... I got the pink plaid ones .

 When you have a 9.5 foot and put it in a size large that is 8.5 to 9.5 , it is too small.When you put your foot in an extra large that is 9,5 to 10.5 , it is too big.Neither size accommodates a true 9.5 with a good fit .
 they are comfy , but they seem to stick to the tile and make a noise when you walk . they annoy me when i walk
 I agree with subrosa 's review ... slippers are too small . None of my shoes are larger than Size 6 , and I was replacing a similar pair of Size Small velour ballerina slippers . National 's Size Small is fit for children , not adults !
 I was very disappointed with these slippers , but I can only blame myself . I had done a search for isotoner slippers and these came up . I thought I was getting a great deal and did n't check the specifics of the slipper . They are not well made and do n't look like they will hold up very well . I was also taken aback by their return policy . They ship for free , but charge more than the slipper itself to accept the return .
 I actually thought I was buying Isotoner slippers on clearance
 Shoes are O.K. , not the best but delivery method that they were sent SUCKS . It tookalmost a month and two phone calls to get the product . Ca n't send anyone to thistroubled ordering site .

 but once they were broken in , they looked terrible . The material that these shoes are constructed from is very thin and tends to wrinkle very badly which makes the shoes look very old right away . I would not have purchased them had I known what they were going to look like just a few weeks later . They do not hold their shape well at all .

 It 's hard to break into the shoes . I have worn them many times and they still hurt , still stiff .
 The shoe is ok . The main disadvantage is that it starts to stink pretty bad after few climbs . My other sport shoes do not smell anyhow but this one should be called Stinky not Smoothy .

 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .
 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 These shoes look great but slip on the heel making them very uncomfortable . Perhaps the toe box is too large . I returned my pair before going out of my apartment with them.linda b
 I was recommended to purchase a Ryka water shoe . I chose the slip-on hoping to save myself some money . Unfortunately the shoe was way too tight , so much that my feet cramped almost immediately and I had to finish my water aerobic class barefooted . Now I have shipped them back and will have to spend the extra bucks for the tie type . I will still purchase the Ryka water shoe - it is awesome .
 Despite the `` lugged outsole '' of this shoe , after having worn it on the wet streets of seattle , they are VERY slick on smooth concrete . BE CAREFUL !!!
 I bought the ZX/2 after owning and LOVING my Z/2 's now for 2 years . Unfortunately , it 's been a huge mistake . The adjustable tightening system with the straps never stays put . I ca n't wear these for more than 5 minutes without having to sit down and adjust them so they are n't strangling my toe . I am , however , a huge fan of the toe strap -LRB- my Z/2 's have the toe strap and it 's great for stability -RRB- . It allows me to run , climb , jump , etc. and I feel great support . With my Z/2 's , I rarely EVER have to adjust the straps to due to the toe strap becoming too tight . I 've worn my ZX/2 's for weeks now and although I hoped the problem would go away , it has n't . I did some research -LRB- wish I would 've done this BEFORE buying !!! silly me ! -RRB- and I discovered similar complaints from other customers with this exact issue . Do yourself a favor and stick to the Z/2 's . I liked the double strap look and thought it would be nicer looking than the Z/2 but the discomfort is n't worth it . I 'm off to buy a new pair of Z/2 's !
 These shoes seemed so great , but turned out to be $ 100 down the drain . There is not enough toe room and I found myself constantly trying to wrestle that strap looser . The strap runs continuously through the whole shoe , and walking and slipping shoes on/off slowly but surely loosens the strap at the ankles while progressively strangling the toes . On days when I needed to be on my feet a lot , I would find myself sitting down on street corners yanking off my shoes and trying to loosen up the toes - not easily done - and then finding myself in the same painful situation an hour or two later . My feet also swell a bit in hot weather , and on true sandal days I was sometimes unable to get my toe into it at all . The strap problem also caused blisters . The shoes are also quite heavy , and because so much strap pressure would be on the toes , even if I had just loosened them it was like the weight of the whole shoes was hanging from my big toe rather than ankle . I am having a hard time imagining a worse shoe design .
 These sandals , which have good arch support which is why I bought them , tighten as you walk to the point that after about 1/2 hour you will have deep strap lines etched into your feet . Too bad .
 I ordered this and although it was shipped quickly , I found that the straps were stretched out on the left shoe and it just did n't fit . I have an adverage size foot and it was too wide and too easily stretched .
 After much researching shoe information and reviews , I purchased a pair of the Chaco ZX/2 Sandals for my vacation to Italy . I purchased these from a shoe store , and even though I was initially concerned about the roughness of the base of the shoe and how it felt on the bottom of the soles of my feet , the shoe salesman assured me that it just takes getting used to , and once they were broken in , they 'd be the most comfortable shoes I 'd ever own.How very wrong he was.I broke the shoes in by wearing them to work every day for 2 weeks before my trip to Italy . After my second day in Italy , the roughness of the shoe literally tore skin off of a 3 inch long section of the bottom of my foot . This made it extremely uncomfortable and painful to walk . I ended up discarding the shoes and purchasing a pair of New Balance tennis shoes to trek around in . After 2 weeks of having bandaged feet , the sores finally healed . However , these shoes very nearly ruined my vacation and I will NEVER EVER buy them or anything by Chacos again.And do n't get me started on the toe-strangling cords that tighten up on their own when you walk . I did everything I was directed to do with these shoes , including soaking them in water before wearing them to fatten up the cords and help keep them in place , in addition to watching the YouTube video about properly adjusting the shoes . NONE of it worked . This was a total waste of money for me . Avoid these like the plague and buy other shoes for walking , instead .
 These were cute in the photo but very unflattering on my feet . My feel slide way forward throught the front . I returned them .
 I was very disappointed upon receiving these sneaks . I am a true Asics fan and only buy Asic sneakers . This particular model is more narrow than any other . They are also not as deep , so I am unable to put my instep inserts into the shoe and still be comfortable . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone who enjoys how Asics feel , as these are not representative of any other model i have tried -LRB- KAyano 's , 1110 's , 2110 's , 2120 ' 3 . 2130 's -RRB- .
 The front of the shoe is narrow . I do n't have exceptionally wide feet but after a few hours in these shoes my feet hurt . A shame because I own 4 other pairs of Tsubo shoes and they 've been extremely comfortable .
 This shoe was terrible ! I wore these shoes a maximum of 4 times in a week ... First the plastic on top came apart from the platform also now the rubber is falling off the bottom of the shoe . . I would think this being a dancing shoe that it would be able to withstand a little more than a week ?? And i go easy on my shoes.Wouldn ' t recommend this brand to anyone !!
 First of all , I must echo the previous reviewer 's comment that the ad is misleading . There are two different Merrill boots
 This ad is misleading . You are being shown 2 different types of boots here - the Merrell Wilderness Original Backpacking Boot -LRB- the black boot with blue laces you see in the main picture -RRB- and the Merrell Wilderness Canyon which is a very different boot in terms of performance . The title of the ad leads you to believe you 're going to get the Merrell Wilderness Original -LRB- a three hundred dollar boot -RRB- for substantially less than what it retails for , but what you could be actually getting is a very different boot . BUY WITH CAUTION ! For example , I wear a size 15 boot , and I know for a fact that the Merrell Wilderness Original is n't available in that size . If you go to the seller 's website and look up the boot , they do n't carry it in that size - but they DO carry the Wilderness Canyon in that size ! And lo , on their site , the Wilderness Original is still 300 bucks , but the Canyon is only $ 200 , which leads me to believe that what they are trying to sell me here is not the great backpacking boot , but rather it 's dumpy city-walking step-sister . Just an FYI .
 The price was remarkably low . Now my husband knows why
 Extremely disappointed in this bag . It was n't even heavily loaded , just some folders with papers , keys , phone , make up , wallet . On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home . Also , the stitching is coming loose . Also the strap is not leather . A big waste of money .
 I should have expected inferior quality for the price . The outside of the bag was pretty nice , but the strap was poor quality . The interior of the bag was unacceptable to me . The main compartment was not fully lined , and I could see the stitching of the pen holders that were in the compartment the other side of the main compartment . The seller was good about communicating for the return that was made about 2 wks . ago , but I still have not received my refund . It was not worth the price of shipping to make the return . The cost of shipping for the item , and the cost of shipping to return , were about the cost of the item .

 Birkenstock Unisex Arizona SandalI received 3 pairs of these sandals , ALL THE WRONG WIDTH . I loved the leather of this style of sandal that i ordered -LRB- but had to finally settle for the synthetic leather one to get my right size , i was very bummed out as I did n't think a consumer just had to settle here on Amazon -RRB- , but the sandals were marked incorrectly at the Birkenstock FACTORY . I only learned this by calling Birkenstock directly ; they were very kind and filled me in on the details I outlined below : When the little foot print image is FILLED in on the lining of the sandal and on the box , that means they are `` narrow '' and not the `` regular '' width which would have an OUTLINE of a footprint.I wish you well for all those that purchased the sandals , you had better check out to see if you have the actual right width for your feet . Amazon was very kind in helping me return the 3 wrong pairs sandals and shipping out the other pair of sandals overnight that just arrived today.The only NEGATIVE with Amazon -LRB- which was the seller -RRB- was that I received a generic terse email today from Amazon saying that they felt I might be abusing the return privileges and threatened to close my account . I can not control their warehouse inventory and as for the other items that were returned , it was due in large part to safety seals being broken or missing or no proper food labels on the food items . I do n't know about other people , but I would most certainly not use a eye medication or consume a food product with a broken or missing safety seal . I hope Amazon and I can get past this , but if we ca n't , I wish them well and there are plenty of other merchants that will want my business .
 I ordered the correct size , according the chart provided . They were waaaay too big . As in unwearable.On the plus side , Birks are great shoes , the product was as described , except for size , and it arrived on the day promised . I love Amazon , and use it a lot , but this one was a failure .
 My wife , a long time Birkenstock wearer , convinced me to buy a pair shortly after we first met - I opted for the Milano . So I bought into the cache , supressed my Yankee frugality and opened my wallet for more than I ever paid for ANY shoe previously . Ca n't say they were very comfortable but I let them grow on me . That first summer was great , and I came to enjoy wearing them . Then I had to fork over more money to have them re-soled , which cost about a third of the original price of the sandal -LRB- the profuse scolding I got from the ` authorised ' repairman about not sealing the cork was free -RRB- . And that 's the way it was for about 4 years then the cork bed fell apart -LRB- despite my conscientious efforts at maintaining them -RRB- and I bought a new pair and repeated the process all over again for another pair , then I gave them up . Sure I wore them all the time , but they did n't get any more wear than any other shoe I 've worn . And no , I 'm not prone to scuffing my feet when I walk . Is it really that much to ask for a sole tread that can stand up to normal wear and not erode like its made out of cardboard ? That 's what I would expect from the $ 20 Walmart knock offs - which , by the way seem hold up better than the real ones . And using rubber cement to seal the cork - really ?! That 's just stupid . So I wore my second pair into the ground which did n't take too long , and found a much nicer -LRB- and cheaper -RRB- style sandal from a local store , which have stood up incredibly well for the better part of three years . Now all of this is n't endemic to just the Milano , my wife 's Arizonas have experienced the same things.Of course your mileage may vary , but be forewarned of what can happen . How much is the Birkenstock cache REALLY worth to you ?
 Bought shoes from FootSmart through Amazon . Shoes did n't fit . Customer service at vendor would not provide return postage because the item was purchased through Amazon and not directly from footsmart . Cost me $ 11.00 to return shoes . I will buy from Zappos from now on .
 well , i tried to order a pair of black sandals , and a pair of brown sandals , each from a different website due to price differences . while the description says `` hunter brown '' , the ones i recieved are clearly black . so , no i have two pairs of black ones . recommend to call vendor to verify color prior to ordering .
 Although the surface looks ok , when wear it , you feel the material is to hard , uncrediable hard . If you are tough guy , you can try that , otherwise , leave it alone .
 Forms an excellent shoe , but I did not feel comfortable when you usedSumma I advise not to buy itThanks Amazon
 I was able to track the progress of this item , and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped . I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me .
 hello we ordered arizona birkenstock leather classic straps but you send me synthetic straps it your misstake cause you published that its leather on web ! I am allergic to that synthetic strapsplease be in tuch for this soon thank you Rachel
 Generally , I like Birkenstocks , but they have one SERIOUS drawback . The soles shrink in high heat . I had my Birkenstocks in the back seat of my car . I parked in the sun on a hot day . The soles of my Birkenstocks shrank approximately 1/4 '' from the edge of the leather on the sides and about 5/8 '' in the toe and heel . The sole also partially separated from the upper . Yeah , I guess for the future I wo n't leave my shoes in the car when I go inside , but ` cmon , a pair of shoes should be able to handle a hot car on a normal day . Like , what ? I 'm not supposed to take Birkenstocks on vacation ? Or only wear them the whole time ? What happens if I want to go on a hike when I 'm on vacation ? I guess I have to pack my Birks on my back . Ca n't leave 'em in the car . None of my other possessions were affected on the same trip . Grrr , Birkenstocks .
 I had to send my first pair back they were too big . Yesterday I received my birks they were very dusty and I do n't think they are leather like the first pair , they scratch easily . The color is not solid it looks faded . . I would retun them but do n't want to spend the money again shipping them back . I would not recomend purchasing anything from this company . Very disappointed .
 This was my first and my last Birkenstock purchase . The soles are very hard and uncomfortable , especially on concrete . Also , I ordered what seemes to be the correct size for me , but these were at least a full size too large . These sandals are wearable , but I usually wear a pair of sandals I picked up at K *** 's for only $ 15 . I was very disapointed with this purchase .
 If , as advertised , you want the ORIGINAL FOOTBED - which is NOT the `` Soft Footbed '' - then these are NOT what you want . I ordered them expecting the original foot bed and received the `` Soft Footbed '' version instead . This was not mentioned anywhere in the ordering process . Pick size , pick width , pick color and material , but no options regarding the footbed . So now I am packaging them up and sending them back , which is a waste of my time . Yes , I am annoyed because I think this is deceptive . Amazon should get it right . The reason they are cheaper may very well be because , in general , people do n't want the Soft Footbed , so they are trying to get rid of them . So now you wo n't be confused or fooled .
 The price was remarkably low . Now my husband knows why
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 I am a 6 ' 1 '' female and ordered a size 12 . The actual shoe part fit fine , however , I could have fit both legs into one boot . The sizing was utterly ridiculous . You will also be charged 20 % restocking fees for any returned merchandise . Do n't waste your time .
 I am a larger thighed girl and have bigger calves so I was hoping from all the reviews that these would work for me . Sadly , they are n't for us midwestern build girls . Great boot but just did n't fit me .

 I normally wear an extra wide shoe . I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it .

 This shoe was terrible ! I wore these shoes a maximum of 4 times in a week ... First the plastic on top came apart from the platform also now the rubber is falling off the bottom of the shoe . . I would think this being a dancing shoe that it would be able to withstand a little more than a week ?? And i go easy on my shoes.Wouldn ' t recommend this brand to anyone !!

 Very nice causal/elegant look to them - Also very comfortable and the leather was quite soft and appeared to be of high quality ... . Who knew they would fall apart in less than a year ?? I only wore them about once or twice a week to the office and ocassionally for social outings . Within 9 - 10 months the leather was peeling and cracking , and one shoe began to come apart at the heel seam , rendering them completely unwearable . I will never purchase Giorgio Brutini shoes again ... . Never .
 When I compared these to the previous pair of Asics trail running shoes I bought I could actually see close to 1/2 '' difference in the width . I have a narrow foot but these shoes are cut super narrow . If you need to put any kind of insert in your shoe -LRB- I do sometimes -RRB- beware . These shoes are cut so narrow your insert will probably not lay flat . These shoes were supposed to be medium width B. No way do they qualify . I 'm very unsatified with this product .
 These boots are cute and comfortable , but the colors are a bit misleading . Black grey shows an image that is black with a grey stripe , but they are actually a mid-light grey with slightly darker grey accents . No black . At all . I have ordered these 2 x. I thought the first time that the supplier sent me the wrong boots , so I ordered from someone else . Same thing arrived on my doorstep . I will be returning these as well .
 These boots are cute and warm but heavy stiff and short in the toe box . Due to construction I do n't think they would break in .
 My feet get cold like if I had sneakers on ... . Not good for new england weather and too much money for not keepin yr feet warm : -LRB-
 After a few short walks -LRB- 15 min each approx -RRB- over the span of one afternoon I got the following :1 -RRB- a scar almost to the point of bleeding -LRB- skin off as a result of friction with the fabric -RRB- beneath the upper side of the boot behind the shoelaces . When I inspected the boots I felt and saw the rough seams that rose from within the soft sheepskin lining , this is unacceptable for a 200 pounds pair of boots .2 -RRB- irritated toes -LRB- reddened -RRB- from the tight fit on the outer sides of the boot , left and right . These boots run really small , but my feet are not wide above average so this should not happen if they had gotten the sizing right . I am 7 and I ordered the 7.5 . The next size available which is the 8.5 would certainly have been too big for me .3 -RRB- I wore the boots with the cuff up and when you do this , you are tightening the laces above the boot and against your skin because the center part of the body of the boot is not high enough ! so the fastened laces end up rubbing against your skin with every step , it is appalling that such expensive boots have such a poor design4 -RRB- Sore feet for the next several hours , this is in general all over my feet , apart from the points outline above5 -RRB- Needless to say that I could never forget I had the boots on while walking , clear sign that these are NOT for walking -LRB- but then , what are they for ? -RRB- Too bad as the material the boots are made of are high end . They just lack the high-end design to be a real pair of walking boots .
 I began serious running about a year-and-a-half ago using cheap running shoes . Everyone kept telling me I needed to upgrade before I injured myself . I finally went to a running store where I was fitted with a pair of Brooks Beast due to my over pronation . As I first started running in them they seemed fine , but with each training run they became more uncomfortable . By the end of a month I was in such excruciating pain I could not run a full mile . I switched back to my cheap shoes and had immediate relief from the pain . I was back to running 10k distances in a few weeks . People who walk in these shoes seem to love them , runners seem far less taken with them .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 They may be called Doc Martens , but the fit and the quality is just not there . They are noticebly shorter in length than any of my older steel toed gibsons , and the toe box is smaller . I love all my older pairs of these , so I bought a new pair because mine are showing a lot of wear . After wearing Doc martens for over 10 years without a complaint , I will NEVER buy another pair of these . CHEAPLY MADE , TIGHT-FITTING JUNK
 I 've owned a lot of doc martens in my life and I was really disappointed with this shoe . My toes were boxed in really tight and the back of the shoe was so rough and rigid that my heel was rubbed raw within an hour . If you 're looking for a long term , comfortable shoe - this is n't it . I went back to my 5-eye padded collar and have n't looked back .
 I bought these because they are an iconic look and high quality construction . This is the last pair I 'd buy . After 6 months of walking in them and thinking &#34; gosh , I thought they 'd be more comfortable , but I guess I just do n't know &#34; , and countless blisters on the back from the relatively thin material with no padding in the back , I decided to go for a pair of RedWings.Wow , I 'll never go back . The RedWings look nearly as good but boyyyyyyyyyyy are they more comfortable . Not even in the same ballpark . I 've got a 3 year old pair of wings that I 've worn every day at work and the soles are starting to wear through , and they 're still a lot more comfortable than the Docs ever were ...
 I had a pair of Doc Martins they lasted me for 3 years they were so comfortable and durable . I needed a pair of steel toe shoes for work so I decided to give them a try they were the worst pair of shoes I 've ever had . They blistered my feet and they didnt even last a year . I do n't know if Doc Martin just went to a lower quality or what but please do n't waste your time on these shoes . Check some of the other shoes with better ratings .

 I have worn Docs for about 20 years , with a long pause in which the boot manufacturing was outsourced to fricking China . Do not believe the apologists who say that the quality has not changed - it has ! Imagine a piece of cardboard that has some thin , cheap leather glued to the surface and you can imagine what wearing a pair of these new boots are like . I bought a pair off the internet , and as I was not able to feel them beforehand , was sorely disappointed with them and even more so when the leather cracked after the first month of winter and allowed water to seep in.Nostalgia aside , I did wear the boots long enough to remember the feel and texture of the leather when they where made in England , and it is nothing like the ` leather ' used now . Such is the way of the world now - pay more and get less , and have absolutely zero say about it . Sad .
 The new Dr. Martens are not worth the money.I got a pair as a present and within three months they fell apart literallyThe stitching came apart and the air sole leaked.Very poorly made product but what can you expect in this new age of profit over quality.I ended up ordering a pair of 8 eyelet solovair 's from England and could n't be happier.The order was processed quickly and the customer service people were in constant contact until I recieved the boots.Be aware that the break in time is considerably longer as it should be.Be prepared to pay for quality and you wo n't be disappointed .
 I have ordered this boot several times and for some reason the ones I just got are already falling apart . The sole on one of them is splitting . I do n't know if it is just defective but I have emailed Shoemania and are hoping they will replace it with a new pair . I have always been please with Dr. Martens quality in the past but I am very disapointed this time . My husband wears these to work and has for at least the last ten years . Hopefully this is just an isolated incident .
 My first pair of 1460s lasted 8 years of near constant abuse . Heck they are still wearable , but the leather is looking really worn , and they are n't as comfortable as they once were . Two years ago , I picked up a new asian-manufactured pair and wore them only intermittently , maybe a couple times a week to a couple times a month . They did not become attached to my feet like my first pair . I rarely wore them in the winter this year . After two years of minimal wear , the weld cracked , causing the outsole to pop off between the heel and the balls of the feet . Whatever happened to their touted goodyear welding ? This is unacceptable , and Dr. Marten lost a customer until their manufacturing standards return . There are better shoes out there you can spend your $ 100 + on.I heard Solovair makes what these guys forgot to make in the quest for the almighty GBP / $ . I will check them out the next time I got some cash to spend on boots .
 however , if you are looking for the original `` Made in England '' Docs these are not it . I just received my Made in England Docs today and let me tell you , they are far better constructed . The leather actually feels like leather , it is stiff but with a little break in I 'm sure this will subside . I have always owned the Made in China version before this and they serve their purpose of about 1 to 2 years of life and then throw them away . If you are looking for a boot that will last , spend a little extra money -LRB- only about $ 50 -RRB- and get the real thing .
 As some others have pointed out here , these DM boots are nothing like they used to be . Not only have the craftsmanship and quality of materials plummeted , the design is not the same either . The new boots are narrower than they used to be , so think twice if you do n't have narrow skinny feet . The sizing also seems off -- I wear a size 11 -LRB- US men 's -RRB- and have no problem with slight variances across different brands but my feet were slipping around in these . As a result , my feet were rubbed raw and bloody after only a few blocks of walking . If you decide to buy yourself a pair of these torture devices , please add a large pack of bandaids and some Neosporin to your cart right now.If you know DMs from the 80s and 90s , these will make you cry . And if you walk in these , well , you 'll cry too .
 I wanted to buy a pair of DR Martens here in Amazon , but I could n't because the size options are like from some weird planet ... Does anybody knows what the hell this means : ??? F -LRB- M -RRB- B -LRB- M -RRB- D -LRB- M -RRB- I am just trying to get size 9 US . This website is for America 's users , why these stupid people put the size options like that ???
 These boots look like Dr martens but the are not the same as they were.To get the real quality dr martens make sure they are made in England.The ones that are not are not comfortable and easily broke apart in7-8 months of wear .
 So I submitted an order for those wonderful lime green Doc Martens . I love the brand and used to wear them all the time in high school . I decided to go back to my roots and get a pair and I fell in love with those green ones . So I placed my order but then the little icon next to my order showed dark green boots and not the lime ones . So I e-mailed customer servce to ask about the color . Apparently the wonderful green color here is not what they have , they have the ugly hunter green . And then I came back on amazon to look for another color but apparently they have n't taken down the false information on here even though they now know the colors do n't agree . I know this is done through another vendor but amazon should really pay attention who puts what information on this site . This is the first time I am trully dissapinted with amazon for letting this seller keep false information posted on their site .
 Bitterly disappointed in the Chinese manufacture . I thought at least the sizes would be true Doc Marten but they are typical smaller Chinese . I wish I had purchased the original UK brand .
 I just got a pair for Christmas after talking about them to a family member . I got very excited looking at the box as I took the wrapping off but the box was notably light-weight . Then I noticed a visible difference in the boots not having touched them yet . They looked like imposters even at first glance . I am not a shoe or boot connoisseur or snob but I do know I like quality . Examining them confirmed my unexpected let down . The leather is a lower grade that does n't ever break-in and the soles feel to be of a stiffly cheaper rubber that wears faster . I took a look at the label to find unsurprisingly that they were made in China . Buy a new pair -LRB- made after 2003 -RRB- if your after the name without the same quality . Buy a pre-2003 pair if you want a better pair of DMs .
 I have worn DMs for years but no longer . I bought a couple of pairs three years ago and later discovered that they are now made in various locations in the East and as a result they are without question sub standard . Further to this , surely it is n't ethical for an English standard like DMs to be taken away from the people who made it great , but then that 's business ... is n't it ? I now wear Solovair 8 eyelet boots . These are made in Northampton , England by one of the companies that made the original Air Cushioned Soles for DMs , they also have the fully welted soles which DMs do not . In a nutshell , if you want honest , best quality made in England air cushioned soled boots like the original ones you can remember , then you need to buy Solovair .
 I felt like revisiting my youth during high school and got a pair for my birthday . Ishould have researched the fact that they are made in China now . They certainly felt different when I put them on and some product flaws I experienced in the past are still present
 These boots are not what they used to be.If you want a comfortable , durable , work boot then do not buy Dr. Martens . Now that they are made in China , they are uncomfortable , especially if you are standing on concrete all day . They are made from cheap leather that wears and scuffs quickly and easily . They are also over priced.However , if you are into spending a lot of money for a fashion accessory , maybe these boots are for you .
 For the longest time I 've heard that Dr. Marten 's are `` supreme '' quality . I believed this and generally ignored the people stating their quality went down after going overseas . I do n't know how they used to be personally , as these would be my first pair , but these are n't quality and are n't worth the price tag.They look nice , but there were three things I noticed immediately : The grade of the leather is poor and had me questioning whether it was real leather . Stitching was alright.Unfortunately the size was wrong , as can happen when you order online . I 'm a size nine and ordered a UK size seven . These are at least a size too big , if not two.There is literally no cushioning around the heel counter . I can tell if I walked around in these for a while my ankles would bleed . Similar if not the same construction as my old pair of Converse high-tops . Flimsy.I go through shoes like crazy and was looking forward to having a pair of shoes that people touted would last for years . These did n't impress . :-LRB- Sadly . I 'll be returning them .
 Ok , whether or not these are now made in China -LRB- does n't surprise me -RRB- , even when they were n't , the insole did not last . Every pair I owned -LRB- at least 5 different pairs/styles -RRB- the insole rapidly deteriorated , separated from the shoe , and collapsed into the `` air '' sole , revealing the small edge of the inside of the outer sole . This edge protruded into the shoe . It was quite painful to walk with this rubbing against your toe . Shoes were great as long as the insole held together , which was about 10-30 days .
 My nephew requested a pair of 12 hole boots for Christmas and I was delighted to buy them . Great taste ! I was confused at first why they were the same price I paid in 1983 and then realized , sadly , that much of the production had shifted to Thailand . I find it deeply disturbing when iconic brands leave their country of origin . I offered to buy him the real thing but they did n't have a big enough boot for his large feet . I bought the cheaper made-in-Thailand version instead and we were frankly , disgusted when they arrived . They were of very poor quality with unacceptable leather . These stink . Luckily , they were too big so we were able to purchase a very nice pair made in England . Do n't buy these . Either do n't buy them at all or buy the England-made version . What junk.My niece requested Ugg boots and my mom ordered a pair at a discount . Lousy taste ! When they arrived , it was clearly a Chinese fraudulent swindle . They were clearly fakes and do n't you know it , the number is disconnected . They , too , will have to be replaced . The quality of her fakes was similar to Dr. Martens Thailand product .
 I have to admit , first of all , that Dr. Martens ai n't the way they used to be AT ALL . Plain and simple , if you want the quality boots with the durability and solid feel of 80 's and 90 's DM 's , spring for a pair of Solovairs . They are n't cheap , -LRB- obviously , since they are made in England of quality leather and handiwork -RRB- but I assure you that they are one thousand times better than the Dr Martens made in China or Thailand . As for the Dr. Martens that are being made in England , I do n't know anything about them so I wo n't attempt to talk about them like I do know . I have heard , however , that they have eyelets that bend and burr out and shred your shoe laces to pieces and the soles are as hard as rocks . This is not the case with Solovair . I had a pair of Dr. Martens from the 90 's and I can remember the luxury and quality that came with them -LRB- As well as the cool factor -RRB- and I can honestly say that the only boot that replicates that feel are Solovairs . Plain and simple , Dr. Martens have generally fallen by the wayside for true Air Cushioned Boots entrepreneurs and Solovair has taken its place as the leader . As much as Dr. Martens will always have a place in my heart , my new love is Solovair and it should be yours too.P.S .

 I bought these boots because I wanted something that would keep my feet warm and dry throughout the unpredictable and -LRB- often harsh -RRB- winters in NYC . I purchased the pair this past November and wore them three times . The first two times were during heavy rain , and they performed beautifully in terms of keeping my feet dry , although I noticed that the sheepskin lining on the insole was already wearing out . The third time I wore these was yesterday during heavy snow/rain/sleet . The experience was disastrous . The boots are not made to withstand blizzard-like conditions ! My feet were cold and wet . The exterior had several dark spots where the water had seeped through and it took several hours for the boots to completely dry out . I wear orthopaedic foot beds under the insoles of my boots and shoes . The water inside the boots destroyed my footbeds !!! These are going right back to UGG for an exchange -LRB- different product altogether -RRB- .
 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .
 The straps on both shoes broke the very first time worn . Spent the rest of the day at work wearing broken shoes .

 The picture shows a blue shoe but the description -LRB- in small print -RRB- said `` black '' . I received a black shoe and had a difficult time receiving help from the merchant . They would n't send me a return label . They would n't refund my S&H . They took zero responsibility for displaying a blue shoe picture while selling a black shoe .

 I have just had a terrible experience with this shoe . I had two pairs fall apart within one month of purchase . When I approached the company that there was a defect or a problem they thought I was crazy . When the trim on the shoes came off the first pair I thought it was a fluke and Geox gladly replaced them . New new pair I was given did the exact same thing ! When I approached the shoe company with the problem - they offered to fix them . But I just do n't think that a brand new , expensive pair of shoes should fall apart in the first place , let alone in the second instance as well . I asked for a refund so I could take my business elsewhere . I was denied . They will only give me a store credit when I do n't wish to give them my business any more.So here 's my warning , do n't buy these shoes unless the place you buy them gives a darn about customer service . And if you have bought them and you have the same problem - please complain ! This could not be an isolated incident . Best of Luck .

 My second review today of this shoe . This is the first day I 've worn this shoe and my feet are hurting so bad I can hardly walk ... . I 've worn Easy Spirit shoes for years with no complaints . This is quite possibly the most uncomfortable shoe I 've ever had on . I want my money back ! These shoes are terrible .
 I almost always wear a size 6 but as soon as I put these on , they hurt my feet . They are extremely narrow - returned right away .
 I bought my black Keds last winter . Within 6 months , there was a hole in the canvas above the toe of the left shoe . -LRB- Not because the shoe was too small , but because the canvas was extremely thin . -RRB- Also , the soles look much thicker in the photos than in reality .
 My new sneakers broke my heart ! They have been making subtle changes for the past several years . This last one was too much . I have been wearing Keds sneakers for about 60 years and absolutely loved them . Several years ago they came out with flared soles , -LRB- I said to myself , I guess I can live with that . -RRB- Then they began making the toes more pointed . Did n't really like that . What 's wrong with toe room ? Time for new ones - pictures showed the flared soles were gone -LRB- GREAT -RRB- . Ordered a pair . The toes are still too pointed , but the insole is as hard as a rock -LRB- maybe not quite -RRB- and the built in arch support was gone ! They had a perfect product and really ruined it . I could just cry . I returned my shoes and they were very kind and gave me a full refund .
 If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .
 Avoid doing business with Shoemall ! Check their feedback ! I 've made two orders with Shoemall and both times they do n't have my items in stock . It seems they do n't update on Amazon regularly . I 'll never buy from them again . Beware , they 'll charge & send you the accessory to an item and later contact you that the main item is out of stock . This happened to me both times I 've ordered . Really bad business practices !
 I have an old pair of these shoes that I have loved for a long time , but needed to replace . I ordered this pair and was very disappointed in the quality . I have only worn these shoes perhaps a dozen times and the sole is already coming apart . They also have this weird squeak with every step that I take . I will be replacing these , but will not purchase another Keds shoe .
 After reading some of the other reviews , I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway . That was a mistake . The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember -LRB- and I lived in Keds for many years -RRB- . These are a very cheap version of the sturdy , supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever . The new ones are also quite a bit narrower , thinner , pointed in the toe , and feel like something you 'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks . Returning this product for a refund and wo n't be purchasing Keds in the future .
 I wore these about twice a week for about 5 weeks before they began splitting apart . To late too return them now so it was a waste of money . Very disappointed in the quality . I wore Keds for years and never had any problems with quality . Will not buy this brand again .

 I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific &#34; look &#34; -LRB- surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers -RRB- . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Sending them back .
 These Navy blue Keds were more black than navy blue . The picture of the shoes on Amazon was very different than the one I received . I put them next to my black keds and you could not tell the difference between the navy blue and the black keds . Very disappointing .
 I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter . The color shows navy , but when they arrived they looked black ... the box said navy ! Had to return because of the shade .
 The shoes were an amazing fit , but when I washed them -- in cold water , I might add -- the blue dye from the soles bled out onto the white canvas . Perhaps , it will wash away next time , but I was more than miffed .
 Not only is the canvas cheap & lightweight , it has a bluish tinge to it . The tongue of the shoe is only sewn halfway ... i.e. , the inside is merely the raw cut . The first time I washed them -LRB- in cold water -RRB- , the blue dye from the inside bled thru to the white upper . Very disappointed in what was formerly a great basic sneaker ... I suppose Keds has succombed to the Chinese influence . Very sad indeed .
 I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade + ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update
 I have worn Keds sneakers for many years , always ordering size 6.5 . The label in the sneaker and the box are labeled 6.5 , but this sneaker is at most size 5 , or it is a child 's sneaker.Very disappointed .
 These shoes are not as good as they used to be . Very little support . The sole is very thin . Definetly not worth the price .
 Do not buy ! The Keds quality has become garbage ! Much narrower , cheaper materials and just a very poor shoe and come on the price !! Get some Vans Lo Pros for the same money or get 2-3 pairs of Joe Boxers at Kmart . Sad to say but my 30 year relationship with Keds has come to an end .
 Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return !!
 the style was wonderful however even tho it said 9 med it was a trifle small-thought it might be an 8 instead-win some you lose some
 Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black ! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe . Also in another picture , the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside . They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before .
 I ordered a pair of black and white keds and was sent a pair of plain black keds . In my opinion they are not nearly as cute as the black and white ones . Also , I ordered a narrow pair because I have really narrow feet , but the narrow pair is pretty tight on me . I ca n't imagine how they have extra narrow pairs because the narrow ones looked abnormally skinny . So be warned . I would have returned them but I had to wear them to a wedding as part of my bridesmaid outfit a week from the time they arrived . I probably will not be wearing them again and I wish I could return them for the black and white pair I had ordered .
 3 weeks after buying these shoes , i washed them with whites in cold water and the blue insole completely bled onto the white and now the shoes are ruined . This never happened to the cheap Target brand we bought . I have to throw them away . The insole does n't come out so I ca n't even try to bleach them .
 I 've ordered Ked 's Champions in the past was very happy with the quality . The ones I recently received from this vendor are like the cheap rips-offs I could buy in ChinaMart for $ 5 . No support , thin canvas - just junk . I 'm taking pictures of them and sending them to Keds to ask if this is really their shoe . I think they are fakes.UPDATE - I did contact Keds and they admit they are not making these shoes like they used to . No support , no padding , more narrow , thinner canvas . I 've bought Keds for almost 35 years so I know the difference . Save your money . You can get this same sneaker in any cheap shoe store for between $ 5 - $ 8 , it just wo n't have a Keds tag . This is no longer the bargain it once was . Another really good American product turned into the lowest common denominator . What 's really sad is most of the people buying this shoe do n't even know it 's junk compared to what Keds sold just a few years ago .
 I ca n't wear these shoes . Something is not right about the soles and instep . Where are the Keds like I have worn for 60 years ?
 I bought this sneaker from my Mom who has worn the same style for years . I 'm sorry to say that we were not happy with our purchase - it seems that the mold for the shoe has changed - the stitching on the top of the shoe is in a different place and does not make this a comfortable shoe for my mom .
 I donated these sneakers to Goodwill without ever wearing them . They were not true to size and for the price I did not want the hassle of returning them . I will not purchase any Keds in the future .
 The shoes are good quality Keds however I believe you have a supplier problem . The shoes that arrived had been worn . I called the supplier and he offered to send a new pair if I returned the pair I had . He made a good offer however , I decided to wash the shoes and keep them , which I did . Now , I have an infection on my toe . Not good .
 I got these shoes in December and they are VERY cheap . NOT worth the money . I could have gone to a local store and paid a lot less . Additionally , the shoes I received did not look like the shoe in the photo . The shoe i received was more of a sketcher type shoe with a longer top . I would NOT recommend them to a friend or relative . They are not what i expected . the top of the shoe is already coming apart . I 've had Keds before and I do n't know if it was just this pair , but I will not buy shoes this way again .
 I like the shoe but I am not too sure it is a wide width shoe . It fitted more medium width .
 They sent the wrong color LEDs , I had bought the black with white sole and they sent all black ked .
 I purchased a pair size 7 1/2 . The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes . These shoes are very narrow .
 I bought these for an 80s party and they were so narrow and had no arch support that I am returning them . Please note I do not have a wide foot at all but they were very uncomfortable . Fine in 3rd grade but horrible now . Some stuff should be left in the 80s !!
 Even though I ordered my normal size , these shoes pinched my toes painfully . I ended up throwing them in a donation box .
 In any shoe I ideally I wear a 7 1/2 W. I usually end up with an 8 M because there is no wide width offered . This summer I wanted canvas tennis shoes for summer and decided to try some Keds . There seems to be no consistency of sizing , however , between colors or styles , and I have had to try different colors and styles due to `` not available '' items . Several years ago I had a Keds size 8 M and it was a little bit too long and slightly snug . So this year I tried the Chambray blue 7 1/2 W and it was too long , but wide enough . I returned the Chambray and got stone 7 W -LRB- no Chambray available in 7 W -RRB- and it was waaay too short and very tight . I do n't think a size 8 W would even fit . This idea of shoes `` running small '' or `` running large '' makes no sense to me . Just make the shoe the size that is stamped on it .
 I was so disappointed with these shoes . In fact , I returned them . The quality is not that of the Ked 's that I grew up wearing !
 I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .
 I bought the white leather sneakers for $ 38 at a DSW store awhile ago . Let me tell you , they do NOT last . I bought Keds hoping for a quality , practical , and stylish shoe that I could wear with anything for a few years . This is what you could expect a few years ago , that Keds were STRONG shoes . Well surprise , they barely lasted one season . The bottom sole of the shoe came unglue from the rest of the shoe , and most of the white leather chipped off leaving patches of brown . Looks terrible , no way worth my $ 40 .
 Eh . I bought myself these KEDS because they were relatively cheap , but I should have paid more attention to the reviews . The quality is way low with these shoes . They 're super uncomfortable and make your toes feel like they 're packed in sardines . -LRB- And I have really small feet - I 'm a women 's 5.5 -RRB- Now that I see them on my feet , they do n't even look that cute . Anyone who buys KEDS for the first time ONLINE should realize that they are exactly what they seem
 The shipping cost was less than what it would have cost me in gas to go the store to buy
 I ordered a pair and they were too big ... so when I asked for a RMA number to return and get a smaller pair they said they could only snail mail me a UPS Lable ... one month later it did not come ... Each time to emailed customer services they said they could only smail mail it and not email it to me ... . whereas I know it is do-able . . Bargain Outfitters can as well as can Online shoes . . So finally I paid $ 15 to send the boots back . on my dine . . and no doubt they will not reimburse me for my $ . . I not only had to pay shipping to get the boots but also they will no doubt chaarge me a re-stocking fee . I will never ever buy from The Sportsman 's Guide again ...
 This is taking way too long ! I ordered my item 3 weeks ago and it is still not here . i can not track my package either . i will never buy from them again !
 The seller 's response was speedy enough but the quality of the purse was far less than I expected . It looks much more substantial in the photo than it is .
 These pumps were way too small and I 'm usually a perfect 10 . The back heel was also peeling . I had to return these so I 'm still looking for a nice pair of low-heel leopard pumps .
 The boots were delivered within reasonable time . The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear . Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price . There is however a defect I noted on the second day . There are small cracks , about 12 , 1/4 '' long each at the back of the right shoe . Photo sent . Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund . Unfortunately , I am based outside of US and can not ship back using prepaid UPS provided . Could have been nice shoes .

 All I hear is * squish squish squish * as I walk in these shoes . Wish I 'd spent a bit more for something nicer .
 I had this sandals , the look great ! , but they broke , the plastic straps just broke apart , just after 5 times used . It is a shame I ca n't find a similar great looking sandal that wo n't break .
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .
 I was very dissapointed with this product . I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada . These were made in China . They are not the same quality at all . These are not cushioned like the others were , they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada . These are NO better than the cheaper `` knock offs '' you find in dollar stores .
 I ordered size 8/9 since i wear a size 8 1/2 shoe , they fit my husband who wears size 11 . To top it off I ended up paying $ 6.00 for the return shipping . It will be the last time I order shoes from them .
 Do not waste your money on these they are cheaply constructed I received them today and the snap on the strap that holds them to your foot was broken and would not stay snapped together save your money I paid my money for broken merchandise again please save your money these are not constructed well at all
 I have bought several prs of crocs , but these were sized differently than the others which were unisex and thus mfor my size 11 feet were too small .
 I have worn Crocs for years . They are almost a must for diabetics . The ones on this page are made in China . The cheaper quality is immediately visible , the sizing is off and the last -LRB- shape of shoe -RRB- also appears different . I wish Amazon would clearly stipulate where stuff is made so we could have a choice .
 Croc strap broke the first time it was worn . Not pleased with this product at all .
 I have bought several pairs of crocs and these did not appear to be original crocs . I always buy the same size and these arrived way too big , how could the same size be too big if these are original crocs ? Had to send back and pay for shipping , not very happy and will only buy crocs from the original website .
 My non-Croc-type of footwear are more comfortable and better made than the real Crocs I bought recently ! Quite disheartening .
 We received the Crocs , which are my son 's favorite shoe to wear . However , when he wore them to school the next day , one of the straps broke and I had to run a different pair of shoes to him at school . We are hoping to return them and get a new pair -- that will last longer than two hours .
 I wore these shoes for 1 day working in the garden . when I took them off the tops of my feet were inflamed with red bumps that scabbed over and were very tender to the touch , I could n't wear any shoes that touched the tops of my feet for almost 2 weeks.they were comfortable to wear , but the rash is still really bad after 2 weeks . I WO N'T wear them again ...
 Est delivery date was 12/13 - 12/16 guess what date it is today ... 1/3/11 ... . it was going to be a nice Christmas gift for my son-in-law . . I was hoping for 2010 . To many other good companies out there to use this one again .
 i 'm very dissisafied with my crocs . they send the wrong size.so i 'm stuck with them .
 tengo mas de un mes que pedi mis cross y aun no me han llegado necesito saber q paa con ello por favor denme razon de ello ya q los tengo cargados en mi tarjeta y todo gracias
 Maybe I 'm too concerned about fashion , but there are shoes out there that are just as comfortable , and dont make me look like I work in a hospital . I see people wear these every day and I cringe when they walk by . I guess theyre good for people maybe 70 and older who need orthotic shoes and cant wear sandals to the beach .
 Sorry . I bought them as a gift and have a report that the holes up front are very uncomfortable especially for big toe . I will be returning , which I am bummed about , and , have probably learned not to buy a clothing item on line as a gift .
 I begin by saying I have worn Crocs `` Beach '' Men 's XXL for many years . They have always been excellent shoes ... UNTIL , I PURCHASED MY MOST RECENT PAIR . The first thing you notice is they are MADE IN CHINA.Without question the shoes from China are smaller . To the point of even being tight . The back strap ismore narrow than the previous shoes I purchased . The front part of the sole is not as thick . Overall , it feels like a cheap imitation . I may NEVER buy another Croc shoe .
 I work for a leading package delivery service and am always looking for nice looking , sturdy , and comfortable footwear . This shoe was so hard that it could not flex in all the places a shoes needs to in order to be comfortable . With each step my feet would send messages to my brain that went `` oooch , ouch , oooch , ouch . '' Too bad I had to return them because they looked great with my uniform !
 There is no sole and no insole . I am so dissapointed . worst product I have ever purchased . Do not buy !
 ordered size 7 for my daughter -LRB- her regular size -RRB- but they were to big -LRB- wide -RRB- , then returned and re-ordered size 6 -LRB- and charged a re-stocking fee ! -RRB- and they were still toooooo wide ... but do n't want to pay another re-stocking fee
 These shoes have no sole like the pictures . They can not be used out of door.And the inside of shoes are different -LRB- no suede insole -RRB- .
 not at all pleased when i opened the box . They were suppose to be a gift for my younger sister but to her disappointed they were pretty much knock offs . i guess i should i looked closely at the product i was ordering .
 this product description says it is rubber sole and pictures show hardsole , but shoebuy shipped softsole to me . I called their costumer service , they are rude and insist that I placed an order on softsole . there are no where says softsole in this produce page and the order confirmation letter . Fix it ...
 When I got the shoes , I am so disappointed ! There is no sole and no insole . Furthermore , making me more angry , shoebuy does not admit its fault , it insists the item is correct ! Oh my God ... Does anyone wear a pair of shoes without sole and insole ??

 I have three pair of these exact shoes that I purchased from Macy 's and they are GREAT , but these are NOT . I wore the shoe 's maybe three times and the side of the shoe split open and not just a little to the point were they probably ca n't be repaired . Now I see why they were only 24.95 and the others were 69.99 and I thought I had caught a deal . Joke on me ! !

 I liked the look of these shoes but had to send them back . The strap that goes over the top part of your foot just was n't comfortable . I do n't have a high instep , but the strap just fell in a place where it was very uncomfortable and they had to go . Maybe if there was more give or if there was a small piece of goring where the strap meets the shoe . Or maybe there was but it just was n't enough , I 'm not sure .

 The cleat looks nice and sturdy but it is not a wide cleat at all . It wasted my time and money to ship it back . For that give it a zero rating !
 It looks good . The sandal is very , very pretty . Shiny and blingy . I got them in gold . But the thong stem HURTS like hell . The whole triangular , embellished section is very tight . I bought these quite some time ago and just now pulled them out to see if they were as horrible as I remember . They are . So I stuck a pair of my husband 's balled up socks in them under the triangle and I 'm going to leave it there for a week or so to see if I can ever get any use out of them . They are so beautiful , and they were n't cheap , so that is the plan .
 The picture shows a blue shoe but the description -LRB- in small print -RRB- said `` black '' . I received a black shoe and had a difficult time receiving help from the merchant . They would n't send me a return label . They would n't refund my S&H . They took zero responsibility for displaying a blue shoe picture while selling a black shoe .
 I am glad that I got the opportunity to rate this product.The sneaker is fabulous and extremely good since I wear othodics . However , both times I ordered M3910 I had the leather pull away from the sole which was very discouraging . I like the sneaker so much and thought perhaps the second pair would be made better . My Podiatrist commented on how well they were made .
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 I ordered this item through Amazon from Eastbay . Watch out on this one -- the picture on the Amazon web site does not update when you do your radio button selection , you end up ordering the `` wrong color '' , you return it and get charged for the shipping for the enclosed `` return mail paste-on '' voucher . That despite writing a note asking Eastbay not to charge me and telling them about the failure of the website to update the picture when completing the order -LRB- so I would have known I was ordering a different color than the one shown -RRB- .

 Its over-sized kiss lock hard ware is perfectly cute . However , its opening is extremely narrow and flat so it is uncomfortable and ugly . The material is not leather but cheap vinyl or PVC .
 I normally wear an extra wide shoe . I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it .

 The picture shows a blue shoe but the description -LRB- in small print -RRB- said `` black '' . I received a black shoe and had a difficult time receiving help from the merchant . They would n't send me a return label . They would n't refund my S&H . They took zero responsibility for displaying a blue shoe picture while selling a black shoe .

 these are the most uncomfortable boots I have ever owned . the tongue is so wide it wraps around your ankle and digs into your ankle bone . no way to fold it to keep it away . but they should never wear out . after an hour a day for six months trying to break them in they are still stiff and hard to wear . I would not recomend these to anyone .
 I have very narrow feet and bought a pair of these a few years ago . They fit perfectly . Now they 're old and not very supportive so I went to get another pair . The straps are so loose on the new ones that they barely stay on my feet . I was so disappointed . If you have narrow feet the 2011 version of these probably wo n't fit . I 'm sad that shoes for wide feet have taken over the world . I am stuck with my old ones until they fall apart .
 I ordered these shoes because I loved the way they looked . When I received them , I was shocked at how comfortable they were ! However , the reason why I gave these shoes only two stars was because of their tightness . I wear a size 7 and I am always true to size , however , these shoes felt extremely tight , even after attempting to stretch them out . In addition to feeling quite snug , every time I walked in them , I felt as if my feet were slipping out the back little by little each step . Also , these shoes do not offer much support . If you want a shoe this in this style , I recommend checking out Rafters Antigua Sandals .
 I purchased the sandals for myself but was not able to wear them because they run narrow , I even went a size up because I have wide feet . . I ended up giving them away to someone with a narrow foot . .
 I like flip flops . These were cute and on a good sale . For me , the sensation of webbing wrapped around my big toe was n't comfortable - or was it just too tight around the toe for my liking ? Had to return them , since I knew they would n't get worn .
 shoe is not supportive . Even if it is a Teva . I am need support for arches . It is very cute but if you need stablization even with extra strapes this is not it .
 These fit a little small for the size , even from other Chacos . I ended up returning them since the straps seemed tight .
 I have been wearing these Teva sandals for three years now , and I have to say that I was really disappointed with this year 's crop of sandals . I used to love these sandals because the bottom part of the flip flop was so squishy and comfy and because they fit my narrow feet so perfectly . They were by far the most comfortable shoes I 've ever owned . I would wear mine every day throughout the summer , until I wore the heels through!But this year , its seems that Teva decided that the fit was too narrow for the majority of their customers so they decided to make the fit a bit wider , the straps a bit looser . I tried on multiple different styles and colors while I was at the shoe store , and it seems that they 've all be changed to fit this way . Unfortunately , this completely changed the comfortability of the sandal for me . Though they fit length-wise like they used to , they now feel like they 're about two sizes too big for me and flop around way too much . Where before I would have rated these shoes 5 + stars , I can now only give them 2 stars . They are no longer my favorite sandals , and I really wish that Teva had n't decided to mess with a sandal that would have been my favorite go-to summer sandal for years to come .
 Very uncomfortable to wear . I did not realize from the photos before purchased , that this was a `` thong '' - thought it was a criss/cross flip flop . Not only is it a thong , but a coarse and narrow thong material is utilized , making them quite painful and uncomfortable - cutting between the toes . Teva has a good name , but this flip flop is a disappointment - only good for bath to bedroom to dress . Too bad , as they are quite attractive
 I have VERY narrow feet . I ordered these and actually had trouble wedging my foot in . Once I did , wearing them was impossible due to the straps rubbing blisters on the tops of my feet . I had to send them back .
 I had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes . This makes it really uncomfortable and I have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap . Nice colors , not very cushy sole because it 's so thin and overall very sorry I bought them without trying first .
 Teva 's are very comfortable , but do n't leave them in the sun ! They shrink ! I left my new sandals in the back of my Jeep while I was at work one day . When I came out the top portion of the sole had shrunk and curled up . Did n't realize they were so fragile ... not happy . $ 30 bucks wasted .
 I bought these sandals because of the name and users recommendations . I found then to be uncomfortable due to the material between my toes.I offered them to my daughter and she also found the material uncomfortable .
 The pair I received were a beautiful color -- just what I was looking for , but one of the sandals was not manufactured properly , one of the bands that crosses over the foot was way too long , so it did n't fit properly . I was disappointed to have to send it back , bc there were no others to get a replacement .
 Have bought several pairs of this exact sandal in the past few years . The pair I received was too wide to wear-so I had to return it . Not happy . Will not buy this product online again -- Not consistent sizing .
 I 've been buying a new pair of Tevas every year for the past 4 years because I 've loved & used them so much.I ordered a 7 again this year , but it was too small . I ordered a 7.5 and that was too big . They must have changed manufacturers , or changed something about the shoe.I 've been looking in brick-and-mortar stores as well , hoping the shoes shipped from Amazon were just a bad batch . No luck yet though.I will be really disappointed if I ca n't find any that fit next year .
 I was sure with all the good reviews that these sandals would be awesome . Well for me ... they are not . I do not like the way they feel at all . They are cushy on the bottom which is nice but they are just not comfy . The straps are not comfy . Sadly . . I threw my money away on these since I had to wear them to find out I do not like them . Poor me . .
 This is the 2nd pair of these sandals I 've ordered . I LOVED the first pair . They were so comfortable , light weight , fit secure on my feet and provided arch support . So I ordered another pair of the exact same sandal for this season . I do n't know what 's happened in the manufacturing process but the quality has definitely suffered . The straps were all over the place , some were way too loose , others too snug . They were not comfortable mainly due to the way the straps were sewn , so I sent them back to Amazon and requested a refund . Have not received yet . I also ordered a pair of the Mandalyn Wedge Ola flip flop at the same time . Again , I have had another pair of those , and the new ones were not as comfortable . Foot bed was harder than first pair , straps not uniform as to fit . TEVA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR QUALITY ???
 This Teva style looks pretty nice for a flip flop . The strap configuration is the whole thing , the only thing I can see that distinuishes it from a $ 1.99 drugstore version.The third time I wore mine , the strap on one came loose . This means the main strap over the foot that holds the sandal on slipped out of its mooring 1/2 or 3/4 inch , from where it connects to the body of the shoe . I was just walking down a cement sidewalk with my dog.From that moment , the whole shoe is much too loose , and easy to trip with . Insecure . And the whole reason I chose this style was to have a more secure flip flop on my feet.I just could not face writing the company and shipping it back and paying $ 5 more to return an $ 18 item . Would not buy again . Disappointed in Teva .
 Due by 2/24/12 - 2/29/12 ... . arrived 03/03/2012 . LATE and extremely disappointed , will NOT purchase from supplier -LRB- HEART & SOLE SHOES -RRB- again . The correct item -LRB- color/size -RRB- was shipped correctly - so i gave it 2 stars . Amazon is usually better than this.The actual sandal was comfortable and acceptable . It deserves 5 stars . I have bought 7 pairs -LRB- from other people -RRB- and I do LOVE the flip-flops .
 Wore them once . Thought they felt good . They looked really nice . Woke up the next morning and could n't walk . Have been limping ever since -LRB- 3 weeks so far -RRB- . Thumbs down for lousy arch support .

 These boots seemed sooo well made - thick sutrdy , the handles well-connected . So now - 2 years of occasional wear by a youngster - the black rubber laminate -LRB- over fabric -RRB- is flapping in the wind - just torn completely . Otherwise , they are in great condition , but such a shame . I would NOT re-order these boots - can not return/exchange after 2 years , even if only occasional wearing.He LOVED these boots - we invested in the hat and coat as well . = :--LRB- -LRB- The &#34; seam &#34; - connection between t he yellow toe and black , seems to bear the brunt of any pressure from movement - both boots the same - and maybe the rubber flexing only against thin cloth is more prone to tearing ?? That 's my non-engineering guess.Very disappointing ...
 I purchased this as a gift . My Grandson loved these boots . They were just what a little Fireman needed . But the quality is very poor . Within 60 days they began to separate at the seams . Needless to say he is upset he can not wear his boots . Based on the quality I give this product only 1 star and would not recommend purchasing .
 First these are not the first pair of this exact boots that I have owned . My five year old son had the same pair in a smaller size that we purchased from Nordstrom last year . He did n't wear them enough to judge back then because they were grown out of quickly . I purchased this pair in December and have not had good luck . The 2nd time he put them on the handles you grip to pull them on broke off on both boots . After wearing them for about a month the sole started pulling apart and ripping . I 'm not impressed . I will tell you that my 5 yr old son is extremely high spirited so perhaps they wore out quicker than normal . Not sure but I wo n't be buying these next year .
 I 'm really sorry these were so poorly made , because my son loves them and wants to wear them daily . He got them for Christmas and wore them three times when the sole separated from the rest of the boot ! The weather was good and they had been mostly worn indoors.I ordered a new pair , and he kept wearing them -LRB- no snow or rain , thank heavens -RRB- , while we waited for the new ones to arrive . When they came the other day , I went to box up the first pair to return them , and lo and behold the OTHER boot had separated in exactly the same way!So now I 'm just waiting for the new ones to fall apart , at which point I will give up and go buy boots somewhere else .
 Ok , my son wore them to death.He also got the `` Jr. . Fire Fighter Suit with helmet '' . That was a creat buy and 3 year of almost daily useage is still ok.The boot start falling apart at the seams .
 These are good design ; however the colors are different on the boots . One of the boots has black shading on the `` badge '' and the other boot does not ! Kind of as though it was bad printing .
 I 'd give 'em two stars 'cause my son liked 'em a lot and they were good while they lasted ... which was n't long enough . But I 'm pretty peeved about the quality so they get one star.With only occasional use they had completely disintegrated within a year . Rubber just cracked apart into a rotten mess . Totally unacceptable . Kids shoes should last to be hand-me-downs ... especially if they are n't everyday shoes.I 'm guessing most of the glowing reviews come from folks who have happy kids after owning them for two weeks .
 My son is in love with all things fireman , and could n't be happier with the look of these boots . On the other hand , after about 3 months of wear -LRB- albeit constant -RRB- , they have fallen apart . It 's really too bad - they are awfully cute .
 I was sorely disappointed in these rainboots . My little fella loves all things firehouse-related and was thrilled when he saw them under the Christmas tree . I expected that for the money paid , they would be well-made and last a good long time . Within a few monthes they were splitting across the tops of the boots . He still wants to wear them but they are of course , not waterproof now . I had purchased a pair of rain boots for my daughter from Old Navy and they survived without damage for years . I will not purchase Western Chief rain boots again .
 My sons totally loved these boots the only problem is they ripped apart at the toes and the sides of the front of the boot . We tried fixing them but , it did n't hold and the boots had to be trashed . This was very upsetting due to the cost and the disappointment to my boys . I am looking for other boots to purchase that will hold up to the everyday wear and tear of boys .
 These boots just do n't last . In less than a month of light use , the upper portion had separated from the sole on one of the boots . I would be very reluctant to buy another of these .
 I bought these boots for my son . He loved them when he first got them . They are so cute ! Unfortunately it seems as though they piece these boots together rather than taking a solid boot and decorating it . The boots split at the seam in the front over the toes . The size was great , they were not tight but after wearing them several times over a 2 week period we had a hole . I think given the price of these boots they should have lasted much longer . I have bought plain rubber boots from walmart for half the price and they last till he outgrows them . We are n't real happy and will not purchase these boots again .
 This boot is way too big and heavy for a toddler . My son -LRB- 20 mons -RRB- could barely lift his leg with this boot on . They are very cute , but what 's the point of a rainboot if a boy can play with them on .
 I have bought these boot twice now and both times they came apart at the seams around the toes within 2 months of wear . We live in a mountain area that consists of some paved roads and some dirt . My son mostly wears them on walks or playing in the yard . He plays like any other 5 year old , but these shoes do not hold up . His friend also got a pair and they came apart in the same area . I love the design but will not purchase again do to the lack of durability .
 These boots look great when you first get them , but they do n't last very long at all . It was only a few months into wearing them when I realized that they came apart . They do n't just come apart a little , they come apart almost completely , at least to the point of them being some flaps of rubber held together here and there.They split pretty much everywhere the black meets the yellow . It 's a real shame because they look like there nice , but you ca n't always judge a boot by its looks , I guess .
 We first got these boots for my -LSB- ... -RSB- son for Easter and they split at the seam in about 1 month . Luckily this was just in time to have them replaced . Unfortunately after 6 months of wearing the replacements they too have multiple splits at the seams and several on top . However , I will say my son loves these boots and is disappointed that we ca n't send them back to the Easter bunny again .
 CHANGING MY REVIEW
 These are some of the most poorly made kids fire boots I have ever seen . My 3 year old is really into firemen . I bought these boots at Stride Rite so I assumed they would be durable . I couldnt not have been more wrong . Within a month the boots had split across the front just under the shield . Not one boot , but BOTH !! The split just continued to get larger . Despite the fact that he mostly wears these indoors , the soles began to wear through and within 3 months the sole had started to detach from the boot all together . I would NEVER EVER buy these boots again !
 We bought this late fall of last year . It was not used the whole winter and was used few times during spring for the occasional rainy days . I was shocked when my son came home from school with wet socks last week . THE BASE CAME APART . We have used many a rainy boots over the years , never had this problem . We had to go for new ones only because he outgrew his current ones . Here we go , now got to buy another pair . If I had bought from a store , would have definitely taken it to them and complained . On Amazon , I do n't know if there is any customer service number that I can call .
 These boots fell apart after very little wearing . They came apart at the seams . I would NOT recommend them . Very disappointing to us .
 The RAIN BOOTS are not water proof !!!! DO NOT BUY THESE BOOTS !!!!
 My son loves firemen . We saw these in the store and he had to have them . When we got home I realized they had the 343 on them . 343 is the number of firemen who died on 9/11 . I think that is a very strange thing to put on a childs shoe . We live in New York City and have many friends who are in the FDNY . I am not so sure it is appropriate for my son to wear these boots . I just thought I would let people know what 343 means .

 Had these for about 2 years , did n't even wear them once . They 're very uncomfortable . Cute but extremely uncomfortable . I finally donated them to Salvation Army .

 These are not the Danner boots that I know and love . My dad has been buying these for a long time now , mostly because of the wonderful quality and the fact they WERE made in the USA . I also still have an old pair that I got back in high school that are just now wearing out -LRB- over 6 years of hard use -RRB- I think you might still be able to find a pair made in the USA , but none of these are ! I tried these on at a local outdoor store and they are horrible . The fabric is very cheep and flimsy feeling -LRB- that 's made in China for you -RRB- . The hooks and eyelets for the shoe laces are made out of PLASTIC ! Really Danner ? These are a sorry excuse for boots in general , and especially for Danner . Look elsewhere people !
 Felt great on the bottom of my feet but a hard seem on the tongue of the boot makes for a hard spot that rubs on each of the ankle bones -LRB- inside and out -RRB- on each foot . Every step hurts since these hard spots rub against your ankle . They look good , seem durable but I have to return them because every step hurts . Tried massaging those spots to soften them up and tried to get those blister protectors but it 's no use . It 's a a design issue . My 5 + year old Wolverines do n't have this issue .

 Im a fan of dockers use most products but never had shoes but i thought very hard desilucione , i think i ` ii keep usind HUSH puppies more soft
 After 4 years , I finally replaced my old pair . I have owned these shoes for less than 4 months now . Already , a hole is beginning to form near the balls of my feet . This is incredible considering the same pair previously lasted 4 years ! I could tell almost immediatly that Dockers must have changed something because of how quickly the shoes were wearing out . I have contacted the company with my complaint .
 These are comfortable but by the time you get them wore in the sole of the shoe is all worn out . I work in an office too , its not like I was on concrete all day and im not over weight . They should make a sole that last longer than 2 months .
 First thing you notice about these shoes is that they come plastered with rather unusual promo stickers about their stain resistance . Hmm , should that be a primary concern for a black shoe ? But apparently there 's just nothing else in these shoes to brag about . They look much cruder than in the pictures . The interior -LRB- insoles and some trim -RRB- are lined with a vinyl plastic , not leather . That immediately makes them very hot and uncomfortable to wear . Unlike some other reviewers , I found the sizing to be fairly true . But there was uncomfortable pressure on the instep , and poor shock absorption in the sole . Since the interior is not leather , the shoes are unlikely to break in either.Amazon provides great service both in delivery and handling of returns ; but I wish I could return these shoes all the way back to China , from where they came .
 I have not received this item as of today . I really do n't know what happened to my order -LRB- Dockers Men 's shelter Plain Toe Oxford , Black , 7 M US -RRB- .
 I bought this pair in a 10 medium . They looked good and felt good on my feet . However , as other reviewers have said , the soles wear out fast within a couple of weeks ! I do n't recommend these shoes.Dockers needs to strengthen the soles .
 The shoes came with a torn out brass &#34; eye &#34; for the laces . This is not a first quality item and I feel that I was taken advantage of by the vendor .
 Great looking shoe . However BEWARE , At least one full size small . 9 should be a 10 . Also , very , very poor padding on the sole insert . We shall see about the wear -LRB- March 1,2012 -RRB- . Will report back ... I Will not buy this brand again .
 This was my second pair . They were too tight , although sized the same . The leather seemed to be inferior to my previous pair but likely still serviceable . I gave mine to a homeless man . I am sure he would write a glowing review of his new Dockers .
 I 've had mine for a barely a month , and I am extremely disappointed how quickly the soles have worn . The soles feel like they are made from the same materials as flip-flop soles . The soles on these have worn so quickly that I will probably only get about another 2 or 3 months out of them.I will NOT be buying Dockers again when I have to replace these , or ever again , for that matter . My shoes before this pair lasted me two years . This is unacceptable , Dockers ! Customers expect much better quality for the higher price associate with your brand name .
 The Dockers Men 's Shelter Plain Toe Oxford is a comfortable and attractive shoe , but the soles wear very quickly . After only 3 weeks of occasional -LRB- 3x a week -RRB- use INDOORS and -LRB- usually -RRB- on CARPET , the soles were visibly worn.Hoping to receive a refund from the seller , Shoebuy.com , proved pointless . When the shoes were returned to me , a form was included indicating that the `` soles are excessively worn '' which is nonsense . If the soles fade so quickly in a mere three weeks , they will be completely eroded in 6 months.In the Great Recession , giving money to a business or government means having parted with it forever regardless of the circumstances . Avoid this shoe and avoid Shoebuy.com unless you wish to get cheated .
 THESE SHOES WERE THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES I EVER PUT ON - I HAVE A HIGH ARCH BUT THESE HAVE SUCH A HIGH ARCH - THEY HURT ! I THINK THEY ARE DEFECTIVE !
 I bought these for aerobics class , but they did n't feel comfortable to me . They feel heavy too . I just wear to work now .
 I bought these because I needed another pair of running shoes , to rotate with my fave Nikes . Well , I should have stayed with the Nikes . Comfy at first then they chewed the back of my right heel . Bad shoes , Bad . I agree with the previous reviewer who stated these things might be defective . I wore them for a couple hours , took them off my feet and threw them directly into the trash . Ouch

 el producto aun no ha llegado al lugar de destino , tiene mas de un mes de retraso y aun no ha sido despachado para recibirlo en mi local ...
 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .

 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .

 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I thought these would work but they just were too narrow for my foot and did n't match up to the quality of the Acorn slippers

 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''

 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .

People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 Adorable shoes indeed ! Contrary to the look of them , because they are wedges , you would think that the heel would be higher . The heel was so low that everytime I took a step , the shoe fell off . I love wedges and prefer them over flats , but the company needs to improve the comfort of their line . I have gotten lucky with this brand a couple of times , but most of the time , they are super cute shoes without any comfort . I had to return these , but wish I did n't have to because they are one of the cutest pairs I have ever seen .

 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ...

The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I 've had great luck with Florsheim shoes over the years , but I find these shoes to be some of the more uncomfortable that I own . They feel like they run small , and I thought they might `` give '' a little , but they have n't . They also continue to squeak when I walk , after several weeks of wear . I only wear these now when I 'm going to be in them for a short time , not all day .
 I 've always had good luck with Florsheim shoes . I 've always found them to be true to fit and well made . That legacy just ended . I was looking for a pair of comfortable shoes that I could use for daily wear to the office . I ordered them online because it difficult in the stores to find an assortment of styles in my size -LRB- 10/EEE -RRB- . When I received these shoes , they looked great , but fit tightly . I assumed they would loosen up with wear , but that never really happened . They are absolutely NOT true to size . Although marked EEE , they fit like an E or maybe EE . Also , in order to get a comfortable fit , you have to leave a pretty large gap between the lace hole tongues , which looks a little stupid . I 've never had to do this with a shoe before , and I do n't have a high arch problem or any other malady that might make me an exception . They 're -LRB- shoe manufacturer -RRB- just cheating on material . I would have returned them , but I wore them for a while in the hope that they would loosen up and , frankly , I just did n't want to go through the hassle . This shoe is NOT recommended .
 I have always worn florsheim shoes . Last year I bought 3 different pair . I am only writing on these because they are the loudest . I am so embarrassed to wear them . Sore feet and squeaking has always been the norm the first couple of weeks , then like magic they would become the perfect fit . Now people hear me coming from so far away . I have soaked them in liquid oil and finally went to saddle soap . Stretching only made this pair worse . My other pairs , courtland and lexington also too loud to wear to work . Disposable ...
 These are very , very tight fitting ! I recommend buying a couple of sizes larger than your normal or you will have trouble sliding your foot in !
 I wear a size 12 shoe and I ordered a size 13 boot . I could n't even get my foot through the neck of the boot . Waste of time and money ! They must run way to narrow .

 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .

 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not .

 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ...

 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .

 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .

 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 These are very , very tight fitting ! I recommend buying a couple of sizes larger than your normal or you will have trouble sliding your foot in !
 I wear a size 12 shoe and I ordered a size 13 boot . I could n't even get my foot through the neck of the boot . Waste of time and money ! They must run way to narrow .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .

 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .

 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .

 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake .

If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are .

 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 Wasted my money on this shoe . The first day my wife wore them they fit perfectly . By the second day , they streched so much she had difficulty keeping them on her feet .
 These shoes look great but stretched out so much after wearing one time , they are unwearable . I contacted the seller who ignored my inquiry . I wasted my money . Not recommended .
 Softspots Women 's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe . It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem . The shoes wear well and are comfortable . This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly . It was so tight I could not get it on . I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug . These shoes have a strong chemical odor . I have aired them for a week with no improvement . The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage . I may have to return these shoes too .
 I 'm a size 9 , through and through , and I 've never had the problems with other shoes that I had with these . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm a Softspots fan , but these shoes are not well-designed . I tried these on and could n't take more than 2 steps in them , they hurt my feet so badly . When the shoe bends as you 're walking , the strips on top come together to pinch the skin on the top of my foot .
 This was without a doght the worst pair of shoes I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to purchase . First they were ugly , second they were way too tight , and last they would never be something I would buy . It cost $ 10 to return and I could not have worn them if I wanted to . This was false advertising if there ever was one .
 The quality of the shoe was good , but I returned them because the fit in the heel was too wide . Slipped up and down when I tried to walk .
 When I first got these shoes , I loved them . They were cute , comfy and a good fit . Within a few days , I noticed they seemed to be a little large after all . After a week or so , I realized they were stretching and were quite loose . But they stayed on my feet -LRB- kind of -RRB- , so I kept wearing them . After a few weeks , they had stretched so much that I could no longer wear them - and then I noticed that the heels had worn half-way down and there were actual holes developing in the bottoms ! This is after less than a month of wearing -LRB- and I 'm not mountain-climbing in them either -RRB- . I called the seller -LRB- Footsmart -RRB- and they said they would not take the shoes back as defective since they had been worn , but gave me the manufacturer 's number . The manufacturer said they had a warranty , so I reported the problem . When I did n't hear back , I tried again . I was told it would take two weeks to receive a response . I waited two weeks -LRB- I work for a manufacturer - we respond to customer complaints within one business day -RRB- . No response . Several calls and one month later , I am still waiting to receive a mailing label so I can send the shoes to the manufacturer for evaluation . I will update this if I do receive a satisfactory solution at any point , but as of now , I would say to stay away from these shoes !

 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .
 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !

 The shoes are very uncomfortable since it is man made leather and is so hard , not flexible at all . The heels are low so it 's not elegant . I do n't think I can walk much with these shoes . It is just a big disappointment after all . This is a second pair of Naturalizer shoes I 've bought online so far . Both of them are not comfortable since they were not genuine soft leather . I do n't think I 'll buy naturalizer shoes any more since the quality is quite compromised . These were made in China .

 I normally wear an extra wide shoe . I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it .
 The shoes were as advertised , however , the toebox is not deep enough for extended walking . The toe is more shallow than in the picture , this puts pressure on the big toe . Otherwise , it is OK . Shoe is true to size .
 Large lump on innersole , would be impossible to wear these shoes for any period of time , very poor quality assurance inspection.Waste of my time to even order such garbage . Amazon shame on you for not checking the quality of the shoes you recommend and sell !
 These are cheap copies of the SAS originals . I purchased and returned a pair of these imitations . The SAS shoes were comfortable from the instant I put my feet into them . Not so the copies .
 These shoes were not what I expected . They were not comfortable . They were big and bulky looking , very unattractive shoes . The front of the shoe is what stands out as being too big ... -LRB- like clown shoes from the the front -RRB- . I immediately sent them back .
 The shoe tongue rubs on my ankle - very irritating . I can not wear these . I thought a 12EE would be super wide ... a shoe I could put my custom made orthotics into , but they would not fit inside and the shoe was too tight and uncomfortable . If you have any swelling around the ankle at all , these shoes are not for you.You can see in the picture how close the shoe tongue is to the back of the shoe . Too close quarters for my slightly swollen ankles .
 It is a fine looking shoe , but the manufacturer obviously can not interpret a sizing chart . I ordered an 11.5 EEE , and what arrived was marked as the correct size , but was so ridiculously small that I could n't cram my foot in it at all . I estimate the actual size to be men 's 8 or 9 with C or D width .
 I normally wear an extra wide shoe . I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it .
 These shoes gave me corns for the first time in my life ! I bought these shoes because of the Easy Spirit brand known for comfortable shoes . Not these ! I even bought them in wide width . I would n't like to feel the regular size fit , it makes me cringe !
 I ordered these shoes after some careful selection of price , heel height , shoe material , and other considerations . I finally made my purchase , and the shoes arrived very fast , but unfortunately , though I 've always worn a standard size 7-1/2 in shoes and recently bought a pair that fit fine in this size , these shoes were so big on my feet that my foot did n't even tough the back in the shoe when I put my feet into them . Adding padding or thick hosiery seemed therefore like a pointless idea , so I decided to return the shoes . I am frustrated that ordering in my regular size did not work.I also noticed that while I ordered a `` Wide '' shoe , these do n't seem all that wide , so overall , this order did not work for me .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 This shoe is as beautiful as it looks , but it runs 1/2 to 1 size small and the bottom of the platform is very narrow , making it difficult to walk . I sent them back , and Amazon paid for the shipping both ways .

 These boots are not cute at all , the suede is really of cheap quality , the detail of the boost is lost in the poor construction of the boot , what has the potential to be a nice boot is so poorly crafted the belt dose n't even come all the way around the boot it stops at the zipper giving it a generic look the heel looks more like a block of hard dark glue.the price for these are $ 75.00 at zappos and $ 59.95 at amazon I paid $ 35.00 so I 'll lose money returning them that sucks because these boots are n't worth losing any money on . Oh and they hurt.they look more like there for a animated cartoon character - timberland makes much better quality suede boots !
 Yes this shoe is very cute , it made it a little hard to return in fact ... the picture depicts a nicely fitting shoe but my calf was floating in the sea that is this shoe . It must take a very large calf to fit such a space ! And Its not like i 'm a terribly thin person either - just normal if not on the thicker side of normal . I 've been looking for a nicely fitting brown boot , but this just did not fit the bill . If you 're looking for just a cute toe to come out of the bottom of a pant this shoe would be excelent - but too expensive for this purpose alone in my opinion .

 This appears to be a good shoe but it `` hits '' my ankle . For me I can not wear the product even after installing insoles .

 These shoes have very shallow toe room , they must be for people with thin toes . Not comfortable to wear when the shoe is pushing down on your toe nails
 I was originally very happy with these boots . The leather is beautiful and soft , and the boots were comfortable . They wore well with nice jeans and slacks . They are versatile enough to wear to the office or just on an outing.But after a few months of wear , the sole began to come apart at the seams from the upper part of the shoe . I had to toss the boots after only a few months . I had this happen with another pair of Unlisted shoes as well .
 The picture on the web site masks much of the poor qualities of this shoe . The material was cheap and it looked cheap . Save your money and spend it on something else .
 This shoe hurt my feet . I returned it .

 This tote is completely different from the one I saw in Amazon . Material is very thin and cheap . The straps of the tote i received are much longer than the one i saw in Amazon . And material very poor . This is false advertisement because what is shown in Amazon is different from what you will get . I do n't think it will last long . Very expensive for the poor quality . I hate it ! I will never buy anything from this company again .
 I was having difficulties with the sizing for this shoe , so I called Amazon.com customer service . The lady was very polite , but could not locate the item . After giving her assistance , she was able to locate the shoe and told me that they were sold out and it could not be ordered.I had the item in my cart so I just clicked to buy it anyway . Either I got it or I did n't . No harm done.It was shipped that day . I will receive it in the mail today.The product itself is great . I have a pair of brown ones ... had them for years and still going strong . And I am not a Dr. Marten 's fan at all.But I do n't think customer service means the customer provides the service to the company ... and I was given incorrect information regarding these shoes being in stock .
 this shoes are as rock , very very hard , uncomfortable.if you want rocks in yours shoes , this shoes can bring.my feet were in pain after wearing them for one day
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .

 Will be returning these shoes after the holiday season . They are a very narrow fit and they do not stretch .
 They are really rough and the loop from the knot on top really rubs the skin raw . Even if wearing light socks it still is abrasive .
 Recieved these as a gift from my dear mother . My face said thank you , but my mind said da HECK . Copious amounts of gross .
 They are a little stiff , should have smoother edges around the area you slide you foot in . Not very comfortable .

 When I bought these boots I was very excited to receive them and wear them out ... BUT I was so disappointed . The picture is better than the real thing . The pirate cuff is way more pronounced than you would think and they fall too short on the leg to pull it off . They look cheap and costumey . I think the worst thing is that the boot is very heavy and clunky . I do n't need a weird-looking , clunky boot taking over my whole outfit . Yuck .

 The boots were very good looking and great quality . I read all the reviews before I decided to order and specifically ordered the extra wide size -LRB- designated as EE or 2E -RRB- as I was expecting steel toes to be a little more restricted . I was very excited when I got them . They looked great out of the box , the leather and workmanship seemed very high quality.Then I slipped them on and immediately noticed how tight and uncomfortable they were . I thought may be that day my feet were tired so I will try them on in the morning again . Same result , they were extremely tight and uncomfortable . I double-checked to make sure they sent me the 2E size and so it said on the tag , but they were n't anything like 2E size - tight all around even though my feet are not wider than normal and usually I get the regular size . This time I decided to get the 2E just so I can have extra room.I emailed the company to verify they sent me the right size . Customer service was very good . Unfortunately this was their widest model . They did accept the shoes back and refunded my money but I was very disappointed because they had manufactured a product with a wrong size.I ordered different boots -LRB- Irish Setter -RRB- again 2E and they had plenty of space for my feet in that size.The Rocky 6 '' Iron Clad Waterproof Work Boots are manufactured in wrong sizes , be aware of that.Pros
 I got these boots for Christmas and had to send them back soon after putting them on . They fir very awkwardly and were too uncomfortable . It felt like there was enough padding and they were well constructed . They just felt really weird on my foot . I opulent walk easily in these boots .
 I bought these boots for work . I ended up returning this product . The tongue in the right boot did not fold properly and hurt my ankle . The right boot also leaked at the toe.P.S . I replaced these boots with some Keen steel toed boots < 3 'em !
 The shoe is OK , except for the fact that it feels like a toy . The shoe is completely made of plastic - including the sole . The sole does not bend well and as a result the shoe is not that comfortable . Adidas seemed to cut a few corners here ...
 Shoe hurts my feet !!! Poorly constructured leather and it 's not going to break in - I wore the shoe and do n't think I can return .
 I 've worn Adidas tennis shoes for 20 years and a 10.5 has always fit perfectly . A 10.5 in this shoe is too small , but I 've already worn them so I 'm out of luck .
 Very comfortable . Just what I was looking for . Fast forward 1 month , the soles wore out ! There is an actual hole in the sole . I 'm so glad I bought them from Amazon . I wo n't have to fight for a refund . I 'll buy a different type -LRB- from Amazon -RRB- hopefully better quality . Oh by the way , I 'm not a tennis pro . I 'm a retired senior .
 The soles are actually slippery . More like plastic than rubber . Fails the most basic of tests for a sneaker .
 I got this great sneaker shoes from Amazon , but the sole is really bad quality , it is like plastic , very slippery , I would like to have better quality , can someone help me .
 The shoe looks great and is really light BUT I found it was extremely uncomfortable around the toe area where the seam between the side and front panel is . I wore them for two days hoping they would break in but no such luck . It 's a shame because I was expecting more from adidas and I really like the design of these shoes .
 These shoes look great but offer little in the way of comfort for the price . Very little padding and a snug fit , rough edges inside the shoe . I 've gotten my share of blisters trying to break them in . I bought my usual size and they are a very snug fit , you may need to order 1/2 to a full size larger in these
 I used to wear these shoes for high school tennis over 25 years ago . I bought a pair recently and they are not the same comfort or quality as the original . They are extremely stiff , no support , and they give me blisters . The do look good -LRB- if you like that classic look -RRB- .
 The Propet Women 's Valley Walker have been a disappointment . I really do n't find them comfortable . Not enough cushion .
 not true to size , I ordered my regular size , should have ordered 2 sizes bigger and a wider shoe , its very narrow and stiff
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .

 I bought these based on the other review 's recommendation , but now that I have worn them , I ca n't see anything special about them . The shoe itself is rather shapeless , and it is a little small in the toe area , but otherwise I would say they are true to size . The bottom also has no traction , so I felt like I was going to slip . There was more padding in these shoes than the Jessica Simpson Leve flat , but it was very thin and flat - if you need arch support , these are not for you . For the amount these shoes cost , I am kind of surprised at how little these shoes offer . It was like walking around in socks .
 The shoe takes the shape of your feet which is not always a good idea !

 I have several pairs of KC shoes , two from this same line . But this one is huge !!! I think it must be a mistake . I was very dissapointed in the sizing discrepancy . I do like this line though , I love the scalloping around the edges and they are comfy . Too bad these ones have to go back .

 Had these boots for less than a year . Wear a size 12 , ended up in a size 10 1/2 and still big . The left boot seperated from the sole in about 7 months . All show and no performance ... should n't be allowed to have the HD logo on it .
 Received the mocs in timely manner , however they were poorly fitted . They were huge , at least a size too large and the width would 've accommodated a very FAT , WIDE foot . Was so disappointed . Have had these mocs . before and they fit wonderfully . Not the case this time . Sorry
 The stitches on my left shoe fell apart , and I now have a `` joker 's mouth '' on my shoe front . I am very disappointed!Anyone knows how to repair the shoe ? It sounds silly , but i really want to get my money 's worth ...
 Minnetonka Moccasins that have this type of sole are too wide . The sole with the little nubs on the bottom are a better fit if you have a more slender foot . I love the look of these , but can not keep my feet from falling out of them .

 Not my favorite shoes by any standard ... heavy and Klutzy ... but costs more to send back than it would be to keep them .
 The Bag is okay . It is n't the same picture they displayed . The bag I wanted was suppose to be a dark brown almost like a mink bag not a fox . Really disappointed . They did n't even make the suggestion to return or switch bags .

 I ordered these shoes for my daughter who has only one month of dance class remaining but had outgrown hers . I went with the Capezio `` economy '' version since there was just a month left of class but sadly , the Wide is no wider than the regular width . I had to rip the thick cushioned soles out of these shoes in order to fit them on her feet and they still are not wide enough .
 I purchased a pair of tap shoes for my granddaughter . They were cute little shoes but she needed a larger size . Unfortunately , because she lives out of the country , they did not make it back to me in time for an exchange . I wanted just an exchange ... not a refund . But the company claims there are no exceptions to its 30-day return rule , even for exchanges , so I am now stuck with these shoes . A reminder to always carefully read return policies before you make a purchase .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap .

I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 Sent me the wrong shoes , then told me the ones I ordered were out of stock .

 The shoe is OK , except for the fact that it feels like a toy . The shoe is completely made of plastic - including the sole . The sole does not bend well and as a result the shoe is not that comfortable . Adidas seemed to cut a few corners here ...
 Shoe hurts my feet !!! Poorly constructured leather and it 's not going to break in - I wore the shoe and do n't think I can return .
 I 've worn Adidas tennis shoes for 20 years and a 10.5 has always fit perfectly . A 10.5 in this shoe is too small , but I 've already worn them so I 'm out of luck .
 Very comfortable . Just what I was looking for . Fast forward 1 month , the soles wore out ! There is an actual hole in the sole . I 'm so glad I bought them from Amazon . I wo n't have to fight for a refund . I 'll buy a different type -LRB- from Amazon -RRB- hopefully better quality . Oh by the way , I 'm not a tennis pro . I 'm a retired senior .
 The soles are actually slippery . More like plastic than rubber . Fails the most basic of tests for a sneaker .
 I got this great sneaker shoes from Amazon , but the sole is really bad quality , it is like plastic , very slippery , I would like to have better quality , can someone help me .
 The shoe looks great and is really light BUT I found it was extremely uncomfortable around the toe area where the seam between the side and front panel is . I wore them for two days hoping they would break in but no such luck . It 's a shame because I was expecting more from adidas and I really like the design of these shoes .
 These shoes look great but offer little in the way of comfort for the price . Very little padding and a snug fit , rough edges inside the shoe . I 've gotten my share of blisters trying to break them in . I bought my usual size and they are a very snug fit , you may need to order 1/2 to a full size larger in these
 I used to wear these shoes for high school tennis over 25 years ago . I bought a pair recently and they are not the same comfort or quality as the original . They are extremely stiff , no support , and they give me blisters . The do look good -LRB- if you like that classic look -RRB- .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack
 I thought these boots liked nice online , but they 're disappointing in person . The inside looks like styrofoam , and the leather was already wrinkled when I got them . They also fit like a 9 or a 9.5 . The wool is nice but they were very unimpressive overall and would definitely let snow in around the ankles .
 I purchased a pair of Maxine of Canada , black , velcro-fastened boots in 2007 and they are the most wonderful boots I 've ever had
 The shaft of the boot is really snug around the calf . I am a woman with really small calves , only 14 '' around , so I never expected this problem . I ordered men 's 6/women 's 7 size . The size fits my foot perfectly , but the calf is SNUG . I would never be able to tuck even light pants into them in the outdoor wetlands and my pants will get muddy and soaked . What 's the deal MuckBoots ?! Lovely boot otherwise . Could use more flexibility in the front of boot when walking , it knocked into my front shin with every step .
 As other reviewers have noted , these boots are well constructed and are very comfortable on the feet however they grip the calf and it becomes very uncomfortable after an hour or so of wear . I am a thin woman , 5 ' 5 so I did n't think I would have a problem but I had to return . Ordering a larger size would n't work as they fit very true to size in the foot . If you have thin calves , I think these rainboots would be perfect .
 Do n't Waste Your Money . The Right sole of my boots came loose and muck told me to glue it back on . These boots are less then two years old and have been used in a tree stand most of the time . I would hate to see how long they last if you actually walk around in them .

 this is the first time that i have a major complaint about buying shoes on amazon . i ordered latin t-strap capezio dancing shoes and got some hideously ugly sandals instead . i spent over an hour on the phone witgh newport only tobe put through a really tedious process of having to return the shoes and waiting a while for my refund ... really annoying
 I did n't get the shoes in the picture . I got very cheep flat dandle few dollar worth . Too badI call the company and they say it was their worker mistake . But they did n't have the right shoes . They were willing to exchange it for another order but I will have to pay the shipping . Too bad , I will never buy from them !
 Minnetonka Moccasins that have this type of sole are too wide . The sole with the little nubs on the bottom are a better fit if you have a more slender foot . I love the look of these , but can not keep my feet from falling out of them .
 Received the mocs in timely manner , however they were poorly fitted . They were huge , at least a size too large and the width would 've accommodated a very FAT , WIDE foot . Was so disappointed . Have had these mocs . before and they fit wonderfully . Not the case this time . Sorry
 The stitches on my left shoe fell apart , and I now have a `` joker 's mouth '' on my shoe front . I am very disappointed!Anyone knows how to repair the shoe ? It sounds silly , but i really want to get my money 's worth ...
 Horrible product . Bought them for one vacation trip and the second time I wore them on the trip the strip snapped on a walk around Philip . I looked at the strap and the reason they broke was because they did a horrible job gluing it on . I looked at the one that was n't broken and I saw that the strap was already beginning to tear half way down . They looked good until they broke after my second time wearing them
 I wish these sandals had a smooth sole . I bought these because I teach ballroom dancing 25 hours a week , and my feet need something soft to relax . These do n't cut it .
 Third time I wore them to wash the car they got wetLater when they dried they smelled badwashed them twice and used laundry soap and bleach no useSmosthing died and it wo n't go awayMade in china ; out of what i do n't know waste of money
 I love them ... so confortable ... even my wife steals tem sometimes from me :-RRB- -RRB- Use them for inhouse , outhouse I use my Crocs or for more social events my Birkenstocks .20 th April 2010Today I 'm reviewing my rating ... was 5 , but now went down to 2 ... after 6 months of use they started showing small cracks all over ... since there are so many small bumps on them -LRB- which are kind of nice to keep your blood circulation going -RRB- , they accumulate dirt and are kind of difficult to clean ... after a while start smelling bad.After leaving them in the sun -LRB- forgot them for 3-4 hours -RRB- , they bent completelly and now I ca n't use them anymore -RRB- . Wo n't get them again ...
 Although I still occassionally use them , these may be the most uncomfortable sandals I 've ever purchased . The top flap is too hard , biting into my skin . The whole sandal seems too rigid and inflexible -- I do n't find it comfortable at all . It 's also too narrow for my foot . The Nike sports sandals I had before were very comfortable , but they 've worn out and I ca n't find new ones online .
 like others have stated here -- uncomfortable -- NO arch support!every step a shock to my spine -- NOT soft at all -- ordered these when I could n't find the older style Adidas -LSB- softer - more form fittin -RSB- that I 'd had for YEARS -- wore em out finally : -LRB- VERY disapointed with these !
 these are by far the worst sandles i have ever worn they are litteraly painful.i had the old styl ones and they where so much better i wore them everywhere and never wore shoes regardless of what the weather was like.these ones i just spent $ 30 on less then 24 hrs ago have been the most expensive chew toys i have ever given too my dog .
 Had a pair of adissage before this pair . Some people ca n't tolerate the hard nubs , other 's like myself find these hard nubs stimulating and somewhat massaging or soothing to the feet . I tried out these Calissage and in comparison they have no massage like effect . I could barely feel the flattened out nubs on these slippers . They had great grip but that 's all . Maybe it 's because I came from the raised nubs of the adissage and to move down to these flattened out nubs just was n't adequate . People with more delicately soothed feet may like the calissage . I returned these for a new pair of adissage and am back to having happy feet . The new nubs of the adissage are more grippy than previous versions , and feel like they 'll not get stiff and crack as soon as my old pair 's did -LRB- overall my old pair lasted 6 years -RRB- , but only time will tell . The new nubs are not as hard as previous versions . Not sure if this is better , but it is different ... still feels nicer and more effective than the calissage . So if you have tough feet with thick skin then go for the adissage , if more delicate , then you may like the calissage .
 I 've been wearing the Adissage model from Adidas for a few years . The nubs on my last pair was now mostly gone so time for a new pair . I saw the Calissage has good reviews , and the nubs are bigger so I was hoping they 'd be more durable -LRB- recent reviews on the Adissage show they 're lot less durable now , nubs falling off fast -RRB- , so I thought I 'd try the Calissage.The problem I have with the Calissage is they 're not form-fitting like the Adissage -- no arch support at all . The Adissage is contoured to the bottom of the foot at the arch and under the toes . Also there is hardly any massaging effect , maybe this is just because I 'm used to the much more aggressive massaging effect the the nubs on the Adissage . No , actually these ca n't offer good massaging effect
 Love the look of the shoes and they were very light and easy to walk in , but they were made for someone with very narrow heels and a larger upper foot area . Had a very odd fit to say the least . So I had to return mine .
 I loved the boots for the 3 times I got to wear them . The heel cap came off of one boot and was lost . A lot of money for that to happen .
 The shoe looks beautiful , but when you receive it , the part of the shoe that fits around your heel , or the very back of your foot does not provide any suppport . It is soft like fabric where it should be stiff . It almost feels as if it is going to fold or fall down .

 I ordered these shoes for my daughter who has only one month of dance class remaining but had outgrown hers . I went with the Capezio `` economy '' version since there was just a month left of class but sadly , the Wide is no wider than the regular width . I had to rip the thick cushioned soles out of these shoes in order to fit them on her feet and they still are not wide enough .
 I purchased a pair of tap shoes for my granddaughter . They were cute little shoes but she needed a larger size . Unfortunately , because she lives out of the country , they did not make it back to me in time for an exchange . I wanted just an exchange ... not a refund . But the company claims there are no exceptions to its 30-day return rule , even for exchanges , so I am now stuck with these shoes . A reminder to always carefully read return policies before you make a purchase .
 I Just Get It And I Wear It Not Over 10 Minutes And The Left Part Of The Right Shoe Started To Ripped Of ... I Wish I Could Have A NEW One Or My Money Back It Was A Worthless Buying ... I Sent Them Back For A Replacement Just Like They Say Me To An Email And I Dont Have Answer Yet I W8 Over 2 Months ... I Thnik I Will Go To A Lawyer Or Something Like That . . I Will Sent Email To Amazon And Then I Will See About Electick Kid
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 This shoe was not worth the price I paid for it . It was highly over-priced . It is just a plain fabric shoe with broad turquoise shoelaces criss-crossed at the top . IT WAS MOST CERTAINLY NOT A `` GEM '' OF AN ESPADRILLE PUMP !!!! I must admit it is a comfortable shoe , my disappointment was in the quality of the workmanship and the beauty .
 Sent me the wrong shoes , then told me the ones I ordered were out of stock .

 These slides look good and fit me okay , but they are PAINFUL because the bottom edge of the band cuts into my toes . Why would anyone make a shoe out of such rigid , sharp-edged material ? Obviously not everyone has this issue with the slides , but it could be avoided with a softer band .
 bought these sandals a year ago . used to just wear them between locker room and pool . started wearing them between apartment and pool . the front of the strap cut into my feet behind my toes . am now looking for something comfortable . as these sandals are quite popular , i thought they 'd be comfortable . not the case .
 I have purchased this type of slider before and never have I had the white strip peel off ! It 's almost like this slider is a different material then the previous pair I bought . I believe the white strip was painted on . The white strip on my last pair has not peeled away , and they are 3 years old .
 I really do n't like these . They feel very , very bulky . Someone else mentioned that they are one size too small , but I think mine actually feel bigger than what they should be . Also , I bought it somewhere else and it said that these are good shower sandals . Not at all - it takes them more than a day to dry up even in winter when it is very dry in my home ...
 I have used it for about 4 months . The sole hardly has any give-in . I thought it would get better over the days . It is almost like wearing a plank of wood . So it is not a good one to use it for daily use at home . I tried to use in the gym -LRB- swimming pool -RRB- . The flap that goes over your feet wears out quickly . The blue and white stripes have started peeling off . It is hard to dry them after wearing them in the pool area . Yet to find a good use of these . I now have to find a better pair .
 Sent me the wrong shoes , then told me the ones I ordered were out of stock .
 Too small . . I should buy 8.5 size . I normally buy 7.5 and 8 , but this really small on my feet . Kinda waste my money on this . I did not return , probably will cause me more . : - -LRB-
 I have worn these Reebok Nylon Classics for years . They just fit and were a reasonable price . However , when they outsourced these to China in the 90s the quality started to go down . When they went to Vietnam they got worse but I still bought them . The last pair I bought was made in Cambodia . A poor fit to begin with and almost no arch support anymore . Then after only two weeks , the tread on both shoes began to come off . What were once really good , affordable sneakers have now been reduced to third rate junk - all to meet the bottom line of Reebok . Geez , bring them back to be made in America ...
 I have been buying this model for at least 35 years and was always satisfied , now they changed the internal parts of the shoe taking out the arch and using a thinner pad with a different feel . They will not get my businessanymore , trying to reduce cost on material and design is a big mistake . Good bye Reebok , my last shoe .
 the shoe was not correct size . Apparently , a larger width is not available . Size 11.5 W is needed . Shoes were returned

 These shoes were awful ! The leather felt like cardboard and the back heel wore out after 2 weeks . What a waste of money .

 I ordered the Puma Women 's Drift Cat Black and White Suede shoes but received the wrong merchandise -LRB- I received the Drift Cat Leather Black & Pink -RRB- . I 've tried returning them for a refund but the seller refuses to believe they shipped the wrong merchandise . Either the seller or the seller 's supplier looked at box which has the right description on the side but never actually looked inside to confirm the merchandise was correct . ARGGHHHHHHH !! I want a refund . Goodbye Amazon !
 The item received was for a Christmas gift.It was too small and was returned for exchange using the emailed return form.As of 2-19-08 , I still have not received the item.The charge was made immediately to my charge cardin early December.So what do I do next?HELP .
 I have been wearing these type of sandals for many years , the brand I loved quit making them and I have been searching for a suitable replacement since , the big problem with these Adidas is the half dollar size logo at the heel right where there should be massaging `` nubs '' I feel the logo with every step I take . What I do n't understand is the decision in the design department that thought this was a good idea since there is a huge logo going across the front of the foot , what 's up with that ? I will be continuing my search for the best replacement for my old ones as these do not cut it !
 I bought these to replace my black ones that were lost years ago and so far they are n't nearly as comfortable . They may take a few more months of breaking in , but I dont remember the other ones hurting this much to begin with : -LRB-
 Two weeks after I purchased them the little pink message things started falling out and they were all over my floor . Now the sandals are useless .
 i was disappointed in the color of the adidas women 's sandals that I ordered . It looked like they were black and white -LRB- not pink -RRB- in the picture . I chose not to pay the postage to return them .
 I bought these shoes and liked the feel . However , within a month , many of the nubs broke off . I contacted Adidas for a return pair . They do n't reimburse for return postage . No one from Adidas ever responded . Do n't waste your money on these ; buy another brand , or expect to find that they will deteriorate in short order .
 Okay , so I love pink stuff , and these are pink , but the little bumpies on the in-soles hurt the bottom of my feet after a while . If I wear them with socks , then it does n't hurt . Also they run really big . I am a 7-1/2 to 8 , but I am able to fit into size 6-7 of these shoes . Interesting . I say
 I purchased these shoes because I have neuropathy in my feet . I imagined that the innersole having the rubbber spikes would be good for blood circulation . I was wrong , they were terribly painful . I was going to give them to my daughter who loves sandals and she gave them back to me saying they were too painful . I then asked my granddaughter who is 11 to try them and she had the same problem . All along I thought it was me . Others in the reviews raved about them . Sorry I could n't join your praise .
 We liked the idea of these massaging sandals . However , they are poorly designed because the tiny massaging pegs came loose and broke off not long after we started using them . My wife and I are not overweight people -LRB- athletic build -RRB- and only use these sandals around the house -LRB- not for hight impact activities -RRB- . We were both very disappointed with this product from a name brand company like Adidas . We would not recommend this product for anyone since they begin breaking so soon .
 I got these for my wife since she always complains of leg aches . Saw the sharp edges to massage feet and thought it would be good . My wife did not really like them but is putting up with it - `` something is better than nothing `` I tried them and felt the same - not a great way to soothe your aching legs.I would not recommend this to others - for the price you pay it 's not a good buy .
 The item that was order and expected was not what I received . This was a very big dissapointment on Christmas morning when presents were being opened .
 I found these to be very uncomfortable in a short period of time . I know they are supposed to massage your feet , but for me , they just hurt after 30 minutes .
 This is the second pair of Charles David shoes I have purchased and again they were WAY TO SMALL ! They were great quality -LRB- although the elastic strap is chintzy -RRB- but I could barely squeeze my size 10 foot into the shoe -LRB- all my other shoes are 10s -RRB- . I wo n't be buying Charles David again for the inconvenience of having to return them every time . If you have a smaller foot like a 9 you could probably wear the 10 .
 I always wear a size 7.5 medium . In fact , I can usually fit a size seven as well . However , the 7.5 medium I ordered for the Women 's Pia Pump was extremely too tight . It felt like a 6.5 medium . I advise anyone purchasing this shoe to purchase full size larger than they normally wear . While the quality was great , I will be returning this pair of shoes and probably steering clear of Charles David in the future .

 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news , since everyone raves about the shoes and seem to be happy . I feel like maybe there 's something wrong with me . The shoes are beautiful , but the thong strap is too wide for my feet and it started hurting . I used them two days around the house and ended up returning them . I wanted them to fit so bad because they are very pretty shoes . They do run small , I am 8.5 and since they do n't come in half size , I had to order a 9 .
 Loved how they looked , but the thong strap pulled out from the sole after maybe 2 months of wearing . Very disappointed in the quality .
 When the shoes arrived , I tried them on ... well , TRIED to try them on . I had to check the size on the shoe to make sure it was correct . I could not even get my foot all the way in . I was surprised because I bought a different pair of Rampage shoes that fit perfectly . I think the third strap is too tight for my foot as I could n't get past that one . I 'll be returning these .

 this is the first time that i have a major complaint about buying shoes on amazon . i ordered latin t-strap capezio dancing shoes and got some hideously ugly sandals instead . i spent over an hour on the phone witgh newport only tobe put through a really tedious process of having to return the shoes and waiting a while for my refund ... really annoying
 I did n't get the shoes in the picture . I got very cheep flat dandle few dollar worth . Too badI call the company and they say it was their worker mistake . But they did n't have the right shoes . They were willing to exchange it for another order but I will have to pay the shipping . Too bad , I will never buy from them !
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 The product was shipped very quickly . This is the only positive thing I can say about my experience with Amazon and the vendor , `` Shoes on a Shoestring '' that was used to purchase the shoe . First , I ordered a black Ladybelle shoe . I received a red shoe , in what appeared to be a completely different style of Clark shoe . So I returned the item to exchange for the correct item . I received no correspondence from Amazon or Shoes on a Shoestring . Then I discover a refund on my credit card for the amount , minus shipping of course . I called Shoes on a Shoestring . It seems they were out of stock of my original order and refunded me the amount . I am very disappointed in the lack of communication between Amazon and the vendor . I was also poorly kept in contact regarding the outcome of my order . I had to initiate all contact . I will work w / Amazon again , however I will not work with Shoes on a Shoestring again . I believe their quality of service is poor .
 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .
 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 I have to say I was very disappointed - I would not buy another pair of Earth shoes again as these are not comfortable at all .
 I bought this shoe thinking that any ECCO would be a great shoe . Boy was I wrong . It is nowhere near as comfortable as my other ECCOs . After a short hike I had a horrible blister on one heel . The next day a blister developed on the other heel.I read reviews of this shoe and everyone seemed to like it and thought it was great for light hikes . Well I disagree . I would not recommend this shoe to wear even as just an everyday shoe . I doubt that I would ever wear it again . Too bad because it looks like such a nice shoe .
 Ordered a size 8N in blue , received a 9N in black . What more can I say?The seller has no quality control .
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON -LRB- SHOEFLAKE -RRB- AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE . FORTUNATELY , I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO . HOWEVER , I AM OUT $ 60 + DOLLARS .
 Shoe appeared to be the wrong size.The shoe was a bigger size than what was stated , more like a factory reject .
 I have worn the Liberty Loafer for many years . These run wider than any others that I have -- in the same size . I will not order these again .
 I have worn the Enzo Liberty loafer as my primary shoe of choice for many years , and have owned at least 15 pair . I always knew I could depend on this shoe to fit my foot as if it were hand-made for me , and to be comfortable from day one . Unfortunately , the quality of this shoe seems to have deteriorated while the cost has steadily gone up . This pair is not the soft buttery leather I have grown accustomed to , but feels extremely stiff , does not conform to my foot , rubs my ankle and cuts into my instep . I will not be ordering these again , and am greatly disappointed .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 this is the first time that i have a major complaint about buying shoes on amazon . i ordered latin t-strap capezio dancing shoes and got some hideously ugly sandals instead . i spent over an hour on the phone witgh newport only tobe put through a really tedious process of having to return the shoes and waiting a while for my refund ... really annoying
 I did n't get the shoes in the picture . I got very cheep flat dandle few dollar worth . Too badI call the company and they say it was their worker mistake . But they did n't have the right shoes . They were willing to exchange it for another order but I will have to pay the shipping . Too bad , I will never buy from them !

 I ordered these shoes for my daughter who has only one month of dance class remaining but had outgrown hers . I went with the Capezio `` economy '' version since there was just a month left of class but sadly , the Wide is no wider than the regular width . I had to rip the thick cushioned soles out of these shoes in order to fit them on her feet and they still are not wide enough .
 I purchased a pair of tap shoes for my granddaughter . They were cute little shoes but she needed a larger size . Unfortunately , because she lives out of the country , they did not make it back to me in time for an exchange . I wanted just an exchange ... not a refund . But the company claims there are no exceptions to its 30-day return rule , even for exchanges , so I am now stuck with these shoes . A reminder to always carefully read return policies before you make a purchase .

 The size was a toddler sizing , so I assumed it ment a child below 4 years old . To be sure I called Amazon , the person that ansered the phone said that their shoe sizing information was not very good and that he could not help me with it . So I ordered the shoe in a size 4 thinking it was for a toddler as it said . When I received the shoes they wewe more like a big kids or adult size . The shoes themself were very nice , well built . I just hope they are still in style when she grows into them . She is 3 years old now . Also some of the shoes I was looking at went by clothing size , not shoe size .

 I run four to six miles per day and having been wearing New Balance shoes for years . I have n't found any other brand that works as well for me . The price on these shoes was excellent ; the quality is excellent ; however , the fit is not consistent with previous New Balance models -- the toe fit is shorter and wider than the 768 series -LRB- I have three pairs of these . -RRB- and the earlier 765 and 766 . Additionally , I can feel what appears to be the gaps in the tread through the soles of the shoe , giving the impression that my feet are not on a uniform platform of support . While I have only worn them once , at this point in my experience , I am reluctant to recommend them , despite the great price .
 I saw a friend wearing similar and thought they were cute , but they did n't have the same impact on my larger size foot . Because of that , but not because of style or comfort , I sent them back . Did not keep long enough to comment on other .
 Either the design sizing or the quality control of these shoes is inconsistent - the size I ordered based on the prior year shoe does not suit me in this years model . Sizing does not appear to be dependable.The shoes can not be returned once tried without re-stocking fee and shipping costs . Perhaps I should go back to buying running shoes in a shop where a proper fit can be confirmed .

 not enough adjustment for high arch . amazon return policy is the best . john
 these shoes hurt my feet a lot , i thought with the price i put in them they 'd be comfortable . they do look good , like in picture , but they are just not feet-friendly , though i have thin feet .
 This shoes is simple and classic , but it 's way too narrow . I am usually a size 4.5 or 5M and I ordered the 4.5 W knowing that my feet could use wide shoes , but when i got it , the length fits perfectly , but it 's very narrow . I ca n't imagine how the normal width would be if the Wide is so narrow . Unfortunately , I had to return them . they do look pretty tho .

 I bought a pair because I owned a previous version of the Kumasi . This one 's a step down in construction , fit and materials .
 Ordered the shoe on 6/25/07 . The tongue on the right shoe came apart today which is 10/28/07 . Poor sewing . Shoes were ok but only lasted 4 months . Played golf on Sundays for the duration and Thursdays till Sept. . It is back to foot joys which last a lot longer than 4 months .
 Not really what I expected . Should have spent more time reading the description . They leave my feet very wet after a round of golf . Next time I 'll choose a brand I 'm more familiar with ... price influenced my decision ... unfortunately .
 These shoes are not at all comfortable and would be a bad buy at any price !
 hi i returned the item didnt like itwould like u to advise when my credit card will be debited the amount
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 The shoes are fine but the color was not what we expected . Look closely at the picture and enlarge it . It is two toned and pretty drastic . If you like those things , it will be fine , I was expecting a very subtle two tone .

 The boots came to me two sizes too small - I 've been wearing 8.5 boots for 30 years , normal width , but these boots could n't take my foot if it were two sizes smaller ! Yet this did n't constitute an `` Amazon Caused Problem '' so I got stiffed full shipping charges BOTH ways.Don ' t ever buy shoes from Amazon unless you can afford to pay LOTS of shipping costs just to find out what the manufacture decides is your size ! In my case I guess that would be a men 's 10.5 or 11 in triple E width!Also - their definition of `` vintage tan '' was more like a `` distressed mud '' color , not even close to the picture color . Once again - do n't buy shoes/boots from Amazon !

 I bought these sandals a few years ago and was disappointed in the comfort factor . Too bad , it 's a good brand .
 I bought this for a trip . I wanted room for my cell phone , sunglasses , chapstick , plus all the credit cards , cash , id , etc. . I wanted to wear it across my body for safety but the strap was extremely irritating to my neck . I wanted to wear it as a fanny pack but the strap would not stay cinched , so it would just slide down my hips to the floor . Since the fabric was soft , it became a strange fat lumpy shape as soon as a few things were thrown in . I have n't used it since returning from the trip , and am now in search of something similar but without the problems this one had .
 I like the concept of this wallet . It seems to have a place for everything I needed . However , the bag is very soft and I wanted something with a more solid construction . I would also have liked the credit card compartment to open fully for easier access which it did not . So , reluctantly , I returned the bag and will continue my search for the perfect wallet .

 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .

 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .

 I should have not wasted time and money seeing for myself given the bad reviews . They do not zip to the top as stated many times and in no way can you possibly tuck in a pant leg as there is no room . These are useless , I ordered them for the practicality of them as I am in and out of bad weather with my job . I live in Maine , I need practical , not `` cute . '' I own other Sorel boots for snowmobiling and those are great , these are constructed too stiff and the zipper sucks ...
 I bought these boots in anticipation for the big snow storm and after 1 block the zippers fall down and my feet start to walk out of the shoe . The shoe becomes pretty useless when the snow falls inside ! Wish I had gotten the lace up ones , going to return these
 I bought these shoes a half size bigger than I normally wear to make sure they were roomy enough . They were still a bit small and the zipper was super flimsy and nearly impossible to zip up or down . I returned the shoes because they were just too much hassle to get on or off . I 'm going to try out the laced version of the same boot ... a whole size bigger than usual .
 EDIT -LRB- read my initial review below -RRB-
 I ordered the Snow Angel 's in grey and LOVED the look and feel of them . So comfortable !!! And it is true what another reviewer stated that you can not tuck your pants in as the boot top hugs your leg . I like that - it helps to keep snow out without cramming pants into the boot ... but ... SIGH ... all this about the zippers slidding down-it 's true-rats !!!! The left zipper stayed up and the right foot zipper just would not hook , so I think it 's a crap shoot , with the odds being against you to actually get both left and right boots zippers to stay up ... and I was n't even walking around-the right boot zipper slipped just sitting down and trying them on . It really is too bad because they are the most comfortable boots I 've tried on since I had an old pair of Columbia 's that I stupidly stored in my attic to boil for two summers and the rubber split on the soles . I may try the Snow Angels out next year , or at least check the reviews to see if the problem has been fixed , but sadly , these babies are going back . If it matters-they did run try to size .
 The boot would not stay zipped and after two hours of snow tubing , I struggled to keep the boot on .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 I thought Josef Seibel made good shoes ? The soles on these shoes have quickly worn through from the inside ! The leather looked frayed and the soles wore through within a few months . It 's a casual style , and I loved the looks so much that I kept them , but I do object to something so shoddy even being sold!Very disappointing !
 I bought these for my husband a couple of months ago and they are good for everything except running . The stitching on the shoe gives a bump on the inside at the front of the arch . Every time he runs over two and a half miles he ends up with big blisters in the arch of both feet , at first he thought he should break them in , but two months later it 's still happening . He has normally shaped feet and has never had this problem before . This is not a manufacturing defect - it 's a design defect . If you do n't do much mileage these are decent shoes , if you plan to run or do a lot of walking in them stay well away .
 This boot came in and it was not at all what I pictured . The shoe runs big and the calf of the boot was tighter than it should be . They do not stay up and constantly slide down . I returned them .
 I agree with the other reviews , they run big . I should have bought 1/2 size smaller . I had to buy some insoles to walk comfortably but even so it feels loose . I like the style but I need to have a shoe that makes me feel safe when I walk .
 The shoes pictured are brown nubuck -LRB- suede -RRB- - just what I wanted . The shoes I received were brown leather - not at all what I wanted . Shoeflake was very prompt in refunding my payment , but I was very disappointed not to get what I ordered , and annoyed by the waste of my time involved in reporting the error , sending back the incorrect merchandise and waiting for a refund .
 I had a similar version of this shoe from about 3 years ago that lasted , surprise , 3 years . I bought a pair of these things as replacements ... I should have went with my initial instinct . The leather is cheap , the rubber leaves marks on floors , the seams are already busting apart ! I walk maybe 1-2 miles a day to work and back and the treads are already wearing thin . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone , what happened to the quality Steve Madden shoe that I used to adore ?

This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase
 Defective product , left shoe too tight and a bit short ! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574 ' s with out a problem .
 I was greatly disappointed in fit , very narrow compared with previous New Balace shoes purchased over the last 25 + years . I will not buy NB again .
 im really so disappointed with this new balance , its really hard to wear it for long hours , my feet hurts , now i dont know what to do with it , i probably just gon na throw it on the trash , i wasted $ 38 , dont be fooled by false reviews , i have the same 574 but i bought it from a local store and its really good , the reason i bought the next one from amazon because it was hard to find the EE size at local stores , i should have a refund for this , i know amazon dont return worn shoes , but i was expecting same comfort as the one i bought from a local store , iam very dissappointed
 Only one color is available for the sale price , and not even in all sizes . It should read `` Sale . $ 39.99 on selected color ... ''
 I loved the shoe itself , i.e. , the quality of its production and the colors , and in general have had great experiences with new balance in the past , but I ordered the wides and they were not really wide at all.If you are not a wide foot like myself , then this will not really apply to you , and you should read another review .
 Hard like a rock box label 8.5 ee But 8.5 gave them to Salvation Army not worth your time looking ordering waiting then you still have to buy again . I will be glad when gov takes control
 left one of pair is warped . . I wish I did n't make this purchase.if you do n't see and touch anything you want to buy , do not buy it .

 Nowhere does it say this shoe has a slip-in insole . I HATE removable insoles so I 'm returning . Also , the box came sealed like new shoes , but one shoe had been laced - rather sloppily leaving twisty creases in the lace - a clear indication this was a return or a store second . Not sure I 'm guaranteed a factory-fresh shoe when I buy thru Amazon , but that 's what I expected . Would n't you ?
 First , these shoes look amazing . The navy suede over the silver really stands out . The N logo on the side even shimmers in the sunlight . So in that regard , they were perfect.As for comfort , they 're as good as any Airwalks or Vans I 've ever worn before . The insole is n't super thick , but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability , unfortunately , does n't seem to be working out for me . One of the shoes , the tighter of the two when I tried them on , has stretched out at least half a size in under a month . It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup . I tried new insoles , that did n't work . I tried the heel lock lacing , and that did n't work . It just seems to be too big for my foot now , a little over a month after the purchase.It 's very frustrating , as I loved the shoes originally , but now my heel is sore from rubbing against the back of the shoe .
 Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap . We love New Balance . But these were made in China !! What 's up New Balance ? We love you cause you 're made in the USA !!!
 these shoes hurt my feet a lot , i thought with the price i put in them they 'd be comfortable . they do look good , like in picture , but they are just not feet-friendly , though i have thin feet .
 This shoes is simple and classic , but it 's way too narrow . I am usually a size 4.5 or 5M and I ordered the 4.5 W knowing that my feet could use wide shoes , but when i got it , the length fits perfectly , but it 's very narrow . I ca n't imagine how the normal width would be if the Wide is so narrow . Unfortunately , I had to return them . they do look pretty tho .

 These shoes do not have the moving air pocket that the old classic DMX has . I would not reccomend them
 Although Amazon.com lived up to its reputation for good service , I was disappointed that my first pair of work boots had steel toes when I had ordered plain toes . Wearing steel toed boots is like putting a soup can on your foot ! I contacted Amazon and was immediately emailed a UPS return label . The second pair arrived a few days later and also had steel toes ! Amazon reacted by issuing a UPS pickup label and also by giving me credit , assuming that if another pair would be shipped , they too , would have steel toes . I really ca n't say anything about Western Chief boots , because I never was able to try them ; however , Amazon handled the situation very well .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 Unfortunately I do n't like this bag . It reminds me of a bag for a bowling ball - nice large size but a little too rounded/domed at the top . Good quality and the shipping was perfect but personally not what I expected .

 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .
 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .
 I wasnt too fond of these boots as the heel seemed a bit too short for the curve of the arch . I ended up selling them in a yard sale for about 8 bucks
 I purchased these for my son to use when fishing . They fit fine and look fine . They are listed as waterproof , but they started leaking the second time he wore them .
 My boots came with insoles that were so thin and flimsy they did n't stay in place when putting the boots on or taking them off , making for uncomfortable folds under my feet . Worse , I bought them in the spring , and by halfway through winter the seams on the backs had split at the ankle , letting water and cold air in.On my next pair of wellies , I 'll spend more and hope for better results .
 I ordeded this boot in a size 14 . the plastic packaging the boots came in stated a size 14 on a sticker and a size 10 printed on the plastic . The attached tag on the boot stated a size 14 but on the bottom of the boot was stamped size 10 . Turns out the boots were a size 10 -LRB- too small -RRB- and had to be returned .
 I was looking for a cheap pair of waterproof boots that I could wear on a boat . These seemed good ; only problem was they were WAY too big . I wear a size 10 , ordered a size 10 , but they were really more like a size 14 . I tried stuffing the toes with cotton , but ended up returning them .
 I 've had these boots for about 2 years or so now . No hard usage just walking in a field with the dog . They have begun cracking and splitting , both boots , around the side seams and are leaking . I 've patched the splits with bicycle tube patches and that works but the boots keep splitting and soon the boot will be one big tire patch . I think 2 years is too short a life . My original review was favorable until this began to happen .
 Was about 1 size too large . The rust color on the side runs into the black in one spot . They were expensive for such a cheaply made boot . They looked nicer in the picture than they do in reality . Buy a cheap work boot instead . I am keeping them just because they are too expensive to ship back . I will have to wear them with two pairs of socks . I should have ordered from Zappos with free retruns .
 I wore these boots for about 6 weeks before the lower rust colored sole separated from the black upper and they began to leak . Western Chief gave me no support citing funky and rigid customer service policies . Fortunately , Amazon gave me my money back . If you like wet feet , these are for you .
 These boots are excellent for : - Bengals fans - Those looking to make a fashion statement at the promBut if you are looking for waterproof boots - look elsewhere . First time they were used , walking in 2 - 3 inches of water , they let water in through the soles and got my socks wet.Move along , nothing to see here ...

 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .

 the shoes were great for about 10 days than started falling apart.They still look good on the outside but not holding together on the inside . I 'm not fat nor do I have swety feet
 I recently bought a pair of romeos for my self with the white crape sole as pictured ! It took 4 days to even get the item in the mail ! I bought them on the 18th of Feb it is now the 28th of Feb so it took 10 days to get shipped here to Idaho !! Then I opened the box and its the wrong ones what the hell ??????? I have had the crape sole romeos before and I love them ! These things I got today are junk ! Well to say the least im not happy with the service or product !!

 Nice quality material however do not purchase if you intend on wearing work boots as you will never get them on or off , even if you go 3-4 sizes too large

 I love clarks shoes but this one does not fit clarks usual comfort shoes . The length is okie . But the leather really hurts your feet . I tried to walk on it for 20 minutes and my feet could n't bear the pain it causes . I would n't recommend this shoe .
 I have been addicted to Clark 's shoes from my first pair ; however , this pair does not show clearly that it is suede and leather - and it does not have the good fit of other Clark 's . The length is correct but the upper outsides seem to almost flare out -LRB- does not have a close fit -RRB- - and the top leather seems to show an inside color -LRB- almost whiteish -RRB- of the leather . I would not have bought this shoe had I been in a store and tried it on.Mayetta Wilson212 W SunsetNashville , AR 71952
 The boots dig into the heel of the foot . The leather is very stiff and the boots are not very comfortable.NOT RECOMMENDED

 Love the way this boot looks , but the calf part of the boot is super wide and the fit was n't good at all . Too much room in the calf area . Do n't recommend ordering cowboy boots online . You need to go to a store and try them on.I sent them back .
 The fit was terrible . I returned this item a month ago , and have yet to be credited . Based on that , I do n't plan on purchasing anything else from this company .

 They are wonderful looking , but have huge wide heels . I felt like i was wearing flip flops ... Worst part i had to pay to send them back ! In this economy thats a definite OUCH !!!
 I bought these shoes because I loved the color and I enjoy Reebok clothing . These are awful shoes ! Playing basketball is literally impossible . These shoes also dig into your feet , and they hurt after awhile .
 Left shoe middle strap shorter than right shoe . Too bad , beautiful otherwise . Just ca n't wear . Still waiting for replacement .
 I have three other pair of easy spirits and I live in them so I ordered this pair on line since I am well aware of this product.The shoes were a little shorter than my others and the patent strip on the top of the right foot cut into my foot and I was miserable . Very disappointed .
 I presently have a white mesh Travel Time Mule in a size 8 narrow that I wore all last summer . I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the same shoe this past fall again but in a black suede in a size 8 narrow . Both pairs of shoes fit perfectly . Now today I received my Travel Time white leather mule in a size 8 narrow and it is much much too wide . I am disappointed that Easy Spirit has made so much of a change in their narrow width shoes . I will not purchase this Travel Time shoe again
 The shoe I ordered was navy and the shoe is black and the lining is blue ! The shoe is so wide it wants to slip . I am very disappointed and will return .
 i have 2 pairs of the same shoe in blue and beige . This one fit wide and was sloppy on my foot
 I visited my sister and tried her Traveltime and loved how comfortable they were . She had a size 6 and they fit me perfectly . I order a different color and model , same size 6 and to my surprise they were 1 size too big . I had to pay $ 12 to ship them back . If I had known about sizing issue I would have ordered from zappos instead and get my free returns until I find ones that fit . I wo n't buy from Shoemall again unless they offer free return .
 Love everything about the shoe , except it feels that it is composed of somewhat inferior materials . Not as comfortable as I thought . I 've had better comfort with LL Bean mules.The color and design is appealing , but comfort level has a way to go .
 This is a nice looking shoe but after awhile , about an hour , my feet start to hurt . I thought from the others reviews that this would be an excellent comfortable shoe but not so for me .
 I really do not understand all the hype for these shoes . I guess to scuff around in they are ok but their almost flat contour has very minimal arch support . They also do nothing to correct common issues with arch and heel alignment which then allows the ankle to cant inward over time . SO not worth $ 70 and marginal even at the sale prices.I do n't care how many colors and textures you tart them up with , they are still the same kind of thing my GrandDad AND my Dad wore around the house . UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYIt is n't easy but I have found other brands with similar slips ons which have a much better fit , more arch and inner heel support , and much nicer styling ... . especially those with the bungee lace ups which give enough to snug up to your foot with or without socks . AND as to pricing , more reasonable than these.The one pair I did buy , -LRB- because many shoes can feel great at first -RRB- now only see occasional use in the yard when I pull weeds .
 The shoe itself is awesome . I own several pairs and so does my mother . As my mother is such a fan I decided to get her 2 additional pairs in other colors for Mother 's Day . The shoes arrived just fine , but my mother did not care for the colors.In all of my years -LRB- and family 's -RRB- of buying on Amazon I have never returned anything . When I called the merchant who filled the order , -LSB- ... -RSB- , to ask about the best procedures for returning I was very shocked by the representatives manner . When I was asking instructions on the best way to send the shoes back she was very rude . As I have n't had to send anything back before that I 've purchased on Amazon I also asked about how the $ would be refunded ... through the merchant or Amazon etc. . The -LSB- ... -RSB- rep sighed and groaned when I asked this question , and if I should insure the shoes etc. . I suppose I could have just caught the rep on a bad day , but because of this lack of professionalism I 'm very worried about my actual refund being given -LRB- I will update when this occurs -RRB- . Needless to say because of this interaction I will NEVER buy anything where -LSB- ... -RSB- is the merchant . You will be fine if the shoes are ok , but heaven help you if you have to interact with customer service .
 The description never told the height of the front of the shoe - just the heel . All other easy spirit shoes say ` flat ' . The description said 1 1/4 heel and nothing about the font of the shoe and it did n't say flat . THEY ARE FLAT . I sent them back . I wish Easy Spirit would remake the Travel Time High shoes . They are the best for me .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I sent the first pair back as they were too small even though I bought a half size bigger as many of the reviews suggested . I received the second pair and the left one fit fine , but the right one was still too small . I am sending them back , so I ca n't really give a review . My husband has a pair of Keen 's and loves them , though . I may try to purchase a pair in the store where I can try them on first hand .
 It is hard for me to dislike this product , because I didn ' . The problem is they sent me the wrong color and the wrong size ! I did n't return them because they were not returnable . I was just out of luck .
 Just came back from a hiking trip by the river , my keen sandals had zero traction.it was like hiking on ice!Fell on a rock and hit my head ... 4 stitches and brain CT scan thanks to keen non grip , super slippery on rocks that are wet sandals , $ 90 waisted and a big bill from the hospital !
 Dear Keen
 I have no idea how the shoe fits or wears because once I put the shoe -LRB- fulfilled by Footsmart -RRB- into my cart the price doubled .
 Thank you for replacing my first pair of Vensie H2 . Unfortunately thesecond pair also turns my toes black . The fabric lining to toe cup isNOT colorfast . Everytime I wear them they turn my toes black and the black does NOT wash off in the shower . This is a major problem . Carol Wissolik
 When I got the shoes , i loved it . I am not online shoe shopper , so i was taking risk with size and look . Well shoes look simply stunning . In fact next day when i was wearing them , i felt that i got the hottest shoes in town . Well day after that , when i was out with my Gf , i misstepped and accidentally nicked them . When i looked down on the , to my surprise rather then seeing a line or something leathery , i see WHITE material under the covers . In fact it looks like shoes are wrapped in some material , and outside is not leather . Even though it feels and looks like leather , any nick will reveal WHITE base of the shoe . I was very disappointed , because once you nick it , you are done , it looks hideous . The only plus that his shoes have , is , they look HOT , so if you are a person who never scratches shoes , then its for you , the rest of us avoid them like plague .
 I owned the black pair of slip ons of this exact shoe and wanted the matching brown . Looking at the pictures I thought I would be happy with them but when I received them I immediately boxed them back up . The uppers are a very `` veiny '' brown with multiple shades running throughout the shoe . They would be fine for wearing out I guess but not as a casual shoe at the office .
 I ordered this in a size 5 big kids and received a size 5 infant .
 These shoes WRECKED my back , they have such good traction and `` bite '' on the turf it 's like standing in a bucket of dried cement . Your feet need to turn a LITTLE BIT as you run up and throw your disc . All the torque , power and TWIST from your upper body goes straight to your lower back when you release the disc ! It only took me 36 holes to finally determine this , but two weeks of epson salts and ibuprophen later my back STILL hurts ! You want shoes that grip ? Better be careful what you wish for ... these shoes grip TOO much for disc golf ! I might wear them the next time I 'm climbing up Pikes Peak , however ... I 'd hate to slip and injure myself !!!
 No slam on this seller . Do n't pay extra money for this product because the manufacturer will not honor the `` lifetime '' warranty offered as a selling point on all other Rainbow Sandals . Bought the Rainbow Sandals for my husband at a pricey beach store and seriously overpaid , but they fit well and came with a `` lifetime '' warranty . Do n't believe it and do n't bother to pay shipping to have defective shoes sent to the manufacturer . The shoes we returned were two years old and were clearly delaminating and all we got was a gee sorry letter stating if we wanted the defective shoes back we would have to pay for return postage . . The delamination was never mentioned . This product is NOT worth the xtra $ $ . The warranty is bogus !
 I bought these flipflops for my son for Christmas . They are falling apart . Returns are supposed to be easy . I went online to exchange them and could not do so . I have to send them back , wait until they are rec 'd -LRB- approx 2-3 -RRB- to get a refund . My son is in college and walks from his apartment to the college every day . He ca n't go without shoes . VERY frustrating . The downfall of shopping on Amazon I guess and with this store .
 These sandals look nice and appear to be good quality . Sadly they strap on top is sooo tight that I can barely fit my foot into the sandal . Only purchase if you have thin feet .
 I thought I was getting a bargain at $ 26.75 for an $ 89.95 shoe ; however , the shoe was not true to size -LRB- too small -RRB- and very uncomfortable .
 these shoes LOOK nice , but the pair i got were not true to size , kind of ... i bought them for a wedding and did not have time to exchange them -LRB- i wear an 8.5 and was skeptical about switching these for a 9.5 anyhow -RRB- ... the right one fit better than the left , and they were ok when i put them on , but were PAINFUL within a half hour ... i 've never had shoes that felt like they fit but hurt so bad before ...
 Was disappointed in color . Supposed to be black but looks more like brown . Fit well , nonetheless , and so I sent them back and ordered a different style -LRB- Scribble -RRB- in grey . Received them yesterday and these are a keeper .
 I wear a size 10 and these are too big in a 10 . Tried on a 9 and they are to small .
 These shoes are extremely comfortable but they were uglier after I received my package than they had looked online . Everyone of my friends and family that saw it did n't like the look , they were even more appalled how much I had paid for them . I returned the product , there was a 10 % `` restocking fee . '' With the price of these , I would shell out my money for something prettier .
 I have several other pairs of Merrell shoes . This style was not true to the size of the other Merrells I have had . They were too big and I had to return them .
 I have purchased this exact product for at least 10 years for my daughter , as she loves them . For some reason even after returning and trying again , these did not fit . She has NOT lost weight , her foot has not changed . She just kept walking out of the heel but the length was ok . We returned them AND had to pay for shipping again . WeJungle Moc Nubuck Kids by Merrell are very disappointed . A few years ago she told me she felt the quality of them changed for the worse , did n't last as long but she still loved them . NOw it seems she will have to find an alternative . So sad .
 The suede jungle moc shoes are the most comfortable shoes on earth . They are just like walking on clouds . Only problem is I received the wrong shoe and UpFootGear are not helpful at all and have now passed me on to a distributor and are now ignoring me . What a shame for Merrell to have such a poor customer service company representing them and their fantastic shoes .
 I usually love Merrell Jungle mocs however the pair I ordered are too wide , so they are not comfortable . Now I could have sent them back but chose to try to wear them . I remember now that the smoke colored ones fit differently than the brown ones it seems .
 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .
 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .
 Left shoe middle strap shorter than right shoe . Too bad , beautiful otherwise . Just ca n't wear . Still waiting for replacement .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 Look at the picture . I should have known better . I concentrated on price only . BIG MISTAKE . Do n't buy these ugly shoes .
 Left shoe middle strap shorter than right shoe . Too bad , beautiful otherwise . Just ca n't wear . Still waiting for replacement .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 I visited my sister and tried her Traveltime and loved how comfortable they were . She had a size 6 and they fit me perfectly . I order a different color and model , same size 6 and to my surprise they were 1 size too big . I had to pay $ 12 to ship them back . If I had known about sizing issue I would have ordered from zappos instead and get my free returns until I find ones that fit . I wo n't buy from Shoemall again unless they offer free return .
 Love everything about the shoe , except it feels that it is composed of somewhat inferior materials . Not as comfortable as I thought . I 've had better comfort with LL Bean mules.The color and design is appealing , but comfort level has a way to go .
 This is a nice looking shoe but after awhile , about an hour , my feet start to hurt . I thought from the others reviews that this would be an excellent comfortable shoe but not so for me .
 I have three other pair of easy spirits and I live in them so I ordered this pair on line since I am well aware of this product.The shoes were a little shorter than my others and the patent strip on the top of the right foot cut into my foot and I was miserable . Very disappointed .
 I really do not understand all the hype for these shoes . I guess to scuff around in they are ok but their almost flat contour has very minimal arch support . They also do nothing to correct common issues with arch and heel alignment which then allows the ankle to cant inward over time . SO not worth $ 70 and marginal even at the sale prices.I do n't care how many colors and textures you tart them up with , they are still the same kind of thing my GrandDad AND my Dad wore around the house . UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYIt is n't easy but I have found other brands with similar slips ons which have a much better fit , more arch and inner heel support , and much nicer styling ... . especially those with the bungee lace ups which give enough to snug up to your foot with or without socks . AND as to pricing , more reasonable than these.The one pair I did buy , -LRB- because many shoes can feel great at first -RRB- now only see occasional use in the yard when I pull weeds .
 The shoe itself is awesome . I own several pairs and so does my mother . As my mother is such a fan I decided to get her 2 additional pairs in other colors for Mother 's Day . The shoes arrived just fine , but my mother did not care for the colors.In all of my years -LRB- and family 's -RRB- of buying on Amazon I have never returned anything . When I called the merchant who filled the order , -LSB- ... -RSB- , to ask about the best procedures for returning I was very shocked by the representatives manner . When I was asking instructions on the best way to send the shoes back she was very rude . As I have n't had to send anything back before that I 've purchased on Amazon I also asked about how the $ would be refunded ... through the merchant or Amazon etc. . The -LSB- ... -RSB- rep sighed and groaned when I asked this question , and if I should insure the shoes etc. . I suppose I could have just caught the rep on a bad day , but because of this lack of professionalism I 'm very worried about my actual refund being given -LRB- I will update when this occurs -RRB- . Needless to say because of this interaction I will NEVER buy anything where -LSB- ... -RSB- is the merchant . You will be fine if the shoes are ok , but heaven help you if you have to interact with customer service .
 The description never told the height of the front of the shoe - just the heel . All other easy spirit shoes say ` flat ' . The description said 1 1/4 heel and nothing about the font of the shoe and it did n't say flat . THEY ARE FLAT . I sent them back . I wish Easy Spirit would remake the Travel Time High shoes . They are the best for me .
 i have 2 pairs of the same shoe in blue and beige . This one fit wide and was sloppy on my foot
 I presently have a white mesh Travel Time Mule in a size 8 narrow that I wore all last summer . I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the same shoe this past fall again but in a black suede in a size 8 narrow . Both pairs of shoes fit perfectly . Now today I received my Travel Time white leather mule in a size 8 narrow and it is much much too wide . I am disappointed that Easy Spirit has made so much of a change in their narrow width shoes . I will not purchase this Travel Time shoe again
 The shoe I ordered was navy and the shoe is black and the lining is blue ! The shoe is so wide it wants to slip . I am very disappointed and will return .

 For flip flops , these shoes weigh a pound each . Not only that but everyone who has them has the little `` key drawer '' -LRB- hidden in the heal -RRB- slipping out . I returned them , and it was not cheap , since they were so heavy .
 Look at the picture . I should have known better . I concentrated on price only . BIG MISTAKE . Do n't buy these ugly shoes .
 These shoes look really nice , but my foot slipped from side to side in the back so I had to return them . They were not tight enough across the top to hold my heal from slipping to the side .
 I have several pairs of KC shoes , two from this same line . But this one is huge !!! I think it must be a mistake . I was very dissapointed in the sizing discrepancy . I do like this line though , I love the scalloping around the edges and they are comfy . Too bad these ones have to go back .
 My husband has worn Florsheim shoes forever . Could always slip foot into a 8.5 EEE . Not with these shoes ! Ordered these twice believing the 1st pair wear was marked incorrectly . Ordered again ... still too small . Could n't even get foot into shoe . Do n't know what has happened here ... Florsheim is having trouble with quality control or this style/size got inappropriately marked with wrong size . Buyer needs to beware ! Finally gave up and decided not to order this shoe for the 3rd time .
 I ask for shoes 8 3E and the shoes I got are too small I did not know that Flosheim has reduce the size of shoes . I have being buying Florsheim for the last 30 years and it is the first time that an 8 3E is too small .
 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .

 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .
 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .

 Even after letting them open to air for few days.Iam not sure if its just the shoe i bought or all r made that way!Design wise they r good and compact .
 The shoe looks better on the picture than it does on my feet . Did n't like the craftsmanship , for a shoe of this price , the material used at the insole seems cheap and slippery , making the foot slide down , plus the insole is not well glued to the shoe . Also the paper that protected the shoe stuck to the shoe itself .

 Cute , good color , but not the comfort I expect from Naturalizer ; heel slipped but otherwise did seem true to size
 These shoes looked really nice and cute . They did not fit my foot ... but I am a difficult person to fit .
 Cute , good color , but not the comfort I expect from Naturalizer ; heel slipped but otherwise did seem true to size
 the very first time my son wore these for a banquet . They came apart at the bottom . The sole was loose in the heel area . I have never had a problem with anything I got from Amazon before : -LRB-
 This is the first time that I 've had an issue with an Amazon product , and I 've bought plenty from Amazon . This pair of shoes for my son was `` gently used '' . I suspect this was a returned item , but it has definately been worn . Since it did not look too bad , and I did n't have time to return it for another pair , I kept it . I would think that the folks responsible for inspecting returned items would do a better job of checking the merchandise before reselling it .
 I have worn Neil M shoes for years without a problem . After wearing the Amalfi Loafer three times the lacing on the left shoe unraveled . I e-mailed the company without a reply to date .
 Seriously , they sell the same boots at Costco for $ 38.95 . I have owned these and the Costco ones and they are THE SAME -LRB- sheep skin and everything -RRB- . Way overpriced .
 Love the part that they are uggs . Comfy and warm . Do n't waist your time the the &#34; Bomber &#34; look though . I wore them for less than a week and there is really no sign left of the &#34; Bomber &#34; . Bummer for me , because I loved the look .
 When UGG Australia first went mainstream , I bought a couple pair of boots that lasted me a VERY LONG time . I wore the same boots from my freshman year of high school to my freshman year of college . After 5 years , there were no tears , shreds or fading in the shoes . They looked nearly brand new . Well last winter , I wanted to purchase a new pair of UGG boots and decided on these very ones -LRB- Classic Tall in black -RRB- . Almost immediately after putting the boots on , I noticed a decrease in the comfort . The wool lining felt harder , thinner , and cheaper . The entire boot , actually , felt much thinner than the ones purchased 5 years ago.After less than a month of wear , one of the boots ripped at the toe . Mind you , these boots were n't too small on my foot , were never walked in water or snow with , and were waterproofed prior to wearing them outdoors . After returning them for another pair , the new pair also ripped , this time down the side seam.Needless to say , I will never purchase another pair of UGG boots again . for $ 200 , these boots should be high quality and instead are cheaply made . I now wear EMUs , which are much more comfortable and better quality .
 I bought the black pair in tall and loved how plush the sheepskin lining was . I ordered a size down from my normal 9.5 - got a size 8 and it fit in length . The first thing I noticed is that there is not a lot of toe height in the boots - I 'm assuming everyone waits for them to stretch . I wore them around the house , to the store , pretty much everywhere and for 8 hours at a time . They were comfortable in the sense that they were cozy and kept my feet warm but my feet ached from wearing them . Specifically , I 'd wake up the next day with sore heels , feet bottoms , and even sore knees ! Just so you know I normally wear Danskos to work because I stand all day and have a relatively low arch , and I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and 135lbs - not overweight . I wanted to keep these so much that I put a pair of slim arch support/heel comfort inserts in them and they were very pleasant to wear - with the exception of the low toe box area which kept compressing my toes . I ended up returning them as I could n't justify the sore feet/legs . I looked online to see if I was the only that had this experience and found this article that explains some of my aches
 For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you , as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it 's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for , this is not a top end elegant product , it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time , years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it , now it 's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity . Thats my opinion and I 'm stuck with it .
 I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs -LRB- apparently they now are -RRB- , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !
 I bought the black ones and they are horrible , they are NOT sheepskin , they have more of a synthetic feel to them . They are VERY stiff when trying them on . I already have the brown ones -LRB- not bought from Amazon -RRB- so i knew right away that these had to be fake . They are in no way , ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs . The fur was not soft like the ones i have , and they are very uncomfortable . I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before , and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website .
 I did not like the way these uggs fit at all . i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably . they are too tight . i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too . since i unfortunetly do n't have the box anymore i ca n't return or exchange them . these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn , that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange . now i have a pair of $ 180 boots that nobody wants because they do n't fit right !!!!
 When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn . My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real . I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller . For $ 200.00 I expect a fresh product .
 I PURCHASED THE BOOTS , THEY CAME IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS , THE BOX WAS PLAN WITHOUT UGG 'S LOGO ON THE BOX . THE BOX LOOKED LIKE THEY TAPED CARD BOARDTOGETHER . WITHIN THE TAPE WAS A RECEIPT IN CHINESE . THE DAY THEY CAME WAS THE I WAS LEAVING ON HOLIDAY FOR 2 WEEKS -LRB- I PACKED THEM -RRB- . KNOW I 'M ON MY TRIP AND ABOUT 4 DAYS INTO THE TRIP I NOTICED A HOLE IN THE BACK SEEM.MORAL TO THE STORY WATCH WHO IS SELLING THE PRODUCT ... THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER STORES ON THIS SIGHT . THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS IN CHINA . WHO KNOWS WHO THEY ARE EMPLOYING .
 If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free . I felt this was a shady business . It took forever to get the boots and to return them . I have to return again for a refund . I am hoping this is a fast process . I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time . I would never buy from them again .
 The boots arrived on time , When they were opened on our holiday celebration it was noticed that there was a rip on one of the toes . It will cost me 5.95 to return the damaged boots , no thank you . I just wo n't be ordering from them again .
 Unfortunately I am returning them because they slip up and down when I walk . I normally take a size 9 AA shoe . I tried a size 8 -LRB- my daughter 's boots , which had already stretched -RRB- , but they cramped my toes . I really wish they came in half sizes , because with the correct size , they would be as comfortable as wearing my slippers .
 They sell fake Uggs simply put . Do not buy from this seller who knows what other products are not the real deal !!! Only buy Uggs from official Ugg websit or a department store like Dillards or Nordstroms .
 This is sort of a cardboard imitation of an Ugg . Not cozy . I 'm returning it .
 I called and they assured me they were real . I ended up keeping thwm and trying them out . They Said maybe they were different cause the ones I have are from two years ago so they may have slight changes . However , when I wear them with out socks , my feet turned black from the boots .
 I was very disappointed with the quality of these . These were a christmas present for my daughter and only two weeks into wearing them , the sole has ripped away from the boot . I am skeptical as to whether or not these are genuine Ugg product . I am returning them to the vendor in hopes it was just a fluke .
 THESE UGGS ARE NOT REAL , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA !!!!! I bought these boots for my daughter in late October for Christmas . When I got them I opened the box to make sure they were tall in black and a size 8 . I was stupid enough to trust this store thinking they must to a good company to work with since they are on Amazon . I have contacted VIP Fashions via email and they will not respond to my emails and I know for a fact the email was read . People look at the UGG box these boots came in , on the back in the corner it says made in CHINA !!!!!! Real Uggs are not made in CHINA.As soon as Im done leaving this review in going to contact Amazon and get the ball rolling to have the store shut down . I am also going to contact UGG.Look up the information on the UGG site
 I ordered a size 9 regular width and was sent a size 9 wide boot . With international shipping etc. it was a bigger pain to rectify the situation so now I wear boots that I slide around in . Other then that I received them in a timely manor and they are the correct colour .
 Well I received these boots today . Theyare made in China so they are obviously not Uggs.I do n't understand how they 're allowed to sell fake Uggs on here.I wish my return request would be finished so I can ship these back.The only reason this got one star is because zero was n't an option .
 My wife came home with a pair that cost $ 220 . I looked at them and immediately noticed the `` Made In China '' on the tag ! Are you kidding me ! All these years watching women -LRB- and some men ? -RRB- spend all this money on these things and they turn out to be china junk . I was always under the impression they were hand made in Australia . Well they never were . It 's an american company doing what most american companies do ; having crap made in china and selling to foolish fellow americans for exorbitant amounts of their hard earned money . The best part is they have done such a good job marketing that I just walked the office and every single person I asked thought the same thing , a high quality hand made Australian product . Shame on them !!! Boy I bet there have been a lot of pissed off Australians.I have been buying high quality shoes for years as I use to spend 10-14 hour days on my feet , sometime longer . Plus walking 10-20 miles in that time . I worked in law enforcement , as a first responder and search and rescue . Good shoes were important and I can tell you I have never found a pair of china made shoes or boots that were both comfortable and durable . I do wear some china made shoes but only casual , and I would never pay more than $ 100 for any shoe made there , most are not even worth that . Even if I thought it was quality I know the manufacturing cost was way below the retail price.A brief online search found a number of authentic ugg style boots that are actually hand made in Australia with actual Australian sheepskin . The best part is none of them cost any more than their overhyped china made counterparts , some less . And some like the EMU 's are readily available right here in the USA . I got my wife a pair and she loves them.I pay over $ 200 for fine hand crafted USA made boots like Danner 's . But these thing will last for many , many years and once broken in become part of your body . I can wear them hard for five + years and send them to Danner to be reconditioned . They come back looking like new with new laces , liners , etc. . The only difference is they are still my old broken-in super comfortable , durable boot . I only hope we do n't lose the last few of our great shoe makers here .
 I purchased these for Christmas for my daughter . Looked great and were packaged authentically . My daughter wore them for an hour and was very skeptical of the authenticity of the boots . We shipped them back . But I will say Amazon.com took care of the return with 100 % satisfaction . Could have fooled me but not the daughter !
 -LSB- ... -RSB- Concerns about qualityAccording to the Australian Sheepskin Association , `` Consumers should beware of fake ugg boots . The dictionary definition of an ` ugg boot ' is ' a sheepskin boot with the wool on the inside ' . An ugg boot must be made of real sheepskin . Due to the high cost of genuine sheepskin , one of the first warning bells will be a so called ` ugg boot ' advertised at a very cheap price . ... Sheepskin is a natural product which breathes , absorbs moisture and provides a warmth and comfort superior to any synthetics . -LRB- Most synthetics become very smelly with wear -RRB- . '' -LSB- 25 -RSB- Independent testing by Channel 7 in Perth , Western Australia ranked one brand of Australian synthetic ugg boots made in China , Aussie Sheep and Wool Products , best in durability ; Deckers Ugg boots , which are also made in China and were priced at over twice that of the other brands tested , were the highest quality boots made of genuine sheepskin ; and all the Australian made sheepskin boots were ranked behind Deckers . -LSB- 26 -RSB- The Emu Ridge , Skiniks and Mortels brands `` fared badly for quality '' . -LSB- 26 -RSB- -LSB- edit -RSB- DesignFashion ugg bootsUgg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached . The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside . Ugg boots often have a synthetic sole , commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate -LRB- or EVA -RRB- -LSB- citation needed -RSB- and the stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot . The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives thermostatic properties to the boots
 I ordered a 9 and they sent an 8 . I had to ship them back . They were a gift for my granddaughters 16th birthday and she was very upset that her most wanted gift was wrong . Not happy at all . Wo n't order from them again
 All black furs on my white socks and calf when I took off . The authorized seller said it happen with all UGG black boots when you wear white socks . What 's happening ? This is UGG boots , not the payless shoes !!!
 These boots were a gift for my daughter and they arrived with a tear along the seam of the shoe .
 UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear . Why are they popular ? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not . If she does , its an automatic NO . Uggs are ugly , cheap , and really just gross . Dont waste your $ . Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs .
 I purchased these boots around Christmas . I am uneasy about ordering items not from the official site especially UGGS because of the fake ones being passed around . I feel the UGGS I received from this retailer were fake . The tage was not the same as the official UGGS because I compared them . The boot itself quality was terrible they did not fit and anyone knows UGGS can confirm you have to order a size smaller otherwise your foot will swim in them . The UGGS I ordered which were a size small just like my other pairs were to small and tight . The quality was poor comparible to fake ones from that of Target . The inside of the boots were not thick and soft like authentic UGGs they were rough and thin . My mother took one look and said `` no way are they authentic just look at your other pairs . '' She is absouletly 100 % correct . So , the reasons for me believing they are fake are the tag is different , there is no sticker on the box , the outside and inside quality are very poor , they are very small I would need a size 9 instead of an 8 and all my others are size 8 and fit perfectly , and the card UGGs provide to prove authenticity were not in the box and the shiny UGG sticker was not on the box also the UGGs box from the UGGs website is smaller then this retailer 's . I 'm not sure if the retailer is aware of this but unfortunately I will never purchase from them again . There is no comparing the items . I do n't like giving negative reviews because I 've always been very satisfied with Amazon.com and their retailer 's but now I am going to think twice and just stick with official sites or go directly to the store .
 I had to return these boots -LRB- at my expense ! -RRB- because they were irregular ; one boot was good size and quality but the other one was damaged and it did not fit right , it was actually very loose . It felt almost like one shoe was regular fit and the other one was wide fit . . do n't know why did that happened but you could tell something was wrong with the one boot just by looking at it ; so I do n't understand why the seller ship it to me ... ny way I got my money back , but I had to follow up with the return ; even called the seller to let them know that the boots had been delivered at their store ; and of course the shipping for the return was on me !!! So I paid bit over $ 10.00 just to look at some damaged boots !!!
 My daughter has been asking for these for ages . Now that she is full grown I purchased her a pair for Christmas . She followed all of the directions and used UGG products to pretreat them . A small hole appeared after only 3 weeks and it has turned into a large hole after 6 . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT . I have had UGG wannabes that have lasted over 2 years with no problems .
 UGGs arrived and at first glance appeared to be two different sizes . Upon inspection they were clearly fakes . Fake sheep lining and mistagged . Visibly a 1/2 &#34; difference in the size between left and right boot . I Contacted amazon customer service who sent me a return shipping label . Thanks to amazon customer service ... but the vendor should be stricken from amazon for selling FAKE products . Really ruined my Christmas . DO not buy from this vendor . I worry many people who have already purchased have been fooled by this product . I am Going to UGG.com and following link to report this vendor for consumer privacy . For what they cost you would not expect fakes . For what it 's worth the box seems real and the knockoffs will fool your friends .
 I live in a very cold climate so I decided to spend some of my Christmas money this year and get the real thing . I also bought spray protector because we get a lot of snow here . These are beautiful ! I am wearing them for the first time today and they are so cozy . Do buy a half size or even full size smaller as they do stretch out -LRB- they are suede , afterall -RRB- and I recommend the spray protector even if you do n't get snow . It did n't change the color of my Sand boots at all and it will protect them from any kind of external moisture . That only makes sense when you are talking close to a two-hundred dollar investment.UPDATE
 I must say I was enjoying these UGGs for about 1 month after purchasing them with no problems . Then the other day they RIPPED while I was simply just pulling them on . If the fabric was REAL suede , this should not have happened . Therefore , I believe they are fake . Good job guys , you fooled me . But I was forced to file a claim on you . I will not be buying from this seller again . I do n't think I will be buying expensive boots on Amazon again . Too many fakes out there . Very convincing though .
 Why were there 2 white labels in the boots saying Made in China.I thought they were Australian boots.Is this a scam ??
 First time my daughter wore these boots she walked through a wet lawn and discovered the brown dye bled onto her white socks and through to her toes !!! The boots never dried back to their natural color , insted , the dark stain stayed - looking like the boots are still wet after days . Do n't really know what happened . Amazon Prime was great and accepted the return with no problem . Amazon is an authorized dealer for UGG so I would n't think we got a fake.I am now rather concerned about the quality of UGG products - for the price I would n't expect what happened ...
 I have purchased UGG boots before and have never had a problem . I purchased these through this vendor as a Christmas present for my daughter . The second time she wore them the seam ripped as she was putting them on , leaving me to wonder ifindeed they are authentic UGGS .
 This is the wrong color , the wrong fit , the label is the wrong color and the lining is synthetic materialwith a plastic feel . The Amazon service was great the product shipped from the retailer is disgraceful.It 's going back right now and I 'll buy a pair from the store so I know what i 'M GETTING.I bought a second pair on Amazon being shipped from a different seller . I hope it 's authentic . Very Disapointed !
 Uggs are not what we expected . Appearded to be fakes . Very cheap feel and look as compared to my first pair which were purchased three years ago . Will not buy from this site again . Will try the actual Uggs website .
 if you are looking for the authentic UGG boots . These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles . If you purchase these for $ 179 , you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality . If you do purchase these , the size runs fine , so keep to your same true shoe size , you can wear them without socks and be very warm , just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house ; my feet do n't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks ; I have worn them since mid December . They are light and not heavy . They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them .
 Careful when buying these boots . They may look like they are built for winter weather , but most are only built for cold , NOT FOR WET . Whether it 's snow , or slush , or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles . Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware .
 I have had Uggs before and loved them . The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs . However , these black uggs are a big disappointment . The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty . Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone . I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown . My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there 's never bled the black color onto their feet . Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would 've returned them .
 I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .
 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .
 those are a good shoes , but the delivery provide service is the worst , i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day , i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail , bad deal to me !
 In spite of reading a review from another purchaser about these shoes squeeking , I bought them anyway and continually regret it . They squeek loudly and continually ; it is embarrasing to walk in a quiet place . I thought that if there were a squeek , it would be minimal and livable , however it is NOT . They are essentially unwearable in public . They are cute , they are comfortable , and I got them on sale , but i still feel I wasted my money . Hope you do n't make the same mistake . I 'd be curious if someone else bought them and they did not squeek .
 Bough a 2nd pair , thought maybe the first pair was defective . Seems to be a design flaw , though . The sole squeaks loudly with every step . Wast of hard earned money . Big disappointment , they are comfortable , too !

 these are badly made shoes , i have owned them for about 2 weeks now and they are already falling apart . the material they are made of rips really easily , do not buy !
 The shoe looks better than in the photograph , but the quality is really bad . It got torn in just 3 months .
 I have the exact same feelings as William Hunicke in his review . I also do not have knee problems , but after running with these even for short distances now , my knees hurt . I have had them for probably a year now and I just ca n't take it anymore . I 'm on here to buy a new pair of shoes.I actually think they may have had a bad long term effect on my knees . Seriously , look elsewhere . They might look cool , but that is the only thing they have going for them .
 4 miles onto the first run in these shoes I developed a fore-leg tendon injury that took 4 months to heal . I have been using other running shoe brands for years with no problems.I realize it may just be my specific build/running mechanics , but hey , I will not touch these shoes with a 10-foot pole ever again-Tom
 These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes . The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact . I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them . I returned them and plan to try something else .
 I bought these for a halloween costume , and even though I selected standard shipping , the cost did n't show up on the balance until I got the confirmation and the order had gone through -- shipping cost as much as the shoes I thought I was getting at a discount!Also , though I used the conversion chart to get a women 's size , they ended up being too small .
 The Ignited Run has been my first experimentation with Reebok running shoes within the past 6 years . While the Ignited Run sneakers feature a snazzy `` clear '' material on the outboard portion of each heel , they do n't have any gimmicks like bubbles filled with inert gas or `` shock absorber '' pods on the heel . They feature a nylon/cordura loop on each heel and have some synthetic suede leather on the toes which tend to get dirty quite easily . The tread material is extremely stiff and hard , making it unsuitable for running on tarmac , ESPECIALLY wet tarmac . The tread pattern is of a criss-cross waffle , but is nowhere as good as the Nike Waffle/Zoom competition racing shoes . The Ignited Run is also extremely heavy and the materials are poorly constructed . The loop on each heel is already pulling apart at the stitches . In addition , the lack of a cinch loop on the tongue allows the tongue to shift all about during storage . I tend to wrap my laces under the lacing to prevent flapping and loosening , but I have to re-adjust the tongue before wearing the sneakers each time.Pros : - Snazzy exterior design.-Comfortable for walking , driving , and running on soft dry surfaces.-Great cushioning , thick outer layer material.-No gimmicks to fail.Cons : - Extremely hard tread compound with poor tread design . It `` clacks '' when running on cold or wet surfaces that are hard , like wet tarmac . It hurts my feet after running 1 mile.-Extremely poor traction on wet surfaces . I 've almost slipped on wet tarmac in a few instances.-Lack of cinch loop on tongue.-Cheap stitching for loops on each heel . Do not use them to facilitate the ingress of your feet into the shoes , they will rip apart after awhile.-Lack of reflective material . I only found a few spots that had reflective material so I would n't use these at night.Overall , I do n't have any issues wearing these for casual activities , work , or driving . They fall extremely short when used as running sneakers though and since they were advertised for this purpose , I will have to give them only 2 out of 5 stars .
 When will there be smaller sizes of these shoes available ? i need 8.5 :-LRB- i 've been looking for them all over and there 's no sizes :-LRB- somebody can please help me telling me where can i get these shoes but 8.5 size ?? i will apreciate it very much , thx = -RRB-
 Description correction
 First I would like to say that the seller is great the boots came in on time ... now to the boots . They look great and all that stuff and the side zipper is great for convinience especially if you work long hours . What I hate about the boot is that it is too big and feels loose -LRB- can barely run with the boots -RRB- , I ordered size 8.5 M and the damn shoe feels like it is a 9 or a 8.5 -LRB- wide -RRB- , I thought I was going crazy so I went and put on my 8.5 Timberland boots on and they fit perfectly , but these boots here not at all . I have worn them for a few days since I got them and I have stopped wearing them since , due to being uncomfortable . The other thing about the boots I hate is that it is `` pleather '' - meaning it is not real leather , so you already know it will be wearing out pretty soon compared to the leather shoes and this shoes are not polishable like the real leather boots , the last thing I hate about the boots is that THEY ARE NOT BREATHABLE AT ALL feet feel sweaty the fisrt day you buy them . In conclusion to this review do n't bother ordering this boots and this is from a genuine pig that has been through the experiment -LRB- I would go with the 5.11 Speed 8 boots -RRB- Men 's 5.11 Tactical 8 '' Speed Boots
 Please do not order shoes on line , It looks beautiful in pictures but I am very disappointed when I received the order .
 Very cute pump ... unless you look closely at the poor workmanship . Looks like they did n't have enough of the material they used as a `` liner '' on the sides of the shoes and tried to stretch it . Also , where the heel meets the shoe on one of mine , there 's a piece of plastic in there I ca n't get out . This is the second try for these shoes because I had ordered a half-size too large on the first try , and apparently I did n't inspect those closely enough after realizing they were too big . The fit is still `` off . '' They run WIDE . They are NOT even real leather . I ca n't believe Dereon/Beyonce would have her name on these AND sell them at this price ! You 'll find better quality shoes virtually ANYWHERE ; try Target or Payless for a fraction of the price . If you want style similar to this , pay the same or a little more and buy Baby Phat brand . These are going back . I am unbelievably disappointed !
 Three weeks ago I requested to return the shoe and get a size larger . No response has been received . I requested express deliver , and they did n't arrive on time . Looks like I just purchased $ 40 shoes that ca n't be worn . Really poor customer service .
 I was having difficulties with the sizing for this shoe , so I called Amazon.com customer service . The lady was very polite , but could not locate the item . After giving her assistance , she was able to locate the shoe and told me that they were sold out and it could not be ordered.I had the item in my cart so I just clicked to buy it anyway . Either I got it or I did n't . No harm done.It was shipped that day . I will receive it in the mail today.The product itself is great . I have a pair of brown ones ... had them for years and still going strong . And I am not a Dr. Marten 's fan at all.But I do n't think customer service means the customer provides the service to the company ... and I was given incorrect information regarding these shoes being in stock .
 this shoes are as rock , very very hard , uncomfortable.if you want rocks in yours shoes , this shoes can bring.my feet were in pain after wearing them for one day
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .

 The left shoe was fine . But , the right one 's insole was not flat that I have to return it.The seller made me to pay $ 7 to sipping them back.I would say I like the shoes but the product they are selling may have a high defective percentage .
 I was having difficulties with the sizing for this shoe , so I called Amazon.com customer service . The lady was very polite , but could not locate the item . After giving her assistance , she was able to locate the shoe and told me that they were sold out and it could not be ordered.I had the item in my cart so I just clicked to buy it anyway . Either I got it or I did n't . No harm done.It was shipped that day . I will receive it in the mail today.The product itself is great . I have a pair of brown ones ... had them for years and still going strong . And I am not a Dr. Marten 's fan at all.But I do n't think customer service means the customer provides the service to the company ... and I was given incorrect information regarding these shoes being in stock .

 Bingo ! Took my Eccos out for winter wear only to find big chunks of the sole falling off as other reviewers have noted . Musta been a bad batch of gum ... Worn maybe two dozen times . Eccos are usually winners . Ah , so . Their workers in the Peruvian jungle messed up ...
 I have 4 other pairs of Ecco shoes which are great shoes . I bought these about 3 months ago . I have worn these about 12 times . Maybe twent-five miles , and the soles are disintegrating . They might last me three months if I do not wear them.What a disapointment . I 'll look for a different brand .
 Ecco makes a fine and well fitted upper leather on its shoes but has a chronic problem getting its soles not to disintegrate . I have a pair of Ecco shoes and one day they started to get sticky on the bottom the the sole just started to fall apart in large peices . Expensive , nice looking , well fitting junk .
 I bought a pair of these shoes from The Walking Company -LRB- $ 156 -RRB- as I was headed to Paris where you walk constantly . I have plantar fasciitis in my left foot and the clerk brought these out in response . I tried them on and walked around a little . They were very comfortable . He also brought out the Walking Company insert -LRB- $ 65 -RRB- which I swapped out for the Ecco liner . The shoes were even more comfortable . I had asked for a size 42 because the next size would have been 9 1/2 , which is ordinarily too big for my size 8 1/2 feet.I wore these shoes for the next couple of days but almost immediately they were pressing against the top-most part of my left foot -LRB- not the instep , above the big toe -RRB- and causing pain . I took the shoes off and when I went back to them , the pressure was less . But it caused pain now in a different area . Clearly these would not do for long walks in a city!I took them to Paris but after wearing them once , I had to wear different shoes -LRB- semi-dress Dockers with Pro-Tech semi-elastic arch supports -RRB- for the rest of my 7-day vacation.I will update this review as I break the shoes in more . But I suspect the shoes are too small , even though , like I said , they were extremely comfortable in the store . Very disappointing overall considering the considerable cost of these shoes .
 I bought a pair of Eccos every year for many years , until the sole of my Seawalkers fell apart in a sticky goopy mess . Ecco said since it was over a year they could n't do anything for me . I have n't bought any Ecco 's since . It 's a crying shame because they were the best thing I could find . It 's very weird to have your soles turn into a slippery sticky mess.After a couple years , and trying a couple other hiking boot brands , I thought I 'd give Ecco another try , but the size I used to wear was too big for me by a lot , and the next size down was too small . The ding dong at the store said my feet got smaller -LRB- that does n't even make sense -RRB- . So I took 3 old pairs into the store and the new shoe of the same size and same model -LRB- Track II -RRB- was obviously bigger than the old shoes I brought in , by nearly half an inch.Ecco shoes are not exactly cheap . I wonder why the quality control is not working . It 's not like they are $ 15 shoes from Kmart or Walmart , that you kind of wonder how they can even afford to make them.I used to think Ecco was terrific , but with the soles disintegrating , and the sizing inconsistencies , I wonder what has gone wrong at Ecco Headquarters . My Seawalkers disintegrated a few years ago , but searching the internet , it still seems like a problem.I 'm still hoping for signs the company turns around . I loved my Eccos .
 The problem with ECCO shoes is the sole . They just do n't last more than two years and when they fail it is a total failure . I have several pairs and each has been re-soled at a cost of $ 70 . They are great looking comfortable shoes , but plan on the re-soling cost within a couple years .
 During the past 12 years , I have purchased six pair of Seawalker shoes . This is the first pair that have not fit perfectly . They bind across the metatarsal-phalangeal articulation . I am able to wear them only several hours at a time . I am using shoe stretchers with limited success . The first ECCO shoes that I purchased were made in Denmark . Since then they have been made in Portugal , Serbia , China , Serbia . It seemed that the products were identical until now . I have been so pleased with prior Seawalkers , that it is difficult for me to complain about these .
 Comfortable ? Certainly.Stylish ? UndoubtedlyExpensive ? For me , any shoe over 125 bucks qualifies as spendy.Value ? No way!ECCO Men 's Fusion Tie Casual Walking ShoeECCO Men 's Track II Low Gore-Tex OxfordThese shoes have everything going for them EXCEPT build quality . Buying Ecco Shoes is like buying a set of tires for your car which only last for a couple of thousand miles.I 've owned two pair of Ecco shoes -LRB- spaced out by 5 years ! -RRB- and I 've gotten burned each time . They do not stay together . The soles basically start coming apart with the first step you take in them . Pieces of it separate from the sole , which is intentionally soft and pliable for comfort . I never got more than 6 months with either pair of shoes.As I said , they have everything down pat * except * creating a shoe which lasts . If they ca n't fix a problem in five years , it 's doubtful they every will . Choose another brand and spare yourself the grief .
 I was so excited about my purchase until I got the product . The picture of the shoe does n't match the color of the real product . It is like got switched . I already changed the product once , so I did n't want to do it twice . Next time , I will suggest buying the product in a store where you can see what you are buying ...

 Are these shoes in made in China ? Or are any of the parts to put the shoes together made in CHINA ? I hear these shoes are not like the old and last only about 2 years compared to 10 years pre-china manufacture - if so then , does that mean little children are making these products ? Also does that mean Denmark has lowered their standards to selling the name base on a good product history , then switching up on the consumer for cheaper quality at the same price ... oh ... hell no !
 I own a couple of pair of Ecco shoes . The Seawalker Tie pair are about 4 years old and have spent most of the time sitting in my closet . I estimate that I 've worn the shoes about 2 or 3 times a month on average . I really like the way they feel , good support for walking.Last week , I selected these shoes to wear on a shopping trip to the mall . During the trip I felt something different on the bottom of the shoes and discovered that I had a large hole in the bottom of both shoes . After returning home , removing the shoes and inspecting them , I discovered large cracks in the soles , from heal to toe , with a large section of missing sole in middle of both shoes.I took pictures to show that the tops of the shoes still look good but the soles contain major deterioration . But amazon.com does not allow the posting of pictures - - just video ?? Bottom line - I have really liked these shoes . And , I know every manufacturing company experiences an occasional quality problem , but the durability problems with the soles of the Ecco Men 's Seawalker Tie was not what I expected from Ecco , even after 4 years .
 I 've owned Ecco shoes for years . I was always impressed by how well they were assembled and how long they lasted . This pair is different . The insole has come loose and the stitching is failing . I will think twice before considering this brand again . For the price I expect top quality , not cheapo stuff .
 Not as advertised
 I received these shoes today and I was ecstatic since shipping took awhile . When I opened it , the box said size 40 , the correct size that I ordered . I took a shoe out , it was new and size 40 which is perfect . However , I took the other shoe out , it was size 45 and obviously USED . I am not going to wear one foot with the correct size and the other foot 5 sizes larger ...
 Had a pair of these shoes 3 years and all of a sudden the soles started chunking and literally melting . Wrote to ECCO and got 0 -LRB- ZERO -RRB- response , never again , for the money , I 'll try another brand . Do a search for `` melting ecco shoes '' LOTS of problems ! -LSB- ... -RSB- ECCO Internet Inc. 16 Delta DrLondonderry , NH 03053
 I have three pairs of Ecco Seawalkers and I have to say that the uppers seem to last forever but the soles on my brown pair have fallen apart and chunks of sole are missing and it is a real shame because the top part of the shoe is in great condition . I still have them because it seems to be a waste to pitch them in the trash but who has time to get their shoes resoled . Also , the shoes are comfortable and look nice but do n't really provide all that much support . Probably not the best walking shoe .
 I used to wear these shoes daily . Within 1 year , the stichting along the top of the toe came unraveled on one shoe such that I could see my sock while wearing the shoe . The soft leather at the back of the shoe along the achilles tendon became ripped up on both shoes with less than one year of wear . These are extremely comfortable shoes , but do n't expect them to last . $ 150 is way too much money to spend on a shoe that falls apart in less than a year .
 A few years ago I bought a pair of ECCO shoes similar to this one . They had rubber-like soles with an embedded oval containing the word ECCO . I wore them on a two-week trip around the eastern Mediterranean , and when I got home I found that the oval on both shoes had disappeared , leaving a big oval-shaped hole . The local shoe repairman said he could not resole ECCO shoes , so I sent it to the recommended repair depot , which resoled them with Vibram soles . I hardly ever wore them until this year on a two-week trip to Russia . Halfway through the trip , the sole partially separated from the shoe . I repaired it with duct tape to get through the rest of the trip.Given the problems I 've had , I do n't understand why ECCO shoes are so highly rated ; from now on I will buy only Merrell shoes .
 If you are considering buying a pair of ECCO shoes I suggest you do some research first and read some of the reviews posted on the web . I personally have owned several pairs of ECCO shoes which I paid well over $ 100 for them , so they were not cheap shoes . After only very little use the soles of the shoes started coming apart in large chunks , making the shoes unusable . The first time it happened , ECCO replaced the shoes without problems . The second time it happened -LRB- with a different style ECCO shoe -RRB- I contacted them and was told that the shoe was `` out of warranty '' and would not be repaired or replaced . The shoes were like new except for the soles that were coming apart in chunks . When I did some checking on the web I found many others with the same issue , and apparently ECCO knew about this problem as far back as 2002 but continued to produce and sell these shoes without fixing the problem . I would encourage you to avoid buying shoes made by this company as they are without integrity . When you pay $ 100 - $ 200 for a pair of shoes the soles should not disintegrate with very little use ! I will be buying many more pairs of shoes for myself and my family in the coming years , but I will never buy ECCO shoes again !
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 These were tight for my normal size 6 . Otherwise , super soft & otherwise would have been good .
 I bought these shoes to see if they would help ease some back pain at work . No luck yet . I also find the scuffed up toes disappointing . The literature on these shoes certainly falls into the too good to be true category for me.Moreover , I was surprised by all the packaging for these things . Two boxes , paper and canvas bags for each of them certainly seems excessive for a shoe claiming to be earth friendly . I prefer my Merrells .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 It was said speedo BABY stretch slide . So I was refering the size to the INFANT/TODDLER size . i was suspicious because when i place add to cart the product item was changed to speedo YOUTH stretch slide . I tried to double check other colors and it does the same thing . so i thought it is just an error in the database.The item arrived yesterday . The box is ruined . The shoes has a black spot in the center of it . and the size is completely WRONG ! It is a big size sandal . It only said S/M/L . only recently after i purchase it , amazon update it with more information about the size.I am not dissappointed with the product as i dont know how it performs if it fits my daughter . but i am disappointed with the quality of service and the error made by amazon for THIS PRODUCT.so BEWARE this is not BABY sandal !
 The kit was poorly constructed , not square . The sides for the sliding lid had much wider gaps at the front than at the rear . I contacted the merchant and they promptly issued a refund upon receiving the defective kit . The merchant 's service was great , the merchandise I can not recommend .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 Comfortable , but do not work well when wet . Your feet slip out of them . Sort of surprising for a company that specializes in over priced swim wear and gear .
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .

I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 This is a very poorly constructed shoe . The bottom of the shoe is pealing off in three places within 2 weeks of owning the shoe .
 In addition to this shoe , I ordered the Maris slide and both of them are just far too narrow in the straps -- the footbed is the right size and width but way too tight on the top . As a reference , usually my foot is slightly narrower than a medium width ! Cute shoe and great price but you just do n't know what you 're going to get .
 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .
 These shoes were comfortable and roomy -LRB- I got a size 6 but it was probably more like a 6.5 -RRB- . The strap broke after I wore it for 6 months ... usually I wear my shoes for a few years before they wear out so this was pretty unusual .
 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .
 I started wearing these 2 weeks early to break them in . I had to take them off after 2 hours . The straps dig into your toes . They are pretty , although there are no stones . The embellishments are actually small clear beads on top of sequins .
 If you have a short big toe , this is not the shoe for you . I have short wide feet so my foot stopped way before the edge of the shoe . The toe ring was most uncomfortable along with the straps . Great if you have long slender feet .
 I DONT KNOW IF ARE THINGS OF MINE , BUT I HAVE MORE THAN 5 YEARS USING THIS STYLE , ADIDAS SAMOA , SO I THINK THIS SNEAKERS FROM THIS STORE ITS NO GENUINE 'CAUSE THE `` LEATHER '' ITS TOO HARD , BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS BLACK UNIT I HAD BOUGHT A WHITE ONE TO AMAZON STORE AND THOSE IF SEEMS TO BE GENUINE , LEATHER ITS VERY SOFT , BUYERS TAKE CARE WHO YOU BUY
 The plastic broke with the first use and it arrived without the pressure point inserts . Very disappointed with the product . The company has excellent customer service but the product was cheap .
 A PIECE OF &#34; JUNK &#34; the thing did nothing for my shoe . Product is defective , it broke up when tring to ajust it . PIECE OF &#34; JUNK !!!!!
 It did what it should . Then , on the third day of use while retracting the screw the cheap plastic bolt just busted in half .
 I should have given more credit to the negative reviews of this product . The shoe stretcher worked great on the first two shoes I used it on . But in spite of my careful use of the device , the gears that widen it were stripped when I attempted a third shoe . Now it is virtually useless . I expected an item that would last several years , not 11 days .
 Ordered 2 . One was broken on arrival . The 2nd broke on 1st use . No invoice in box to know who to contact . I will not recommend the item or company .
 It only lasted 30 min . It still stretches lengthwise , but wo n't move widthwise.This is so not worth it . I should have bought something better made .
 I initially was impressed by the two-way stretch feature & the construction seemed decent , tad leery of the plastic components . After ONE use on fabric slippers the width stretch feature just spins and will not expand . I will use it for length stretch only - no width stretching capability . I expected better from FootSmart . Again this item is flimsy CRAP ! I would NOT recommend .
 I have wide feet a bought this to stretch the width of some of my heeled shoes . The listed did n't specify that this was for flat shoes only and I do n't know anything about shoe stretchers so did n't realize it myself . When I got it , I quickly realized that it would n't work on my high heeled shoes -LRB- you need one that 's tilted at an angle to fit properly in the shoe while stretching it -RRB- . The plastic just made it seem cheap and like it was n't going to last long . I quickly returned it and found a wooden one for high heels on another website -LRB- amazon did n't sell it -RRB- . I have it and love it . I would suggest getting a wooden one as the quality is much better and it seems like it will last much longer .
 The item is plastic and flimsy . After stretching my first pair of shoes the shoe stretcher broke . JUNK . Junk . Junk . Junk !
 I ordered this product and when it arrived it looked very promising . I used it on one shoe and it seemed to do just fine . I started to use it in the other shoe and it broke . Very disappointed as it was a product that I wanted to use .
 I liked FootSmart products a lot . But this is just poor quality . What they don tell you , it made of plastic , not wood and metal like the better ones . the length device broke the 2nd time i used it . Do not buy a plastic stretcher.And always wet the shoe before you stretch it .
 I 've used this for one shoe . The width stretcher is stripped already and I had to stuff other objects in the stretcher to get it tight . I wear a womens size 7 - so not that big . It 's been one week and it is still not stretched enough . The plastic leaves a grainy dust when you tighten the screws , which is a lovely feature . I will definitely buy a wooden one next time .
 This product does work , but is very light duty . I have two and both of them have broken after a few uses . The parts are plastic and very light duty . I will now have to buy a wooden and steel stretcher next time . This product is definitely too light duty for long term use .
 This stretcher , although two way , held up for two stretches before failing . Its about as cheap as you can make something without it being total garbage . No where in the description does it say its hollow plastic , and the pictures are low res and small so you do n't necessarily realize what you are buying . To stretch leather shoes , you have to apply a pretty fair amount of push , and thats not really possible with this item . Its also priced similarly to toe box stretchers , so its not that great of deal when you realize what you actually bought.I have not bought from FootSmart before , and this first impression leaves much to be desired . Had they noted it was plastic and `` inexpensive '' I would have opted for a heavy duty wood one instead .
 the two-way stretching is good , but this is cheaply made and did not last long before the plastic cracked where the threaded rod passes through . looking for something made to last .
 Like other reviewers I found this item to be of very poor quality - the plastic actually looked used/chewed up when i took it out of the box . The stretch function is very cheaply made and did n't adjust out of the box . I am very diappointed and sending it back - I 'll pay up for the wood one now .
 Complete waste of money - broke the first time I tried to use it . Next time I 'll just burn the $ 18 - at least I 'll have instant gratification , rather than waiting for shipping to be disappointed . The only way this could have been a worse waste of my cash is if it had actually laughed at me when I took it out of the package . Then again , that might have actually added some value .
 This stretcher is made of plastic that falls apart in random-sized small bits as you stretch the shoe . One of the bits was quite sharp but most of them are like cookie crumbs . At first I thought I had sand in my shoe until I looked at the crumbs closely and then tried it on another clean shoe . The device continued to work , but I have since bought a set of solid wood stretchers , worth it , since these were a waste of money .
 Bought the product before reading the reviews -- big mistake . It did stretch out my shoe , but the shaft broke when I pulled it out after the second stretching . If I were to do it over again I would probably select a more sturdy , wooden device .
 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Not very impressed with these shoes , not nearly as much as other Nunn Bush products . I found them quite stiff out of the box , and the leather too firm . After several months of occaisional wear they had not loosened up , rather , the leather had developed uncomfortable and unsightly creases . Granted , these are inexpensive shoes , and I bought them for rainy days when I did not want to wear my more expensive black dress shoes.I still have them , wear them occaisionally when the weather is bad , but will be looking for another foul-weather pinch-hitter when these either wear out or I have some money to spend .
 I wrote the company after a second pair of their loafers soles SPLIT due to poor Chinese rubber . They IGNORED my emails -LSB- twice -RSB- at their website . I had bought one pair which split after about 20 uses and thought it was a fluke . I really found them very comfortable . So , I bought another pair which split about the same . I now use them for everyday use BUT I can not go outside when it rains because water gets into them via the split soles . WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK . Do n't buy them .
 The old saw `` You get what you pay for '' was never more true . I am wearing a pair of these shoes AS I TYPE THIS , and can tell you that you would do better to spend a bit more , and buy some better shoes.Update
 These shoes are far heavier than other steel toed shoes I have worn . If you are not on your feet all day , and want something that looks a bit more business-like , then they may be a good choice . But otherwise , I would suggest something lighter .
 THIS IS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE PAIR OF SHOES I HAVE EVER HAD ON MY FEET ... BAR NONE.I have other Nunn Bush shoes such as the Emory and the Eagan . I have been very impressed with the comfort , style , design , and finish of Nunn Bush shoes.The gel pad in heel causes more pain than comfort because of how it presses up against your heel in that pronounced U shape . The cut out in the heel pad is the culprit ; it allows the shape to protrude and press on your heel . With thick socks its not as noticeable , but with a pair of thinner dress socks I found the irritation set in within a few hours.By the end of a normal day in the office my heels where stinging with pain . I had to drive home in my socks ; I just could n't stand it any longer and had to get those shoes off my feet.The ComfortGel is a nice advertising feature to showcase the design , with the pretty blue gel showing , but poor for the fit and feel.I tried putting a Dr Scholl 's insoles -LRB- thin versions -RRB- in the shoe , but that caused my foot to ride too close to the top of the shoe , feeling a pinch when I walk -LRB- the shoe is a low cut design to start with -RRB- they also made the shoes fit too snug.I tried again with the inserts in and the shoes strings a bit loose ; still after a few hours , they just hurt my feet.I donated the shoes a local charity , brand new , highly polished and ready to wear . I hope the guy who gets them finds someway to enjoy the fit ... if possible.I will never buy another pair of Nunn Bush ComfortGel shoes ever again .

 I bought these sandals on the reviews of other customers and regret it . These are the worst , most uncomfortable sandals . Very cheaply made in China.Quality is unacceptable and completely waste of money . I wonder if some of these reviews are written by the company itself .

 I have a very large foot . I purchased one size larger than my normal shoe . Instead the slipper I received was more like two sizes smaller . If you know the correct size I will admit that the shoe is well made and if it fits it should wear well.I was very disappointed . I will simply give the shoes to a relative with smaller feet .
 I ordered these last week for my 6 year old son . Love the way they look . Like that they are leather and thought the price was good . When we got them a few days ago , I was even more impressed ... until he tried them on . He currently wears a size 12 and that is what I ordered . He could n't even get the front half of his foot in them . I held on to them -LRB- in case I needed to return the second pair as well -RRB- and ordered another pair 1/2 size bigger . They came today . Still ca n't get his foot inside . The problem is n't the length . The problem is because the top stitching of the tongue starts right about the middle of the arch of his foot so you ca n't pull it back far enough to slip a foot inside . He does n't even have high arches . Out of curiosity and false hope , I took the laces completely out and pulled the tongue back as far as it would go and still no luck . I do n't dare order a 13 , because I feel like even if he could get his foot in , once it 's inside it 'll slosh around . The shoe seems like it would be very roomy given the square toe , but that top just does n't have any `` give '' to it . They are such a cute shoe , exactly what I wanted and really seem like a good quality product , but they just wo n't work . Now I will have two pair to send back .
 Too little and very stiff . Should have stuck with the traditional Bucks , but we needed black shoes . We have returned them to stock .

 These are very comfortable shoe , but wo n't last long . Leather begin to wrinkle & crack in couple of months .
 I have had these shoes for 6 months . The bottms of the shoes have holes worn in them . I have never worn a hole in the bottom of a shoe before .
 ITS SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT FOR STYLE AND COMFORT BUT ON BOTH ACCOUNTS IT IS LACKING . THE STYLE IS WEAK AND COMFORT IS PRACTICALY NON EXISTENT . I HAD TO TAKE OUT THE VERY THIN INSOLE AND USE A BETTER ONE . SUCH A WASTE

 While the shoes are indeed easy to walk on and they fit well with my wide feet . They do rub on the inner side of my arch and in a short walk will cause blisters on them . Ca n't wear them without socks which defeats the purpose of clogs ...

 The handbag is not useable ! I ca n't get into the bag due to the too short handle . The color is a dull fuschia and the material is stiff . The hardware was broken , and it was a brushed gold color which made it look cheap . Definitely not worth $ 63 , I can get much better for this price . One positive thing , it has one of the best handbag interiors I have ever seen . Designer bag makers should take notes from this interior

 I go these shoes many years ago and never cared for them . They are still sitting in my shed with hopes of me using them again . I like my crocs better .

 The first pair -LRB- too small -RRB- were beautiful shoes . They did n't look like seconds . the next pair , the toes did n't match , they were much larger than expected , all around we were really disappointed .

 heavy , clunky , did not break in after months of use . I would avoid this shoe . They feel like huge work heavy work boots .
 I have worn this type of Rockport for many years . My earlier pair was made in Portugal . This pair was made in China , of course . I had to return them . Either my left foot shrank or the left shoe was larger than the right shoe . They are well made and it broke my heart to have to return them . I guess I just have to buy shoes in the store from now on . I 'd give them a five for quality but the size problem made me cut it back to two stars .
 On this web site , there is no size of W -LRB- wide -RRB- and XW -LRB- extra wide -RRB- . If you need these sizes , you have to go to other stores . Otherwise I would give it 5 or 4 stars.The best part is these shoes are waterproof.In the past Rockport shoes ' front end was a curve , these shoes ' front end is like a cliff . The image on this web site is not very right , may be an old photo . The old style is much better for me.The bottom worn away quickly and became totally smooth , it is very slippery in raining weather , and before too long , it was totally worn away . The shoelace worn away too soon as well .
 For my job , I 'm required to stand a lot and move around between carpet , concrete , and metal surfaces while carrying 5-25lb loads.The bottom outside edges just did n't give me the traction I needed while switching surfaces and slippery areas and I would always found myself losing my footing.The center part of the shoe did great at holding on as long as I got the entire foot down but for my day to day needs , I need to move on .
 The shoes did n't fit . They were nice shoes but my husband has a wide hard to fit foot . Sorry we did n't try again .
 Just received the Rockport shoes which I ordered based on them being billed as very comfortable ... They have a very unnatural feel , the tops of the shoe feel hard around the ankle ... I can tell that if I were to walk far in them , I would be blistered in no time . They are very plain looking and the sole does not feel that soft on your feet . They look like they would be comfortable , but my old dress shoes with leather soles are much more comfortable . I returned these immediately upon trying them on . Shoes.com makes returns very easy and I highly recommend them ; but not these shoes .
 The Rockport margin is a cheap shoe . I work on my feet 10-12 hours a day so great shoes are very important ! I bought the Margins last year on sale for $ 65 , now they sell for $ 100 ... what a joke ? Steel shank-rock hard , thin cheap liner , cheap look . Spend the extra money on the dresport tru-walk or rockport lites , you will be soooo much happier ! Also , If you need a good looking comfortable shoe look at Florsheims with comfortech . They are super comfy like , the `` REAL '' Rockports .
 Received these shoes on time - and I know from having owned many pairs of the black style , they are incredibly comfortable.However , they arrived with a department store sales tag stapled to the bottom of each , and were scuffed and clearly worn - indicating that they were a department store sample model before being boxed and shipped to me.I love the shoe - but I 'm returning these and going to pick up an actual &#34; new &#34; pair from a local store.I 'm sure Amazon is n't responsible for this - but the shoe vendor provided a very unfortunate experience .
 First I was happy to find these shoes at this price on here . I was excited and got them in 2 day shipping but it all turned out to be a huge disappointment . Reason being the shoes appear different in the pictures here . I got the chocolate colored ones and the actual shoes are no way close to the photos they put here . They are infact shiny and cheap looking , although I have to admit they are ok for the price .
 after one day wearing this shoe , my socks were wet of sweat ... and it 's not comfortable since too narrow ... do n't buy it , not worth the money !!!
 Although these shoes look great and feel comfortable , the soles have a distinct squeaking sound as you walk . The squeak becomes more and more pronounced as you break the shoes in . I no longer plan to wear these shoes due to the loud noise they make around my office . Needless to say I wo n't be buying another pair .
 This is the second pair of Rockports I 've purchased . They have a great reputation and I thought the first pair I bought were an outlier . They started hurting my feet after about a year . The shoes still looked great but something in the support broke down . The second pair had the * exact * same problem after six months . They still looked great but who wants to wear shoes that hurt ?
 I normally wear a 9.5 and these were at least 1/2 to 1 inch longer . If you but these order a half size smaller . I was driving my car in them and using the clutch the shoe disconnected a switch . Had to get a tow . Bummer !
 These shoes ran extremely small . I ordered them for my daughter to wear under her prom dress . She normally wears a size 11 but because of the way these shoes are made , she actually needed a size 14 .

 Durable and High Quality , but cause blisters on both my sons ' feet -LRB- one with a high instep and one without -RRB- ... blisters on top of toes and heel ... zip front shoes are better alternative .
 The delivery here was excellent , the shoe itself was fine ; however , the feedback I read here I applied to my ordering process and it did not play out for my daughter at all , and she is a petite little girl . I had to return the shoe twice b/c too small . Ended up going to a local danceshop and found out she needed a size and half bigger than her actual shoe size , which also gives her a little wiggle room . Go to a local store if you have one , otherwise you 'll be a bit disappointed like me that the shoe does n't fit .
 We had to clip the elastic just to get the shoe on . It is exactly the same size as the other pair my daughter has in black . These , however , were very tiny for the size .
 I bought them for my 4-year old for a 2-week dance camp - not for heavy use . The first pair was too small -LRB- I ordered half size up from her usual , but they did n't fit at all -RRB- . On the plus side , I was not charged for the return and the new pair in size 10 arrived quickly . When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues -LRB- a bit of glue visible on the trim of one , slight discoloration around the ties of the other -RRB- . But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them . Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off ! It 's probably a glue problem again , but it literally is tearing in several places , so we 'll have to glue it ourselves if we want these shoes to hold for another week of camp.I was very disappointed - sizing issue was almost expected based on reviews , but few people seem to have had such quality issues . I am starting to wonder whether we got a refurbished pair or something .
 these were so adorable but looked like they would fit an infant . My 2 yr old has a small foot , but i still ordered her a 6.5 -LRB- she wears a 6 -RRB- . it was WAY too small . I heard return shipping is a nightmare - wish me luck !
 These shoes were nowhere near `` real '' size . My daughter wears a size 5.5 in toddler . I ordered a size 6 and I ca n't even get it on her foot ! Make sure you order much larger than usual . I wish I had that advice before I was scurrying around looking for shoes that would fit for TOMORROW .
 I was very annoyed regarding my purchase of the ballet slippers . AFTER having to return them because the size was VERY wrong , I read a lot of the reviews about them . EVERYONE complained that these shoes were missized and too small . I am annoyed that the description from the Capezio folks does n't warn the consumer themselves . I feel I took Pretty big money loss on my return because of the lack of warning on the size issue . I reordered some shoes from a different company who DID offer guidance on how to select the best size .
 Our dance instructor measured my daughter 's feet . Of course she lost one slipper right away . . So I ordered the same size through Capezio . When it arrived it could have fit another foot in the toe of the shoe ! That 's how large it was . So I figured `` okay , different company , maybe different fit '' and ordered same shoe a WHOLE size smaller . Same thing . Actually nearly no difference between the two . They really need to advise people of their fit . Which foot measurement equals each shoe size . I 'm paying to return their shoes which seems a bit unfair . Especially since a professional made very clear as to my childs ballet slipper size . And also , I have purchased from other companies that collaborate with our instructor .
 If you already know what size to buy , the quality of the shoe appears just fine . -LRB- Hence the 2 stars -RRB- I ordered my child 's street shoe size , as suggested in some other reviews , and they are at least 2 sizes too small . I would advise either buying a few pair knowing you will be returning the extras , or going to a store for your dancer 's first pair . My town has no store that sells ballet shoes so my options are limited .
 These shoes fit fine but they are uncomfortable on her feet . They do n't `` hug '' her feet the way they should and they look wrinkly . Not pretty at all . They are also difficult to tie . I expected a better product from Capezio . On the plus side they seem strong and are an appropriate color .
 I ordered these despite all of the other reviews about sizing problems . I checked the Capezio website and the sizing charts indicate to order the child 's regular street size . Further , I 've returned things through Amazon before and for some reason was SURE that I would n't have to pay to exchange if they were still the wrong size . Well , they arrived and despite my double-checking the brand 's size charts , they 're way too small ! And Amazon wants to charge $ 5 to ship them back . So really , do n't be like me and think you did your homework and you 'll be fine . Buy them in store . Major Amazon FAIL .
 My child typically wears a 5.5 toddler shoe . I ordered this shoe two different times ; one in a 6.5 and one in an 8 . both were far from fitting ! ballet shoes typically run small so I ordered up the first time with that in mind . my suggestion is to find a store and let them help you . with shipping cost , the money you `` save '' is not worth it . do not buy .
 I bought this ballet slipper for my 5yo daughter for her first ballet class . The shoe is very pretty , but the sizing is way off . I ordered her a size bigger , but it was still far too tight , and as her feet are pretty narrow , it was also way too wide . I returned this slipper -LRB- in the end , it cost me a ridiculous amount of money due to return shipping -RRB- and bought her ballet slippers at Payless which are her size and fit .
 My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes . Because of my years of dance , I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes . We do n't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home , so I had to order all of her dance supplies online . Because of this , I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement . Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long . When I looked at the size chart for this shoe , the length of her foot matched with a size 7 . I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes , so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same . Wanting to be on the safe side , I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5 , thinking she 'd grow into them if they were too big . When they came , I could NOT believe it . There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5 . Absolutely NO WAY . I 'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4 . That is a BIG difference . She was so disappointed , and so was I . It would cost almost $ 6 just to return them , even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing , so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into . Now I 'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided .
 I bought this shoe for my daughter starting ballet class , and I bought 1 size bigger just in case . It was far too tight for her feet ! The sizing is WAY off on this shoe , so be weary ! If you buy it for your little toddler , be sure to go up at least two sizes !
 THIS BRAND IS HORRIBLE . I ORDERED AN 11m , WAY TOO BIG , ORDERED 10 1/2 m WAY TOO SMALL , ORDERED 11n THEY ARE A 1/2 INCH SHORTER THAN THE 11M , ABSOLUTELY NO RHYME OR REASON BEHIND THE SIZING . COST 15.00 TO SHIP THEM ALL BACK AND I STILL DO N'T HAVE A PAIR OF SHOES FOR MY DAUGHTER !
 This shoe may have been ok but they were soooo small that we could n't use . I returned for another size , went from 7 to 8.5 and still had to return because they hurt her toes . Ballet shoes that hurt her toes ! We had bought a ballet shoe locally in the size 7 so thought we would be close with the Capezio in the same size . We were wrong .
 I was very disappointed with this shoe , and Capezio . My 9 year old had the correct size -LRB- confirmed by costumer -RRB- , wore it in a musical play four evenings , and the toe completely blew out of one of the shoes . Returning it .
 So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off . I measured my daughter 's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested . Her foot measures a little less than 6 '' , which would be between size 8 and 8.5 . I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still did n't fit !! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon . The shoes itself only measure 5.75 '' which is not what the sizing info states for size 9 . Her big toes are curled up inside . So now , we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon , it 's not their fault . Really cute shoes , but yeah , the sizing is like playing roulette , you never know what you would get !
 I never write reviews but felt like I should this time . I read all the reviews about the ballet shoes running small so I ordered a 1/2 size larger . They are still too small . Of course now I am getting charged shipping to return them . Not worth it . I order stuff from amazon weekly and I will stick to the sellers with free returns from now on .
 I thought I did my homework before purchasing these ... I bought this pair two sizes bigger than my daughter actually needed . They were still way too small . I am happy that Amazon is so great to work with . They returned them free of charge .
 I ordered size 8 for my small 3-year old -LRB- her normal size -RRB- . The shoes looked really nice , but they were way too small -LRB- at least , a size smaller then expected , and probably more -RRB- . I returned the shoes . Had to pay for shipping , but saved by packaging them in a padded envelope and using 1-st class mail instead of Amazon shipping -LRB- saved about $ 2 -RRB- . I would 've gotten another pair , but I 'm afraid it will not fit either , since it 's hard to determine what size would be appropriate , and I do n't want to take chances and have to ship another pair back . If you know exactly which size fits your kid , I would recommend the shoes , but if you do n't , try ordering 1-2 sizes bigger than you normally would .
 received these , 2 pair for my girls who are starting dance , way too small . REtuned both pairs in the same box and only received a refund for one pair . Very upset and dissapointed .
 Ordered these for daughter . She was 2 and starting her first dance class when I got them , and had small feet because she was not a big kid -LRB- still is n't -RRB- . She could n't even get her little foot into the size 6 . However , when we got a size 6 from Payless , she fit in them just fine . Returning this pair would have been a hassle , so we just kept them and learned our lesson . At 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 years old , a $ 10 Payless pair is just fine . And you can return with no hassle if they do n't fit . Live and learn , Mommy !
 I purchased a pair a size and a half larger than my dauhgter 's size - she wear 7 , I ordered 8.5 . Guess what - it did n't even fit her foot . I compared this ballet shoe with a shoe I purchased for her in the store -LRB- 8.5 also -RRB- , and the ballet shoe looked 2 sizes smaller . I am returning them . Not sure I will go with the same brand since the sizing is way off .
 I should have read the reviews . We measured according to Amazon 's shoe size chart and she can not even get her feet into them let alone wear them . Very disappointing and shame on Amazon .
 I ordered brand new ballet slippers and as they were pulled out of the package they were all black and worn on the bottom of the shoes . Not at all what was advertised and i did not click on buy used button either .
 The shoes were not as they were described.I just was not happy with them at all and they were to tight in the toe for my 4 yr old .
 Hi , I really like these shoes , however , was disappointed to see what appears to be a stain on the right toe area . . because they are suede . . I dare not even try to remove on my own . . it just looks as though whoever packed these shoes , or checked them , may have had a dirty thumb or spilled something on them . . it is noticeable . . but then again . . it is not . . so I just feel as though the cost of shipping them back is not worth it to me . . they are kick around shoes that I have worn as a young adult and now again as an older woman . . brings back memories . . hehe . . thanks for asking ...
 I picked the brand with the hard soles because I wanted to wear them outside . The soles are very , very thin and unless you just plan on going to the mailbox they will not be comfortable . The leather is flimsy also . I will use them for houseshoes .
 I love Minnetonka shoes and have worn them for several years . These boots are cute , but the quality is not up to par with the other shoes I have previously owned that were made by Minnetonka . The right shoe has a wretchedly hard knot right on the insole at the rise of my arch . It rubs and is like walking with a pebble in my shoe . I fear if I cut it the entire sole will unravel from the upper . It is going to cost me an additional fifteen dollars to take it to my local cobbler for repair . I should not have to repair brand new shoes . Quallity control needs to pay closer attention .
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves .

 I purchased this bag for work . The strap came apart at the seam the first time it was used . The zipper is still in place . You get what you pay for .
 I ts too small , I guess I 'm not good with measurement . I was going to use it for work . I thought when u adjust the strap it will be long enough so it can go across your body . I guess I can use it for lunch bag .
 My strap popped I put a water and small bottle of soda in it . I still use it but I put it inside another bag
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 These shoes were adequate as work shoes . They are fairly comfortable , and look fine with a skirt or pants . Other reviewers also mentioned these running small . I wear 8.5 ; I bought 8.5 ; 8.5 fit me fine . Other reviewers mentioned that the shoes pinch . Yes , they did until I broke them in , then they were fine . It took three weeks before they were broken in.I liked these shoes at first , but after I had had the shoes for just over two months , the sole began to separate from the shoe on the toe of the right shoe . I 've only worn the shoes to work , nowhere else , and I wore other shoes to work as well . My commute to and from work is just over a mile which I walk . Other than that I pretty much slip the shoes off under the desk during the day , so overall that is very little use . For comparison , I wore a pair of black Bass shoes almost every day a couple of years ago when I had a commute of 6 miles round trip . The Bass finally got to where the sole started wearing thin , but the shoe remained intact and construction was good.These are NOT A GOOD BUY mostly because of the very poor construction . Let me break down for you what you are paying for with these shoes . 80 dollars = -LRB- 9 weeks of wear -RRB- x -LRB- less than 5 days/week -RRB- -- > It costs just over $ 2 per day to wear these shoes , then the sole starts peeling off and flopping about.I am a long time fan of Merrell shoes for their durability , but these the Spire Emme shoes started falling apart after very little use . Due to poor construction these shoes are not economical , and it takes more than 1/3 the life of the shoe to wear them in . Horrible shoes .
 I had high hopes for these shoes . I am in and out of airport security several times a week , and have had great luck with a pair of men 's Merrell slip ons . This pair did not hold up nearly as well . The antimicrobial/anti odor was a joke . My feet do not smell , but within 3 days of wearing these , they did . I was never able to get rid of the odor , despite using different foot sprays and clean feet . Also , they scuff incredibly easy . A shoe polish lasts about a day . If you do n't care how they look , they are reasonably comfortable , however there is some lateral instability that may not work with some knees for walking of any length . Definitely will not purchase these again .
 These are very comfortable - especially for people with low back pain . However , I was very disappointed with how they were made . I wear them for work daily , and I work in an office , so most of my day is sitting and brief walking . The black covering on the heels and soles is peeling off and it looks really crummy . I invested extra money into buying this particular brand because I thought they would be well-made and comfortable . They are definitely comfortable , but I 'm really , really disapointed with the peeling on the soles . I 'm not sure if I would purchase another pair .
 I have many pairs of Merrells and this is the first to disappoint . They look great and are cushioned well for all day wear , but there is definitely something wrong with the sizing or design . I have heard many times before , `` order a size up '' or `` down '' for certain Merrells , but I have always ordered my same size before and they have fit fine . These are snug in the toe but loose in the heel . I feel like I am wearing flip flops . A different size would not help that . It makes the idea of a professional shoe kinda moot if it does that flippy noise when I walk around the office . The strap is adjustable , but even on the widest setting it cuts into my foot - and at that level the shoes also fly off my feet , so I have them even tighter , and tried all the levels . If the strap was farther back I think it would feel better ; the strap seems awkwardly close to the toe . I bought tiny hidden nylon socks with a gel heel pad to help me wear them - I spent $ 80 bucks on these shoes , so I guess I should do something ! What a shame !!

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I used to buy these all the time & loved them ... then for a long while I could not find them , so when I found these I was very happy even though the price had gone up considerably Having had them for a while they are a big disappointment . The old Staheekum were snug fit . These have stretched out in the width as to make them unusable ... . so if you are expecting what you use to get when you bought these ... these are not the old quality Staheekum Scuff !

 This was a Christmas gift . As far as I know , the quality is what we expected . The only problem was that it `` toured '' the West Coast for about two weeks before I received it . Thank goodness I ordered several weeks before Christmas !

 I have been purchasing Skechers shoes for at least 12 year 's and my last 2 pair have failed . The older pair lasted 1 year and the outsole cracked in half across the width of the sole . My latest pair purchased less than 3 months ago had the side seam tear out of its triple stitching . I find this to be unacceptable having 2 pair of shoes fail in 1 year . I work in an office and I sit at a desk 8 hours a day . These are worn maybe 3 days a week . Will never buy this brand again .
 Here 's the simple deal on this one ... . Superb sole . It is super thick and you feel awesome . But , the top sucks . The leather is really fake and will start showing cracks very soon . Of what use is a shoe that looks like crap from the top but is essentially still functional because the sole is great ?? Gave it to the SALVATION ARMY !!!
 We have bought 2 pairs of these shoes for my husband . Both have fallen apart within six months . My husband enjoyed wearing them for work because they were comfortable , however , within months he had problems with water leaking in his shoes and the leather cracking and breaking apart . Although they look nice and are comfortable , I would expect a longer lifespan for a $ 60 pair of shoes !
 this Chinese made shoe is terrible , i bought this shoe and the upper part of the shoe after few months started to break up , started to pill off . i would not recommend any shoe made in china or this shoe what so ever .
 Skechers are quite possibly the cheapest , worst shoes ever made . I tried on this very shoe at a shoe store and when tightening the laces the eyelet popped out - just trying them on . Others I know have had countless problems with their Skechers as well . Poor stiching that unravels after only a few uses , eyelets that bend or break off , emblems or logos on the shoe that fall off , and so on . If you 're interested in a good looking , hip and trendy , cheap shoe to wear once or twice , then Skechers is your shoe - but if quality is a concern , then do n't bother .
 I 've worn these shoes for years . A few years back one pair cracked after a few weeks . Thinking this was just a fluke I continued to buy them . Within the last 6 months though I 've gone through 3 pairs , all of which have cracked on me . The leather either bubbles , feels as if there is gravel behind it or , as on one pair , there is nothing behind the leather . I have bought my last pair of skechers .
 The medium is actually very very wide , and the stitching on the upper gave way only a month after I bought it . Generally , I like Skechers shoes , but I could only recommend this for people with very wide feet .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I have purchased and worn Romika men 's slippers for more than 30 years . I paid around $ 30 for my first pair . Over the years they have become more expensive , of course . They always wore very well and I wear them in and outside , for work , relaxation and even driving . About a year ago , looking for a new pair , I noticed that the cost of a new pair , plus shipping had risen to about $ 100 . I decided to try this brand `` Europedica '' that was listed with the real Romikas at $ 59 plus shipping . They looked similar and advertised to have all of the same `` benefits '' as Romika After less than one year the sides are separating the arch support is less than the original Romika and flattening out as worn , and the leather is already showing signs of severe ware . I still alternate these new ones with my two remaining pairs of original - both more than 10 years old , and the old ones are more comfortable and fit better because these new ones have stretched out to a size larger than when purchased . My advise , pay the extra money and get the original Romika . I will for my next pair .
 I purchased a pair off these clogs thinking that the lower price -LRB- almost half of the German made original brand -RRB- was a bargain . However , the cheap Chinese imitation is just that . The interior lining completely came apart in both shoes . While the exterior `` nubuck '' leather is wearing well and the rubber soles are fine , the shoe bed liner is completely coming apart after less than a year of use . Save money and buy the German made original which this shoe is trying to copy . Needless to say , I am very disappointed in this cheap immitation a shoe . I have owned three pairs of the German made originals and thought that this Eurocrapia would be a suitable subsitute ; unfortunately it does not hold a candle to the original .
 I bought these for my husband as a replacement for the Romika Mokasso clogs he 's worn daily for 10 years . They ran small -- had to return at my expense for a bigger size . He wore them around house & they make his feet sweat which the Romika 's never did . Now I have to pay again to have them shipped back to Footwise . So with the $ 25 in shipping charges I 've lost , I could have bought the more expensive Romika 's in the 1st place for same cost . Oh well , live & learn . Be careful if you 're buying these to replace Romika 's because you 'll be disappointed .
 With the name `` Europedica '' one could be forgiven for thinking they were made in Europe ; they are in fact made in China . Mine are starting to come apart after less than a year of wear.The arch support is not nearly what it appears to be looking at the outside of the slipper ; what you see is just a flap of `` rubber '' extending from the sole to give the impression of a high arch . I had to add my own inserts to get the support I need.Sizing is an issue ; the slipper 's uppers will stretch . I got the size recommended by the telephone rep at FootSmart ; the slippers have stretched and now my toes `` bottom out '' at the front.They are expensive for what they are . If you live in Canada FootSmart will insist on shipping them to Canada and by the time the dust has settled the slippers cost will have increased by about 60 % . This makes them not a good buy in my opinion .
 My husband has worn the Romika Mokasso 202 for nearly 20 years . When we tried to purchase a pair through Amazon.com , we were directed to the look-alike Europedica brand . Although similar in appearance , these are definitely not the same shoe . They have different arch support and are not as comfortable , and after trying to make them work , my husband eventually threw them out . A long web search did not reveal a US supplier , although we found that the Mokasso 202 is still made in several versions by Romika in Germany and is available on the German version of Amazon , Amazon.de . We eventually purchased a pair through a Canadian company , Moose Creek Mall . I do n't know why this model is no longer available in the US , except in limited sizes as a clearance item , but if you want the feel and comfort of the original Romika , spend the extra money.Follow up

 I have bought many , many pairs of Ryka shoes over the last ten years and this one is ahuge disappoinment . I have this same style in white and so the black seemed a natural to purchase too . Something is different about it and it does not fit the same way that the white pair does . These leave my feet aching . So I wonder if this is a `` second '' or one that did not make the regular quality control ? I only wear these now when I am outside and am going to get dirty since they are black and do not show the dirt . Good for mowing the yard on a riding lawn mower if you understand what I mean . Do not buy these if you have been happy with Ryka in the past as they are not the same shoe that you have loved .

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 They do n't really look the same in person . They look matte online but they 're shiny like patent . I like the matte look better . Also , I ordered 8M but I was sent 8W so they do n't look as neat on my feet . They 'll have to do ... besides when you are an international customer , returning stuff is just too expensive .

 They over sold this product so i did n't get them , then they tried to make up for it by offering to sell me the worlds ugliest shoe .

 I like the style of 901 NB very much . Shoes are light , sturdy and highly visible . They are also very stable . Unfortunately for me the shoes do n't offer enough cushioning . I walk/run 3-5 times a week for about 1hr . at the time . Even though , I had the shoes for several months , at the end of the week I had blisters on my heels from the lack of weight absorption . I have decided to replace the inserts with ones made by LifeFitness to see if this improves the comfort . I walk mostly on gravel roads.I do n't have any type of drama with my other pair - NIke Free 7.0 which are extremely soft and easy on the feet but not as durable as NB.Overall , NB are well made shoes that fall short on heel cushioning in my opinion .

 THESE BOOTS ARE VERY DETAILED . THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL . HOWEVER , THE LENGTH IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED . THEY ARE TOO SHORT TO BE COWBOY BOOTS . I WOULD ONLY BUY THEM IF THEY WERE TALLER .

 Overall construction is good however the side top edge does not have a cushion for the ankle bone . This caused an abrasion under the ankle . Product was returned and credit was issue in a satisfactory manner .
 This product never arrived . Customer service was not able to explain the cause . They also were unable to correct this error . They did refund my money , but by purchasing the item it believe it was clear that I would have preferred the item over the money .

 This style of thigh boot is a nice concept but possesses a narrow toe , fragile soles , and a fairly large shaft despite being cut to resemble the shape of the legs . Unfortunately , there are n't many thigh boots made of cow/kid leather or synthetic material and also possess a flat to medium heel . Likewise , when a pair is found , they usually cost too much or there is some problem relating to the quality or fitting of the boots . I hope to someday see more affordable and good quality thigh boots for sale .
 Its an okay sneaker got some compliments , but they gave me the wrong color i wanted the multiple color one and end up getting the black.dont wear it for the whole day feet hurts .
 very cute , but really uncomfortable . might just be the most uncomformtable sneakers i 've ever owned . so , do n't be fooled by its look .
 Due to the tropical climate here in Belize I hardly use my boots.However it was raining for a whole week so I use it and on the fourth day it burst from the lower seam by the heel . Not good for business .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 I was somewhat unimpressed with the quality of the shoe , additionally it did not seem to be true to the size -LRB- wider than a well made shoe of medium width -RRB- . Overall I would consider it a shoe for non athletic purpose .
 I suppose that it 's inevitable , but I was hoping that the shoes would be the same as I remembered as a kid . They are not . To say the quality is inferior is being kind . The sizes run small as well -LRB- about a half size -RRB- and A * com will charge you shipping to return it .
 I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths . Just a bland old no name shoe .
 When I ordered the shoes , I thought there would be a screen to change to shoe size or else let me cancel the order . It did not , so I had to return them and have not yet received my refund
 I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them . I used to wear Stans all the time , when a pair would wear out , I would go to the store and pick up another pair , size 11 1/2 . I did n't have to try them on , just buy them and go . Beware of doing that with these . I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow , the length is ok , but they are narrow , and squeeze my feet . I could wear them , and they might break in , and stretch , but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports , to get the issue resolved , but the email came back , and when I contacted the website , it did n't get answered . This is a buyer beware situation . The look good , but I do n't want to look good and feel terrible . I would not buy these online , go to an old brick and mortar store , and try them on .

 when I order these I got two different color brown tone shoes , the left shoe is a darker brown , little disapointed ! Thought they were cute , nice style , its a shame .
 These shoes are so cute but as the day wore on they got tighter and tighter . There is no give in them . I had horrible sores on the back of my feet and toes .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 cloth on bottom sole not good for hardwood floors , knobs on bottom of sole with cloth glued to them offers even less area for grip . doubt the knobs will be comfortable , but time will tell . solid build and warm for ankle and once fabric on sole wears out and offers some grip -LRB- what where they thinking ? -RRB- it might be comfortable but will definately be warm , if it doesnt make feet sweat ... -LRB- just got them so unknown , but looks like the dearforms inner fabric , sorta . -RRB- if not for the knobs and cloth on bottom , this could get a five .
 I wear a size 10.5 D . After reading other reviews here saying these shoes are &#34; true to size &#34; , I ordered a size 11 . I received them and they ar at least a full size too small . This is the last pair of house shoes I will try to buy on line . I know from trying them on in store that you just ca n't trust their sizing . I do n't know why that is , but i 's been the case ith Every pair I 've bought . I happened to be able to give this pair away or a Christmas present instead of having to return them . That said , I regret buying them ... wo n't try it agin .
 I ordered these for my Dad for Christmas , but he was n't able to get his feet in them . They were very small .
 These were sold as mens size 11 , both my son and my husband wear a size 10 1/2 shoe , neither of them can wear these slippers . They are at lease 1-2 sizes too small . The shipping was slower than advertised as well . The slippers themselves are solid and warm with a sturdy sole you can wear outdoors without fear . The only problem is they are much smaller than the marked size .
 Comfortable slipper . Top construction is well made and put together but sole material wore out too quickly wearing the slipper around the house and outdoors on occasion to walk out to get the sunday newspaper . Would not purchase these slippers again .
 These shoes were MUCH smaller than the stated size . I wear a 13 and a half shoe , but knowing that house shoes need to be loose , I ordered them in a size 14 . They were SO small , I could n't force my feet into them . And if the seller -LRB- different than the manufacturer -RRB- really had a `` bend-over-backwards '' policy as they state , they would offer a fedex or UPS label so I could send them back for free . / This is exactly why I dislike buying cloths from the internet or by mail-order . But , it is getting harder and harder to find local stores that have the larger sizes -LRB- even big and tall stores -RRB- . I guess I 'm just screwed .
 I ordered the recommended one size up . The toe box length and width is tight , but the back half of the slippers and sides are a bit loose . A full size increase to a 9M from the size , which I ordered -LRB- 8M -RRB- would be too large and the sides would definitely be too loose . As other reviewers noted , these slippers do loosen up and I hope that the toe box becomes more comfortable . The 3/4 '' rubber raised soles appears adequate . As I write this review , my feet are becoming quite warm , after about twenty minutes , with my athletic socks.After an hour , my feet are roasting in these slippers . Would I purchase again ? Difficult to say , if the toe box does n't loosen up for comfort .01 / 25/2012 UpdateI replaced this pair from DSW -LRB- Designer Shoe Warehouse -RRB- with two pairs , which fit . My feet were never comfortable with this pair . Would not recommend .
 normaly this would be my size.could barely get my foot in them . i think this was the only size available.looked well made but jusy wouldny fit . gave yhem to the needy .
 The slippers were ok except the opening is too small to get your foot into it without considerable effort . That made the slippers unusable for me .
 I tried on these slippers on precisely one time , then returned them to the box . They were n't horrible , just not real comfortable , and I got the feeling they would n't be particularly warm . But to be fair , I did n't wear them long enough to judge their thermal efficiency . I just did n't like the feel of them.For my money , better to pay a little more and get better quality .
 Good Quality ... But opening for foot way too small ... My huband couldn &#34; t get his foot in the slipper ... Other wise nice slipper shoe
 I threw them out ! the most cheaply made piece c. . p I ever had . Your feet have no support and the stuffing in the sole is like tissue so your feet remain cold
 Having read another review that said these slippers ran small , I ordered the next size up but it was too small . I returned them for the next size but they are out of the next size bigger . This is the only style slipper my husband likes and it is impossible to find them anywhere .
 Do n't order these unless you have tiny little feet . I ordered a size larger than my husband normally wears and he could n't even get them on . If you order them , you better try TWO sizes up than normal .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 Very cute shoes , but the leather is very hard and gave me terrible blisters . These are not as soft and comfortable as other pairs of Aerosoles I 've worn . Wearing socks and padding has helped some , but these shoes are still uncomfortable . Great price though .
 the asics mexico 66 are the nicest trainers i have ever had - which is why i was so desparate to get hold of another pair - and when the black/grey/gold ones appeared not to be available in the uk i decided to buy them over the internet - sadly eastbay sent me the wrong colour - and whilst they have refunded me the value of the shoes - they have n't done the same with the duty and postage costs which are more than i paid for the shoes themselves . I have also now spent quite alot of money chasing up and trying to get this money back as eastbay assured me i was entitled to it ... and am just about to start the process all over again ... if shopping with them i hope you have a better experience ... second time round i have been impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the eastbay staff - do n't know whether i 'll get the $ 116 -LRB- not including the purchase price which has been refunded now -RRB- that i am owed ... i think thats down to amazon ... fingers crossed i guess

 I 've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe . However , in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday -LRB- blue with red and silver -RRB- is synthetic . Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price , you receive a leather shoe ! You are not `` saving $ 50 '' if it 's synthetic .
 I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper , which is why I bought it . I see now that the description has been corrected , but too late for me.also , the sizing does not run true as the current description states . I usually wear 9.5 , but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes .

 I 'm usually ok with most of the pain that comes with heels . This bends the foot to an awkward form . The hole in the middle just cuts into my foot . It 's pretty though ... !!!

 The merchandise arrived in a timely manner and as described . Returns option was clear and seems convienient although I did not use it .
 UPDATE July 2009 . I found that the newer Saucony -LSB- sorry I will have to get the name -RSB- version 6 is similar enough to the Grid Hurricane 6 and 7 , so that is what I am buying now . It 's a different name than Grid Hurricane but the sole/tread is similar . ============== I have been wearing Saucony Grid Hurricane 6 and 7s for years now.I just got the 8 and it is not the same . I went out for my first runand soon after I felt a pain in the center of the ball of my foot . Thesame pain I got from Nike 's that were too soft . But the Hurricane is supposed to be supportive right ? Well the 6 has ` HRC ' Hard Rebound Compound in the toe box and is stamped on the side of the sole . The 8 has ` SRC ' in the toebox and stamped on the side . I called Saucony and they say some like it some do n't but their new 9 's got great reviews . I tried the 9 's since they are supposed to be a different toe box with ` some ' HRC in it . The 9 's are the same as the 8 's . Both 8 and 9 have SRC Soft Rebound Compound and are not the same support in the sole like the 6 and 7 's .
 I just read the previous runner 's reviews and have to agree that these 8s are not the same quality as the Saucony Hurricane 6s and 7s . I am 6 ' 2 '' and 180 lbs . I need a really good shoe to cushion the impact -LRB- shock absorption -RRB- of my daily 3 mile run . I do n't seem to get the same `` feel '' from these that I did from the 6s and 7s . These 8s were a bit small -LRB- 1/2 size smaller closeouts ? -RRB- as I wear a 13 and , they wore out really fast . I 'd buy some Hurricane 6s or 7s to replace them if I can locate a pair .
 the company was very kind in allowing me to return the shoes -- nonetheless , I wouldnt have had to return them if I had read `` all the fine print '' about the ` closeouts ' running 1/2 size too small . I take responsibility for not reading the fine print , but I am ordering shoes , not closing on a house or something ! It would be better for all parties , including seller , if the seller put the Size disparity in the headlines -LRB- or at least put an asterisk next to the price or size -RRB- .

 I have to return this item , because size chart is way out of right scale . If anyone wants these shoes , get 1 size bigger , you usually wear , at least . And shoes are very very narrow . If you got lucky and it fits you , these shoes must be comfortable , they have soft cushion-like inside lining .

I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 When will there be smaller sizes of these shoes available ? i need 8.5 :-LRB- i 've been looking for them all over and there 's no sizes :-LRB- somebody can please help me telling me where can i get these shoes but 8.5 size ?? i will apreciate it very much , thx = -RRB-

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 Do not buy these shoes ! They are slippery and I 've fallen several times . This last time , I threw them in the trash . Save your money and buy a better shoe .
 I 'm usually ok with most of the pain that comes with heels . This bends the foot to an awkward form . The hole in the middle just cuts into my foot . It 's pretty though ... !!!

 The shoe is exactly what I ordered , and I knew what I wanted when I went looking for it . The problem was that when it arrived the Leather did not match . One one shoe it was pristine and on the other it looked like it had been worn for a month or two . You get what you pay for and I did get a pretty good deal on them , I would have returned them if not for shipping costs , I can still tell that they are not the same -LRB- I had hoped with wear you wouldnt be able to tell -RRB- someone that did not know probably could not tell so it all depends on how picky you are I guess .

 This was my first purchase of work boots via the internet and my decision was ultimately influenced by other reviewers . That was a mistake I will not make again . The product was nothing close to what I expected . I have been in either construction or landscaping for 40 years and more of my life has been spent in work boots than anything else . Most days I wear them dawn past dusk , -LRB- to my wife 's dismay -RRB- , and I 've run the gamut from top-shelf to two pair for fifty-something . These are the first pair that are so heavy , as opposed to solidly built , so confining , as opposed to well-fitted , so awkwardly engineered as opposed to innovative , so uncomfortable as to be unwearable when not necessary . Soles are rigid and smack the ground , the boots are heavy without an obvious reason why , the tongue is padded where the eyelets need come together making them difficult , -LRB- I swear it ! -RRB- , to tie . They are truly sized only if one were to wear dress socks and subsequently in the cold weather they do not allow for any normal hosiery and thereby are n't warm enough to spend the workday outside . I would 've returned them immediately after one wearing if I had n't marred them my first day working with them . The only saving grace is soft supple leather uppers and one successful day being waterproof . Big mistake . I had the choice of so many well-known brands , models and prices that my disappointment is magnified that much more .
 Another product ordered and I receive it in a damaged box and they are not steel-toed as I ordered . . I need steel-toed boots here and soft toes are not acceptable . Since it will cost me more time to fly into a base with a post office and send these back , i will use these as slippers and order boots from another site . If you are going to sell a product ensure you have an adequate Quality Cantrol/Quality assurance Dept.

 I loved the look of these shoes until I put them on . They gaped terribly at the sides . I know everyone 's feet are different but the way these shoes gaped made them look very cheap . I returned them .
 Do not buy these shoes ! They are slippery and I 've fallen several times . This last time , I threw them in the trash . Save your money and buy a better shoe .
 I purchased the black faisel shoes for work . They are not solid black as in the picture but have a white bottom and white laces so they are not professional enough for my work . The picture should be corrected . Im trying to return the shoes and get a refund .
 I ordered The Dingo Dan Post 's Mens Molly Harness Boot is `` Tan Apache Distressed . '' What I received was the same boot in Mahagony . . Eeww . Anyway , I am shippong them back and getting them in Gaucho -LRB- ? -RRB- because the `` Tan Apache Distressed '' version is no longer in production . Yet , it is still on the Amazon website and you can still order them . They will just ship you someting else ...

 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered these sneakers for a Christmas Gift and was informed they would arrive after Christmas , no problem . Later that week I called the store and was told the order was cancelled since they ran out of the sneakers . I would recommend that no one place an order with this store . There customer service stinks , if I had not called I would not have known the order was cancelled .

 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I really like Chuck Taylor shoes and these are n't my first pair . But they are the first pair that have started to fall apart after 1 month of use . Not really falling apart but developing holes throughout the canvas . Not sure what 's going on but I 'm very disappointed .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ORDERED THESE SHOES AND WAITED 2 WEEKS , THE COMPANY EMAILS ME AND SAYS THE ORDER HAS BEEN BACKORDERED . I WAIT 1 MORE WEEK AND THEN THEY EMAIL ME BACK SAYING THE ORDER IS OUT OF STOCK . THIS IS VERY UNFAIR B/C WHEN I ORDERED THE ITEM IT SAYS THEY WERE IN STOCK ! I AM STILL WAITING FOR A REFUND . BEWARE

 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .

I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic .

 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .

 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .

 My boys really liked the boots , they seem comfortable & sturdy . Problem is that the eyelets that hold the shoelaces in place break easily . On one of the pair , the eyelet broke the 1st time he wore it . On the other , it lasted maybe a dozen wears . Hoping Timberland comes through , b/c too late to return to Amazon .

 I was excited to receive these Bass , woven-leather clogs -- beautiful to look at -- gorgeous color and interesting design with small brass tacks around the uppers . However , I 'm sending them back because they are n't comfortable . The inner lining in the toes is n't smooth , Perhaps I could deal with that but the biggest problem is that there is no flexibility in the sole . It 's made to look like wood and that 's exactly how it feels -- just a hard , inflexible sole bed . Perhaps that 's fine for other people but it wo n't work for me . You ca n't bend your foot as you walk . That was n't described in the description of the product on the Amazon website or I would n't have ordered them . And now I 'll have to pay to ship them back . Not a happy camper here . Bass , you 've let me down.Bass Women 's Jillian ClogThese were purchased through Amazon from Shoes.com .10 / 23/2012 In the interests of honesty I want to report that return shipping for this order -LSB- ... -RSB- was FREE . I had understood I would have to pay to return these shoes but I 'm glad to report that I was wrong . Pls note this correction to my review .
 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 Do not buy these shoes ! They are slippery and I 've fallen several times . This last time , I threw them in the trash . Save your money and buy a better shoe .
 These are really nice slipper , but they are the heaviest slipper I have ever tried to wear .

 This shoe is a pure running shoe , not a cross trainer as indicated in the title . It fits extremely tight and is very uncomfortable . I returned them immediately .

 Well - I purchased the same money clip in June for $ 8.99 from Gem . Worked great and the I lost it when paying a restaurant bill , I left in on the counter.I repurchased it from Gem in October -LRB- same item -RRB- and it just came in . It is horribly made unlike the first one . This one seems to have a thicker piece of metal for the magnet to attach to . This then makes the `` Slim '' design not so slim at all.As a matter of fact , it does not even close properly because of the thickness it shapes itself like this when closed '' > '' so it does catch on my pants pocket when taking it out.This order also cost $ 4.99 in shipping which Gem says they do not return & I have to send it back . The post office shows $ 1.95 for postage on this 3 oz . shipment ... so Gem made money on that as well.So to return an $ 8.99 item it has already cost postage of $ 6.94
 Wonder Costumes sent me the wrong shoes !! The ones I received looked nothing like the ones pictured and when I tried to contact them to rectify the situation I first had to call 7 or 8 times before I actually got a live person -LRB- you ca n't leave a message -RRB- who then told me she would look into it and call me back within an hour , I never heard back from them ! After trying for 2 more weeks to get a hold of them I finally gave up , now I 'm stuck with a pair of shoes I never would have ordered !
 The size 6 , which I am , was too small . I returned it for a 6.5 , which was too big ! So , no shoes for me .

 Within 2 days of wearing these shoes , the sole started to fall off . A little shoe goo and all was better and the shoes are comfortable , but I would expect a lot more from Dockers .
 Nice looking pair of shoes - and not the best price - but went with reputable Amazon infrastructure.Product arrived on time.During first day of wear , the soles came off the shoes.Amazon covered the shipping fee back.I went elsewhere to purchase this same product .
 We were so happy to see these shoes on Amazon . My husband had a pair of what we thought were identical shoes that he wore for years and years . The soles finally wore out , and rather than have them resoled , we decided it was time to replace them , and were glad to have found the very same shoes ! Or so we thought . The old pair was made in Brazil , and these new ones were made in - you guessed it - China . The fit was different , but , hey , they were brand new , and the pair they replaced were well broken in . But , less than a year later , with moderate wear , this replacement pair looks just terrible ! The finish has totally worn off in strange places , and the shoes look like they 're 10 years old .
 I have bought these shoes in store or ordered online now for the last 4 years . They last me about 6 months . Obviously I like them - that 's why I reorder them.But this time the left shoe is significantly darker than the right shoe . -LRB- It is not worth my while to send them back and I need them , so I started wearing them . -RRB-
 The Quality of this boot is the worst ! `` Timberland '' Waterproof Boots !! The paint rubbed off the toe of my son 's boots within two wears ? I bought them a half size too big so that he could grown into them , thinking they would last atleast two seasons and within three weeks the toes of the boot has crease marks across the toe !?
 Ordered a 6.5 from this company on Amazon and the company never shipped them out and then when I finally contacted them they stated that I ordered a toddler boot and that they do not have them in stock . So I contacted Amazon and they assured me of what I ordered a big kid 6.5 timberland boot . My ordered was suppose to be shipped out on 12/23 and they never contacted me about the shoes not being in stock . After they cancelled my order , I went back on Amazon to see if they still have the shoes listed and to my surprise they still do .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I generally like this product but it has a major flaw.The product is pretty easy to put on , and it does keepyour feet warm in cold weather . The insulating effectis superior -LRB- and more comfortable , too -RRB- to insertingchemical toe warmers into your boot . There 's also anice side benefit , that is , the glove shields the bootbuckles and top surface from snow and grime.Be sure to get the right size for your ski boot , becauseif you get , say , the Medium for a small boot , the bootglove will appear to fit but the front edge will slipdown onto the lip of the boot . That makes it hard toclip into your bindings.The major flaw is that the cloth securing strap thatgoes underneath the boot wears out too quickly . Thisstrap is positioned about under the ball of your foot , and thus makes direct contact with the ground when youwalk in your boots . For a purely recreational skierwho stays mostly clipped in , the strap may hold up fora sufficient time . I 'm a Ski Patroller , and I have todo a fair amount of walking while wearing my boots . Inmy case , the straps have nearly severed from wear afteronly two days of use . The bottom strap needs to bemade of a more durable material , and/or moved back towardsthe heel where it could rest in the hollow of the bottomof the boot .
 My husband has tried them for a few weekends now and they do not work for keeping feet warm . Maybe in conjunction with battery warmers but not on their own .
 Ca n't comment on the effectiveness of how well these warm but I can comment on the quality of the detail ... poor ! I purchased and opened a brand new package of these -LRB- size large -RRB- and although they are both stamped L for large , one has a longer strap by about 2 inches and fits much looser than the other . It also was slightly streched around the top than the other . Very disappointed to say the least as I paid good $ plus extra for expedited shipping . The idea is great but the quality disappointed me to say the least .
 I like the idea , and the covers are very well made . I just ca n't get the covers on my boots in a way that does n't interfere with the ski binding in the toe area . I could probably trim the front of the cover to get it away from the binding , but decided to return the covers instead .
 I almost always get cold feet when skiing ... especially if there is fresh snow , so I thought I 'd give these a try . I bought them for a recent trip . The first day I tried them , my feet stayed nice and warm in the morning and I thought I 'd made a great purchase . However , I took my boots off when I went in for lunch and when I went to put the boot gloves back on after lunch the plastic piece that you slide the velcro strap through broke . I really busy after the trip and did n't check the paperwork ... turns out it 's only a 30 day warranty so I guess I 'll try to glue it and see if it holds .
 Wore these on a cold day . Worked in keeping toes warmer . After 6 runs the plastic `` buckle '' broke so I took them off and found that the bottom strap was already worn and frayed . Extremely disappointing because they actually did keep my feet warmer , if only for an hour or so .
 The pair of BootGloves I purchased disintegrated after only 2 days of skiing . They tear easily . Also , the toes of the BootGloves folded back in ankle-deep snow , thus became permanently stretched and useless .
 These came as advertised and in a timely manner . What I did n't like was the tear in the elastic band -LRB- which functionally replaces shoelaces -RRB- on the right shoe . This causes the my right heel to come out of the shoe when I walk simply because the shoe is not tight enough . There is also a tear in the piece of canvas on the left shoe that holds the grommets . When I walk the hole opens up on the side of my foot.I 'm wearing these because I 'm in Afghanistan and have no other sneakers to use until the replacement set I ordered from another vendor arrives . Returning these would not be practical as it involved significant bother and cost using the military postal system . If the vendor had sent a non-defective pair of sneakers in the first place there would be no reason for this bad review .
 These shoes are not like your Chucks from back in the day . I had a pair of similar Converse branded all-hemp shoes previously which were far more durable . The first week of wear introduced a series of streamer threads splitting out from the ` shoestring ' area . It is a design intention -LRB- a la ` cut-offs ' -RRB- . Looks pretty shaggy for new shoes , but some of the appeal is no doubt the show of impermenance . If you need shoes for everyday wear and you ca n't buy a new pair every month , I would go with a more durable shoe .
 I thought it would be great to get slip-on chucks , but these are imposible ! i struggled for sooooo long each time i tried to put them on because the stitching comes up pretty high and decided to cut them a bit . Good idea , but did n't help at all . ended up chucking the chucks . boo
 I had to return my first pair of converse because the size was wrong . I resent that I had to pay to ship them back as this is the third pair of shoes I had to pay to return . The new pair fit fine
 I usually love Chuck 's . bought these for my boyfriend and a month later the heel was completely separated from the sole . I tried to return the shoes but i was one day late on the return policy . Not pleased , wo n't buy from here again .
 I was not pleased with the product I received . Before I purchased the product I would have liked to have known that the colour black is not what you think ! I still think I was sent the wrong colour shoes -LRB- they look like they 're navy blue not black -RRB- . When I emailed the company about this they ignored me and did not offer for me to send them back or anything , so I was not happy with them at all.I will not be purchasing from them again !
 These shoes look great . But when I received them the size was wring ci had to return them and had to pay for it . Then the shop costumer service told ne that I made a mistake in the size . Which is not true . And they were not sure whether they reimburse me.I got my money back but I was not happy with this experience . And I still dont have my shoes .
 Ordered over a month ago , emailed seller and still have yet to hear back . I think i am considdering it a loss about now . Funny how quickly they were to take my payment but not send out fast ...
 When I purchase a pair of shoes in the USA I expect them to be USA sizes not UK sizes . I had to return the shoes I bought not once but TWICE cos the people at this company could n't follow my first returned instructions nor did the person I spoke to on the phone ! IDIOTS.The third time they were delivered I was promised next day delivery which never happened . I did finally receive the correct shoes 2 days later , which ended up being over 3 weeks from my original order.Good luck to anyone using this company !!! Shoemania
 I love the look of Converse sneakers and have purchased them in the past . I do feel that for the price I paid I was expecting a higher quality of these Converse , vs. the ones I bought at Target for less than $ 20.00 . I was hoping that for over $ 60.00 , these Converse would have a better made insole with arch support and the canvas used on the sneaker was also very flimsy compared to my other Converse 's -LRB- even from Target -RRB- . Also - I ordered a half size down from my normal size -LRB- as requested by the seller -RRB- , they were still a bit to large.I like the look of these shoes but would not purchase another at this price .
 The sizing advertised is all wrong.I wear a size 12 US ASICS , and a size 12 in Converse is 1-1 .5 sizes too big . I had to give them away.I 've learned from this encounter .
 I bought 3 pairs and they are to big for him . They seem to be running a size larger than marked
 I COULD N'T BELIEVE IT !! MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES !! HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WAS N'T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY , BECAUSE IT WAS DEC. 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC. 26 , AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES ??? I 'M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL , BECAUSE I 'D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK !! WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR -LRB- WITH LACES -RRB- AT A BETTER PRICE .

 This shoe is a pure running shoe , not a cross trainer as indicated in the title . It fits extremely tight and is very uncomfortable . I returned them immediately .

 I am sure they would have been great boots , but they never arrived ! My credit card was charged and I received a confirmation e-mail . A few days later I recieved another e-mail letting me know the boots were out of stock . Because of this I missed the opportunity to buy these boots in my size from another site : -LRB-
 They recommended you get your same shoe size , but I did n't believe them and ordered a half size larger . However , even a half size larger was too small . This shoe kind of gapes open and the toggle shoe string sticks up and just looks really weird . It looked really cute in the picture and I was really glad to finally have found a white zumba shoe . But , this is n't the one . I 'll keep looking .
 The cleat looks nice and sturdy but it is not a wide cleat at all . It wasted my time and money to ship it back . For that give it a zero rating !

 I LOVE UGG - their snow boots and previously their slippers.Five or Six years ago I purchased my first pair of Coquette slippers - they are still intact but look faded and the inside wool has padded down - but they can still be worn . My one year old , latest purchase - now have a hole coming through the Big Toe area - and the suede leather looks so thin compared to the outer covering used on the `` old '' ones . Has the quality control gone down now that they are manufactured in China ? I have tried to find a head office where I can send these back to ... Does anyone know of an address in California or in USA

 Love uggs slippers except black . You have a difficult time getting the dye off your feet . I was very disapointed .
 I am a woman who appreciates a good slipper and I figured you get what you pay for but these slippers are NOT GOOD and DO N'T LAST.I got these for Christmas in 2007 . Cost
 The lining is not as thick as other styles . They are hard . Theey are ok to run to the market or drop the kids off . They are not slippers
 I purchased a pair of these slippers 5 yrs . ago . They were wonderful , wore them to the store , walking my dog ... everywhere . I read the reviews about the soles being stiff , not up to the quality you would expect from UGG 's . Because I LOVED my old pair sooooo much , I purchased these anyway hoping the reviews were wrong . I should of listened . The price is up and the quality is way down , these will not last me as long as my old pair . I do not mind spending that kind of money on slippers if they last 5 yrs . They are too stiff , the sole is like a piece of hard plastic , they are hard to walk in . I would buy something else ... I 'm going to return them
 I ordered these to replace a pair of Ugg slippers I liked so much I wore them out . When the new slippers came I was disappointed , because the quality did not seem to be up to Ugg standards . The lining felt stiff and uneven , and there were tufts coming out . I returned those , but when the second pair came they were n't much better . I decided to keep them anyway , thinking maybe the lining would break in and they 'd feel as comfortable as my old Uggs . Well , they never have . Within a few months the lining started to wear thin , and if I wear them very long the black dye starts turning my toes black . I used to think Uggs were high quality and worth the expense , but not any more .
 These literally fell apart . After about 4 months the shoe actually ripped away from the sole . I have been pleased with My other Uggs but these are not well made at all!I did not wear them in any adverse conditions either , just around the house ect.Don ' t waste Your Money !!!
 My husband bought these for me for Christmas , and while I love my other UGGs , these were most uncomfortable ! The soles are like industrial boots and very stiff ... they do n't bend with your foot when you walk . Because they do n't bend , they feel like they are slipping off . I have some from Target that are much more comfortable and way cheaper . I 'll stick with the original ... the boots !
 UGG Women 's Coquette Slippers - I am on my second pair of UGGS Coquette . Two years ago , I purchased my first pair and wore them everyday . They held up very well . In fact , I replaced them because I had worn them so much , the outside was beginning to show their age . I replaced them with an identical pair and within WEEKS the heel area lost all of its fur . I purchased them through Zappos and they replaced with a new pair . Within weeks , I am experiencing the same problem - virtually no fur left in the heel area . I had also purchased 2 pair of the same style as gifts -- and both pairs had the same issue almost immediately . I spent $ 300 + for inferior quality . I shall replace with one of UGGScompetitors that is less expensive . A word of advice to UGGS ... once you lose a customer it is nearly impossible to win them back . BUYER BEWARE
 I have been wanting these slippers for over a year , but could never afford them . I had purchased other slippers made by another Australian company and they were very good , but I really wanted the UGGS ! I finally got my husband to purchase me these slippers for this past Christmas . I was thrilled when I got them - they were beautiful and comfortable . BUT NO LONGER !!! It has not even been a full month since I 've been wearing them and already the fur under the heals is totally gone !!! Because the fur is gray the bald spot left where the fur used to be makes the slipper look really ugly . I can not believe a slipper that costs $ 100 wore down so quickly . I am not hard on my shoes - I can wear them for years without them looking worn down . The other slippers I purchased a year and half before my husband gave these to me for Christmas are still in great shape and they cost half the price ! Please , NO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE SLIPPERS !!! -LRB- The fur wore down so fast that I am actually wondering if they are really counterfeit slippers ! -RRB-
 I received a pair as a gift in December and after only a few weeks the fur came up at the toes in one of the slippers leaving a very uncomfortable bare patch . Ugg customer service was kind enough to send me a new pair and this time the fur has come off in spots on both heels after only a few weeks . Also quite uncomfortable . Fortunately , Ugg customer service is sending me a refund and I 'm going to get a different brand of shearling slippers.This construction is quite surprising to me as I own other Ugg shoes that I think are just fantastic and I would n't trade them for anything ! -LRB- Oh , LOVE the boots in the Colorado winter ! -RRB-
 These slippers are indeed rugged and very , very warm . However , after only 20 minutes of wear time they make my feet and ankles ache so badly because once your heels settle into the sheepskin it is like walking on bricks . There is zero shock absorption so if you have plantar fasciitis , weak ankles or spurs then these are not the slippers for you . For the money I expected more than just wool over hard rubber . An underlayer of memory foam or something could have made a world of difference . I wo n't be buying these again .
 After only 1 year of infrequent wear , the inside sole of the slipper has no fur left . All that 's left underneath is a plasticky textured sole . I contacted the company about repairing , or replacing and they informed me that I could purchase their insoles and have them permanently stitched in by a cobbler myself , that this has worked for other customers ... so clearly this is a problem with all of them . Not worth the money if you ask me which is sad because I really love my ugg boots and was expecting the same quality for the price .
 i ordered these as a gift for christmas for my mom and they have only been worn for a month and the fur in the shoe is worn out it is flat ... this product did not hold up at all waste of money ...
 There was a mix-up with my original order - I 've sent the wrong order back but have n't heard anything from Mosser 's shoes - they owe me a pair of Uggs Coquettes , chestnut color , size 8 ... Called them again today . I 'm not particularly happy with this transaction confusion and would n't use this again - I 'd just buy locally and avoid all the confusion .
 i preface this by saying i already have 5 pairs of ugg coquette slippers which i adore BUT this transaction was a bummer ... they took forever to come & when they did they were defective -LRB- the logo patches were out of place -RRB- & there was a whole ` dog & pony ' show return process with the vendor ... in the end i did not get my return shipping cost back -LRB- they said there was no defect - yeah right -RRB- & i ended up losing $ 12.00 with no slippers to show for it ... i do want to mention that amazon was wonderful but SHOES CENTRAL was not !
 I got the same exact thing at Target for $ 14.99 ! Do n't be ripped off by these so called `` designers '' !
 i too bought these and thought oooo these will b so comfy and warm well they were warm but comfy not likely . I too like another customer found that the foot bed wore out and now I just walk on a hard plastic footbed . . It looks gross and is truly not what I paid for ... I am just not sure how you can charge over 100 dollars for this product and this is what happens . I highly doubt they are counterfeit as I purchased them from nordstrom . . I also have some very wonderful looking Ugg boots but as luck would have it they kill my feel after a short period of time which leads me to think that there is not arch support which amazes me that a shoe that you pay 300 dollars for would not go the extra yard like say dansko and birkenstock to also want your foot to be happy anyways thought that you should know . thanks
 I received thee cozy and sturdy slippers as a gift late in the fall of 2008 . They looked and felt great , but before the winter was over the heel part of the interior sole became completely worn out in both slippers . For the record , I am 5 ' 7 '' , weigh under 120 lbs , and do not have an unusual gait . I was surprised that an Uggs product would wear out so fast . My last pair of shearling-lined slippers lasted over 15 years -LRB- wish I could remember the brand -RRB- . I wear an 8.5 shoe , the size 9 slipper fit perfectly .
 After debating `` will I '' or `` wo n't I '' buy these slippers , as they are quite expensive for a slipper , I decided to treat myself and ordered them . If all you are looking for is warmth , then these will work -LRB- for about 8 months -RRB- . However be warned they are not soft in ANY way . I could not believe after all the marketing and Hype I have heard about UGG brand that they would produce this slipper . Not even one milimeter of cushion in these babies , not ONE . It is simply sheep fur , glued onto a very hard rubber sole -LRB- much firmer the rubber on your car tires -RRB- . For $ 100.00 I did expect even a little cushion . After one year of wear -LRB- not daily either -RRB- , the fur has worn off on the points of the toes , ball of foot and heel . And now if I wear them , my foot is sitting in a sweaty rubber slipper with fur only on the top part of my foot ... Must be one hell of a marketing team at UGG !!!!! Sorry that I can not reccomend antoher slipper that would be better . . Also , my best friend just bought me another pair , in a different style , and they are even worse ... So I do n't think it is just this slipper , they seem to be just fur glued onto rubber .

 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 I wore these shoes for the first time at work today . The `` sling '' part dug into my heel , and my toes were cramped by the end of the day . Definitely not the most comfortable pair of slingbacks I 've owned !
 The shoes are gorgeous to look at . They go incredibly well with a few of my dresses . But alas , I pay the price for them . I am a 12 to 121/2 but of course I bought the 13 . I figured , well I can not miss with these . Was I ever wrong , the strap at the back is really skinny and then it just presses into your flesh.If you wear it to work you are going to have to be able to take it off .
 The shoe is absolutely beautiful , but like previous writers , the sling cuts into the back of your heel . Not too comfortable , have to use bandaid to get through the workday . I should have brought extra shoes !
 This sling back looks very good and dressy but the sling itself cuts into your feet , the soles of the shoes is poor so you feel every pebble you walk on . I would not recommend this shoe to anyone . I had to give away my own on the first day I wore it .
 The design is very beautiful , but wearing the shoes is quite another . For one , it 's difficult to just slip them on without pantyhose . Even then , the fold in the front pressures top of feet b/c of the narrow space ; the back fold produces an uncomfortable pressure into the back of feet . Lovely design but not made for human feet -LRB- perhaps due to non-leather/stiff materials used to make it -RRB- .
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 They recommended you get your same shoe size , but I did n't believe them and ordered a half size larger . However , even a half size larger was too small . This shoe kind of gapes open and the toggle shoe string sticks up and just looks really weird . It looked really cute in the picture and I was really glad to finally have found a white zumba shoe . But , this is n't the one . I 'll keep looking .
 The shoes are really cute and would probably work for a child who is 4 or 5 but for anyone smaller the elastic strap just does n't hold the foot in the shoe like it should ... the shoe would be far better with a buckle or a velcro closure ... the elastic was just too stretchy and my daughter 's foot would slip out making the shoe unwearable and in my opinion even a little dangerous .
 this is the first and the last time i will order a work boot online again . i have owned wolverine boots in the past and have really like them . these boots just did n't fit very well . i gave them a chance , but no go .
 This shoe was impossibly small , about a full size , which was an expensive shock to me . I had heard that MBT sometimes ran small but since I do not wear socks with sandals , I thought purchasing to the upper end of my normal size would be about right . I wanted these sandals for a vacation trip and was very disappointed to send them back . Also , as I had purchased them from an `` Amazon partner '' not Amazon.com , it was an expensive mistake . It cost me $ 13 to return the item to the storefront seller , `` Heart & Sole . '' Beware of dealing with storefront sellers when purchasing a `` fit item . '' The delivery was ridiculously SLOW , and then the return was costly . Only Amazon.com and Amazon Prime delivery for me .
 Yes I just checked my sandals bought from the same Seller two months ago `` SHOP U Last '' after reading the previous review . I 'm in shock to find OUT that they also sold me a pair of '' Sample not for sale '' sandals . What a bunch of crooked and dishonest people out there . PLEASE Beware of this particular DISHONEST MERCHANT '' SHOP U LAST '' I GIVE YOU AN ADVICE : '' IT DOES NOT PAY TO BE DISHONEST '' .
 I was very upset and dissappointed , I never expected it to happen . When I received the shoes there was a black highlight on the writing and I ignored it . I started to use the shoes the black highlight started to dissappear and the writing started to be clear , I was shocked -LRB- SAMPLE NOT FOR SALE -RRB- I contacted the seller immediately complaining about this issue and I told them if they didnt solve it that I will comlain and her what they replied to me with : Dear customer , We are very sorry for this inconvenience.We buy directly from a local MBT distributor and they sell their over stock merchandise . We were not aware of this situation.For your information it is NOT illegal to sell sample shoes ; actually if you get some of them you can sell them . However it is not your case.We figure out you are out of the United States . Because of this any exchange or return will take time and it would be very expensive.We offer you to keep the sandals and we 'll refund you $ 25 . Please let us know if this would work.Shop Us LastIs it reasonable ???? is it fair to have such a reply from them telling me that it is NOT illegal to sale SAMPLE piece and offering paying me 25 $ back ??? I claimed them on amazon and I posted a negative feedback on them , the day after they e mailed me back with this e mail : Dear customer , We are very sorry for all the inconvenience this has caused you.We 'll cancel this sale and we 'll fully refund your payment for this order.We only appreciate if you consider to remove the negative feedback that already posted.Once again we apologize for any inconvenience.Regards , Shop Us LastI wont delete what I wrote it is the truth and I want the others to be careful to such issues and fight for their rights.Thanks amazon for your fair action I always trusted your site and you never let me downRegards , From the United Arab Emirates , DUBAI
 This was my first pair of MBTs . I was very disappointed . They are not comfortable and are very clunky and awkward to walk in . I really expected more from the brand name MBT . Now I understand the big reduction in price .
 My daughter has barely size 10 feet so thought Size 10-11 would be perfect . NOPE . Her feet hung off by half inch . The 10-11 would be a 8-9 if it was lucky . Gave the sandals 2 stars as they are really pretty - size not so pretty .
 They are true to size . But the width is a little small . I ordered the 9.5 Wide . This is bigger than my shoe size . I bought this size so that I could wear thick socks with them . I ca n't . But a great shoe anyway
 I ordered these as I was getting new carpet and wanted to keep it clean . These covers are very flimsy and very slick . You would not be able to walk on the carpet or flooring with these on and not slip . Would not recommend .
 These shoe covers are not worth getting . They are of very poor quality and some even come pre-broken . They rip when you put them on and can not be relied on to stay on your feet .
 These shoes did not fit at all . They were one whole size smaller , like the manufacturer was trying to save material !?
 Really well crafted sandals that most likely work well if you just wanted them for rafting or water activities but I find them too heavy and rigid to walk in for any long distance and they are way too heavy to pack if you are flying . I was really shocked how heavy they were .
 I ordered these to match a wedding dress . The color in real is not the same as pictured . the shoe is a comfortable shoe and for a great price . If it 's still available I may exchange for a black one .
 My Mom wanted these shoes . She has a terrible time getting shoes that fit her feet . Aways before there was no problem but this time the quality was definitely poorer ! The part of the shoe that fits around her ankle is loose and does n't fit well . . she is quite disappointed ! and they are made in China ... that bites too ! She does n't plan on buying another pair !
 I purchased these shoes because they came wide , and I have a wide forefoot and bunions . Unfortunately , the heels on these shoes are as wide as the front of the shoe , and I could not lace them up enough to keep the heels from slipping . I have never seen such a wide heel on any shoe . Why do shoe makers assume your entire foot is wide ? These shoes might work for someone with swollen feet or a very wide foot all over , but they did not fit me at all in the heel . They are not as clunky as many wide shoes , and the leather was soft . I am returning the shoes , and continuing my quest for a wide , decent-looking shoe with a normal heel width .
 I have a hard time finding shoes that fit with my high arches . I hesitate to order tennis shoes because most of them are poorly designed -- they are designed to kill your ankles , rub them raw when walking , and damage your achilles tendon . This shoe is just another example
 Warehouse has shipped me the identical , wrong size 3 times ! Granted , they sent me a free return lable 3 times , but having ordered these in early Dec. and had to return 3 , plus 3 calls to customer service , may be the last FootSmart product I buy .
 These boots are hard to get on my son 's foot . I have to help him and he has to angle his foot just right . -LRB- He 's 5 1/2 yo -RRB- He complains they do n't keep his feet warm and they 're not comfortable . He 's not a complainer so they must be pretty uncomfortable for him to even mention it . I bought a size larger -LRB- for extra socks etc -RRB- but the boots seem to run small . The larger size fit with no extra room .
 The part the makes to shoes `` cute '' is the interchangeable color slides that go on the sides of the shoe . I bought thoes for my 9 year old for cheerleading and had to order a womens 6 because they run small . The shoes are not leather and cheaply made . She has wore them 3 weeks and they are falling apart !!
 My Mom wanted these shoes . She has a terrible time getting shoes that fit her feet . Aways before there was no problem but this time the quality was definitely poorer ! The part of the shoe that fits around her ankle is loose and does n't fit well . . she is quite disappointed ! and they are made in China ... that bites too ! She does n't plan on buying another pair !

 Hard to believe these are real Rockports . Was the price a giveaway?nless you wont be walking mucvh in these they are much too thin with no enough support . No padding , just the one layer of shoe upper ! Not reccommended for those who plan to actually walk .

 Item was described as a leather shoe it was a fabric shoe , would have preferred leather . Wished item was described correctly , I would not have purchased a fabric shoe in lt. pink . Misleading advertisement .
 I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed . The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy . I would not recommend this shoe to anyone .

 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 They are gigantic even when I ordered my regular boot size . I like the style but they are so stiff just could n't keep them .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 I was considering to buy this handbag , but I did n't buy it because of the very vague description of it . The most important lacking information is the dimensions of the bag . Why would they state the shipping weight and NOT the dimensions of this handbag ? It does n't make sense to me .
 I thought these would be a great idea since I recently had the tops of both feet tattooed , so I ordered two pair . I wore one pair to work for about 4 hours and the adhesive came off the shoe in large areas . It was enough that I could n't wear them the next day . I figured maybe I just got a defective pair so I wore the second pair out to a local club . I was only wearing them for about 2 hours and I was sitting for most of that time . The adhesive came off of them as well . The second pair also made my feet sweat so that they came off my feet constantly . I also wanted to say that you do feel the adhesive the entire time you wear these shoes . I would n't recommend these for anyone .
 Very disappointing to get these shoes . We were told specifically to order the same size as street shoes and this is clearly wrong . They are two sizes too small . Hope this is corrected for others . The shoes also do n't look nearly as nice as the picture .

 I bought these shoes to see if they would help ease some back pain at work . No luck yet . I also find the scuffed up toes disappointing . The literature on these shoes certainly falls into the too good to be true category for me.Moreover , I was surprised by all the packaging for these things . Two boxes , paper and canvas bags for each of them certainly seems excessive for a shoe claiming to be earth friendly . I prefer my Merrells .

 I hate to downgrade Merrell as they make great shoes , this being my 4th pair . Tried these on locally and then ordered through Amazon , the 11.5 D -LRB- M -RRB- , I noticed right away the right shoe was more narrow then the left . When I took the insoles out , the right insole had more of an upward curve where the shoe is more narrow . So now my left foot is comfortable and my right one is hanging off the side ... Checked and they 're both the same size . Oh well , other than that the shoes are nice . Now I am stuck paying twice the shipping and wondering whether or not to reorder or get something else.I would n't care too much about quality assurance either if I was being payed 50 cents an hour .
 Size not true to US standards . I bought them as a gift for my husband . The pair received was at least a 1/2 size smaller that he usually wears . As these were sent to an APO/AE military address , I was not able to return them . I guess no more ordering shoes over the internet .
 This boot was fabulous for the first 50 miles or so . Then all of a sudden the sole gave way and I could feel every single rock and pebble . Unfortunately this happened during a 20 mile hike and I had about 10 miles to go . I hated and cursed Merrell every step of the way . I will never buy something with the word `` Vibram '' on it . EVER .
 I bought these shoes a year ago and have taken them out on hikes ranging from a few hours to a 6 day backpacking trip in Colorado . Overall I would say that the construction is very poor . After a few months of hiking in these the soles started to separate and the stitching started to come undone . The insole is no better than a thin sheet of cardboard would be and had to be replaced immediately . At one time Merrell 's made good shoes , but the construction and cutting corners has made their shoes good for short hikes and maybe yard work . For me , these shoes were pitched in the trash after I took them on a six day backpacking trip in Colorado . These shoes ruined my trip by causing several blisters and bruises . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone .
 These boots are not true to fit ... the width is too narrow . Makes for an uncomfortable fit . Too bad otherwise a nice boot .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 These shoes are really nice and very comfortable . The problem is that they are listed as being leather uppers , but the shoes I received were all man made materials . If they had been leather I would have kept them .

 Absolutely love this pair of sandals . I got my first one from a local dept store and got the second one from Amazon . I was planning on getting 3 more had the size been available . I was lucky there was one left when I ordered . Very comfortable and got a lot of compliments from friends . Its classic design will never get old . I hope I can find some from other websites .

 I ordered these boots as a Christmas Gift for my son who desperately needed boots , after exhausting searches my husband and I found these sold by Sportsman Guide , within a month the seams split open on the pair . I will not purchase another pair . If you have extra money to spend on boots each month , then these are the boots to purchase . In addition , I lost the receipt and therefore have to send a copy of the bank statement PROVING we bought these in order to get our money back . Hopefully the Sportsman Guide will reimburse us and stand by their warranty .
 Bought these boots from another sports chain store and they lasted about one month . The upper rubber part started to leak water in the seams . I have purchased other rubber boots in the pasted with no issues . Stay away from these boots .
 The boots leaked when I stepped in an inch of water on opening day of deer hunting . Sent back for refund
 Trying to get a replacement ... the boots are warm , I just think my pair had a defect in them , as they leaked the second time out ... real warm up until that point though .
 I wish I could give them -5 stars.I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $ 170 should be really good . I could n't be more wrong . The lining of these shoes started falling apart just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day !!! Stay away at all cost !

 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Be aware that this shoe -- in a WIDE - is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide . The shoe runs narrow . However , it does come in an Extra Wide . Although the shoe has little to no arch support , it is , nevertheless a `` dressy '' alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet .
 Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking , exercise , etc. . I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D , unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough . Liked the look but it 's not for me .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 I know that people say that they are so comfortable . But you wan na know what makes me feel comfortable ? Well , i 'm going to tell you , not wearing ugly shoes , thats what . I go to lesbian bars all of the time and I see people wearing these things and I ca n't help but ask myself `` why ca n't I be straight ? why , god ? why ? ''
 Bought these for my girlfreind who wears a womans size 8 in normal shoes . When she got them she had trouble getting them on and after wearing them only a few times the back ripped wide open . It was too late to return them , but I thought I would get her another pair -LRB- exactly the same -RRB- and she said they felt a little looser when puting them on . She has been wearing the second pair for a few months now with no issues .
 These boots were way too big . Im a size 7.5 and I ordered a size 6 . I should have ordered a size 5 . Im also afraid these boots may be a really good knockoff . The sticker proves that its not real and the box didnt even come with a little brochure about the shoe . I would not suggest to buy these boots . Im really mad and Im returning these boots . Im buying these from a different user .
 These are not real uggs . I ordered them in chestnut color and the color is totally off the original uggs . also the inside fur comes out when you put your feet in . I have a pair of REAL UGGS and these are nothing like them . Beware and do n't waste your time buying these !!!
 I ordered these Uggs based on the review from other customers . I was very disappointed . The uggs i ordered in chestnut color were off the normal chestnut color of uggs . Also the fur inside was rough and came out when i put my feet in them . I believe these are knock offs . i do not recommend these .
 they do n't fit like the other colors . . i ca n't get my foot into them ... i have black , beige & chestnut & they fit fine ... the grey are a very bad fit
 they make your foot look big and your ankle look so small and they are hard to get on your foot .
 I bought these for my daughter and when she put them I noticed the label on one boot was upside down . These boots are expensive and I feel this error is unacceptable .
 These are adult size 6 boots , not toddler size . What a pain . I like to order online but this is one of those times when in store would be better ! I love Uggs so at least gave 2 stars as the product is not the problem here !
 My boots were a great buy , i thought , until they ripped . No idea why , or how but they did . So now i have ripped boots sitting in my closet , that i ca n't wear . Not so good .
 It looks great ! But my toddler will not be able to wear them in the next 3 years I guess ... This is no toddler size . I had a hard time figuring out the size , and it turns out I actually have n't been able to figure it out . And I have n't pulled myself together to return it yet . It 's just a pain .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .

 Absolutely love this pair of sandals . I got my first one from a local dept store and got the second one from Amazon . I was planning on getting 3 more had the size been available . I was lucky there was one left when I ordered . Very comfortable and got a lot of compliments from friends . Its classic design will never get old . I hope I can find some from other websites .
 I needed a pair of sandals and decided to try on the dreaded Birkenstock . As I was going to Italy for the summer , I wanted to get something that I could both wear to the beach and use to walk on rocky shores and on streets back to the house . well I took one look in the mirror and the image of my white foot in that sandal evoked Robert Powell as Jesus in Franco Zeffirelli 's classic biographical film of 1977 . I wondered to myself and asked the sales person if I might be able to walk on water as well as on sand with what was easily the ugliest pair of shoes I ever wore . My less aesthetically inclined friend decided to buy them and wore them everywhere . In Milan many people stared at the Jesus Water Walkers -LRB- that 's what they should be called as in Milano you wo n't be very popular when you try to get in to La Scala wearing them -RRB- and quite frankly even on the beaches of Nerano , or hiking near Positano these sandals evoked nothing but messianic visions of the passion as depicted in Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel and the scent of fermenting milk from the Mozzarella production centers in Massalubrense . I will concede these ` milano ' sandals are confortable and that 's why they get two stars . However , the more practical and eye-pleasing simple mocassins I bought instead were cheaper and allowed me to run faster , protected my toes while walking in rocky areas and on city streets -LRB- from the dust and dirt -RRB- . I could also wear them to La Scala for the premiere and the Sabatini restaurant for an elegant dinner . So before you decide to announce to the world who you 're favorite prophet in history is through your footwear - making everyone wonder if you can in fact also walk on water -LRB- something that you might need given the dirt and gunk your feet will accumulate with these beauties strapped on -RRB- consider more practical and attractive alternatives .
 I wish I could give them -5 stars.I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $ 170 should be really good . I could n't be more wrong . The lining of these shoes started falling apart just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day !!! Stay away at all cost !
 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT

 There is only one problem with the boot , that is , it is too hard to pull on and off . Other than that I like the boot , it 's comfortable and looks good . Next time I will get the one with the zipper .
 I never wanted to write one of these , but I feel I have to . I bought these boots , they were great , but one size too big . So I tried to exchange them . Amazon does n't do exchanges ... apparently too difficult . On top of this , the price doubled after I bought them , so now if I want the boots , Amazon will not honor the previous price . This is something that any dime store would do , but apparently one of the world 's largest online retailers could n't . This is very disappointing , and I would never recomend this company to anyone ... ever ... quite the opposite .
 Item is not authentic . Kenneth Cole is all I wear and those shoes are not Kenneth Cole .
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .

 They are true to size . But the width is a little small . I ordered the 9.5 Wide . This is bigger than my shoe size . I bought this size so that I could wear thick socks with them . I ca n't . But a great shoe anyway

 Runs short and narrow for me . I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 Well , the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue . My mother could not wear these shoes . On top of that , it costs $ 12.50 to mail them back , and if you want to exchange them , the company -LRB- Heart and Sole Shoes -RRB- charges $ 8 for this . My mothers needs new shoes , though , and so I sent it . As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order . Today , I got the $ 8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing , just a hand-scrawled &#34; N.A. Refund &#34; next to my request for a refund . Well , okay , I 'll take a refund then , and write off the hassle and the return cost . BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND ?!?!? It 's ordering by the Internet , and so this should be easy to do . What a lousy experience . I 'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again .
 I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them . Now the D width is too tight , especially on my left foot . The shoes will be returned .
 I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe . The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes . The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway .
 i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought !!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
 always wear 9 1/2 Med , these shoes were almost two sizes larger , I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately .
 I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .
 I have never seen shoes so narrow ! I could n't even get my foot in the shoe . So , if you have narrow feet , I would recommend to not order the narrow size but , instead , the next width size up.Also , as an extra heads up , if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes -LRB- where these were from -RRB- and need to return the shoes for a refund , make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs -LRB- cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes -RRB- . I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs -LRB- on the email sent to you from them -RRB- was unclear and the communication from them -LRB- when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs -RRB- was terse .
 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .

 I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times . Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow ! What happened ?
 I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit . This time , the same size , 6M did not fit , they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes , I looked inside my old shoes to find the size , I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful , just what I was looking for , but not a good fit .
 I really loved these shoes when I first got them , but within my first couple times of wearing them the plastic piece on my right heal starting popping off . The heal is completely hollow . Naturally it popped off while I was walking the other day and I lost the plastic piece forever . I really liked the shoes , but they did n't last more than two months .
 The shoes have a really cool look to them . I was looking for something like this to match my gothic lolita outfits . However they broke immediately after I bought them and walked down the stairs . The strap came off , like it was just attached with glue . That was a huge disappointment . Another thing is that they have no traction so I was sliding all over the place.If you 're buying cheap shoes , expect cheap results ...
 I ordered these in my normal size but they fit horribly . I bought them for an outfit so I wore them for one night . These shoes actually damaged my large toe on both feet to the point where I had to see a doctor . Eventually both toenails fell off from the damage done . These went in the trash .
 They 're cheap , what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet . NONE.Need to break them in or they 'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by . . Brash , I think . They 're much better quality and cheaper as well .
 This boot has a leather shoe with a stretch man made shaft . The sole is man made rubber and very flexible . Overall this boot is comfortable . But do n't buy these if you want to wear them . The heel of the boot became detached the first time I wore these . Not the quality you expect from a Clark .
 I purchased these boots on line and was a little disappointed with the size . I ordered a size 8.5 and they feel more like a 9.5 . I ordered these boots due to the fact that Clarks makes the most comfortable shoes and I have purchased quite a few on line in Canada . With these boots it was diappointing and I ordered it from what I thought was a store and yet the address was supposedly from a gentleman 's address . Do n't think I will be purchasing anything from here again . Really a huge disappointment .
 I bought these boots from a retailer besides Amazon . They are great looking boots , very comfortable after wearing all day , but the quality is terrible ! One of the seams on the front right side of the boot just ripped all the way down after wearing maybe 5 times ! Definitely not what you would expect from Clarks !
 My girlfriend ordered me the cherry red 1914 UK 9 's `` supposed to be US M 10 but received US 11 Ladies . this was a xmas present and they have to be sent back because they are NOT mens and THEY do not FIT . they are truely a womans boot a man can not not wear them . when you click on the black they are correct but the red are not . i am very disappointed and will be sending them back and ordering a pair on the Dr. Martain Website
 I was excited to order these beautiful Doc Martens boots thinking that this old established brand was making a fine product . Instead , I paid $ 120 for boots with unfinished , non-lined leather that rubs off on my socks , a small unfinished , non-lined tongue that slips to one side and also rubs off on my socks , and though adequately sized , lack padding and hurt my toes and are simply not comfortable . They certainly look and sound good in your marketing material , though .
 Love this style and LOVE these boots !!! But I normally wear 7.5 US sized womens shoes and ordered 6UK/39EU/8US and they were a size too big but WAY too tight around my foot . PLUS stiff as a BOARD !!! I read that it was really hard to get them worn in , but OMG ! Guess I will have to find my perfect Docs in a store where I can try them on and make sure its not going to take the rest of my life to wear them in ... Very disappointed that these did n't work out for me : -LRB-
 I was very disappointed when I received these boots . They are now made in china -LRB- not too surprising guess -RRB- and made out of the toughest piece of leather ive come across.They were rediculously stiff , even for a new boot -LRB- I have several other pairs of leather boots lace up and non and none of them were as bad as these when new -RRB- Overall I would not recommend these boots , you can order the english made ones else where Id try that or buy a different brand
 I got these as a gift for my wife . She loves them , the soft foot bed is great , extremely comfortable . She had a bargain pair before but these are a step above.The seller however is horrible . They 'll let you place orders and even charge your card but a week or two later send an email saying they are `` out of stock '' and will refund your money . Not good for Christmas shopping . I ended up at a local retailer .
 I wanted Birkentstock Boston Black Shoes.They came , but in SUADEI would never have ordered suade.Many times I find the Amazon product description inadequate.I spend many hours trying to figure whether the description shows the product I want to order.Now , looking , I did not see the same page as when I ordered.LIke virtually every other time , I am unwilling to go through the trouble it takes to return.I will wear these and next time I will be extra extra careful.Disappointed , Karl Loren
 Birkenstock does indeed make `` high-arch '' shoes . I own several pair , and I live in them because I have problem feet . When I saw these clogs called `` high-arch '' I was ecstatic ! But , they are NOT high-arch Birkenstocks , which have extra high arches , with the words HIGH ARCH actually printed in the shoes . So , these have to go back . What a disappointment!Yes , I know I can get the real deal from Birkenstock , but in one color only . I was so excited that I could -LRB- I thought -RRB- get them in different colors.Amazon -- please change your description for these clogs .
 These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size . I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks . The shoe literally slipped of my foot .
 The boot has a great heel and sole , and the price is good for a work boot . That is the plus side . The negatives are the country of origin is not listed and the boot leather is very thin . I returned my purchase after opening the box and thinking that these are not durable enough for farm work .

 I really do like the Naturalizer Mae Loafers and would like to get my hands on a few more pairs ... but this seller sold me the totally wrong shoe ... some really big zebra-like high heel . Not sure what happened to the shoe I ordered . I immediately returned the product .

 I purchased these as a gift for a friend and after a week of wear , both slippers fell apart at the seams ! These are very poorly constructed and should actually be taken off the market . I wanted to rate them 0 stars but the site made me select at least 1 in order to complete this review .

 One of the shoes contains scratch mark on it . And to my surprise , most of the upper is made of man-made material with a little bit leather . But the instruction said the upper is made of leather . I 'm very disappointed .
 These shoes are adorable ! ... but I had the worse blisters I have ever had after wearing them . I have tried wearing them a few times but they are so uncomfortable that I ca n't even break them in .
 i work in the army an for only 2 weeks , this boot fell a part , dont waste your money with this low quality product .
 I Purchased these 4/23/09 , today 6/02/09 the bottom of my sole just fell apart . Unfortunately I havent even broken these in and yes , they have just started to fall apart .
 I ordered these boots for general use . Thought they looked pretty good.When I received them it became clear they are poorly made . The sole it not attached to the upper well . The insole is paper thin and poorly made . Very uncomfortable boot.I would spend my money elsewhere .
 I was looking for boots like the ones issued by the Marines . This boot has a heel plate that just about tears apart your foot as you slip it on . No thank you . This is made for someone into pain ! The shoelace started falling apart after I laced them up the first time . Sizes run BIG .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 Sandal did not hold up . Had the sandals for 1 week . I caught my foot in the door and one sandal ripped . Who do you send them back to ? The sandals are very comfortable but are not made to last .

 I loved my sandals so much . I did n't overwear - in fact I only wore them out about two times other than going to get the mail.In under a month the glue was coming off and I had to spend five minutes picking glue off my feet so I wrote to the distributor I bought them from and received the following response : The life of the sandals depends on many factors . It is normal for the glueto break down eventually and start to come off the sandal . Usually it willcome up around the toes and around the edge of your feet . This does n'taffect the use of the sandals , but it can leave behind a little residue.They are not perfect , after all they are sandals with glue on them . That ` salso why they do n't cost very much . We are n't involved with themanufacturing process at all and therefore have no control over the designor quality of the product . We buy them from the factory and resell them.We are a primary distributor for the US and Canada and mainly sellwholesale.In my opinion , the amount of use you can get out of a pair before they needto be replaced and the attention they draw from other people when you wearthem , out weighs the issues that may arise while wearing them -LRB- residue onyour feet -RRB- and for only $ 10 you ca n't complain.The way your skin reacts to the glue , where you wear them -LRB- sand , dirt , gravel , grass , etc. . . -RRB- how you care for them , all affect the life of thesandals . I have seen people wear them out in less than 30 days and I haveseen people that have had them for 2 years . Hope this helps answer yourquestions . Thank you for your interest in Topless Sandals .
 They stayed on for a few minutes around the house , so I wore them to go to the store . I did n't even get across the parking lot before they started coming loose , and then they came completely off walking in the store . After reapplying , it happened again . As per instructions they were clean and dry all the time .
 Got the sandals today and am already disappointed . The instructions say you should clean them by washing and brushing after 2 wearings . Who wants to clean their shoes that often . It seems that they might be useful for catching large rats though .
 What a great idea for sandals that stay on your feet without plastic straps . I was so excited to try these out for a beach vacation . I was so excited that I bought 2 pair . They came in the mail and I followed all directions . But they would even stay on as I walked around the house . I gave the other pair to my sister . She had the same trouble !!! She went to class and ended up on the campus bus barefoot because the stupid things would n't stay .
 I sent mine back -- the toe is REALLY LONG
 I work for a leading package delivery service and am always looking for nice looking , sturdy , and comfortable footwear . This shoe was so hard that it could not flex in all the places a shoes needs to in order to be comfortable . With each step my feet would send messages to my brain that went `` oooch , ouch , oooch , ouch . '' Too bad I had to return them because they looked great with my uniform !
 Looks ok . Insole is poorly cushioned . I bought these about a month ago
 The slippers looked good when I got them and still do after more than 3 months of frequent use . However , the initial snug fit is now very loose . Very loose ! More annoying , the bottom lining has separated and is crumpled up near the toes . Using an inner sole helps , but for the price , that really should n't be necessary .
 Ran small and tight across vamp . Returned for larger size but still to tight across the vamp . Returned second pair for refund . Sorry they did not fit , nice quality .
 I bought these for my husband for Christmas and he thought they were great , very comfortable , good fit , did n't slip off his heels . But in less than a month , the lining of the toe area of BOTH slippers fell apart , noticed when small pieces of the foam lining were coming out . Very disappointing for what we thought was a nice high quality slipper .
 My husband found the heel area to be too wide and foot kept coming out ... returned them . Nothing very special anyway .

 these are the most uncomfortable boots I have ever owned . the tongue is so wide it wraps around your ankle and digs into your ankle bone . no way to fold it to keep it away . but they should never wear out . after an hour a day for six months trying to break them in they are still stiff and hard to wear . I would not recomend these to anyone .

 Reasonably priced boots . Purchased these boots to replace a pair of Tingley insulated rubber boots that I had used for at least 15 years . The leather uppers offer no support . The removable liner is nice but seems way too soft . Seems like it will be difficult to use these boots to work in .

 Cute shoes , but extremely uncomfortable . I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes . I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair . I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned . This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit . I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big , it 's a catch 22 .
 The overall fit of these shoes were fine , however they were way too narrow and I have a narrow foot ! My toes hung off the edge and I had to return them .

 I am returning my shoes . Although they are attractive to look at , they do n't stay on my feet . The section of the shoe that creates the `` slide '' is too small and too low on the foot so the shoe slips off with every other step or so . If the slide came up higher on the foot or was just a little larger , they would be fine . I have another pair of slides just like this so I know it is n't the style of the shoe ; the problem is with this specific design .

 The shoe you get is a different version of the persuade in black leather . The bow is made of patent and patent embellishment all around the rim of the shoe . If you google , you will find that version . The one pictured here is NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET .
 The product sent was not as depicted . One model was shown on site and an entirely different model was delivered . I have vowed never to order shoes on line again .

 I usually love Naughty Monkey shoes ! The quality is always top notch and the designs are so different . I really loved the color and look of these shoes . However , they are made of some kind of basket weave straw materical or something . When I got them out of the box they were already kind of falling apart near the sole and heel . I could just imagine with a couple wears they would just get worse . I take care of my shoes and I have a shoe man who resoles , cleans , patches and puts new tips on my heels . He would not have been able to fix these .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 Shoes seemed comfortable so I have purchased to wear them in the office . The quality was so shoddy - I will never purchase another pair of Florsheim shoes.I have worn them only in a car driving to work and in the office . Still , in 2-3 days the spray-on laquer started to peel of from soles . After 3 weeks or so sole of one shoe desintegrated , cracked . Just imagine , wearing those shoes in the street - would they even last several hours?Could be just one `` unlucky '' pair ...
 The flip flops are not in any way as good as the older `` Sugar Flip Flop '' . I have searched all over to find the older kind . They molded to your foot and were extremely comfortable . This new flip flop makes lots of noise when walking and does not mold to the foot . If you can tell me where to find the older `` Sugars '' , I would appreciate it.Thanks
 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 Because I 'm an avid runner that can pretty much use any neutral shoe , thought I would run in this shoe with no problems . I found that the top stitching in the toe-box was weird and pressed up against my foot . Overall they were surprisingly uncomfortable . However , if you are looking for a shoe to just walk around in or do some light exercise , this one seems okay .
 These boots are very nice . Too bad that I cant fit them . I wear a size 10 and they were too small . My girlfriend who wears an 8 fits them perfectly . I gave the boots to her for a gift . I would definitely recommend ordering a size up !
 The shoes were the ones my niece wanted for Christmas , although it did not fit her because the size advertized on the website -LRB- size 5 -RRB- is Men 's size although the shoes are obviously women 's shoes , It is clearly labeled size 5 Men on the box and some other equivalent women size -LRB- 9 -RRB- which is too big for my niece . If it was properly labeled we would not have purchased them . The store did the refund/return properly no complaints there . My niece simply did get her gift on Christmas .

 Horible , I orderd these late december . two weeks later i get them in the mail . i got one size 13 and one size 10 , how that happens i dont know , but they dont email back an when they do its gunna take a loooooooong time . i shipped back my shoes and almost 3 weeks later havent got 1 email or recived my shoes . if i could punch someone threw a computer , it would be them !
 Still have n't received it . Received one that is too wide . I returned it . I 'm waiting for the one with the correct size .
 So I ordered these shoes , thinking they would look just like the picture . I was wrong , they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver . I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw . The shoes were not only the color I did n't want , but also HUGE , WIDE & not what I expected . They came in a nice box though , but besides that I would not Buy these . I was so disappointed & I paid $ 71.00 for these ? There 's So many shoes out there ... that you can BUY for less . . & look just as good . I should n't ' have paid this much for these shoes . .
 Very good the shoes I recommend 100 % , thank you very much .
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 I 've bought several pairs of Kenneth Cole Unlisted shoes . I like the designs and the low prices . But that ends there . The shoe outsoles are really cheap quality . My new pair lasted less than 3 months and the sole on my right shoe literally split open . I do not wear the same shoe every day . I guess I wore the Unlisted pair about twice a week , with the most heavy walking from the parking lot to the office . These shoes may look nice , but the rubber sole is really really poor quality . AVOID THE SHOES !
 Even though it 's only $ 30 , I would save the money and get shoes that would actually last . Unlisted is not worth it . The material is cheap , the build quality is cheap , and it is n't that comfortable . If you want to get formal/dress shoes , I would go for a higher quality one ; it 's not worth skimping on . If you want something by Kenneth Cole , get the Reactions , they are far superior . $ 60 - $ 70 should get you a good pair .
 they look cool , but there are two problems .1 -RRB- . the manmade material fades at the creases right away .2 -RRB- . they HURT . not comfortable at all .
 It 's a very cheap material that you often see selling in flea market.After 1 day wear , I dumped them in garbage can -LRB- first I planned donate them to Salvation Army but feel bad for people who would receive them so I threw them out in garbage -RRB- . It will hurt your foot and looked so stupid in reality _ absolutely not like in picture shown.Never buy shoes online or at least not by Unlisted name .

 UPDATE : I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear , so this is an update after 6 months of wear . This is my first pair of Danner boots . I wear them everyday , sometimes all day . They have been worn on a 5 mile hike and around the office . I have had them in water . I have provided no care -LRB- polish , oil , waterproofing , etc. -RRB- Overall , I am disappointed in these boots for the price . I bought them because they are `` Made In The USA '' and because there are so many good reviews and anecdotal stories of people having their Danner boots for decades with great satifaction . I do n't see that happening with these boots for me . These are well crafted , but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.APPEARANCE : They look just as they do in the image . The image provided is representative . I have worn them to the office with khakis and have gotten compliments from clients . I have n't tried to polish them , yet.LEATHER : Very Poor !! At first , I was surprised how soft the leather was and how very little break-in was necessary . However , this is because the leather is so thin there is nothing to break-in . Additionally , they have put some sort of rubberized coating on the leather . It almost seems like a latex paint . Because of this , the coloring is unnatural appearing . Out of the box it gives the boots a soft comfortable feel . It does n't take long to realize this is merely superficial . It has mostly scraped off the toe of the boot with very light use . The only other time I have seen this is on a pair of VERY cheap boots I bought from K-Mart while I was in college . I bought these boots to last me for years . They 're not going to make it . The leather is garbage and very disappointing for such an expensive boot.OUT-SOLES : Best thing about the boots . Quality Vibram soles as you would expect . They are a typical lug with a middle layer of well-cushioned rubber similar , but more dense than that found on running shoes . The Vibram part is really only the outer most layer . This has worn very well . I question whether the mid-sole cushioning is going to last.LACING :5 eyelets , 4 hooks , 1 eyelet . Simple . The laces are a typical nylon braid found on most utility boots . There have been no problems keeping them laced up . Once tied up they stay that way for the day.INSIDE : They are lined with a nylon fabric simply to serve as a barrier between the wearer 's foot and the Gore-tex . It seems to be holding up well . There are n't any leaks . I have had them up to the ankle in a creek or two . They come with a heal-cup type insert . This is made of a soft plastic material . The inserts are annoying in that they have to be re-positioned every time you put the boots on . Note , these are not insulated boots.COMFORT and SUPPORT : Surprisingly comfortable for the lack of support . The cushioning in the sole contributes to that . I find the heal inserts to help . I have n't tried them without the inserts . But , frankly , these boots should come with quality inserts with arch support that runs the length of the boot -- especially for that price ! On the one 5 mile hike I did with these , they did n't cut it . My feet were very sore in the end and there is zero ankle support . Admittedly , these are not hiking boots , but 5 miles over pretty moderate terrain is hardly a hike.SIZING : They seem perfectly true to size and width . There is no heal slippage and there is plenty of room in the toe-box , but not so much so that my feet are sliding around.PRICING : Far overpriced for the materials.Sadly , I 'll never buy Danner again . I have a pair of Red Wing 2218 Lineman boots and they are much better boot with regard to durability and materials . Consider the Red Wing 4585 or 214 before you buy these .
 I thought these slippers were so cute that I ordered them in a size 6 A2 . I was very disappointed when I tried them on to find them extremely wide . There is no way that these slippers will fit someone with a narrow foot . They felt like squishy marshmallows . I returned them for a refund .

 I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years . Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use . The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked . There is no fix for a cracked sole . The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned , and are in great shape . Because the sole is cracked , the boots are worthless . Save your money and look for a different brand boot .

 I ordered an `` 8 1/2 W '' which is my usual size , although I can wear an 8 average width as well as an 8 1/2 average width sometimes , depending on how the shoes are made . These shoes are beautiful , lightweight - which I really wanted - and a fabulous price . But they are NOT the size I ordered , even though the box lists them as the correct size . They are at least 1 size smaller and instead of being wide as I ordered , they ca n't possibly be that width . I am so disappointed . I have to order all my personal clothing and shoes from online since I ca n't go out without someone pushing me in a wheelchair , which is very difficult to arrange . Have you ever felt like crying out of frustration ? It 's hard enough to find quality clothing and shoes at affordable prices , without then having been mislabeled . Or perhaps Naturalizer sizesNaturalizer Women 's Montealto Strappy Sandaltheir shoes unlike other brand names ? If so , I 'd like to know so I wo n't waste the effort and money on ordering that brand again .

I do n't see that happening with these boots for me . These are well crafted , but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.APPEARANCE : They look just as they do in the image . The image provided is representative . I have worn them to the office with khakis and have gotten compliments from clients . I have n't tried to polish them , yet.LEATHER : Very Poor !! At first , I was surprised how soft the leather was and how very little break-in was necessary . However , this is because the leather is so thin there is nothing to break-in . Additionally , they have put some sort of rubberized coating on the leather . It almost seems like a latex paint . Because of this , the coloring is unnatural appearing . Out of the box it gives the boots a soft comfortable feel . It does n't take long to realize this is merely superficial . It has mostly scraped off the toe of the boot with very light use . The only other time I have seen this is on a pair of VERY cheap boots I bought from K-Mart while I was in college . I bought these boots to last me for years . They 're not going to make it . The leather is garbage and very disappointing for such an expensive boot.OUT-SOLES : Best thing about the boots . Quality Vibram soles as you would expect . They are a typical lug with a middle layer of well-cushioned rubber similar , but more dense than that found on running shoes . The Vibram part is really only the outer most layer . This has worn very well . I question whether the mid-sole cushioning is going to last.LACING :5 eyelets , 4 hooks , 1 eyelet . Simple . The laces are a typical nylon braid found on most utility boots . There have been no problems keeping them laced up . Once tied up they stay that way for the day.INSIDE : They are lined with a nylon fabric simply to serve as a barrier between the wearer 's foot and the Gore-tex . It seems to be holding up well . There are n't any leaks . I have had them up to the ankle in a creek or two . They come with a heal-cup type insert . This is made of a soft plastic material . The inserts are annoying in that they have to be re-positioned every time you put the boots on . Note , these are not insulated boots.COMFORT and SUPPORT : Surprisingly comfortable for the lack of support . The cushioning in the sole contributes to that . I find the heal inserts to help . I have n't tried them without the inserts . But , frankly , these boots should come with quality inserts with arch support that runs the length of the boot -- especially for that price ! On the one 5 mile hike I did with these , they did n't cut it . My feet were very sore in the end and there is zero ankle support . Admittedly , these are not hiking boots , but 5 miles over pretty moderate terrain is hardly a hike.SIZING : They seem perfectly true to size and width . There is no heal slippage and there is plenty of room in the toe-box , but not so much so that my feet are sliding around.PRICING : Far overpriced for the materials.Sadly , I 'll never buy Danner again . I have a pair of Red Wing 2218 Lineman boots and they are much better boot with regard to durability and materials . Consider the Red Wing 4585 or 214 before you buy these .
 UPDATE : I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear , so this is an update after 6 months of wear . This is my first pair of Danner boots .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .

 These boots have zero insoles whatsoever which make them extremely uncomfortable . Literally they are one step above a rubber rain slicker . I paid $ 24 for the boots , $ 5 for shipping , and another $ 8 for insoles with arche supports . They are not worth the asking price as I have seen better boots selling locally for $ 25-30 . I give them 2 stars because they are warm , and waterproof .

Note , these are not insulated boots.COMFORT and SUPPORT : Surprisingly comfortable for the lack of support . The cushioning in the sole contributes to that . I find the heal inserts to help . I have n't tried them without the inserts . But , frankly , these boots should come with quality inserts with arch support that runs the length of the boot -- especially for that price ! On the one 5 mile hike I did with these , they did n't cut it . My feet were very sore in the end and there is zero ankle support . Admittedly , these are not hiking boots , but 5 miles over pretty moderate terrain is hardly a hike.SIZING : They seem perfectly true to size and width . There is no heal slippage and there is plenty of room in the toe-box , but not so much so that my feet are sliding around.PRICING : Far overpriced for the materials.Sadly , I 'll never buy Danner again . I have a pair of Red Wing 2218 Lineman boots and they are much better boot with regard to durability and materials . Consider the Red Wing 4585 or 214 before you buy these .
 one shoe was wider than the other . The foot I needed to be wider has a bunion so it did not fit . I liked the shoe but would not chance again ordering on line since it has been such a hastle to return
 Appeared to be nice however after wearing once for about 6 hours both inserts are peeling out . Very poorly made and really not worth the money .
 I 've worn Stephanie Soft Spots for over 15 years . They 're my favorite work shoe , and I have them in navy , black , white , and recently used leather paint to make a red pair ! Recently ordered 2 pair in size 12 and when they arrived they practically fell off my feet ! WHY OH WHY did they change their sizing ? Decided to send back for 2 size 11 's -- too small . Will try for 11-1/2 . Very disappointed that a product that 's been consistently perfect all these years has undergone a manufacturing change .
 I purchased these shoes because I was looking for a comfotable shoe . I am on my feet a great deal of time . I received them in January . Within three months , the right heel had collapsed internally . So if I wear them the left heel is fine and the right heel sinks down and throws me off balance . These shoes are now to dangerous to wear . Why would this shoes fail this way ? I have never had a pair of shoes do this . I think the company should replace them with a more reliable shoe .
 Size I always order was way to big . Sent it back and requested a smaller size .3 1/2 weeks later they called to say smaller size not available .
 Not only was I unsatisfied with the product -LRB- shoes too big -RRB- but to make matters worse , when I sent the shoes back to the `` only '' address listed on the packaging , the company would not accept the shoes back -LRB- I had never worn them -RRB- . It cost me $ 48 . dollars for the shoes and another $ 8.45 to get the shoes back from the post office . I will never buy clothing off the internet again .
 I had to return it immediately when I opened the box . On the picture it looks more blue than purple .
 UPDATE : I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear , so this is an update after 6 months of wear . This is my first pair of Danner boots . I wear them everyday , sometimes all day . They have been worn on a 5 mile hike and around the office . I have had them in water . I have provided no care -LRB- polish , oil , waterproofing , etc. -RRB- Overall , I am disappointed in these boots for the price . I bought them because they are `` Made In The USA '' and because there are so many good reviews and anecdotal stories of people having their Danner boots for decades with great satifaction . I do n't see that happening with these boots for me . These are well crafted , but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.APPEARANCE : They look just as they do in the image . The image provided is representative . I have worn them to the office with khakis and have gotten compliments from clients . I have n't tried to polish them , yet.LEATHER : Very Poor !! At first , I was surprised how soft the leather was and how very little break-in was necessary . However , this is because the leather is so thin there is nothing to break-in . Additionally , they have put some sort of rubberized coating on the leather . It almost seems like a latex paint . Because of this , the coloring is unnatural appearing . Out of the box it gives the boots a soft comfortable feel . It does n't take long to realize this is merely superficial . It has mostly scraped off the toe of the boot with very light use . The only other time I have seen this is on a pair of VERY cheap boots I bought from K-Mart while I was in college . I bought these boots to last me for years . They 're not going to make it . The leather is garbage and very disappointing for such an expensive boot.OUT-SOLES : Best thing about the boots . Quality Vibram soles as you would expect . They are a typical lug with a middle layer of well-cushioned rubber similar , but more dense than that found on running shoes . The Vibram part is really only the outer most layer . This has worn very well . I question whether the mid-sole cushioning is going to last.LACING :5 eyelets , 4 hooks , 1 eyelet . Simple . The laces are a typical nylon braid found on most utility boots . There have been no problems keeping them laced up . Once tied up they stay that way for the day.INSIDE : They are lined with a nylon fabric simply to serve as a barrier between the wearer 's foot and the Gore-tex . It seems to be holding up well . There are n't any leaks . I have had them up to the ankle in a creek or two . They come with a heal-cup type insert . This is made of a soft plastic material .

 I returned these for credit because the very small lace eyelets were not right for the very wide laces . I have already rated these before .
 This shoe is HORRIBLE !!! I am an avid runner . I have run in just about every brand -LRB- Nike , adidas , Reebok , Asics , etc. . . -RRB- . I am partial to Asics , but like some of the shoes adidas put out in the mid 90 's -LRB- Equipment Ride , SuperNova Cushion -RRB- , so I figured I would give the `` Mega Ride '' a try.After my 3rd time running in the shoes , my arches hurt so bad I could barley walk . I took them to a local running store to ask on of the sales associates -LRB- whom I trust -RRB- about the a3 technology.He informed me that the midsole is PLASTIC ! I figured that it was a new material but would give some type of cushioning , but NO , IT IS PLASTIC ! Basically adidas was looking to knock off Nike 's SHOX technology because it was very successful for the Swoosh.Well adidas , you really screwed up . This shoe is awful . You claim to be so innovative and the best you can come up with is a plastic midsole ? WOW!You commercials claim that `` Impossible Is Nothing ! '' . Well , I guess at adidas , it 's impossible to build a good shoe these days !
 These shoes are very heavy and quite unresponsive . I ca n't really use them for anything else than really slow easy runs . They might be better for hiking than for running , I guess .

 I ordered three pair of these for family members . We thought that they were attractive for outer wear - with jeans . They were short and the top appears to be made of foam rubber covered with fabric - very flimzy - below average quality . At this price - not a bargain - more like a house shoe - klm from Texas

 I presently have a white mesh Travel Time Mule in a size 8 narrow that I wore all last summer . I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the same shoe this past fall again but in a black suede in a size 8 narrow . Both pairs of shoes fit perfectly . Now today I received my Travel Time white leather mule in a size 8 narrow and it is much much too wide . I am disappointed that Easy Spirit has made so much of a change in their narrow width shoes . I will not purchase this Travel Time shoe again
 The shoe I ordered was navy and the shoe is black and the lining is blue ! The shoe is so wide it wants to slip . I am very disappointed and will return .
 The description never told the height of the front of the shoe - just the heel . All other easy spirit shoes say ` flat ' . The description said 1 1/4 heel and nothing about the font of the shoe and it did n't say flat . THEY ARE FLAT . I sent them back . I wish Easy Spirit would remake the Travel Time High shoes . They are the best for me .
 i have 2 pairs of the same shoe in blue and beige . This one fit wide and was sloppy on my foot
 I have three other pair of easy spirits and I live in them so I ordered this pair on line since I am well aware of this product.The shoes were a little shorter than my others and the patent strip on the top of the right foot cut into my foot and I was miserable . Very disappointed .
 I visited my sister and tried her Traveltime and loved how comfortable they were . She had a size 6 and they fit me perfectly . I order a different color and model , same size 6 and to my surprise they were 1 size too big . I had to pay $ 12 to ship them back . If I had known about sizing issue I would have ordered from zappos instead and get my free returns until I find ones that fit . I wo n't buy from Shoemall again unless they offer free return .
 Love everything about the shoe , except it feels that it is composed of somewhat inferior materials . Not as comfortable as I thought . I 've had better comfort with LL Bean mules.The color and design is appealing , but comfort level has a way to go .
 This is a nice looking shoe but after awhile , about an hour , my feet start to hurt . I thought from the others reviews that this would be an excellent comfortable shoe but not so for me .
 I really do not understand all the hype for these shoes . I guess to scuff around in they are ok but their almost flat contour has very minimal arch support . They also do nothing to correct common issues with arch and heel alignment which then allows the ankle to cant inward over time . SO not worth $ 70 and marginal even at the sale prices.I do n't care how many colors and textures you tart them up with , they are still the same kind of thing my GrandDad AND my Dad wore around the house . UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYIt is n't easy but I have found other brands with similar slips ons which have a much better fit , more arch and inner heel support , and much nicer styling ... . especially those with the bungee lace ups which give enough to snug up to your foot with or without socks . AND as to pricing , more reasonable than these.The one pair I did buy , -LRB- because many shoes can feel great at first -RRB- now only see occasional use in the yard when I pull weeds .
 The shoe itself is awesome . I own several pairs and so does my mother . As my mother is such a fan I decided to get her 2 additional pairs in other colors for Mother 's Day . The shoes arrived just fine , but my mother did not care for the colors.In all of my years -LRB- and family 's -RRB- of buying on Amazon I have never returned anything . When I called the merchant who filled the order , -LSB- ... -RSB- , to ask about the best procedures for returning I was very shocked by the representatives manner . When I was asking instructions on the best way to send the shoes back she was very rude . As I have n't had to send anything back before that I 've purchased on Amazon I also asked about how the $ would be refunded ... through the merchant or Amazon etc. . The -LSB- ... -RSB- rep sighed and groaned when I asked this question , and if I should insure the shoes etc. . I suppose I could have just caught the rep on a bad day , but because of this lack of professionalism I 'm very worried about my actual refund being given -LRB- I will update when this occurs -RRB- . Needless to say because of this interaction I will NEVER buy anything where -LSB- ... -RSB- is the merchant . You will be fine if the shoes are ok , but heaven help you if you have to interact with customer service .
 I was sure with all the good reviews that these sandals would be awesome . Well for me ... they are not . I do not like the way they feel at all . They are cushy on the bottom which is nice but they are just not comfy . The straps are not comfy . Sadly . . I threw my money away on these since I had to wear them to find out I do not like them . Poor me . .
 This is the 2nd pair of these sandals I 've ordered . I LOVED the first pair . They were so comfortable , light weight , fit secure on my feet and provided arch support . So I ordered another pair of the exact same sandal for this season . I do n't know what 's happened in the manufacturing process but the quality has definitely suffered . The straps were all over the place , some were way too loose , others too snug . They were not comfortable mainly due to the way the straps were sewn , so I sent them back to Amazon and requested a refund . Have not received yet . I also ordered a pair of the Mandalyn Wedge Ola flip flop at the same time . Again , I have had another pair of those , and the new ones were not as comfortable . Foot bed was harder than first pair , straps not uniform as to fit . TEVA WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOUR QUALITY ???
 This Teva style looks pretty nice for a flip flop . The strap configuration is the whole thing , the only thing I can see that distinuishes it from a $ 1.99 drugstore version.The third time I wore mine , the strap on one came loose . This means the main strap over the foot that holds the sandal on slipped out of its mooring 1/2 or 3/4 inch , from where it connects to the body of the shoe . I was just walking down a cement sidewalk with my dog.From that moment , the whole shoe is much too loose , and easy to trip with . Insecure . And the whole reason I chose this style was to have a more secure flip flop on my feet.I just could not face writing the company and shipping it back and paying $ 5 more to return an $ 18 item . Would not buy again . Disappointed in Teva .
 I like flip flops . These were cute and on a good sale . For me , the sensation of webbing wrapped around my big toe was n't comfortable - or was it just too tight around the toe for my liking ? Had to return them , since I knew they would n't get worn .
 shoe is not supportive . Even if it is a Teva . I am need support for arches . It is very cute but if you need stablization even with extra strapes this is not it .
 These fit a little small for the size , even from other Chacos . I ended up returning them since the straps seemed tight .
 I have been wearing these Teva sandals for three years now , and I have to say that I was really disappointed with this year 's crop of sandals . I used to love these sandals because the bottom part of the flip flop was so squishy and comfy and because they fit my narrow feet so perfectly . They were by far the most comfortable shoes I 've ever owned . I would wear mine every day throughout the summer , until I wore the heels through!But this year , its seems that Teva decided that the fit was too narrow for the majority of their customers so they decided to make the fit a bit wider , the straps a bit looser . I tried on multiple different styles and colors while I was at the shoe store , and it seems that they 've all be changed to fit this way . Unfortunately , this completely changed the comfortability of the sandal for me . Though they fit length-wise like they used to , they now feel like they 're about two sizes too big for me and flop around way too much . Where before I would have rated these shoes 5 + stars , I can now only give them 2 stars . They are no longer my favorite sandals , and I really wish that Teva had n't decided to mess with a sandal that would have been my favorite go-to summer sandal for years to come .
 Very uncomfortable to wear . I did not realize from the photos before purchased , that this was a `` thong '' - thought it was a criss/cross flip flop . Not only is it a thong , but a coarse and narrow thong material is utilized , making them quite painful and uncomfortable - cutting between the toes . Teva has a good name , but this flip flop is a disappointment - only good for bath to bedroom to dress . Too bad , as they are quite attractive
 I have VERY narrow feet . I ordered these and actually had trouble wedging my foot in . Once I did , wearing them was impossible due to the straps rubbing blisters on the tops of my feet . I had to send them back .
 I had hoped these would be good for walking around campus during summer semester but the narrow cross strap keeps slipping under my short pinky toes . This makes it really uncomfortable and I have to keep stopping and repositioning the strap . Nice colors , not very cushy sole because it 's so thin and overall very sorry I bought them without trying first .
 Teva 's are very comfortable , but do n't leave them in the sun ! They shrink ! I left my new sandals in the back of my Jeep while I was at work one day . When I came out the top portion of the sole had shrunk and curled up . Did n't realize they were so fragile ... not happy . $ 30 bucks wasted .
 I ordered these shoes because I loved the way they looked . When I received them , I was shocked at how comfortable they were ! However , the reason why I gave these shoes only two stars was because of their tightness . I wear a size 7 and I am always true to size , however , these shoes felt extremely tight , even after attempting to stretch them out . In addition to feeling quite snug , every time I walked in them , I felt as if my feet were slipping out the back little by little each step . Also , these shoes do not offer much support . If you want a shoe this in this style , I recommend checking out Rafters Antigua Sandals .
 I have very narrow feet and bought a pair of these a few years ago . They fit perfectly . Now they 're old and not very supportive so I went to get another pair . The straps are so loose on the new ones that they barely stay on my feet . I was so disappointed . If you have narrow feet the 2011 version of these probably wo n't fit . I 'm sad that shoes for wide feet have taken over the world . I am stuck with my old ones until they fall apart .
 Due by 2/24/12 - 2/29/12 ... . arrived 03/03/2012 . LATE and extremely disappointed , will NOT purchase from supplier -LRB- HEART & SOLE SHOES -RRB- again . The correct item -LRB- color/size -RRB- was shipped correctly - so i gave it 2 stars . Amazon is usually better than this.The actual sandal was comfortable and acceptable . It deserves 5 stars . I have bought 7 pairs -LRB- from other people -RRB- and I do LOVE the flip-flops .
 Wore them once . Thought they felt good . They looked really nice . Woke up the next morning and could n't walk . Have been limping ever since -LRB- 3 weeks so far -RRB- . Thumbs down for lousy arch support .
 I 've been buying a new pair of Tevas every year for the past 4 years because I 've loved & used them so much.I ordered a 7 again this year , but it was too small . I ordered a 7.5 and that was too big . They must have changed manufacturers , or changed something about the shoe.I 've been looking in brick-and-mortar stores as well , hoping the shoes shipped from Amazon were just a bad batch . No luck yet though.I will be really disappointed if I ca n't find any that fit next year .
 Have bought several pairs of this exact sandal in the past few years . The pair I received was too wide to wear-so I had to return it . Not happy . Will not buy this product online again -- Not consistent sizing .
 I purchased the sandals for myself but was not able to wear them because they run narrow , I even went a size up because I have wide feet . . I ended up giving them away to someone with a narrow foot . .
 I bought these sandals because of the name and users recommendations . I found then to be uncomfortable due to the material between my toes.I offered them to my daughter and she also found the material uncomfortable .
 The pair I received were a beautiful color -- just what I was looking for , but one of the sandals was not manufactured properly , one of the bands that crosses over the foot was way too long , so it did n't fit properly . I was disappointed to have to send it back , bc there were no others to get a replacement .
 UPDATE : I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear , so this is an update after 6 months of wear . This is my first pair of Danner boots . I wear them everyday , sometimes all day . They have been worn on a 5 mile hike and around the office . I have had them in water . I have provided no care -LRB- polish , oil , waterproofing , etc. -RRB- Overall , I am disappointed in these boots for the price . I bought them because they are `` Made In The USA '' and because there are so many good reviews and anecdotal stories of people having their Danner boots for decades with great satifaction . I do n't see that happening with these boots for me . These are well crafted , but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.APPEARANCE : They look just as they do in the image . The image provided is representative . I have worn them to the office with khakis and have gotten compliments from clients . I have n't tried to polish them , yet.LEATHER : Very Poor !! At first , I was surprised how soft the leather was and how very little break-in was necessary . However , this is because the leather is so thin there is nothing to break-in . Additionally , they have put some sort of rubberized coating on the leather . It almost seems like a latex paint . Because of this , the coloring is unnatural appearing . Out of the box it gives the boots a soft comfortable feel . It does n't take long to realize this is merely superficial . It has mostly scraped off the toe of the boot with very light use . The only other time I have seen this is on a pair of VERY cheap boots I bought from K-Mart while I was in college . I bought these boots to last me for years . They 're not going to make it . The leather is garbage and very disappointing for such an expensive boot.OUT-SOLES : Best thing about the boots . Quality Vibram soles as you would expect . They are a typical lug with a middle layer of well-cushioned rubber similar , but more dense than that found on running shoes . The Vibram part is really only the outer most layer . This has worn very well . I question whether the mid-sole cushioning is going to last.LACING :5 eyelets , 4 hooks , 1 eyelet . Simple . The laces are a typical nylon braid found on most utility boots . There have been no problems keeping them laced up . Once tied up they stay that way for the day.INSIDE : They are lined with a nylon fabric simply to serve as a barrier between the wearer 's foot and the Gore-tex . It seems to be holding up well . There are n't any leaks . I have had them up to the ankle in a creek or two . They come with a heal-cup type insert . This is made of a soft plastic material . The inserts are annoying in that they have to be re-positioned every time you put the boots on . Note , these are not insulated boots.COMFORT and SUPPORT : Surprisingly comfortable for the lack of support . The cushioning in the sole contributes to that . I find the heal inserts to help . I have n't tried them without the inserts . But , frankly , these boots should come with quality inserts with arch support that runs the length of the boot -- especially for that price ! On the one 5 mile hike I did with these , they did n't cut it . My feet were very sore in the end and there is zero ankle support . Admittedly , these are not hiking boots , but 5 miles over pretty moderate terrain is hardly a hike.SIZING : They seem perfectly true to size and width . There is no heal slippage and there is plenty of room in the toe-box , but not so much so that my feet are sliding around.PRICING : Far overpriced for the materials.Sadly , I 'll never buy Danner again . I have a pair of Red Wing 2218 Lineman boots and they are much better boot with regard to durability and materials . Consider the Red Wing 4585 or 214 before you buy these .
 The shoe is gorgeous but since I 'm not use to wearing heels , I was in agony the entire day . Gave them away .
 These shoes have a great look , classy , modern , stylish . The first few days were uncomfortable , which is typical for dress shoes , but they eventually became acceptably comfortable.The reason this review is 2 stars is the shoes started `` sqeaking '' as soon as they were broken in . Also , the shoes only lasted about 3 months of frequent use before the sole started seperating from the shoe . I got the sole repaired twice , but after 9 months the upper seams started coming undone as well.I will buy Kenneth Cole shoes again , but for this price I 'm hoping some of the other models will last a bit longer and be a bit quieter .

 These boots look very nice , but unfortunately , they are way too narrow -LRB- and I have narrow feet -RRB- . My whole foot felt squashed . Back to Amazon it goes !
 I DONT KNOW IF ARE THINGS OF MINE , BUT I HAVE MORE THAN 5 YEARS USING THIS STYLE , ADIDAS SAMOA , SO I THINK THIS SNEAKERS FROM THIS STORE ITS NO GENUINE 'CAUSE THE `` LEATHER '' ITS TOO HARD , BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS BLACK UNIT I HAD BOUGHT A WHITE ONE TO AMAZON STORE AND THOSE IF SEEMS TO BE GENUINE , LEATHER ITS VERY SOFT , BUYERS TAKE CARE WHO YOU BUY

 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .
 UPDATE : I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear , so this is an update after 6 months of wear . This is my first pair of Danner boots . I wear them everyday , sometimes all day . They have been worn on a 5 mile hike and around the office . I have had them in water . I have provided no care -LRB- polish , oil , waterproofing , etc. -RRB- Overall , I am disappointed in these boots for the price . I bought them because they are `` Made In The USA '' and because there are so many good reviews and anecdotal stories of people having their Danner boots for decades with great satifaction . I do n't see that happening with these boots for me . These are well crafted , but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.APPEARANCE : They look just as they do in the image . The image provided is representative . I have worn them to the office with khakis and have gotten compliments from clients . I have n't tried to polish them , yet.LEATHER : Very Poor !! At first , I was surprised how soft the leather was and how very little break-in was necessary . However , this is because the leather is so thin there is nothing to break-in . Additionally , they have put some sort of rubberized coating on the leather . It almost seems like a latex paint . Because of this , the coloring is unnatural appearing . Out of the box it gives the boots a soft comfortable feel . It does n't take long to realize this is merely superficial . It has mostly scraped off the toe of the boot with very light use . The only other time I have seen this is on a pair of VERY cheap boots I bought from K-Mart while I was in college . I bought these boots to last me for years . They 're not going to make it . The leather is garbage and very disappointing for such an expensive boot.OUT-SOLES : Best thing about the boots . Quality Vibram soles as you would expect . They are a typical lug with a middle layer of well-cushioned rubber similar , but more dense than that found on running shoes . The Vibram part is really only the outer most layer . This has worn very well . I question whether the mid-sole cushioning is going to last.LACING :5 eyelets , 4 hooks , 1 eyelet . Simple . The laces are a typical nylon braid found on most utility boots . There have been no problems keeping them laced up . Once tied up they stay that way for the day.INSIDE : They are lined with a nylon fabric simply to serve as a barrier between the wearer 's foot and the Gore-tex . It seems to be holding up well . There are n't any leaks . I have had them up to the ankle in a creek or two . They come with a heal-cup type insert . This is made of a soft plastic material . The inserts are annoying in that they have to be re-positioned every time you put the boots on . Note , these are not insulated boots.COMFORT and SUPPORT : Surprisingly comfortable for the lack of support . The cushioning in the sole contributes to that . I find the heal inserts to help . I have n't tried them without the inserts . But , frankly , these boots should come with quality inserts with arch support that runs the length of the boot -- especially for that price ! On the one 5 mile hike I did with these , they did n't cut it . My feet were very sore in the end and there is zero ankle support . Admittedly , these are not hiking boots , but 5 miles over pretty moderate terrain is hardly a hike.SIZING : They seem perfectly true to size and width . There is no heal slippage and there is plenty of room in the toe-box , but not so much so that my feet are sliding around.PRICING : Far overpriced for the materials.Sadly , I 'll never buy Danner again . I have a pair of Red Wing 2218 Lineman boots and they are much better boot with regard to durability and materials . Consider the Red Wing 4585 or 214 before you buy these .
 I DONT KNOW IF ARE THINGS OF MINE , BUT I HAVE MORE THAN 5 YEARS USING THIS STYLE , ADIDAS SAMOA , SO I THINK THIS SNEAKERS FROM THIS STORE ITS NO GENUINE 'CAUSE THE `` LEATHER '' ITS TOO HARD , BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS BLACK UNIT I HAD BOUGHT A WHITE ONE TO AMAZON STORE AND THOSE IF SEEMS TO BE GENUINE , LEATHER ITS VERY SOFT , BUYERS TAKE CARE WHO YOU BUY

 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .

 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote .

 I DONT KNOW IF ARE THINGS OF MINE , BUT I HAVE MORE THAN 5 YEARS USING THIS STYLE , ADIDAS SAMOA , SO I THINK THIS SNEAKERS FROM THIS STORE ITS NO GENUINE 'CAUSE THE `` LEATHER '' ITS TOO HARD , BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS BLACK UNIT I HAD BOUGHT A WHITE ONE TO AMAZON STORE AND THOSE IF SEEMS TO BE GENUINE , LEATHER ITS VERY SOFT , BUYERS TAKE CARE WHO YOU BUY
 They do n't serve . I buy these shoes but i 'm disillusioned i just used them for 20 minutes and the right one starts to emit a sound like when you open a door `` uink , uink '' , do n't buy this product . I lose my money

 UPDATE : I originally reviewed these boots after only a week of wear , so this is an update after 6 months of wear . This is my first pair of Danner boots . I wear them everyday , sometimes all day . They have been worn on a 5 mile hike and around the office . I have had them in water . I have provided no care -LRB- polish , oil , waterproofing , etc. -RRB- Overall , I am disappointed in these boots for the price . I bought them because they are `` Made In The USA '' and because there are so many good reviews and anecdotal stories of people having their Danner boots for decades with great satifaction . I do n't see that happening with these boots for me . These are well crafted , but the materials are very poor except for the Vibram sole.APPEARANCE : They look just as they do in the image .

 Do not buy this product . Dansko stopped mnufacturing this shoe because it is defective !! The strap breaks within months of purchase and a pair of Dansko 's should last you years .
 I have had similar trouble with the design of these shoes . The elastic strap on one shoe broke within just a couple months . I returned it to the seller who gave me a new pair of shoes . But the same problem occurred again . I absolutely love the style of the shoes and the type leather -LRB- I have the brown -RRB- , but the poor design makes the shoes worthless . They were also extremely uncomfortable to break in .
 Horrible shoes . Sucks , Horrible red label at the sides of the shoes
 the water shoe is really comfortable but if your looking for protection this may not be the shoe for you . This shoe will not stay on your foot if your looking to kayak and find yourself swimming in some tuff current .
 So I bought these shoes for a white water rafting trip ... let 's just say once wet these guys just slip right off . . I lost one of them to the river . . would n't buy them again . . not very comfy either
 These shoes are adorable but they absolutely do not stay on your foot if you are swimming or walking through deep water . It 's a pity because they are adorable .
 Looks really nice in the picture but the toe pit of the sandal is just choking my big toe !! And it 's really hard , so very uncomfortable ... have them on right now ... and not comfy at all1 !!
 The style of the sandal is very lovely . The sole is rather thin and a bit flimsy . K-Mart sold sandals Made in India and the soles were much sturdier . The fit is a bit big . All in all I am enjoying my sandal by Naughty Monkey .
 I thought these slippers were so cute that I ordered them in a size 6 A2 . I was very disappointed when I tried them on to find them extremely wide . There is no way that these slippers will fit someone with a narrow foot . They felt like squishy marshmallows . I returned them for a refund .
 The straps on both shoes broke the very first time worn . Spent the rest of the day at work wearing broken shoes .

 This style is not designed for people who have wide feet . If you prefer comfort , please do n't think to order them . Too narrow to put your feet on , even , you order your right size . Size run small . You have to order one bigger size than your actual size in order to fit on . I do n't recommend this style to other customers . Very uncomfortable to wear .
 These are not the sandals that are pictured and they come in a size range not a specific size . Not a good purchase .
 The sandals were lovely but very heavy for a thong flipflop . Because they were so heavy , they rubbed at the top of my foot . Yikes and Owie !
 These arrived yesterday by the time I got home from work . I immediatley put them on and set off to walk the dog . Within 3 blocks the blisters started . Foolishly , I kept walking . Away from the house . Far away from the house . `` I can tough this out , '' I think to myself . Wrong . 45 minutes later I hobble back through the door , feet bleeding profusely , more determined than ever to break these little torture devices , er , flip flops - yes flip flops , in.My story , and quest has a bit of history . Years ago I bought a pair of flippers by this company but with thin nylon straps on sale for about $ 8 at some beachside store . I had never heard of the brand -LRB- and certainly would 've never paid $ 50 for flip flops had they been full price - little alone for something with a rainbow on it - how old do you think I am ? -RRB- . Suprisingly they quickly became my favorite shoe outside of work , until after about 3 years I eventually wore the soles to the ground . They were no longer shoes , more like toilet bowl protective covers . Enough was enough , I could no longer tote my little toilet bowl cover flippers around so they got left behind in some distant land where the chances that I be able to retrieve them from the trash were distinctly less possible.So this is what brings me here , trying to revive those three wonderful years with my trusty , hippie flip flops , only to be deterred from that happiness . I have a very narrow foot anyway , but the problem is that these straps are hella tight ! As that they are now worn -LRB- not to mention covered in my flesh and blood -RRB- I ca n't really send them back . It would just be rude . Luckily I 'm no deserter . My new plans involve copious amounts of moleskin , wearing them in the shower -LRB- most likely with lead socks -RRB- , and possibly leather softener to stretch the straps . I 'm definitely open to suggestions , but in the meantime I ca n't help but feel my life is slipping away as I think of ways to safely wear a pair of flip flops . That cost $ 50 .
 They do not last any longer than any other sandal . The company does not stand behind the product . It is all marketing . I would not buy again .
 If someone wants to order these Rainbow Sandals the sizing is all wrong - I have to send mine back now and looks like the sizing is off by two shoe sizes.Kim Garrett
 I bought these sandals as a birthday present for my daughter . After two weeks of normal wear , holes had worn into the bottom of both heals . My daughter has another pair of Rainbows that she had for over two years and held up very well . We purchased Rainbows because they are guaranteed . However , when we contacted Rainbow about the rapid wear they refused to honor the warranty . They pointed out that the warranty does cover wear through the top or bottom layers . When I pointed out that the wear occured over a period of just two weeks of normal wear , Rainbow responded that they had never seen this and my daughter must have been skateboarding or rock climbing . She did neither . Instead of honoring their warranty and doing the right thing , Rainbow all but called us liars and refused to stand behind their product . I will not be purchasing Rainbow products again.By the way , before my daughter received this pair of Rainbows , she was wearing a cheap pair -LRB- $ 4 -RRB- of Walmart flip flops . The Walmart product held up much better than the Rainbows.These Rainbow 's sandals were a big disappointment only to be surpassed by an even bigger disappointment in their poor customer service and refusal to stand behind their product .
 I bought a pair of rainbows , at 50 bucks , for the same reason that I 'm sure anyone does ; the `` lifetime '' guarantee . After two months of daily wear the bottom sole wore thru to the middle sole so I contacted Rainbow and this is the reply I received : `` I 'm sorry , but wear and tear on the sandals is not covered by the guarantee . The life of the sole or top sole depends on the wearer of the sandal . Some peoples sandals last longer than others.Personally , I can wear into the middle layer from the bottom sole in one month . It does not mean that the sandals are defective , it just means that I drag my feet a little . Unfortunately , there is nothing that we can do for wear and tear.Have a nice day.STEVE LANECUSTOMER SERVICE-end email-DO NOT BUY RAINBOWS ! for the guarantee . If you like leather flip-flops that cost twice as much as reefs and last a third of the time then these are the flops for you . Otherwise your money will be spent better elsewhere .
 I was not a savvy shopper when I bought these . The salesperson got me when she told me about the lifetime guarantee . Lies ! The guarantee covers manufacturing defects ONLY until the sole gets worn down . Basically , the `` lifetime '' guarantee for my rainbow sandals was one year , which is when the sole broke through to the `` soft colored insert '' - from rainbow website .
 i was not pleased with the product and when I decided to return them there was a restocking fee plus and $ 8.00 return fee which i think is unrealistic when ordering something from the internet which I had n't seen in person .
 These are very , very heavy . I can really feel the difference when they are in my gym bag . It 's not so noticable on my feet , but they still seem pretty clunky . The insole area has little bumps to prevent slipping , but to me they feel like nails . All in all , not nice to wear . It 's kind of a shame , because they seem to be decent quality , and it looks to me like they could have made the bottoms thinner to lighten them up . For me , reducing the size of the traction bumps on the inside would be an improvement . I considered trying to trim them down with a knife , but there are just too many .
 I thought these slippers were so cute that I ordered them in a size 6 A2 . I was very disappointed when I tried them on to find them extremely wide . There is no way that these slippers will fit someone with a narrow foot . They felt like squishy marshmallows . I returned them for a refund .
 I bought these shoes brand new a few weeks ago , and wore them at Splashin ' Safari water park earlier today for the first time . Big mistake ! Within the first 30 minutes I developed a huge blister above both heals do to the hard mesh friction rubbing agianst my skin . Speedo did a really poor job on the construction of these shoes . They need to go back to the drawing board . Why put such a hard material in the shoe heal for god 's sake ?! It 's a water shoe ! You do n't wear socks with them ! The bottom line here is that the Speedo XP 's are like wearing a cheese grater strapped to your heal . I 'm done with water shoes . I 'll stick to wearing my sandals in the water . They 're a lot more comfortable . I 've never had a whole lot of luck with water shoes anyway , and this pair was definitely no exception . The Speedo XP 's are the worst I 've worn by far . I recommend everyone stay away from them !
 I took this to Bahamas with me in October . Although I guess it 's my fault , I thought they were slip on shoes and did n't tighten up the laces . It caused a nasty blister on my Achilles tendon that lasted for the whole week ! Yucko !! One could wear them with socks though .
 He wore them for a while , but he got a strange callous on the side of his foot and decided not to wear them any more .
 I brought these shoes last year ! . When i brought them i put them up for a couple of months for i can wear them on my birthday , So the day came i was all excited and put them on with in 25min of walking in them they started detaching for the soles !!!!! . Their glued on to the sole , it jus came all apart !!!! . It was soooo embarrassing thank god we were leaving the move theater , so i would not recommend this for anyone ! . But they are soo comfortable man i regret the way they made them !
 I purchased these shoes and on the first time wearing them the sold pulled apart and the little straps pulled out of the sole . I was not given a refund or eschange . Worthless .
 I thought these slippers were so cute that I ordered them in a size 6 A2 . I was very disappointed when I tried them on to find them extremely wide . There is no way that these slippers will fit someone with a narrow foot . They felt like squishy marshmallows . I returned them for a refund .

 What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product ? I would have wanted to know if they did n't have the color they showed in the picture , which was Burgundy . If I had known that I would have never ordered it . I am a female and I do n't want a black timberland boot . The burgundy was a really pretty color and more suitable for a lady . I am very disappointed and will have to now search elsewhere for what I want . I thought I was going to get what was shown in the picture , but it did n't work out . You live and learn - and I learned really well this time around . I am hoping for a refund as soon as possible .
 I ordered a size 8 as I normally would and when the thing arrived it was so small my size 6 mom could n't even get it on her foot . No refunds so I am out the money . Worst service ever !
 I wear a size 11B . Some boots I have found I can surprisingly wear a 10 or at least try it on for general look and feel then order an 11B . This boot fit like a 9.5 . It is comprised of very thin material , obviously not real for the price , but very cute . They can be folded down for the knee height look . I would say it runs 1.5 sizes small , and would work for a costume if you could get a size big enough -LRB- 1.5 sizes larger than your normal size -RRB- , but I ca n't see it standing up to regular wear . I also bought a pair of Chinese Laundry thigh highs for about the same price . Those 11 's fit great . They are comfortable and sexy . I could even wear thin-average thickness socks with the Chinese Laundry thigh high boots , and they feel more comfortable to stand in . I will get a lot of wear out of the CL 's .
 This shoe was way too big . I missed the deadline for returns so I 'm stuck with it . Anyone want it ?
 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack
 Absolutely love this pair of sandals . I got my first one from a local dept store and got the second one from Amazon . I was planning on getting 3 more had the size been available . I was lucky there was one left when I ordered . Very comfortable and got a lot of compliments from friends . Its classic design will never get old . I hope I can find some from other websites .
 They look nice but the slouching looks weird . They do no fit my calves at all .
 I love the look of this shoe . . it 's adorable , sporty , cute and cool all at the same time . However , there is one MAJOR flaw with this shoe . The back part is SO high that it tortures the back of your ankle . It 's just so painful with the back section is too high , as it is with this shoe . Otherwise , it 's great . Perhaps if one could use an insole or something like that . . but for me , it was just not working .

 Returned this pair . Sizing was way too big . The width was wide , but the length felt 1 size over .
 I had to return the shoes . Even though I ordered a D width it was still too narrow for my feet . The shoe appeared to be of good quality , but because I have very difficult feet to fit it 's better if I go to a store to try shoes on before purchasing .
 I ordered these shoes for work as a nurse . They are not white as the picture shows but sports white or as I discovered tan . They look very comfortable so I am very disappointed that I have to send them back .
 This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small . While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small . The shoes were very stiff and hard . I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes . I could not return them because I had woren them , so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again .
 I am so far pleased with this product . It appears durable and all that was advertised . It comes with a 1000 mile sole guarantee . That was my original opinion of the product when it arrived . The shoes are falling apart after 3 months , of light everyday wear . The stitching on the right toe area has come undone , and the tread is worn down on the bottom . Sorry I purchased them .
 I could n't really tell from the pictures , but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow . And I even purchased the wide ones . I 'm on my feet all day and ca n't have my toes all squished up , it 's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly , and if you 're thinking of buying these please pay close attention , the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe , cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DO N'T want it.I tried on the right shoe , tied it up , felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe , and that 's all she wrote . These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately . Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy . Thanks Amazon !
 I have purchased Propet for about 15 years . Recently the brand changed styles , these are not nearly as comfortable as the Propet 's I was wearing about 4 years ago . I am having a hard time breaking these in . I work on my feet all day , and so far I ca n't wear these a full day yet . I think I will have to buy some other brand . They are very stiff .
 I owned a pair of Propet walkers about 15 years ago & loved them ! I thought these might be of the same quality -LRB- they appear to be -RRB- but actually , are NOT . They are cheap & squeaky & made of a strange plastic material that stinks . The squeaking is so bad I dare not wear them outside or people would STARE . I use them on my treadmill & I hope they will wear out fast .
 I looked at the number of good reviews without reading any of them , my fault . I wore them to work for 5 days . My back , hip , legs and feet were so sore I could barely walk by the time I got home from work . The right shoe rubbed my little toe to a blister . I ended up getting myself a different brand of new shoes , which I put on right away without any problem . This new pair of Propet 's is going to Goodwill . Will never buy another pair again .
 I worked an 8 hour shift , and the shoe itself was hard and lacked support.Your heel strike was like walking on concrete , with bare feet.I also felt that the over all fit too big , and not true to size.I gave the shoes to a friend and she could not tolerate as well . Sorry I had high hopes .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .

 I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit . Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them . So I sent them back hoping that the 7 's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5 s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for . I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous , especially when you have to spend so much money to get them . I am to young for this problem , with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gon na keep looking .
 Twice I received men 's shoes instead of womens . I returned them both and received a refund . I was told by the Amazon Representative that he was going to check into the situation and he would get back to me . I have not heard from him . I did order the womens shoes , not the mens in 9M . I would like to order them again , however , I am afraid of getting men 's shoes once again . I ordered the Breeze Walker the first time and I believe the Stability Walker the second time . Again , I reiterate , both times I was sent men 's shoes and they were advertised as Propet Women 's . The representative was going to check with the warehouse regarding this and was , as I previously stated , going to get back to me . Thank you . Barbara Simington
 This is a very cute shoe , especially the style and the height of the heel . However , it is not made of leather as advertised . This makes a difference to shoppers as myself , as shoes made of manmade materials do n't breathe well.Also , I ordered a Medium-width shoe , but this style runs extremely narrow . I have never had to buy a Wide-width shoe in my life and am consistently the same size for dress shoes . However , these are more than uncomfortably tight on my foot.It 's too bad , because the seller mailed the product to me in record time . Their customer service was also very responsive when I contacted them to return the item . Overall , I would not give the seller a negative rating , but would caution people interested in purchasing this product as they may need to order a size up -LRB- esp . in width -RRB- .
 I looked all those nice reviews but I was disapointed when the shoe came . It is pretty but has a slipery sole . And it is not leather as advertised .
 This shoe is pretty and stylish , but not true to size . I ordered a medium width . The shoe fit OK except for the heel , which was way too narrow . I had to return them .
 i was looking for nice plain low heels.i trusted the hushpuppies brand . needed 11 ew . to narrow and bottom of shoes were slick . a plus size girl could slip and fall in these real fast . i returned them . i suggest cloudwalkers instead .
 The product took 2 weeks to arrive since it was originally shipped to wrong state . Then , I received the wrong color . Size ordered fit at least two sizes smaller than same size from any store . Even when color and size were wrong , I had to return to store at my own expense . Poor custumer service . I will not buy from this company again .
 Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .
 Other reviews were right that these seem to run a little small . Both a little short and maybe a little narrow too .
 Shoe is advertized as a leather upper . When it comes it is clearly marked as `` ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS '' inside the heel . Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15 % restocking fee for a `` damaged shoebox '' to 50 % for `` trying-on wear . '' Seller is a rip-off . Do not buy ! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use .
 Everything was just fine until I tightened the laces for the first time . When the roller style guide pulled out of the boot it left a nice hole clean through the shell , about half way up the boot . So much for water proofing .
 Shoe was fairly comfortable but did not look `` right '' on foot . The `` front `` of shoe was too short . Item was true to size .
 I just got these in ivory and black and I am returning both pairs . The price was great but the shoes were so unattractive in person and both pairs looked like somebody had been wearing them for a long time . The gold studs were scratched badly and leather part were dirty . Do n't waste your money and time on these pairs .
 They developed holes way too quickly.Don ' t bother.Nice red though .
 I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past ; however , the description on Amazon is incorrect . This is NOT a 3 pair pack , it is only one pair of socks for $ 13.99 plus shipping . What a rip-off . I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack

 Absolutely love this pair of sandals . I got my first one from a local dept store and got the second one from Amazon . I was planning on getting 3 more had the size been available . I was lucky there was one left when I ordered . Very comfortable and got a lot of compliments from friends . Its classic design will never get old . I hope I can find some from other websites .
 I just received these beautifully made shoes . However , they are very uncomfortable . I could not walk very far after I first put them on -- the leather rubbed on the small extremity toes and the backside came up too high and cut into the back of my ankle . Sadly , I had to return them .
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 Bought these for my wife who has several pairs of these boots in different colors and loves them . Wears the black ones regularly . Got this one home and it was clearly differently constructed . It was much more narrow and smaller / tighter than the other Dingo boots my wife has -LRB- some of them she has only worn once so its not an issue of the boots being already broken in -- she never had to break these boots in by the way -RRB- . Dingo has clearly changed the foot model for their boots . I 'd advise them to change back . They have lost this customer .
 These run very small . There was no mention of this prior to ordering them . When I returned them it cost $ 18.00 to do so . So very disappointed ...
 These boots are so beautiful and I thought these were going to be the best boots I ever bought . But sadly the two pair I bought had a defective left heel.They fit well and at first they were so comfortable . But the left one on both pairs felt as if the heel had not been made correctly as after a short time of wearing it my heel started to hurt . I had not realized this until after I had left for the day , so after a few hours it was unbearable to wear the left boot . I was so disappointed.Since I had bought two pairs and both had the same problem I chose to have a refund instead of trying to get an exchange in fear that an exchange would be defective as well .
 I own high cowboy boots and was so happy with them that I ordered these once in black and brown.So far I was only able to wear them for 5 minutes at a time , because I got blisters on my ancles . The design really is not comfortable at all - what a shame as I can also not return them.Do not understand why others find these shoes great , for me they are just painful .
 I wear a seven , and based on others ' feedback ordered an 8 - what I received was labeled 8 , but must have been a size 6 . That 's absurd .
 Bought these to replace an older pair which looked identical , but which I discovered are not . They look gorgeous and are very well-made , however , they fit extremely tight -- to a point where I wore them for about a half-hour and one of my feet went completely asleep ! Also , as one other reviewer mentioned , they ride high on the ankle and this actually rubbed one of my ankles raw . I do n't know how I can get these to be more comfortable , short of trying to stretch them and possible cutting them where the ankle rubs . My advice is not to buy these online before actually trying the identical pair on in a store somewhere , because they do n't fit like most ankle boots do .
 Got this as a gift ... Right size , right color , excellent leather texture -LRB- nice 'n' soft -RRB- , but the stitching was a complete mess ! One boot looked bigger than the other ... The upper leather portion was n't centered properly over the rubber sole on either boot . Needless to say , back they went . Unfortunately , I had to haggle with the company over the shipping to send it back . They were giving me grief about who should pay the shipping for the defective boots and also over possible restocking fees . Did not order a replacement from the company because of their customer service and the fact that the defects were so major , I did n't have any confidence in the next pair being in better condition.Buyer beware ...
 The length of the boot -LRB- 12 '' -RRB- makes it difficult to get on and off , especially off . Years ago I wore a Frye boot in a 10 '' length . At thattime they called it a Half Wellington . I was in the Navy at the time , so the color was black . It took a great shine .
 The shoe 's ankle support is too rigid and has never loosened up in spite up repeated usage .
 I would go out of my way to find Columbia footwear solely because I always had tremendous respect for the quality put behind their product . Until a few years ago a bought a pair of Columbia Men 's Pagora Trail Shoes for myself and a pair of Columbia Youth Beartooth Shoes for my son and we both experienced foot and leg pain while wearing them . Neither of us felt this while wearing any other footwear we owned.I pretty much threw in the towel on Columbia until I decided to give them another shot . Mistake . I purchased a pair of Columbia Men 's Birkie Trail shoes in good faith . but guess what?Same problem with the aches and pains.Won ' t buy again .
 I have worn this style shoe for as long as it has been out . I typically get about a years wear out of them . However , I recently started experiencing leg pain and lower back pain by late afternoon every work day . I noticed that the soles of my shoes are very worn after only 5 months . I work indoors , and spend most of the day at my desk or in the server room . My daily routing does not lend to excessive wear or my shoes . Based on my experience and other similar reviews , this will be my last pair . I just ordered a pair of Clarks .
 I bought these shoes after an extensive search for something both comfortable and durable . After seeing praise from Amazon reviews as well as the customers of other retail stores , I went to the local shoe store and bought a pair . Everything seemed good when I tried them on , but my right heel began to hurt a few hours after leaving the store . For some reason the left shoe has a soft heel , while the right shoe has a very hard heel . This inconsistency makes the right shoe feel very uncomfortable after a few hours . It also makes me feel off balance , as the left shoe gives to my weight while the right shoe does not . Furthermore , a hard piece of rubber that was not cut properly on the right sole made me feel like I was stepping on a rock until I removed it myself with a knife . Finally , my right foot tends to slip forward , causing my big toe to rub against the front of the shoe . I imagine this is because the heel has no give to it.So basically I 'm stuck with a good left shoe , and an incredibly uncomfortable right shoe . Because of this , I am donating the shoes to Goodwill and resuming my hunt for comfortable and durable shoes .
 My husband bought these exact same Birkie Trail shoes at a local store . It was his first pair of Columbia shoes . After about 6 months of daily wear -LRB- not for work , just walking to and from work -RRB- , he noticed a knee pain while wearing them . When he switched to any of his other shoes , the pain stopped after several days . After he stopped using these Columbia shoes altogether the knee pain disappeared completely and never came back . Also , he never had any problem or pain with any of his other shoes . We were intrigued by this , so we inspected these Columbia Birkie Trail shoes more closely . Turns out -LRB- although this is not easily spotted -RRB- that the part of the sole was collapsed . I think this is a serious issue , since the problem with the sole is not obvious and you can permanently damage your knees while wearing them with collapsed soles , hence only 1 star.I think they deserve some credit for those 6 months of use that my husband got out of them . Although , they still look good -LRB- except the small gray stripe of faux leather around the ankle that started to disintegrate -RRB- , my husband is not able to wear them any more due to the sole problem . For him , 6 months is rather short lifetime for a shoe . All his shoes last at least twice as much with the same amount of use , even the cheap no-brand-name ones .
 The delieve is too slow!I am waiting my shoes until today!I just confused that why it will delayed until a week!I feel displeasure !!! VERY VERY DISPLEASURE !
 I really wanted to love these shoes , they 're really cute and comfy . BUT , I wore them one time and the front seam ripped , exposing my big toe on the right side . The left side seam was starting to come undone too . These are not too tight , in fact they fit loosely , so they did n't break from over stretching . These are not constructed well , even though the leather seems to be good quality . Just be aware , these are not the high quality moccasins that Minnetonka used to produce . Not worth the extra money for the name . I had to return my pair , I hope Amazon comes through with the refund .
 The one they sent me is soft sole and the product description said they would be rubber sole !! Feel soo disappointed !!! Fix it ASAP !!!!!!
 I bought a pair of these very pretty , reasonably priced mocs last year and was delighted with them - until : - the beading around the soles separated,-the toe stitching blew out,-and the inner soles separated.While they are lovely to look at and have a really nice range of colors , I suggest you stay away from them .
 This is my first time buying goods in Amazon , however it is n't a pleased result . Both the picture and the description on the Amazon website show it is a Hardsole shoes , rubber sole shoes . When I receive the shoes , it disappointed me a lot cause it is softsole . I ca n't wear them outdoor . I really hope shoebuy could give our customer a pleased feedback . Unfortunatly , it has ' t been solved now .
 Be very careful ordering these shoes ! Some of them are not as pictured ! Most pictures show a rubber sole . I ordered one where no sole was shown -LRB- only the top of the shoe was shown ... which excluded showing that no sole was included on this particular pair -RRB- . Very deceptive and I 'm pretty mad about it . If one of the shoe options is not the same as the others shown in the options then hiding the difference is dishonest . I 've applied for `` approval '' to return these shoes but have not yet received it.Buyer beware -LRB- and seller , if you 're offering a different version of these shoes hiding the difference is deceptive and only leads to bad reviews and not happy customers -RRB- .
 I 've had these shoes for about 4 months now . I have these in black and they are cute and for the most part comfortable . The price is also very good.But I give these 2 stars because the cons way outweigh the pros.The cons
 I was very disappointed with these moccasins as they were very loose/wide -LRB- even though I wear a medium and they say they are medium width -RRB- . When I walked around the house in them -LRB- had to put socks on so they 'd stay on my feet -RRB- I could feel my feet sliding to the side . Lengthwise they were perfect but even wearing socks , I knew I 'd be in trouble if I walked around in these even a brief amount of time .
 I was sent a pair of soft sole moccasins . The top of the shoe looks very cute but I can not ever wear these outside so whats the point , I did n't buy slippers . The description and picture of the shoes , in all colors , shows a rubber sole . I 'm really dissapointed since I had to return . Please correct your site and descriptions , very misleading .
 I ordered the gray pair of these moccasins , and could hardly wait to get them . I was expecting a wonderful pair of shoes , considering I already own them in brown and in purple . I have never been more disappointed with an order received from any online company . They were absolutely terrible . One shoe has a rounded tip around the toes , the other is more pointed . They are two different shades of gray . One is a more stiff leather the other not so much , AND one is bigger than the other -LRB- and both say size 8 -RRB- . And to top it off Amazon customer service was horrible . I ca n't see myself ordering from Amazon.com ANY time soon , if ever again . Very , very disappointed .
 We were looking forward to receiving these moccasins for my wife but were very disapointed when we found defects in the lacing near the tongue . The top holes for lacing were torn on both shoes and the lacing had pulled out . Obviously a manufacturing defect which should have been caught at the factory ! I guess the Chinese are not really up to par on quality control these days . Very disapointing !
 Shoes are fine , look nice . Here 's the rub , I bought these for my wife for Xmas not knowing that apparently they run big . She tried them on a few weeks later and they were too big . I emailed Footnation and they would n't exchange them for another size b/c of their 30 day return policy . Since I purchased them the beginning of Dec , by the time I gave them to her it was already 20 + days into their 30 day policy . Ridiculous . I can understand not RETURNING the shoes after 30 days but to refuse to EXCHANGE them for another size ? You 've got to be kidding me . In this market you would think stores would bend over backwards trying to keep customers . Wake up retail world , its no longer a booming economy ! I would have purchased more shoes from them , but no thanks . I 'll find a store that appreciates my business .
 the moccassins arent as described when they came they were softsole when the picture and desription described hardsole moccassins they need to fix this asap
 I rated these shoes one star because I just do n't believe any shoe should look this beat up after 3.5 months . I have very rarely worn the shoes outside , mostly just around the house . I do n't think they would exist if I ventured out in them . They look sloppy and overrun because the width has stretched so much . And , they stretched width-wise very soon after I started wearing them.I do n't think anyone with a slightly narrow foot could wear these . My width is between B and C and these are probably at least a D now . Both of the ties have ripped off , and I probably only tied them a few times . They 're comfortable because they 're such a wreck they 're barely touching my feet anymore . I need to buy new mocassins , but I definitely wo n't be buying these again .
 I ordered 3 pairs of Moccasin shoes for family members -LRB- upon their request -RRB- . However , two pair did not work out . I called to ask for their return policy . On their website , they stated that after 30 days , you will need to pay $ 5 for each pair to return . If in any way you damage their shoe boxes , you will need to pay another $ 5 for the shoe box . Please , who in the world charge people for shoe boxes ???? I will NEVER shop for their shoes again . Also , they make shoes that have no soles . Who in the world wear that kind of shoes ???? Very bad business practice . I do n't know why people give their product such good reviews . Run the other way will be my recommendation .
 I bought these hoping I could find a shoe to wear around the house . But after owning these for a few months , they have stretched out so much I can no longer wear them . The big toe area has a big hole in the leather , the ties keep coming apart and never stayed tied . I will not buy Minnetonka shoes anymore . Such a shame because they use to be quality made , now they are a piece of nothing . Maybe they are this way because they are n't made in the USA anymore .
 Purchased for my daughter for Christmas . She does n't love them and we want to exchange . Unfortunately , we accidentally discarded the box . Customer service will not respond to our inquiry about if we can return or not . So , we have n't been able to do anything yet and it 's been nearly a month .
 I bought this shoe four months ago . I paid fifty dollars for them , but they did not prove to be worth the money . Unfortunately , after two months the interior bottom started detaching itself from the rest of the shoe ; this makes wearing them very uncomfortable . Also , the shoelaces come undone every fifth step , so extensive walking is out of the picture if you do n't want to be highly inconvenienced . Overall , the shoe did not meet my basic expectations , and was utterly overpriced for the quality .
 What i ordered is Minnetonka Women 's Kity Moccasin `` DUSTY BROWN '' and what i got is a black one with tiger print on the top front . . though on the box its written dust browngetting a wrong order cost me a lot cause i live outside the US so i have to pay shipping plus customs and returning it via any courier will cost me triple its price ... i will think twice next time if i thought of ordering anything from Minnetonka !!! as i order a lot of things from others and get exactly what i order !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I returned this - I just could n't get over the feeling that I looked like an old lady wearing these ... They were ok comfortable , but not over the top comfortable where I could have gotten over the fact they did n't look good on me . If they felt more like a supportive slipper , I probably would have kept them .
 i wore these shoes for years and now they are made very differently . too big and wide for my narrow foot .
 I recieved the shoes promptly btu man where they in bad shape . One shoe was twice as wide as the other ! Really strange .
 It stinks the way Converse has ruined this shoe . The suede sole is gone . The padding around the ankle is gone . The padding in the tongue is gone . The Jack Pucell logo on the tongue is gone . The logo on the heel has changed . The durable shoelaces with metal aglets are gone . The trademark `` smile '' is no longer recessed in the toe . For some reason the insole eyelets are now located partially in the rubber midsole . The material and overall feel of the shoe is now flimsy , thin , and cheap . Oh , and - inexplicably - the blue version of the shoe now features white stitching.The changes were probably for financial reasons , but I 'd gladly pay 10 to 20 dollars more to have the Jack Purcell be like it was back in 2008 or ' 09 . Just save your money and buy a pair of All-Stars and draw a line across the front of each shoe with a marker . Basically , that 's what you 'd be buying .
 I was about to purchase these in Black/White , but every time i add them to my cart i 'm seeing the ` Canvas ' image , which leads me to believe these are not ` Leather ' as i had hoped . It 's very unclear and needs to be updated . I wo n't risk buying them just to receive the wrong product .
 I thought these shoes fit well and initially they seemed comfortable . I was happy with their appearance and quality , but after I wore them for only a short time , I had two big blisters on one heel . Maybe it 's just my feet , but these turned out to be killers . So painful I 'm afraid to try to break them in .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .

 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL

Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 Product as expected , BUT having to pay an extra 42 IMPORT CHARGE that was not expected as company never informed us . We had to pay over 30 P&P !!!!! NOT HAPPY ...
 Very disappointed in quality.Shoes marked as size 11.5 -LRB- Euro 46 -RRB- . These are barely an 11 . Euro 46 is equivalent to 12-12 .5 . What is wrong here?Shoes are pretty waterproof but do n't breathe so they are so hot they are uncomfortable indoors.Rockport used to make good shoes . I 'll not buy another pair .
 They looked like they would have lots of cushion , but the sneaker was hard and after a break in period they were just OK . They also had a flat sole witch did not work for me .
 I ordered these and when I received them they were defected . One of the tree stomp stamps was darker than the other and it was also crooked . One of the insoles was also too small for the shoe , maybe it was just the pair I recived , I dont know . Its a reason why they sell boots that cost 180.00 for 120.00 , you get what you pay for . I returned these and ordered from timberland.com for 180.00 and boots were perfect . Oh well .
 Used these boots for 30 days and found that the seam below the lower lace eyelet was ripping apart . I returned the boots for a refund ASAP .
 once these boots are on , they are awesome ; but the difficulty of getting your foot into and out of this boot makes it undesirable . I even ordered a 1/2 size larger , but it did n't help .
 I bought this pair of timberland boots , fully expecting to receive the one shown on the picture -LRB- with black padding at the top and the brownish color bottom -RRB- , but somehow , this seller sent me a different pair of boots . After I have emailed the seller about this issue , the seller did n't reply and instead , added the picture of the boots -LRB- no black padding -RRB- . Maybe they were going to change the picture , and I ordered it right before they changed it , but , I am rather dissatisfied about this purchase .
 my left shoe is not same as right shoe , the right shoe wide than left , and the left shoe tongue is not level
 Length :
 The boots arrived and were lovely . However , they were too big for my husband , so I returned them approximately three weeks ago . I have sent the company several messages through Amazon inquiring about when my credit card will be refunded . However , I have yet to receive a response even though the company boasts a 48-hour policy of getting back to customers . Lucky for me I have the receipt and can place a dispute on this charge . Order from this company at your own peril and make sure you keep all copies of receipts .
 i was very disappointed when these arrived.They are fake and cheap lookingI sent them back immediatly
 The product looks great but it is a lot more smaller than expected.I currently use size 9 for several other pairs of golf shoes from different brands.I bought these in size 9,5 thinking they would fit , but THEY DO N'T !!!
 Harder on my feet than most high heeled sandals i 've worn . And not as nice looking as the picture .
 These mules are neither comfortable nor impressive to look at . Not a great buy and am considering returning . The two stars is for the shipping from Amazon which was superfast .
 I bought these in my size - however the elastic in the back cut in the my heal . Also , I did not wear these often and they now have holes in the sides .
 i love rockports ... they 're great ! i actually wear a pair every day . however any shoe , boot or even sneaker , has some kind of a heel on it and the heels on these shoes are actually lower than the sole . sooooo , you feel off-balance whenever you are on your feet . they actually throw off your equilibrium ! yeah , the open adventures stink . rockport should have just stayed with the old reliable westlakes .
 I own a lot of heels and these are a pair that is more difficult to walk in . I think it 's the lack of arch support .
 I am very disappointed with these slippers . After a few weeks of wear , the fell apart . We have the `` ladybug '' slippers by the same company and they fell apart as well . It 's too bad because they were very cute .
 These slipper are VERY cute . My little girl has had them about 6 months and one of the soles is coming off . Seems like a sewing issue that others are having with these slippers also . They need a better QA deparment
 This shoe is very cute , but I believe it was an older style Clarks sandal , and it ran small . Although I own many Clarks sandals in the same size , this one was so snug , I had to return it .
 The shoes fit wonderfully and looked great with my dress . However , they looked like someone previously bought them and returned them . There was a scuff on the heel and the soles looked slightly worn . Did n't have time to return them for a new pair before the wedding .
 Bought these for my husband , he had this brand before and they lasted a long time.But the ones I purchased on Amazon seemed cheaper made and not as good quality.Don ' t know what happened there .
 Like many of the reviewers , I thought a long time before spending so much money on these shoes . Unlike many reviewers , I am very disappointed with the Mephisto Match . While true to size , after almost a month of wearing them , I do not find them comfortable . I have had to trim the insert in the right shoe to keep it from rubbing a sore spot on the side of my foot . In addition to the discomfort , a close look at the construction puzzles me regarding all the `` hand operations '' claimed by Mephisto . I have worn far more comfortable and supportive shoes for two-thirds the cost.A costly poor choice.On the positive side , I did pay less for these shoes through Amazon and , as usual , Amazon provided excellent service.Update . I realize now that I should have waited before my review of several weeks ago complaining that the Mephisto Match was an uncomfortable shoe . Having continued to wear them , they have become a pleasurable pair of shoes . Perhaps in my case , the shoes took a long time to break-in . Or perhaps it took time for my 75 year old feet to adjust to a `` proper '' shoe . At any rate , it is only fair to Mephisto to now say I am pleased with the shoes .
 I wore my Mephistos occasionally for three years and found them heavy but very comfortable . Then the leather strip around the laces separated from both shoes . They want $ 75 to `` refurbish '' - sounds better than repair - and add new laces . I bought a tube of Shoe Glu for $ 4.00 and did the job myself . When you buy Mephistos , you really do n't get what you pay for .
 I purchased a pair of these a number of years ago expecting them to last . They did not . They are moderately comfortable , yes , but so are many shoes . I would have expected at this price for the soles to hold up for at least a year of moderate use . They did not . For something so expensive that calls itself a `` Walking Shoe '' , this is inexcusable . I walked with these shoes approximately 15-20 miles per week in good weather on sidewalks and pavement . Within 9 months the outer rubber had worn through the on both heels and under the balls of both feet . At 12 months , the holes at each section had grown to the point where dirt and water were easily getting into the shoes and walking was downright uncomfortable . I 've owned shoes that were $ 300 less expensive than these and that lasted 5 times as long . These are , without question , the most overpriced and terribly constructed shoes I have ever owed .
 The arches of these shoes are much too high for me . I could not wear them and I gave them away . I am very disappointed . I will not buy Mephisto shoes again .
 For $ 24.97 the boot is n't bad if you can get past the fact that the fur sheds everywhere . I had fur in my mouth and on the floor when I tried the boots on for the first time . I decided not to keep them .
 These are fine for occasional use , but when I used them for hours of hiking , I injured my Achilles tendons badly .
 This shoe is very cute , but I believe it was an older style Clarks sandal , and it ran small . Although I own many Clarks sandals in the same size , this one was so snug , I had to return it .
 This is a very pretty , high quality leather shoe . The wedge heel is very steep and the toe is narrow . If you are going for looks only ... they are good . If you want any kind of foot comfort ... skip it !
 I just got my pair of sandals.I regret I didnot read the customer review before buying . Although very cute and trendy sandles , but are very uncomfortable .
 Bought these shoes for ARCH support ... there is none . Nice shoe , but if you are looking for good support ... do n't bother !
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...
 I owned a pair of Minnetonka Moccasins for about 20 years before they finally gave out . -LRB- The sole ripped at the toe -RRB- . I LOVED those moccasins - I wore them everywhere . I am not averse to ordering cheaper versions of popular styles , but in this case I was very clear that I wanted to order the Minnetonka brand . Although the shoes arrived on time and as ordered , the sole separated from the leather within one week of regular wear . When I looked at it , I realized the `` stitching '' between the sole and shoe body was ornamental and the sole was actually glued on . Although I reglued it and continued to wear them , they started to scuff immediately and , when I tried to clean them , found that they were not shining up like real leather , but peeling like leather blend . This was a terrible disappointment to me and I 'll be looking for a new brand of shoe . Why pay more to get poor quality ? Shame on Minnetonka .
 Beware this seller return policy . I have worn Minnetonka Deerskin moccasins many times over the years . They are always soft and comfortable . I wear a size 9 and have very narrow feet.These moccasins are well made , but they must be mis sized or seconds . They would never fit a medium width foot as they barely fit my narrow foot . I requested a 10 as maybe this would help.This seller return policy is not user friendly to say the least . The most troublesome is a 20.00 restocking fee . Policy states that shoes must be returned exactly as shipped . No problem EXCEPT moccasins had a handmade narrow band of white tissue paper around them which must be removed to try on and could never be replaced as it is . The company will not do an exchange . You must buy another size and hope they refund original cost . One has difficulty believing that the entire policy and white band of tissue is meant to STOP exchanges . I have NEVER written any reviews previously.I feel cheated by this company
 The quality was fine , but felt sticky on my feet . Perhaps I would have been happier if there was some type of lining . I felt bad , but had to return them as I knew it would never be comfortable on my feet . Sorry to say , I guess I have a problem with skin contact with deerskin .
 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .
 This is not the Tankerboot I remember at all . The actual fitting of the boot was incorrect . What I mean to say is , the physical size of the boot was not the size advertized . The straps were substandard , and would in my opinion would have worn out in short order . The reason I can say this is that I myself am a leather worker . I would have to remove and upgrade the straps to have any confidence in them . In closeing a size six fit like a size five . If you order these order large . Myself I went back to Corchran Jumpers . My last two of those sets lasted so long they could n't be resoled any longer . Five times to be exact . And I went directlly to U.S. Calvary -LSB- ... -RSB- , much better service .
 Wrong size sent to me . Product was not what was expected . The quality was not good and the leather was like paper . Definately not worth the money . Tried to return them and initially had trouble . No one responded . I was told they missed/did not get the email . I finally received the return label and sent them back . I was credited immediately.Dont know if I would buy with the company again but I would never buy shoes from that manufacturer with seeing them first .
 I ca n't wear these they make my feet bleed . They dig into my achilles ! ugh ...

 I love heels , the higher the better . I also adore shoes by Steven . This shoe however did nothing for me . I tried to wear it several times and always took it off to change into another pair . I do n't know if it was the gold color , and I really prefer bronze . Whatever it was , I gave the shoe to charity . It would have set new in the box forever . This way , hopefully someone will get to wear them , and maybe like them !
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .
 I ordered The Dingo Dan Post 's Mens Molly Harness Boot is `` Tan Apache Distressed . '' What I received was the same boot in Mahagony . . Eeww . Anyway , I am shippong them back and getting them in Gaucho -LRB- ? -RRB- because the `` Tan Apache Distressed '' version is no longer in production . Yet , it is still on the Amazon website and you can still order them . They will just ship you someting else ...

 these boots are ok for the price - they do they job but gave me blisters when I first wore them and they do n't make a great connection with the ball so they wo n't improve your game .

 I have the exact same feelings as William Hunicke in his review . I also do not have knee problems , but after running with these even for short distances now , my knees hurt . I have had them for probably a year now and I just ca n't take it anymore . I 'm on here to buy a new pair of shoes.I actually think they may have had a bad long term effect on my knees . Seriously , look elsewhere . They might look cool , but that is the only thing they have going for them .
 4 miles onto the first run in these shoes I developed a fore-leg tendon injury that took 4 months to heal . I have been using other running shoe brands for years with no problems.I realize it may just be my specific build/running mechanics , but hey , I will not touch these shoes with a 10-foot pole ever again-Tom
 These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes . The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact . I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them . I returned them and plan to try something else .

 I have been using this for couple of weeks . The shoe looks good andwell built . I like the grip . But the insole peels off - exposing the foamand it messes up the socks . Good shoe - but poor insole.Update
 ok so im a very athletic build i have large calfs and when i bought these boots i was excited that i found some white boots for my new outfit how ever the top of the boots is so big i can wrap them around my leg with out tieing themaxualy i cant tie them because they over lap way to much . so im returning them .
 I ordered the red patent leather ones , and when they came I was susprised at how LARGE the calf was for a 9 B -LRB- m -RRB- the tounge would not even stay up and they felt like they were actually size 11 's . Something is not right with these boots , either they are actually EE and not b , or something is wrong

 I 've had my pair for only three weeks . I went out in the wet grass in my yard this morning and then left the wet shoes on my covered porch . Went out 45 minutes later , and the left shoe was warped and the right shoe had shrunk . It was only 90 degrees outside , so this is unacceptable . Will not buy another pair .
 Please be advised , they do shrink . Mine were great for the week until I left them in the car during a bike ride . I went to slip them on afterward -LRB- post-bike being a main reason for the purchase -RRB- and they were tight . I assumed my feet had swelled until I noticed they were still snug and short the next day . Still refusing to believe it , I went to a store to try some on again . Sure enough , it was n't in my head . They had shrunk more than 1 croc size -LRB- I was borderline XL/XXL and my XXLs were now smaller than the XLs -RRB- . To make a long story short , I think there should have been a warning on the label . I do n't think it 's an obvious assumption that beach sandals will shrink dramatically in the sun/heat . I would have taken more care in these conditions .
 BUYER BEWARE
 These shoes were great for the first 3 weeks until one day when I left them in the car . One of the crocks sat in the sun and shrank half a size . I called the company , they know about the shrinkage issue , but unless you bought them through their web site , they 'll do nothing to help you . I 've worked around the outdoor retail business for years , and have never run into a more frustrating return policy .
 The fact is that crocs are VERY comfortable . So much so that I actually convinced several people to purchase a their own crocs after I related how comfy mine were.However , after a few hours left in the sun , mine have shrunk so much that I now can not wear them.There are people writing on here that theirs have not shrunk in similar circumstances . Well , that 's great for them , but it does not change the fact that a significant portion of crocs owners , as represented by reviewers on this site , have in fact had their crocs shrink . And that 's a real problem.At the very least , prospective buyers need to be aware of this situation . Since the crocs company is not inclined to share this info , it really is up to us , the consumers , to do so .
 Left in car during 100F day . Car was hot and they shrunk like George Constanza 's package in the cold pool . They shrunk 1-2 sizes and are garbage to me now . Loved them before that . I will attempt to return for poor advertising of this fact at REI .
 I am very very dissapointed in my croc sandals i purchased and loved ! They are now about 2 sizes too small and good for nothing ! I could not have even imagined that these shoes would shrink . I just thought i accidentally picked up someone elses sandals instead of mine until I started to look up and read all the reviews and complaints ! These shoes are way too expensive to have such poor quality ... I 'm just another dissatissfied customer !!! Think twice before purchasing these disposables !
 I went to put my crocs on and could not fit in them . At first I thought someone had the same pair as mine and I grabbed those . That was not the case . I then realized they shrunk - 2 sizes ! I then checked to see if someone had put them accidently through the dryer -LRB- they were in the laundry room -RRB- . That was not the case . My sandals shrunk on their own . I will never invest in a pair of Crocs ever again and I will let anyone who will listen know about this . Amazing there is no mention of this on any labling from the company . Totally disappointing and removes any customer trust in the product and the company .
 I discovered today what many people apparently already knew . Crocs shrink ! I have had a pair of the flip flop style crocs for 3 years . Today I left them in the car while we were at the zoo . It was hot today
 I 've had my crocs a while now and loved them up until this very day . My left shoe had shrunk to a third of the original size . Now , I checked the crocs website , did a website search and found NOTHING on the site talking about possible shrinking . Based on what I 've read about the company not giving a crap about this and being very aware of this issue , I 'm utterly amazed they continue to do such good business . Their practice is unethical and I now refuse to buy another pair , as does my family . It 's sad that I 've lost all faith in this company , but thankfully this happened before I purchased another pair .
 My hubby left his on the back deck after using them in the yard and they shrunk almost 2 sizes . So lame-we got them for gardening , but if you ca n't leave them by the back door after you are done b/c they 'll shrink in the sun , then what is the point ? We will get different clogs in the future .
 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .

 I like Vaneli styles , and I own other shoes from this company , but these were unusually cheap . They were unlined ! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet , and they are lined . The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining . In addition , the heel plates are cheap , hard plastic . My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off . My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges . FootSmart charged me $ 12.99 to ship the shoes , and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction , they are charging me $ 6.99 more using the barcode return label . Thus I spent $ 20 to try on cheap shoes . I do n't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore , and I wo n't order from FootSmart . Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero -LRB- -LSB- ... -RSB- ! -RRB- .
 Initially this is a very comfortable shoe and looks great on your foot , however the soft leather does not wear well and stretches out .

 Reasonably priced boots . Purchased these boots to replace a pair of Tingley insulated rubber boots that I had used for at least 15 years . The leather uppers offer no support . The removable liner is nice but seems way too soft . Seems like it will be difficult to use these boots to work in .

 The shoe is alright , I bought these shoes , and TRUST me they look so much better online than in person . Quality of the shoe is very poor .
 When I ordered these I thought that they were made in the USA . Wrong , made somewhere south of the border . My slippers came with very thin laces that looked as though they were cut with an exact o knife , not the thick leather laces as pictured . The first time I tightened the laces they broke . I sent them back to Amazon . I also emailed Minnetonka and complained . The CEO wrote me back with an apology . He thanked me for bringing the poor laces to his attention . The company sent me a free pair to make up for my trouble ! Amazing Customer Service . The new pair did have the thick leather laces as pictured however after three days of use the stitching around the top , which looks like some kind of straw has already begun to come unraveled . I can not recommend these disappointing slippers .
 Okay . I love these shoes . I have worn this model for years . Please get them.But not from this seller . I ordered a size 6.5 and they sent an 11.5 . When I sent them back , their form for returns included a choice for exchange and the reason . I told them on this form that the size was wrong . I heard nothing for quite a while.Finally I got an email saying that I had been given a refund . Well that was nice but I wanted an exchange . I wrote them back asking about that . They said they can not do exchanges since all their stock is on ebay . Okay . Fine . But why did n't they say that in their description that they do n't do exchanges ? And if they are all on ebay , how come you can get them on Amazon?Anyway , I did finally find my shoes and they will arrive soon - from another seller . Two months it took from my first order and I really will not work with this company again .
 I have a narrow foot and these were supposed to be narrow but were n't . I returned them immediately . I have other Ros Hommerson shoes that fit very well but these did not meet those standards . I returned them immediately .
 i ordered them for my wedding and I got pink ones from converse but i never got the green ones and they charged me for the return . not happy at all
 The Logo was on the inside of the Sneaker not the outside.It was defective . disappointed with Macy 's .
 I ordered this item , then AMAZON sent me another model -LRB- BALET TYPE -RRB- shoes ... I returned it , tried to explain the reason -LRB- but I think nobody even reads what we write -RRB- ... I ordered AGAIN the same shoes , and guess what ? AMAZON sent me AGAIN the same Naturino Balet Model.Too time consuming ... Keeping ordering and returning products . I understand there is something wrong with the CODE of this product with the whatever catalog they use to send the item ... But I gave up ordering this product .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 The description never told the height of the front of the shoe - just the heel . All other easy spirit shoes say ` flat ' . The description said 1 1/4 heel and nothing about the font of the shoe and it did n't say flat . THEY ARE FLAT . I sent them back . I wish Easy Spirit would remake the Travel Time High shoes . They are the best for me .
 I visited my sister and tried her Traveltime and loved how comfortable they were . She had a size 6 and they fit me perfectly . I order a different color and model , same size 6 and to my surprise they were 1 size too big . I had to pay $ 12 to ship them back . If I had known about sizing issue I would have ordered from zappos instead and get my free returns until I find ones that fit . I wo n't buy from Shoemall again unless they offer free return .
 Love everything about the shoe , except it feels that it is composed of somewhat inferior materials . Not as comfortable as I thought . I 've had better comfort with LL Bean mules.The color and design is appealing , but comfort level has a way to go .
 I presently have a white mesh Travel Time Mule in a size 8 narrow that I wore all last summer . I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the same shoe this past fall again but in a black suede in a size 8 narrow . Both pairs of shoes fit perfectly . Now today I received my Travel Time white leather mule in a size 8 narrow and it is much much too wide . I am disappointed that Easy Spirit has made so much of a change in their narrow width shoes . I will not purchase this Travel Time shoe again
 The shoe I ordered was navy and the shoe is black and the lining is blue ! The shoe is so wide it wants to slip . I am very disappointed and will return .
 i have 2 pairs of the same shoe in blue and beige . This one fit wide and was sloppy on my foot
 I have three other pair of easy spirits and I live in them so I ordered this pair on line since I am well aware of this product.The shoes were a little shorter than my others and the patent strip on the top of the right foot cut into my foot and I was miserable . Very disappointed .
 This is a nice looking shoe but after awhile , about an hour , my feet start to hurt . I thought from the others reviews that this would be an excellent comfortable shoe but not so for me .
 I really do not understand all the hype for these shoes . I guess to scuff around in they are ok but their almost flat contour has very minimal arch support . They also do nothing to correct common issues with arch and heel alignment which then allows the ankle to cant inward over time . SO not worth $ 70 and marginal even at the sale prices.I do n't care how many colors and textures you tart them up with , they are still the same kind of thing my GrandDad AND my Dad wore around the house . UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYIt is n't easy but I have found other brands with similar slips ons which have a much better fit , more arch and inner heel support , and much nicer styling ... . especially those with the bungee lace ups which give enough to snug up to your foot with or without socks . AND as to pricing , more reasonable than these.The one pair I did buy , -LRB- because many shoes can feel great at first -RRB- now only see occasional use in the yard when I pull weeds .
 The shoe itself is awesome . I own several pairs and so does my mother . As my mother is such a fan I decided to get her 2 additional pairs in other colors for Mother 's Day . The shoes arrived just fine , but my mother did not care for the colors.In all of my years -LRB- and family 's -RRB- of buying on Amazon I have never returned anything . When I called the merchant who filled the order , -LSB- ... -RSB- , to ask about the best procedures for returning I was very shocked by the representatives manner . When I was asking instructions on the best way to send the shoes back she was very rude . As I have n't had to send anything back before that I 've purchased on Amazon I also asked about how the $ would be refunded ... through the merchant or Amazon etc. . The -LSB- ... -RSB- rep sighed and groaned when I asked this question , and if I should insure the shoes etc. . I suppose I could have just caught the rep on a bad day , but because of this lack of professionalism I 'm very worried about my actual refund being given -LRB- I will update when this occurs -RRB- . Needless to say because of this interaction I will NEVER buy anything where -LSB- ... -RSB- is the merchant . You will be fine if the shoes are ok , but heaven help you if you have to interact with customer service .
 Used it once , washed it once , elastic had detatched . Pretty useless all in all . Still looking for something that works well .
 These shoes arrived with 4 different other pairs . All the boxes were damaged and did not have original style packing setups -LRB- crumpled out of place paper , shoes out of their bags , etc. . . i.e. , they were not packed the way shoe manufacturers ship them , and the boxes showed evidence of damage even before shipping , although more may have occurred due to the poor packing job from Amazon -- five shoe boxes in a big single-thickness box with no padding -RRB- , and this pair had evidently been worn by many different people in a shoe-store , as they had much evidence of dirty sock heels having been in the shoes , with a bit of sole wear as from a shoe-store carpet . Oh , and the uppers were scuffed as well , and inconsistencies in what is usually a high quality shoe indicates that these may have been `` seconds '' as well -- there are stripes in the coloring where an even tone or gradient would be expected , and the stitching is not neat as the usual Allen-Edmonds quality . These quality problems even lead one to wonder if these might be counterfeit shoes.Amazon fraudulently sells these and many or most others shoes as though they are new when they are not . It would seem from my ordering experience that many of the shoes they sell have at least been opened in shoe stores , and many have probably each been worn by many people in that context.I rate these one star because for the barely discounted price they should certainly be new shoes , delivered in perfect shape , and that was not at all the case .
 These jazz shoes are the kind that easily scuff and wear . The leathery outside rubs away easily , leaving a greenish scuff underneath . They probably wo n't be very durable for much longer . Also , I could n't tell in the picture , but this is the kind that does not have the fabric middle . It is leather all the way from toe to ankle .
 I purchased this exact shoe -LRB- Capezio -RRB- only to receive a brand called Dance Now . The description said to order your normal street size . This is wrong . You need to order at least a half size , if not a whole size larger . I ordered them for my daughter and they are too small . I am real disappointed . I am now stuck with a shoe that my daughter has to wear too small .
 This shoe was cut in a way that was terribly uncomfortable . Besides that , the leather was scratched .

 I was so hoping to love this bag . From the photo , description and price I was expecting at least a moderate-quality bag.The leather was extremely thin and looked and felt more like faux-leather , but that aside , the craftsmanship of the bag is what really made me return it . The fabric lining was smaller than the outer leather , causing the leather to pucker and fold in a way that looked terrible . I tried to see if putting things in the bag would fill it out and make it look better , but that did n't work . Too bad , because the yellow color was actually nice.Even for $ 20 , this bag would be completely unacceptable .
 I purchased this bag in black in the spring . I have used it quite a bit , but definitely not everyday . By the end of the summer , the leather at the top of the back started looking old and worn . Much of the leather lost its shine . It is definitely not worth the money . I am already looking for a new bag to replace it and it has only been about 4 months . Very disappointing .
 The size is correct for me but since it is not very comfortable and the scrap is hard so I have to return it .
 I was desperate for a new pair of work shoes ; I have purchased this Mary Jane from Propet before however the sizing on this was so wide it gapped when I put it on with thick socks . Had a hectic schedule at work and missed the short return period which was barely thirty days . Better to go to Zappos .
 This is a very attractive shoe but it lacks any type of support for the arch or ball of the foot . The footbed is very hard . It is an attractive round-toe style which I really liked . Too bad it would be very hard to wear over the long haul .
 Good delivery , easy return , beautiful shoes , but they do n't fit me . Soft , nice leather , very nicely made . Gaped a bit widely at the front , at the ball of my foot , when I took a step . But , I doubt it was the shoe , think it is my feet .
 Be warned , the Light Grey pair pictured is incorrect . The light grey pair received actually includes Hot Pink ! . . Also beware that these shoes have a mesh wall and as such will let water in . Not great for outdoor running , unless you want your socks to get wet ! . .
 like the previous reviewer said , the shoe pictured is not what was delivered . The 3 stripes are hot pink !!! in color .
 Great looking shoe , but beware the Ortholite anitmicrobial moisture-wicking sockliner leaves the soles of my feet raw red ? Adidas needs to go back to less abrasive materials . You might have to buy new sock footlines for these shoes .
 They were ok I guess I was looking for more of a sneaker type slip on , this was very light , as I know Easy Spirit 's are but it seemed a little flimsy . Just not for me

 These shoes are gorgeous . But , to even lift the feet to step out , they feel like they 're falling off the feet . The strap only covers the really front part near the toes that it doesnt cover enough of the dorsum of the foot for the shoes to stay on when you lift your feet . Also , they are not true to size . They run about 1/2 size larger , so it contributes to the above problem . In addition , after wearing it out to a new years party once , the bow on one foot popped off ! As beautiful as these shoes are , i would n't recommend them .
 I love this brand and have a beautiful pair of Italian shoes but found these to run small and actually found them cheaper in Ross Dept Store $ 19.99 so no bargain here .

 Perhaps I am accustomed to a higher grade of dress shoe , but these shoes are the most uncomfortable shoes I can ever remember wearing . The sole and body are extremely stiff , making every step a challenge . Small details like the thick sewn-on label on the inside heel make it feel you are steping on something . These will be relegated to `` emergency '' shoes .
 There were so big I could n't even walk in them . 15 is my true size in MOST shoes . I returned these and ordered a 14 and they were still too big . I guess me and Florsheim just do n't work so I 'm not messing with this brand ever again . Thanks for taking those shipping charges AMAZON !

 I bought a 9 1/2 size Men shoes and they were to tight . So I ordered a size above and received a 10 1/2 shoe which was still to tight . I 'll see if they stretch a little .
 This was the second pair of Reebok Time and a Half shoes that I have owned . Just like the first one the sides split out after about a year and a half . The shoes were comfortable but not durable enough . Will not purchase again .
 after five months of non-daily wear , they got a big tear in the covering - its not leather , not sure what the material is . cheap crappy shoes , do n't waste your money at this price .

 Cute , good color , but not the comfort I expect from Naturalizer ; heel slipped but otherwise did seem true to size
 I have purchased Naturalizers for years for my narrow foot but these shoes , tho cute were too short and width was too wide . I love mules and was so looking forward to wearing these but ended up being very disappointed and sending them back .
 I ordered a size 8 which is my usual shoe size and the shoes were too small . This style/brand of shoes must run smaller than standard . Sent it back for refund . Did n't trust purchasing a larger size .
 I ordered a half size smaller than my size based on reviews and the shoes were still way too big . A comparable sizing chart is needed or guidance from Rieker that their shoes fit an ? size bigger than US sizes . I did n't bother to exhange for the next smaller size .

 I bought this shoe for halloween and did not ware them due to the pain they caused . The front of the shoe was too short and my toes were squashed . Cute shoe
 I bought these slippers for my husband 's birthday present and we were both very disappointed in them . The back of the shoe would n't stay on his feet -- and he does n't even have an arch in his foot ! They looked nice , though , and inside it felt nice . He would have kept them had they stayed on his feet .

 I bought 2 shoes a couple months ago i.e 1 is a bostonian w size 8.5 EEE and Floorsheim Morton size 8 EEE . However , the morton size is bigger than that of the bostonian . I think it 's important that the standard of shoes size should be consistent . The size 8 should be smaller than 8.5 whatever the brand . Also as a lover of a light shoes I recommend that you add info about the weight of the shoes.The morton is too heavy for me.Thank you
 This is a nice traditional slip-on design . However , the pair that I got had a very obvious defect ; the lateral -LRB- decorative -RRB- leather band was longer on one shoe than on the other , so it wo n't snugly fit on top of the tongue as it is supposed to ; it awkwardly loops out . It is baffling as to how even a half-awake QC inspector could have missed it.I sent these shoes back without ever wearing them because of the defect , and some of the following comments are influenced by the Florsheim Mansfield model , which in many ways is a twin of the Morton model being reviewed here . I purchased the Mansfield simultaneously and have worn that shoe a couple of times.For anyone interested , the Morton model is made in India , and seemed to be a notch lower in the quality of materials and construction than comparably priced Bostonians . For example , I noticed small -LRB- 1mm ? -RRB- slivers of paint layers peeling near the stitching on the upper . Also , the leather sole did not seem to be the most flexible and had a hard , rigid feel/appearance to it.Lastly , the earlier comments about the shoes being a half-size too big are borne out by my experience also.PS
 I already have big feet and these shoes did me no justice . I really wear a 15 and these still were way too big . This was the second time I had to return a pair of Florsheim . I hate eating the shipping charges but Amazon gives you no choice .
 I have owned a few pairs of Cimacools and these are not true climacools . they were very tight and cheap . Do not waste your time on these shoes . Plus , if it rains outside , your socks will get wet .
 This item appears great in the ad . Unfortunately , it does not wear well . The insoles came out after the first week and have now started to fray around the edges after less than a month of use . I would have returned them , but my husband decided to keep them with the knowledge they would n't last very long .
 Skip this shoe -- the base and heel are covered in patent leather which will show all scuffs and scratches . That is a bad design decision .
 I have purchased Naturalizers for years for my narrow foot but these shoes , tho cute were too short and width was too wide . I love mules and was so looking forward to wearing these but ended up being very disappointed and sending them back .
 Cute , good color , but not the comfort I expect from Naturalizer ; heel slipped but otherwise did seem true to size

 These jazz shoes are the kind that easily scuff and wear . The leathery outside rubs away easily , leaving a greenish scuff underneath . They probably wo n't be very durable for much longer . Also , I could n't tell in the picture , but this is the kind that does not have the fabric middle . It is leather all the way from toe to ankle .
 I purchased this exact shoe -LRB- Capezio -RRB- only to receive a brand called Dance Now . The description said to order your normal street size . This is wrong . You need to order at least a half size , if not a whole size larger . I ordered them for my daughter and they are too small . I am real disappointed . I am now stuck with a shoe that my daughter has to wear too small .
 I 've been really disappointed by these booties . The heel is too narrow and sometimes causes my ankle to roll . The width of the toes are also too narrow , and my feet are n't wide in the slightest . I do n't think they 're comfortable at all . Big thumbs down !
 These boots are super cute ! They are a true navy and look great with skinny jeans either faded or darker blue , they make my legs look like they go on forever ! They feel like the arch -LRB- there is no arch -RRB- goes all the way across my foot so it feels like it 's being forced into an upside down V. I keep trying them on hoping they get more comfortable . I normally wear a 10 and the length is correct , but I have a narrow foot so my foot slides a bit in thinner socks . Thick socks were too thick , I 'll try medium thickness socks next and see if that works , otherwise they must be sadly returned. : - -LRB-

 These shoes are really cute , well made , nice looking , etc , but eventhough they are not tight -LRB- they 're true to size -RRB- these shoes are so hard they make your feet hurt ! I got them at full price months ago and now they 're really cheap , but I would not recommend them at all .
 The shoes are very cute and very well priced but uncomfortable to wear it for more than one hour .
 I thought these shoes were such a good deal , nine west flats for 20 dollars , I consider that a steal . But it isnt worth it . The first day that I wore them I developed horrible blisters on my heals . The shoes are also extremely hard . These shoes are definitly not everyday shoes , I am very dissapointed . Dont waste your money its not worth the pain and discomfort .
 If you 're looking for comfort , look on . I am still trying to break these babies in after 3 weeks . I even installed heal guards and they still rub terribly .
 This shoe only looks good on display . It is very uncomfortable . I wear eight and half but I bought a nine . The front is very narrow and upon wearing it for the first time it blisters the back and sides of your feet . What 's funny is that a co-worker of mine wore the same shoes and I ask her how is it , she took one foot out and oh my boy there were so many blisters on her feet . Yes ! I wondered why is she still wearing it , she said she bought it from another store and paid 3 times as much compare to amazon so she had to wear it . Do not buy this shoe . Not even good for charity .
 these shoes are so cute but not comfortable . they are also too low for me . I gave them to my daughter who has n't worm them yet .
 These shoes are cute but they gave me the worst blisters I have ever had . They 're honestly too painful to wear .
 I was expecting cute flats for everyday wear . But to be quite honest these are n't that cute . . more leaning towards granny looking shoes . The shoe is also VERY hard . Not quite sure about the comfort level yet since I have n't worn it outside , but I doubt it will be super comfortable . I do n't really like the heel of the shoe either . I will wear these for work . .
 This shoe was so cheap and it does n't run true to size . Save your money and click past this . This shoe started coming apart within 6 weeks .

 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .

 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 I bought a pair of these golf sandals after giving them to a friend as a retirement gift . I liked the way they looked and the fact that several reviewers said that they were very comfortable . Although they initially felt comfortable and seemed to be the correct size , the second time I wore them , I developed a huge blood blister on the back of my heel . I had to have it drained at an urgent care facility . I sent back both mine and my friend 's -LRB- she had n't worn hers yet -RRB- . I am hoping that I will get a refund . I do NOT recommend these .

 Most uncomfortable boot ever . Soles have no cushion deff not made for standing any length of time . inside finish is very hard at seam locations and VERY uncomfortable even when worn as loose as can get . I hope they -LRB- break in -RRB- some and are tolerable otherwise these will go in the trash . JUNK JUNK JUNK
 I received these under 60 days ago . I love the shoes , but have worn them probably less than ten times . In that time , the soles have completely ripped up inside . They have n't been exposed to any strange conditions and I 've mostly worn them either to work or walking around -- no great stress on them . I 'm assuming this is just a defective pair and not something wrong with the line . Love the look and comfort , but they fell apart almost immediately .
 I bought a pair of these shoes because they look really nice and feel decent for casual shoes . However , they have one major drawback - the outsoles are made of obscenely lousy black rubber that disintigrates with every step . STAY OFF OF YOUR FLOORS ! THEY LEAVE SCUFF MARKS WITH EVERY STEP !! I went to a house party and the owner noted after looking at his floor that somebody was wearing evil shoes . I was embarrassed and should have known better . In the alternative , Steve Madden makes similar shoes with a gum sole that do not have this problem . I wish I had never gotten these shoes .
 Shoddily-made shoe which does n't even merit a single star . Sole began to detach from the upper after minimal wear , eventually requiring Super Glue surgery . As evidenced by the many negative comments of other reviewers , Steve Madden footwear is emblematic of a general decline in the quality of many products in this age of suspect sweatshop `` craftsmanship '' and unit labor-cost obsession . Not one of the major sneaker brands seems to make a shoe that has anywhere near the durability of those produced 20 or 25 years ago.Forgive the digression , but remember Adidas back in the 80s ? Those shoes were indestructible , my circa '85 Lavers STILL look good and with a new insole are insanely comfortable . I bought a pair of the re-issued Lavers a couple of years ago and they are just worthless , flimsy knock-offs that probably would n't survive a single set of hard-court tennis.Madden shoes look great out of the box , but you 'd be better off fashioning a pair of sandals from discarded tires if you 're looking for something that will endure beyond more than a few months of routine wear .
 Received my item quickly but this was not at all what I expected . I purchased the same shoe in a different color so I expected the black patent to look the same but to my surprise it is not Patent at all . It is a nice shoe but I expected a patent leather - I returned the item .

 Although the order arrived quickly , The sizing was off . It ended up being a size too small . Upon contacting Amazon they said they would have the seller contact me . I wanted an exchange . I still have heard nothing almost two months later . Would not buy again .
 I have purchased 3 pairs of doc 's in my lifetime . The first pair , shoes , I bought about 5 years ago . They were great comfortable shoes and lasted a good 4 years . This year I purchased a replacement pair of shoes and a pair of boots -LRB- the ones I am reviewing -RRB- . Both the new shoes and the boots started to squeak within a few weeks of owning them . I 'm not talking about squeaking on the floor , they actually squeak somewhere within the shoe/boot . It seems like it is coming from between the leather part and the sole . I 'm not saying that this is the cause , but , the two new pairs were both made in china . The original pair was not . Coincidence?I wo n't be buying doc 's again .
 I bought these boots on 9/5/2011 . They are the first pair of Doc Martens I ever had . I wear them to work everyday where I am a database developer , so I sit at a desk all day . Yesterday , 1/18/2012 , I noticed the sole of one boot is spliting horizontally and I can see the underside of the leather upper . I do n't imagine it 'll be too long before the tread comes off completely . Really sad for an industrial boot .
 I bought this shoe for halloween and did not ware them due to the pain they caused . The front of the shoe was too short and my toes were squashed . Cute shoe

 Bought 2 pairs of these in different colors . Wore 1 pair once . So uncomfortable , altho they looked really nice . Had to give away .
 It looks good but hurt my feet . I have never wore it after 20 minutes . The bottom was too heavy and the top is too little to hold onto your feet .
 These shoes do not look in person the way they look online . They are actually very narrow , and the toe curls up a bit . The shoes break in , right where the design is on the top , and this makes the shoe look bubbly at the top . A very uncomfortable shoe , that will spend its time in my closet , because it is skinny and uncomfortable . Shame on Mr. Cole for this one .
 I bought this shoe for halloween and did not ware them due to the pain they caused . The front of the shoe was too short and my toes were squashed . Cute shoe
 Too small . . I should buy 8.5 size . I normally buy 7.5 and 8 , but this really small on my feet . Kinda waste my money on this . I did not return , probably will cause me more . : - -LRB-
 the shoe was not correct size . Apparently , a larger width is not available . Size 11.5 W is needed . Shoes were returned
 I have worn these Reebok Nylon Classics for years . They just fit and were a reasonable price . However , when they outsourced these to China in the 90s the quality started to go down . When they went to Vietnam they got worse but I still bought them . The last pair I bought was made in Cambodia . A poor fit to begin with and almost no arch support anymore . Then after only two weeks , the tread on both shoes began to come off . What were once really good , affordable sneakers have now been reduced to third rate junk - all to meet the bottom line of Reebok . Geez , bring them back to be made in America ...
 I have been buying this model for at least 35 years and was always satisfied , now they changed the internal parts of the shoe taking out the arch and using a thinner pad with a different feel . They will not get my businessanymore , trying to reduce cost on material and design is a big mistake . Good bye Reebok , my last shoe .

 Sorry but my other review posted was for the `` Adidas Stan Smith Hardware W '' - womens size 9.5 -- That I purchased after returning these . Those are great . THESE ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT . These are not true to size -- They were more like a 10.5
 I have the same problem with these shoes that I had with the first pair you replaced . They have VERY soft soles and are wearing away at an unbelievable rate . They will probably last for two months , or about 10 to 12 wearings.I live in Hawaii and our court temperature can get to 100 degrees , but after all they are tennis shoes and should be made to withstand wear.I would never pay money for these shoes again .

 THIS WAS A REALLY NICE LOOKING SHOE , BUT WAS TOO NARROW FOR ME . I HAVE A NARROW FOOT , AND USUALLY THE OPPOSITE OCCURS , SO I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED , BUT HAD TO RETURN IT !
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 The shoe is 5 star , Amazon sucks !!! You say you 'll match any price , so I find a price less than one/half what your selling at and you ding me postage twice to get it back to you and no other compensation for messing around with you . This is ludicrous .

 I also ordered the loafers and received sandals . When I tried to return them , I could only exchange them even though my size was out of stock . After three very long calls to customer service , I was allowed to return the sandals for a refund , but had to pay the shipping myself . If you order these shoes and get the sandals , it might be best just to keep the sandals . For me , at three hours of my time on the phone , plus twelve dollars in shipping , it would have been cheaper to keep the sandals .
 I ordered the loafer and got the sandals . I will keep the sandals , they are not bad , but I wo n't order from Propet again .
 The sandals are okay , not terrific , too much of a hassle to return . Probably wo n't order again .
 Propet Women 's Comfy Walker LoaferI also purchased the loafers for $ 34.90 but received sandals instead . Must be a mixup with the photo/item number . Easy return process by printing pre-paid return label . Original shipping charges also to be refunded .
 Overall construction is good however the side top edge does not have a cushion for the ankle bone . This caused an abrasion under the ankle . Product was returned and credit was issue in a satisfactory manner .

 These have been around for a long time . That 's why there called classics . However I have owned at least 5 previous pairs growing up . I was expecting the same pair of CLASSIC K-Swiss shoes . This pair does n't seem to have the same comfort or durability as before . Seems like I 'm cleaning them constantly and I 'm way more metro now then back then . If I had to pick one thing out It would be the laces . They turn black from the metal loops they lace through . They did n't used to have metal loops . Sad because these were the best shoes back in the day .
 Even if you 've worn these since the 60s , 70s , or 80s -LRB- as I have -RRB- , do yourself a favor and DO N'T order these online . They 're smaller than they used to be and after wearing them for decades they no longer fit -LRB- too narrow especially -RRB- . Not only are they hard to find in stores now , but now that most people will be ordering them online they changed the sizing . Worse , if you order direct from K-Swiss they will take a return but will deduct $ 5.00 unless you do an exchange . I 'd exchange for a 12 wide but they do n't have one listed on their site for this shoe , nor on this page as of this writing . Too bad , because I really liked them for 30 years .
 I have been buying this same exact shoe for 30 years now , one pair per year , and have always been happy with the product . I was disappointed this time however , and returned the shoes for a refund . While the quality seemed ok , the shoe had substantial changes . Most of the changes were subtle , like the info tag on the inside of the tongue no longer being present , tread design changing slightly , and a different insole/liner . The changes however that prompted me to return them were more serious . The shoe &#34; felt &#34; narrower , so I compared it to my other pairs and used a tape measure to make sure my observations were correct . The new model ranged from 1/4 &#34; to 3/8 &#34; narrower across the entire sole , a significant difference . The second significant change was a higher arch support , which is not necessarily a bad thing if you need it -LRB- I do n't -RRB- . While I can understand that over the years some things will probably change , It would be nice to know that upfront before I make the purchase.Lesson learned
 I have been wearing this exact same shoe for almost thirty years now and it 's one of my favorite tennis shoes for comfort , style and versatility . I say this so that when I tell you that I believe these are knock-offs you will understand that I know what these shoes should look and feel like . Here are some things that made me suspicious
 base of shoe was close to 1/2 '' narrower than luxory edition that I was attempting to replace . the luxory edition is no longer available in my size . the price is about the same . if you can find your size in the luxory edition get that one !
 I bought these shoes at Foot Locker , and within days of attempting to break them in , I strained the right big-toe metatarsal ligament so badly I had to miss work for a couple of days . I should not have listened to the idiot salesperson who told me the shoes would stretch to fit when I remarked how squeezingly tight they felt . I recall that I really felt the squeeze all across my metatarsals , too . And this sleazy company wo n't give me my money back even though their lousy product caused me injury . Upon examining these shoes , you 'll see that they have no toebox worthy of the name ! Look at the entire shoe , and you 'll see that there just is n't as much shoe there as there really should be . These shoes companies keep making these shoes tighter and narrower and tighter and narrower because narcissistic fashion-conscious teenagers want them that way -LRB- some teenagers will buy tenner-shoes two `` half-sizes '' too small and force them stretch out because they think that looks pretty or something -RRB- , and now it has gotten to the point where they 're so tight and narrow that they will inflict harm upon your feet . Is n't it about time somebody just said , `` Enough ! '' to this bizarre insanity?Thank you K-Swiss for making me realize that it 's time for me to move on from tenner-shoes and just wear regular grown-up shoes .
 These jazz shoes are the kind that easily scuff and wear . The leathery outside rubs away easily , leaving a greenish scuff underneath . They probably wo n't be very durable for much longer . Also , I could n't tell in the picture , but this is the kind that does not have the fabric middle . It is leather all the way from toe to ankle .
 I purchased this exact shoe -LRB- Capezio -RRB- only to receive a brand called Dance Now . The description said to order your normal street size . This is wrong . You need to order at least a half size , if not a whole size larger . I ordered them for my daughter and they are too small . I am real disappointed . I am now stuck with a shoe that my daughter has to wear too small .
 Even if you 've worn these since the 60s , 70s , or 80s -LRB- as I have -RRB- , do yourself a favor and DO N'T order these online . They 're smaller than they used to be and after wearing them for decades they no longer fit -LRB- too narrow especially -RRB- . Not only are they hard to find in stores now , but now that most people will be ordering them online they changed the sizing . Worse , if you order direct from K-Swiss they will take a return but will deduct $ 5.00 unless you do an exchange . I 'd exchange for a 12 wide but they do n't have one listed on their site for this shoe , nor on this page as of this writing . Too bad , because I really liked them for 30 years .

 These have been around for a long time . That 's why there called classics . However I have owned at least 5 previous pairs growing up . I was expecting the same pair of CLASSIC K-Swiss shoes . This pair does n't seem to have the same comfort or durability as before . Seems like I 'm cleaning them constantly and I 'm way more metro now then back then . If I had to pick one thing out It would be the laces . They turn black from the metal loops they lace through . They did n't used to have metal loops . Sad because these were the best shoes back in the day .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .

 Cute , good color , but not the comfort I expect from Naturalizer ; heel slipped but otherwise did seem true to size

 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women . I ordered them , waited anxiously , tore open the box when they arrives and ... The 4E -LRB- which was labeled on the shoes themselves , so it was n't a mistake in size -RRB- was NOT wide AT ALL . They were narrower , in fact , than my mother 's medium width shoes . This is NOT an industry standard 4E ... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed .
 After just 4 weeks , the inner lining is seperating and coming out , and the velcro is n't sticking anymore . You should also know that this shoe is not really for narrow feet . The velcro wo n't allow you to adjust for width . I think it 's probably a medium width shoe and wo n't adjust to anything else . Also , when we got the shoes , I was very surprised by how there was absolutely NO padding in the shoe . The leather is really soft and the soles are really flexible ... but I do n't think it 's meant for a lot of walking . They are cute ... but do n't expect to get a lot of wear out of them ...

 I bought these shoes because the my daughter -LRB- 9 mos -RRB- was in between sizes of the shoes she normally wears -LRB- pedipeds -RRB- . When I recieved them I was disapointed that they were not white like in the picture but more of a cream color . They were also very wide and did not fit her feet as well . I noticed the stitching around the shoe was already coming apart and we had not even worn them yet . I would not reccomend these shoes . The are cute and a good price but they are made cheaply .
 Loved , loved , loved these shoes until they fell apart after 3 weeks ! Leather is nice and supple , design is adorable , price is fantastic , but ... . The whole stitching around the front of the shoe is too weak for a 14 month old walking !
 I bought these , thinking how adorable these would look on my 16 month old daughter . I received them in a timely maner and was so excited to have her wear them the next day . She came back from Day care with the leather fraying around the seams . I picked her up the 2nd day , when my day care lady handed me the shoes and said that they were garbage but cute . I looked at them and the whole seam around the front of the shoes came off . leaving gapping holes . What a disaster and how dissapointing since I did thought they were so cute and with the strong rubber bottom I only thought they would outlast any other of her shoes . WRONG ! Do n't get these shoes if you expect them to last more then 1 wearing .
 These shoes are off white in color and seem to be made for a wider foot . The cost of shipping and return shipping is almost as much as the shoes , so be sure before you buy .
 Yes the shoes are adorable ... but it 's hard for me to put them on my daughter because the pair I received was off-white / cream ... do they do n't really match with her black and WHITE dress or her red and WHITE dress . I keep forgetting to get something cream to match them !! Now I 'm looking at other pairs of shoes to buy and I 'm wary about whether I 'll get white or not-white !!
 I thought these would work but they just were too narrow for my foot and did n't match up to the quality of the Acorn slippers
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer

Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .

 I did n't like these shoes at all . They are cheap quality and the bottoms are very slippery . I fell down some stairs the 2nd time I wore them . I looked at the bottoms and they collect any kind of grime possible . They do n't allow your feet to breathe allowing them to slip off mid step when walking . It 's quite embarassing when you 're in Target and you 're shoes are flying off your feet . I can see why the shoes were so inexpensive . I have many , many pairs of shoes and these so far are the only shoes I 've had a bad experience with .

 I bought these shoes and after wearing them for 20 minutes I had blisters the size of quarters on my heels and toes .
 I found these shoes to be a tad to small for their sizing an they are hard an uncomfortabl , should have sent them back but after what I paid in shipping an what I 'd have to pay to send them back I would be out alot of money with nothing to show for it :0 -LRB-
 Reviewer By Jen , William 's Wife : Okay , I did n't have the highest expectations for these shoes . I would never workout in anything besides the best athletic shoes no matter how tall or cute these might make me look . I simply wanted a tennis shoe with some height that I could wear walking about the mall or the supermarket that would n't look ridiculous and would be comfortable . These disappointed me immensely . They are only about an inch higher than normal athletic shoes , and while they are cute and look very nice , are made of a very stiff material that does not bend with the natural toe action . The problem is not in the sole padding but in the upper toe area , and this can not be alleviated by adding foot pads . I used these to simply walk about Circuit City for a few hours and my feet were purple afterwards . I hate to leave the house in anything lower than four inch heels , and most of them are much more comfortable than these shoes . I plan to give mine to Goodwill ; they are that painful .
 These shoes were so uncomfortable , I could not wear them . I ordered them a half size larger as instructed from other reviews of this product . They did fit , but the sides came up too high and hit against my ankle bone causing discomfort . I have never had this problem before with any shoe . Will not be keeping these !
 I do n't like it at all , it looks like a christmas shoes . It 's look better on the net . Maybe it 's not my style someone else most like it .
 I purchased this as a birthday present for my mother in law who is currently searching for a new job . I thought it would be a good way for her to carry her resume , references , etc to her job interviews . Unfortunately , when it arrived its only the size of a small cosmetic bag ! This is not at all what I thought I was getting for her and I am strongly encouraging her to exchange it right away ! I am extremely dissapointed - over $ 100 for something the size of a cosmetic bag !

 Bostonian shoes have been a favorite mid-priced brand of mine for several years . The shoes that were US or Italian made offered good fit , style and value . But what 's an American to do in a global market ? Since most , if not all , US brands have gone off shore to manufacture their shoes in an ever widening number of countries , finding a shoe that fits correctly is increasingly difficult . I have found that sizes vary a great deal depending on where they are manufactured as well as the brand . Shoes made in India have tended to be wider / longer than the old American standard.These shoes are made in India and the 9M was long and very wide . Sent them back for an 8 1/2 M - same thing . Sent those back for an 8M and the shoe is somewhat short and still too wide . I was able to compensate for the width with a tongue pad but they still do not feel right because of the length . If you have a wide foot , the seller offers free shipping and returns and you have the time / patience to send back and forth then you may be able to get a good deal . But if you have to have them right away , or you have to pay for the return you may not want to purchase these mail order . If you really want this style , go to a brick and mortar and try them on to make sure they are going to fit and be comfortable.These are light weight , thin-soled , lightly padded , all leather shoes except for the heel which has a rubber insert . Not made for a lot of walking . I have only worn them a few times and have noticed loose stitching on the top trim on the side of one shoe .
 My husband wears 8W . We ordered this shoe in that size ; it was way too long and wide . We ordered 7.5 D. Width OK but still way too long . We gave up !!

 I loved the shoes and the price so much I bought two . After wearing the shoes one day I noticed that the wood at the front of the shoe had cracked all the way through to the sole . The nail that attached the rubber sole had created a crack and during the day the crack got so big that the shoes were not safe to continue wearing.Wear the shoes with caution ; they can become deadly to your health and safety .
 These are the most uncomfortable shoes I 've ever had on my feet . The straps dig into your feet like you would n't believe .
 I have never tried on a shoe this narrow and ordinarily my feet are just a bit narrower than medium width ! I will have to return them and miss out on this one since a larger size would not rectify anything -- the footbed is true to size . Had thought about keeping them and trying to have them stretched because the price is great and the look is super-cute but the thong portion on my left foot must have been too close to the outside of the shoe and it was really pressing painfully on my middle toe . Overall , I would have to say shoddy quality since neither of the other reviewers mentioned narrowness -- you just do n't know what you 're going to get !
 my shoe literally broke in half after wearing them once - not happy at all .
 I was diappointed with this purchase . The inside sole of these shoes move all about and do not stay in place , so I have had to remove them . Instead , I have my own insoles for support , another thing this shoe did not have . I do hope the exterior of this shoe holds up . I expected so much more from a speedo product.Don ' t waster your money or time on this product .
 Well , the inner soles crawl up and curl around your toes.I tried to fix it , but no good.Don ' t buy them
 They look great , but do not run to size . Leaving for a cruise next week . Will probably have to buy water shoes on board .
 Within the first week , the liner inside the shoe fell out . I expected better quality from this brand name product .
 Poor protection . Not enough sole to protect from pool bottom . Did n't stay on . Flimsy . Returned it . Got a different brand .
 These felt comfortable the first time I wore them . After about 20 minutes of walking around in these -LRB- we were walking to our cave tubing site -RRB- they had rubbed the inside part of my feet raw . I had two huge blisters in the weirdest spots where these were rubbing . :-LRB- I do n't think I can wear them again .
 It constantly blows my mind that manufacturers of thees shoes -LRB- especially you Speedo -RRB- make a water shoe that does not ultimately hold up to the rigors of cycling wet-dry-wet-dry ... !!!! After about 2 months -LRB- over a year period -RRB- of constant wet-dry use , the inner soles start to lose their adhesiveness ! This is unacceptable for a constantly wet water shoe . I have not been able to find a manufacturer that makes a good solid or one piece sole design for this purpose .
 I absolutely love how these look -LRB- I got the light blue ones -RRB- , and they fit really well . I 'd be delighted with them except that , having only worn them twice , the footpad in one has already come loose and bunches up in odd places under my foot . It 's pretty annoying . I spend a lot of time trying to tug the pad back into place , but that only works for a min or so . I 'm thinking of trying to reglue it , but I 'd have to figure out what type of glue to use.Such a shame because I really like these shoes otherwise .
 pretty flimsy for a water shoe - certainly would not want to stub your toe on coral . ok for walking on the beach but not for more adventurous endeavors ... prob get eaten up real quick
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer

 I ordered 3 pairs of New Balance M 878 shoes and got the wrong size and a different model . If the correct shoe was n't available I would have preferred being told that rather than getting a wrong order .
 Since you ca n't return them , buying shoes online is not a good idea unless you are already familiar with the exact size and model .

 These shoes were once made in Europe and were fine shoes . They are now made in China and are not the same . The leather is much thinner and the shoes wear out in the heel very quickly inside . A lot of products are finely constructed in China , for example Apple Computer products . Clark needs to compare the quality of their former version of this shoe to the current version . It 's all about supervising the manufacture , not the fault of the Chinese factory . I own a pair of the former version and the current . They do n't feel quite the same to the foot either when wearing them .
 I have purchased two pairs of these shoes in the past and have worn them for many years . The shoes have been very comfortable and durable . In fact , I still have the last pair of shoes I purchased five years ago and they still look like new , despite showing moderate sole wear . With this purchase , I had only worn them for less than two hours and the both soles separated from the upper portion of the shoes and one of the soles split in half ! The vendor graciously refunded the full purchase price without me having to incur any addtional cost of returning them ... they accepted a picture of the shoes as proof of their post-wear condition .
 I bought a 2nd pair after loving the 1st pair I bought about 5 years ago . This pair , although priced lower , fit nothing like the first . They were much narrower with a thinner sole . I noticed the 1st pair was made in Pakistan while the inferior 2nd pair in China . Buyer beware !
 The previous three pairs of this shoe were made in Europe and they lasted for over 3-4 years , however , the two new pairs -LRB- black and brown leather -RRB- were made in China AND THEY FELL APART IN 3 MONTHS.It is very deceptive to sell at $ 130 quality shoe and then produce a highly inferior shoe . The base of the brown shoe was worn out after only 10 walks . The specialist that shines my shoes told me that the cheaper thin material and assembled poorly in China .
 Clarks Men 's Natureveldt , purchased through Gabriel Shoes came apart after wearing them moderately for 4 month . Gabriel shoes did not provide any help just because the order passed 90 days policy.Awful product , awful service .
 I have worn Clarks for over 30 years and those shoes were made in England . These Chinese copies do n't measure up in any way with the originals . In fact , I have sent my shoes back for a refund and are resoling my old Clark 's thru Resole America for 72.00 . The key difference was the foam , comfort air insole inside the bottom of the shoe ; it did n't have the give or immediate fit as was promised . Sadly , I have keep looking for alternative brands that might measure up to these original Clarks .
 Shoe needs more padding . There was none on the tongue and it chaffed .
 I was excited to receive the package with my new shoes , only to be disappointed when I discovered that they sent me BLACK shoes instead of the Chestnut color I ordered . I phoned the company and a sales rep apologized and made arrangements for me to ship the incorrect shoes back at no charge and she said the correct color would be sent right out . I returned the incorrect shoes and then waited for the new Chestnut color shoes to arrive . But , no shoes . Finally , after repeated email inquiriea , I received a blunt response saying essentially , `` We TOLD you we do n't have the Chestnut colored shoes '' . I will not order from this company again as it appears they do n't have good internal communication .

 You get what you pay for . They are comfortable out of the box . The waterproof works for awhile , but they do not take a beating . The soles are not solid rubber . They are hollow and quickly fall apart with any type of extended wear - mine lasted a few weeks of serious hiking and now 5 weeks into hiking they are completely un-useable . The only thing between my heels and the ground is the waterproof lining and the piece of paper they have for insoles . If you are going on vacation and need some boots that need no working in to feel comfortable these are worth it . Do consider them disposable however .
 I echo the other reviewer who gave 1 star . My story is exactly the same . I got about 4 weeks out of them . They 're really comfortable ... I was thrilled . Then I was walking through a parking lot on a rainy night and wondering why my foot was completely soaked ? The soles were gone ... I did n't buy them from Amazon . I wish I had . Then at least I could have returned them . Dunham Sports would n't take them back because I did n't have the receipt and Itasca ... . it 's some shady outfit that does n't want to be contacted . Eventually I tracked down the company that owns that label , boxed them up with a nice letter and shipped them back . I hope to hear from them but I 'm not holding my breath.They were fine for a few weeks but over the weekend I wore them ... yes , hiking . I did about 12 miles , and apparently that was that.Save your money and do n't buy anything from this company . I ca n't believe I 'm saying it but you might do better at the Temple of Consumption aka Wal-Mart . I do remodeling work for a living and I have produced the kind of product you get from these companies ... I would rightly be labeled a criminal . Why do they get away with ? For some reason the public thinks that if they have a big building and a neon sign with a franchise name , somehow that makes them legitimate . They have more credibility than I do since I 'm just a self-employed nobody . I ca n't say I think too much of the good folks who work for these outfits . I realize many of them are just working minimum wage jobs but I could n't do it .

 The shoes are fine but the color was not what we expected . Look closely at the picture and enlarge it . It is two toned and pretty drastic . If you like those things , it will be fine , I was expecting a very subtle two tone .

 I 've own 100 's of shoes . These are the first to hurt my foot . Something is poking me . Made in China ! Will find some New Balance made in U.S.A.
 I still didnt receive the shoes ?????????????? its been a month now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .

 these are super cute , BUT WILL NOT STAY ON CHUBBY-LEGGED babies !!! the leg opening , although featuring velcro , does not adjust properly to keep them on !
 I ordered these booties because I really liked the light pink color of the boots . But what I received is dark pink which is completely different than the product image . I am totally disappointed . The images of the product shared here are deceptive .
 Booties are not made for infants . They are not ergonomically correct and do not consider the width and thickness of most babies ' feet .
 I thought these boots were nice but when I received them they ran so large I ordered the smaller size and they were still to big . They do not stay on child 's feet I am hope he grows into them but i think that they run so large around the ankle that he will prolly never use them .
 I ordered these and besides running WAY to big they were dirty . On top of my disappointment they charged me a shipping fee to send back . I 'm very disappointed because i normally like this brand.Minnetonka Infant/Toddler 1187 Hook-And-Loop Boot
 I ordered an infant size 2 , but received a size 5 . I ordered these specifically for a photoshoot with my son , and by the time we received the order it was too late for me to return them and exchange for the correct size . I decided to keep the size 5 that was sent , and my son can grow into them . However , I am very disappointed that this error was made and we were unable to use these in our photoshoot .
 We were looking for little boots for my granddaughter to wear . These are unlined and more like moccasins than boots .
 I ordered these shoes not only because their adorable , but I love the pale pink color . When I opened the box yesterday I found that they are bright , hot pink , not the pale pink that is pictured . I 'm pretty sure that this is the new color that Minnetonka uses , but I thought that since I was buying from Amazon , it would be the color advertised . I am returning them and now looking at sites like ebay to find the pale pink color .
 This shoe looks like my regular diabetic walking shoes , but the quality and workmanship is very poor.The straps were made with such thin leather , that when walking in my livingroom , the straps actuallycut my skin over my ankles and toes . Had to send them right back . Beware of copy cat items whenpurchasing items for yourself .
 PRODUCT WELL MADE , SIZED PROPERLY , LEATHER UPPERS SUPPLE AND NICE . HOWEVER , SOLE WAS VERY HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE TO WALK IN . STRAP WAS DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE FOR ME , AND THERE WAS NO ARCH SUPPORT AT ALL
 Looked like they were substantial sandals . I looked at the pictures very carefully , though what I could not see until they arrived was the poor finished product in the top strap . It was not rounded and finished off soft , rather it was rough along the seam edges and therefore it would give blisters rubbing on the top part of the toes . Shame , other than that it was a decent sandal .
 The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so . The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality .
 I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color , but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large . I returned them but had to pay the postage . I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong .
 The product runs large and the process of trying the exchange for smallersize is just about impossible . I am still trying to get the shoes back in a half size smaller . They would be o.k. if they fit .
 These shoes run much smaller than Clark 's . I was very disappointed and ended up stuck with them because I could n't get to the post office to return them within the 30 days .
 These were not comfortable for me . I have a bunion on one foot so the adjustable straps were good but after an hour or so on my feet , they hurt . I just have a really hard time finding shoes that do n't hurt my feet and these were not them .
 Propet Women 's W0001 Breeze Walker SandalThis shoe is advertised as a walker , but it did not give my feet enough support for me to walk across the street in them . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes . The return was easy , and I appreciated the service I received , just not the product .
 A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain . The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank , and the Tigertooth does not . I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way , I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia . The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake . The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking . I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it .
 I purchased these 3 years back but rarely wore them . Recently I figured out why I did n't , the sole wears unevenly toward the back first and while the tops looks near new the bottom looks well used like a regularly worn everyday shoe . I 've worn another pair of shoes purchased at the same time nearly every day the last 3 years . While the top is worn pretty good the bottom is still in better shape than these trail shoes . I know these replaced another model but it sounds like every one wants the old model back because they were much better than this `` new version '' . I 'm guessing this is why no one sells them on amazon anymore but they are available if you want to try your luck . Personally I ca n't recommend buying these unless you like to throw your money at something you can wear short term at best unless you only use them on grass ...

 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .

 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic !

 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer

 I , too , had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe . The new shoe was not as comfortable at first , but after time has become more comfortable . After just over a year , I , too , have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers . The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes . This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear .
 I 've owned 3 pair of these shoes . Comfort is great , good support , roomy toe box and easy to get on and off . But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear . The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly . I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear . The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior . I 'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality .
 I bought a pair of Eastland 10 years ago and they were fantastic shoes , comfortable and long lasting , they finally died . I then purchased 2 pairs of the newer version of the shoe shown here , not as comfortable as the original -LRB- the others looked better for the work place too -RRB- but I broken them in and they were acceptable . Now a year later the sole of the shoe has split in two . Definitely not as well constructed as the last pair but they cost the same . Actually the interior of the heel of one of the shoes broke very shortly after I started using them . Right now it would seem I would get about as much usage from a pair costing 1/3 as much . One of the reasons for going to these was because the cheaper shoes die after about a year of wear . The quality has really degraded . You might want to look elsewhere .
 I purchased this shoe in the usual size I take in Eastland shoes and I could hardly get my foot into the shoe . Once on , with the use of a shoehorn , the shoe was long enough but too tight overall . Too uncomfortable on , it was immediately apparent they had to go back . Disappointed as the shoe is good looking and I have had very good luck with Eastland shoes otherwise . Plus had to pay return shipping . : -LRB-

 Rainbow are the most comfortable men 's sandal , but they were not the right one 's that my son wanted . But overall they are a comfortable sandal .
 I wanted some cute flip flops to wear to the carribean . I wore them there and then never again . They cut into my feet so efficiently that after wearing them for maybe 12 hours -LRB- on an off , you know , because of the pain -RRB- , I had to wear band aids on my index toes for the remained of the trip . Not even remotely worth the purchase .

 While the shoes are indeed easy to walk on and they fit well with my wide feet . They do rub on the inner side of my arch and in a short walk will cause blisters on them . Ca n't wear them without socks which defeats the purpose of clogs ...

 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 The last Naturalizer Navy Women 's Scout sandals I bought were well made . These had cheaper quality leather , thinner soles , and no elastic in the back of the heel , which I need for my narrow heels . I was disappointed . Especially , since I paid $ 18.00 's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before .
 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer

 Nice looking shoe . Was n't the shade of `` cognac '' that I would have preferred -LRB- expected something a tad lighter in color -RRB- . Took a chance in ordering a half size larger because that 's all was avail ; and it was being offered at a rather inexpensive price . Comfortable initially - plenty of cushion . However , after two wears , heels started to slip while walking and toes started to slide forward . Shoe is also a bit heavy . If I had to do it all over again , I 'd attempt to get this shoe in my true size , which I imagine would be very snug initially , and attempt to break them in after three to four wears . Overall , I 'd give this shoe 2 1/2 stars out of five .

 This boot is very flashy and definetly a show stopper . The boot is very big around the calve area and the chains started to fall off after the second wear .
 Do n't waste your time . The construction seems traditional , but the boot is extremely poor quality in terms of craftsmanship and materials . When I unpacked them they were attracting lint particles in a way I 've never seen and the odor coming from the boot was n't a leather smell , but a rather unpleasant rubber smell ... like a really old tire , or something treated with chemicals . The so-called leather sure did n't feel like leather and I was too disgusted to even try them on . I 've owned more than several pairs of Engineer boots over the last 30 years and these are the worst I 've ever seen , although by today 's low , low standards with everything made in China I 'm sure you could do worse than these boots from Carolina . Just ordered the Chippewa steel toe Engineer and its eligible for free return if they are bad , but somehow I get the feeling the Chippewa 's will be better than this . This Carolina boot is the first item I 've ever returned and the first 1 star review I 've ever submitted .

 This shoe looks quite different and nice but it 's quality left a lot to be desire . I had only worn the shoe a few times and the shoe tear at the side where the upper part meets the sole . I did n't do anything to stress or test the strength of the material and yet i noticed the tear which is almost 2 inches . I had to stop wearing the shoe and because the material is thin , i did n't even think of getting it repaired . Very disappointed .

 While the shoes are indeed easy to walk on and they fit well with my wide feet . They do rub on the inner side of my arch and in a short walk will cause blisters on them . Ca n't wear them without socks which defeats the purpose of clogs ...

 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .

 I bought these shoes a year ago , in two different colors . They were very comfortable and they ... looked ... HOT . The only problem was that the leather upper quickly stretched out , on both pair , allowing my feet to slide forward and over the end of the shoe by an inch ! That does n't look good , I can tell you . I 'm not sure if I bought a 1/2 size smaller that it would have even made a difference.Overall , it was wasted money because I can not wear either pair now .

 The band on these shoes is too wide for the stated size , not a little bit , but close to two sizes too wide . Consequently , the shoes give the wearer a very unstable feeling . I would have never bought these shoes no matter what the price had I been able to try them on before buying . Dr. Scholl 's people do n't seem to realize that having padded soles on shoes does not make them comfortable if your feet can not hang on to them while walking .
 The straps were too loose all across the instep . I should have believed a caveat from a former purchaser .
 This shoe fit excellent in the length . But the leather across the foot was so large I had to have it taken in at my shoe repair , about $ 30 . And they took it in too much so every time I wear the shoe I have to soak it with leather stretch to get my foot in and then they are okay for the day . However , it 's good leather that usually snaps back , and it 's winter now so I 've only worn them once or twice . Maybe next year the stretch will settle in ? This was the unfortunate case w / all 3 Dr. Scholl thong sandals I purchased . GREAT prices on sale . Fit did not work for me at all .

 Most uncomfortable boot ever . Soles have no cushion deff not made for standing any length of time . inside finish is very hard at seam locations and VERY uncomfortable even when worn as loose as can get . I hope they -LRB- break in -RRB- some and are tolerable otherwise these will go in the trash . JUNK JUNK JUNK
 i bought 2 pairs of these . both were defective , and were purchased a year apart from one another . customer service was a major disappointment . they are from a company that is local to me , and when i offered to drive to their location to work out my exchange that they promised , yet never delivered on , they told me they could not help me at a store since amazon works with their catalog department , which by the way is also local to me yet not available to help me . thumbs WAY down : - -LRB-

 I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out . . however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off . . very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
 I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer `` Scout '' pair which I already own and love . I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic . I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However , after receiving them , they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout . They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money . The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper , padded sole , and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic ! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather . The sole is not padded and sinks in . The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone
 The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width . they were way too tight . I gave them to a friend .
 I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago . The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small . I sent them back and got a refund .
 i like the shoes but there verry hard to walk in , if you want sore feet & your back hurting then get them but i would not buy these shoes ever again . there just not comfy on my feet.Crystal
 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice . Yet , I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there , which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes , I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand . I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size . They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought . I was very disappointed to say the least . And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you .
 Let me just say that I can often wear an 8.5 Medium in most shoes ... but I often look for a wide and usually find them even more comfortable . Depends on the shoe.I have a BROWN pair of these Eastland shoes in 8.5 Medium that I bought some years ago . I do n't wear them often so they are still new-looking ... and they fit me perfect . I could stand or walk all day in them . The problem is I do n't wear brown shoes very much and tend to prefer black.So I wanted a pair in black and it 's easier to find wide shoes online these days so I ordered the black in wide . Not only were they smaller than the brown 8.5 Medium I already own ... I could barely get them on !! This sizing is so off it 's ridiculous . Many of the more recent reviewers have the same complaints . I guess they are sizing them differently of late ... and not for the better.I will also say that I ordered some other `` wide '' styles from the Eastland site and had to send them ALL back ... they were impossibly narrow . And it was costly to send them back ! I decided I was done with Eastland for online ordering since their sizing is no longer trustworthy.If you have a SUPER NARROW foot ... MAYBE they will fit you . Maybe not . But I will say this is a high quality street shoe that is excellent for standing long periods or walking ... but until they correct the sizing issue ... I am taking my business elsewhere .

 I was glad to have finally found the right pair of boots , but it did n't last long . Not even 3 weeks after I bought it , it already has deteriorated . Given that I live in Seattle , rain seeped in really easily and the sole pads started breaking . It was like wearing melted cardboard .

 Returned these Boots . They claim to be Extra Wide , but they are not . Extremely disappointed with this product . Does anybody really carry Extra Wide Boots . For the record Extra Wide = 4E
 This is a good quality boot . However , it does not look like the online photo . The boot is actually much darker and the visible portion of the sole has a greenish stripe on it . Everybody asks me if I just finished cutting the lawn when I wear these boots . Very disappointed with the look and therefore do n't wear them much .

 I tried on a size 12 in the Super Runner 's Shop in NYC which felt like I was walking on a soft marshmellow cloud but the size was a tad tight . Searched various runners stores in NYC for a twelve and a half to no avail and ended up ordering on line , size twelve and a half . They are n't the same and although the fit is good , they 're way too hard.I gave them to my stepson and ended up with a pair of Brooks instead
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 This shoe was so cheap and it does n't run true to size . Save your money and click past this . This shoe started coming apart within 6 weeks .
 These shoes are the narrowest shoes I have ever bought ! Half of my foot hangs out from the side of the shoe . These shoes were very expensive and I would have thought they would have been made better . I was wrong ! I wear a size 9 , but I bought a size 10 and they still did not fit . Since I received the free shipping discount and I have to return them , I will now have to pay for the original shipping costs and the return shipping costs . Such a waste of time and money ! If you do not have a narrow foot I would highly recommend not buying these shoes .

 I actually found this shoe -LRB- but pink -RRB- in the January edition of Life & Style . Went to every Macy 's within a 50 mile radius of me , no one had it . Contacted Carlos Shoes and they said it would be ready in March ... it 's September and they STILL do n't have it . I finally found it here on Amazon -LRB- Do n't understand how amazon has it , and Carlos does n't , but whatever -RRB- and got so excited I ordered it right away . I was severly dissapointed . First , the shoe looks not quite as stunning as it does in the picture . The material appears to be a a matte colored leather , but the actual shoe itself looks to be like a cheap fake leather -LRB- although it is real leather -RRB- also it has a blue irridescent tinge that definitely is n't obviuos in the picture . Overall the shoes do NOT look like a fine quality crafted shoe . Definitely NOT worth $ 100 . I 'll spend a $ 100 dollars on shoes that look like it is worth it . These do n't fit that requierment . They look cheap and fake . Plus I could see glue spots wheer the leather is glued to the sole . Finally , it runs big . I wear a size ten and when I tried it on , I had about 3/4 '' of space between my heel and the heel of the shoe . I compared it sole to sole to about 4 other pairs of size 10 shoes like these that I own and these were a good inch longer than all my others so if your going to order these , make sure to order about a size smaller than you regularly wear .
 I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes . I 'm on my feet all day so it 's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe . According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width . When I received them I immediately triedthem on . I had to double check if I ordered the right size .

 I bought a pair of Women 's Plainview less than a year ago . I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months , so that the upper part is still very new and nice .

I do n't expect shoes to last forever , but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line . This brand does not meet that minimum requirement .
 I ordered this shoe and they were worn during one softball tournament . The toe tore completely out , the rivets in the bottom of the toe wore down . Do n't waste your money on these cleats .
 I need black confortable shoes to work . I am a waitress and I have to walk non-stop , sometimes for 12 hours . I used to wear Reebok Princess Sneakers but with new uniforms , I needed something more dressy , so I bought all the &#34; comfortable shoes &#34; I could find here at Amazon . I was looking for a mary-jane look with a sneaker feel . - Ambulator By Aetrex Women 's B6000 Mary Jane , Black - I could n't even try it because it runs a number and a half small -LRB- at least -RRB- . My size is 9 or 9,1 / 2 . I bought 9M , 9wide and 9 1/2 wide . All too small . Go at least a number up . Another problem is that the insole is too high . My toes and the top of my feet were so &#34; squished &#34; against the top of the shoe that I could n't even give it a quick walk . It looks adorable , - Propet Women 's W3851 Wash & Wear Slip-On - The back is too high so it cuts/rubs on your leg when you walk . Overall uncomfortable . A lot of pressure on your feet overall , sides and top . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 W for me -RRB- - Propet Women 's W0029 Mary Jane Walker - Good support all around , long strap on top , good looking but not enough cushion to walk for 12 hours . fits true to size -LRB- 9 1/2 for me -RRB- . As they did not have it in wide , it makes too much pressure on the front of the foot , just before the toes . - Drew Shoe Women 's Rose Mary Jane , Black Calf/Black Stretch , - Too high where the strap comes out , it hurts as soon as you put it on . It looks so comfortable is the worst offender . Runs true to size -LRB- 9 , 1/2 W -RRB- - Clarks Women 's Wave.Cruise Mary Jane Flat , Black ,9.5 W US - It feels like it is missing half of the sole ! It feels like just the outer part of the sole is on , and the other half is missing , making your foot lean towards the inside . Crazy ! It feels like I am gon na fall down , very hard to keep your balance . Almost like ice skates . Runs BIG , go a size smaller.The winner ? So far I found Eurostep Jenna Black -LRB- $ 59.99 at my local store -RRB- to be the best one . Mary Jane style . I 've used it for 4 nights now and one 12 hour shift .

 I ordered these in my usual size 8 1/2 N . They were too long , they fit more like a size 9 , so they had to go back .
 I have had this shoe for a year now . Like it very much for the quality of craftmanship and leather ... but it is not comfortable to wear.Not like the usual Ecco comfort.Your foot really starts feeling squeezed from sides after about an hour of wearing , not immediately . And this sensation progresses into the time.Very wierd and uncomfortable feeling.I ca n't say I have a very wide foot , and besides , I do n't feel my foot is squeezed until about 40-45 mins of wearing.Something must have gone wrong with this particular model.But , I guess , for a person with a very narrow foot , it 's gon na make a nice shoe!Not for me , though ...
 I 've been attempting to wear these shoes for 11 months now to no avail . They are much , much narrower than advertised and start feeling uncomfortable after approximately one hour of wear . I have even tried taking them to a shoe store to have them stretched , unsuccessfully . I have written to Ecco for advice regarding this unwearable shoe to which I was basically told `` too bad '' . I can not believe I spent $ 100 dollars for shoes that I can not wear . I will never buy shoes from Ecco again . Worst . Shoe . -LRB- And company . -RRB- Ever . If there was a ranking of less than one star , this poorly made shoe would definitely qualify .

 This is a really cute shoe but if you want to wear it , order at a least a full size larger . This shoe is so stiff and tight , it will make your toes become numb . I have ordered many shoes online 7.5 medium , this is the first pair that do n't fit and have to be returned .
 I 've worn Hush Puppies soft style shoew for years and they used to be so comfortable right from the first day . However , I recently had to replace an old pair that I simply wore out . The new shoes are not nearly as soft , flexible , or comfortable as the old ones . The left shoe will not stay on my foot . Hush Puppies say I can pay to send both shoes in for product inspection , but if they do n't find anything wrong with it they will send them back , probably again at my expense . I will NOT buy Hush Puppies shoes anymore .

 It look good on the webside , but when i got it was not what it look like.The price was good so i will take as it is .
 These were a good buy and look awsome . But can not wear during a regular work shift . I had to take them off at my desk . Sexy looking but painful . As long as you do not have to wear them for very long , you 'll be fine .
 Received this shoe for my husband as a Christmas Gift via Shoebuy . We needed to return the shoe due to sizing issues . The shoe is well made but the vendor , ShoeBuy is horrible . We have tried 4 times to get in touch with them , no answer . We have n't even heard from Amazon . Stay away from ShoeBuy . I probably will not shop with Amazon again . Very disappointed .
 I purchased the women 's easton western boot in three colors , camel , brown and black , and the camel boot is the only one that does not bleed dye from the boot , onto my leg and into the pants I am wearing . It is unfortunate as the boot fits well and is attractive .
 The design is very beautiful , but wearing the shoes is quite another . For one , it 's difficult to just slip them on without pantyhose . Even then , the fold in the front pressures top of feet b/c of the narrow space ; the back fold produces an uncomfortable pressure into the back of feet . Lovely design but not made for human feet -LRB- perhaps due to non-leather/stiff materials used to make it -RRB- .
 These shoes were too small and looked like it has been used . The soles were supposed to be black , but they were gray . Somehow , I tried these at the store and the size was fine . However the ones Amazon sent did n't fit . Overall , I was very unhappy with this purchase ; therefore , I returned it for a full refund .
 This one does look cute , but is not comfortable to walk at all.I went for a half smaller size than usual but still have problems when walk a lot.I suggest trying on before purchasing online for this kind of wedges with ties .
 WOOD HEEL IS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER 5 MINUTES . TO NARROW AND STRAPS BURN TOP OF FOOT . NEVER WEAR THEM ONLY AROUND MY HOUSE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO .
 All I hear is * squish squish squish * as I walk in these shoes . Wish I 'd spent a bit more for something nicer .
 the shoes look tatally different than picture . look so cheap . also I bought another pair of shoes from this company but that shoes also horrorbly ugley . so I ended up spent $ 20dollars !!!!! for shipping and returen cost . -LRB- refund was very late -RRB- I never going to business with this company again !!!
 This is a review of the Softspot Supremes Marathon 122401 women 's shoes . I bought my first pair in 2000 in preparation for a trip to Asia . I affectionately call them my doofus shoes for their complete lack of style , but with a thick , firm , cushioned sole and good toe room , they are perfect for walking all day . And I did a lot of walking in these shoes , including a European walking tour and then one through New England as well as hundreds of daily wearings . In May 2009 , with another trip with lots of walking planned , I was still wearing them , but the heels had worn down , so I bought another pair . The first pair lasted 9 years with only the sole showing wear , the second pair lasted 2.5 years . The right sole is cracked , there are holes in both insoles , and the extent of heel wear is similar to the older shoe . I wondered why the second pair - which cost the same as the first pair - did n't hold up as well , so I compared them . I ca n't detect a difference in the leather upper or the sole , but yet the 2009 sole is cracked . The insole of the 2009 show is thinner than the 2000 shoe and is made of a different material that did n't hold up as well . The 2009 pair were made in China , according to the box . I do n't know where they were made in 2000 . Maybe you are supposed to be satisfied with shoes that last 2.5 years , but be warned , these are not the same Marathons they used to make .
 My son is eight and has been wearing Sperry shoes for years . This shoe looks very nice however it runs small and narrow . The first pair I bought was a 1 1/2 M and was so narrow my son could not get his foot in the shoe ; the second pair I ordered in wide and they are still too small . He has a new pair of topsiders in the same size and they fit great . After sending back two pair I am not sure if I will order again , especially since I have to pay to return them and it is not possible to make an exchange .
 Cute shoe unfortunately it runs small and narrow . I had to return it . I can not recommend this shoe . Amazon also charges an additional $ 5.00 for return .
 I guess I 'm just used to buying Pedipeds and Umi shoes , but I was really surprised at how extremely stiff the soles of these shoes are . It sounds from the reviews like they might break in okay , but for a little more , I can get shoes that do n't require breaking in . I 'm returning .

 The concept is great ; a heeled shoe with cushioning . The cushion is comfortable but he back of the shoe dug into my heel creating horrible blisters . I guess I could have broke it in at the expense of my feet but decided to return them .
 The shoe is beautiful and it is made with an excelent quality , but the size is extremely narrow . I have never needed a wide shoe but I might have it in this one . I can not even wear it because it is so tight that hurts . It is a shame . Unfortunately I am out of USA so the returning fee will cost me more than the shoe did .
 This is a beautiful shoe and well made . Unfortunately it 's also way too narrow even if broken in ... They kill me just to try them on . I 'm a true 8 and have never needed a wider shoe . What a shame . I really would have enjoyed these .
 This shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide . They run small . They look nicer in the picture than they actually are .
 This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order . I ordered a size 9 , but was n't able to wear them . I gave them to my little brother who 's a size 7 , they fit him perfectly .

 I consistently wear a 9.5 M. Not so for these shoes ! They are so narrow , my feet were squishing out the sides . Not comfortable at all . Otherwise , they seem to be of good quality leather and are well made . Too bad I ca n't wear them ...
 I wish I would have listened to the other reviews . This does run small . However , it is so cute . I really love the look but ca n't wear them on a long day .
 These shoes hurt my feet . I ca n't even wear them . The sole on the inside has a black leather design running through the center that is raised and gives you a nice blister on the bottom of your foot . I have very narrow feet and this show rubs and pinches . This is my first Clarks purchase and I will never make that mistake again !

 I ordered a WW but the shoe was still too tight on the instep . It 's a beautiful shoe and the color was perfect for my needs . Unfortunately , it was too uncomfortable and I returned it .
 Tried to return . neither Amazon or the manufacturer provided me with return instructions . I now have a pair of shoes that I like the look of but are too small for my feet . I wear a 10.5 so I ordered an 11 and the 11s are way too small . Since I ca n't return , I 'll give them away . I am always pleased with ordering from Amazon but not this time . I 'm very disappointed with this shopping experience .

 PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
 Soon after I bought a pair , . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins .
 I was sent the wrong size and Amazon refused to exchange them ; said it was my fault . I know what size shoe I wear !!!! So , now I have shoes that I can not wear . Amazon suggested that I sell them ! That is ridiculous ! Oh and I could n't return them either because they were late in arriving to me and by the time I knew they were wrong , my 30 days were expired . Amazon could not be bothered .
 the number does n't fit like all the shoes with the same number , it 's too small .
 Although well constructed , they are smaller than a normal size 5 and they are a bit tight on the toes . Surprising for me as I do n't have particularly wide feet . Would n't buy again .
 The structure was not substantial . I put my very skinny foot into the shoe and the shoe 's sides gaped open . I sent then right back !

 I 'm a big Ecco fan , and have been buying their shoes exclusively for work for the past few years . This was the first pair to disappoint.First , the color of the leather as received is much duller and browner than the somewhat orange sheen that shows in the pic.Second , they lack the signature comfort of previous pairs of Eccos I have enjoyed , although that may be due to the fact it 's a loafer and not my more typical Helsinki or Seattle slip-ons . The stitching is also more pronounced than the photo shows and than is typical for a loafer , making them look more casual than you 'd expect.Finally , the latex sole at the front is already starting to show the first signs of separation of the shoe . So this pair do not appear to be nearly as durable as other Eccos.Sorry to be a party-pooper amidst these other glowing reviews , but this is my honest opinion , and in this case I think you get what you pay for , i.e. a cheaper Ecco offering is in fact cheaper .

 when i first saw it i was disappointed , leather was wrinkled , and nicked in spots , but when i tryed it on i was really disappointed , was not as comfortable as i thought it should be . will not buy this brand again .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .

 It 's hard to come up with a review bad enough for these horrible shoes.They are so badly designed , fitted and manufactured that I can not get into them while wearing socks , and only with difficulty without socks . The shoddy , inadequate elastic at the sides begins to tear out at the first wearing . The indicated sizes are nearly a full size too small . Still , even when ordering them a size larger so they 'll fit , they 're nearly impossible to get on because of the way the tops are designed.When items are closed out at long discount , there 's usually a good reason . In this case , it 's that the product is utter trash .
 I just received this shoes and wear it for a day . This shoes looks great , so does the material . The only problem is the opening design . The elastic and opening height make it difficult to wear and take off , and it also makes you hurt if you have wider ankles . The size is a bit small , so if your foot is wide , take 0.5 size bigger than usual.I bought it for $ 15.99 , including shipping cost . I do n't want to spend more changing for a bigger size , so I just cut the elastic part off . It works ! Now it 's easier to put on/take off , and feels more comfortable while wearing it.Fashion looking , great deal , but a so-so shoes . If you confront the same issue I had , try to cut off the elastic part .
 Stupid design of the shoes make it hard to get the foot in , yet after you get the foot in , the openning is too large to hold the foot secure . So when you walk fast the loosen part of the shoe scrach the back of my foot . The shoe is too hot for the summer and too cold for the winter time , not water resistent since it has the strench material at the side . No sure the purpose of this shoe . I pay $ 16 for it but I still think I did get a good deal.For people who has hard time to put the shoes on , try to enter the shoe side way , from the side that has the strench material , it should make it easier .
 These shoes probably ca n't be sold in a physical store because people ca n't put them on . Even the mass discounters wo n't take em . So I bought them on-line , thinking of the great Teva quality and design . I am disappointed . I have the correct size , and once I got my foot in , they fit and were comfortable . But it took 2 people more than 15 minutes just for me to put these on ! Even with a shoe horn , it 's very difficult to put them on . I 'm telling myself that the material will become more pliable after I wear it a few weeks . Basically there 's no shoelace . You have to sqeeze your foot through the top of the shoe . It does have some elastic , but that 's inadequate . WEAR THESE IN A REAL STORE FIRST BEFORE BUYING .
 Teva misleads customers with sale items then cancel orders . Probably just collecting your data with the ol' bait-and-switch . Do n't support them .
 These shoes looked good , but part of the decorative metal button pokes through to the foot . Even without this issue , these shoes are n't comfortable .

 This product is supposed to be extra wide -LRB- 6E -RRB- but it did n't even come close . The toe is almost pointed . Not for anyone with wide feet at the ball and toes .

 I wanted a comfortable pair of flats to wear to work , as I have to walk a few blocks . To date , I have only wore this once , as they are too big for me , and the heels of the show rubbed against my heel , causing me to bleed . Even if I would have gotten a size and a half smaller , i think it would have hurt me . I think the style is really cute and all , but get a heel guard if you purchase these shoes . -LRB- and a size and half smaller -RRB- .

 Although this shoe is really lacking in the comfort area , I gave it 2 stars for price as I purchased it for just under $ 25 . I 'll be sure to wear them when much walking is n't required .
 these shoe is not the same that i have before , this dont have cushion , its hard on the foot , compared to the one i got couple of years ago , i still have it , and even untill now after so many years of using it , is still comfy compared to this one ! this sucks ! im thinking of returning this .
 Pretty shoe but the sizes are misleading . When they say 8.5 Wide what they mean is 8.0 Narrow .

 This shoes are el cheapo , to be sure . But , the retail price of 60 bux is completely misleading . To begin , these shoes are constructed poorly . Personally , I wanted a pair of kicks that functioned as sneakers , but had some quirkiness to them so that I could wear them with just about anything . These are not shoes that will replace the comfort of sneakers proper . First off , the leather -LRB- beige or red -RRB- is not reinforced on the interior of the shoe . So basically it 's a single layer of leather without cushioning . As a result , your white socks will turn either beige or red depending on which color you order . Second , the laces are inserted through this cheapo plastic protrusion -LRB- white in color -RRB- that looks like -LRB- and feels like -RRB- it was made from an empty gallon milk container . The only thing decent about this shoe is the rubber sole . But this is not enough to make this shoe function as a legitimate sneaker with comfort . If you really like the style , or if you can appreciate the diadora phenomenon in the late 80 's and want to relive it , then these shoes are probably good for you . The price is certainly decent . But , I suggest going for a pair of old school Saucony Jazz or Asics Tigers which actually do function as good sneakers unlike these Diadora shoes . The old school Adidas are OK , but their prices tend to be inflated for no reason except popularity , which is precisely what we are trying to avoid by buying these types of shoes right ?

 Even though these shoes have the same model number and design I 'm used to , the leather material and feel are n't the same . Too bad ... I guess I 'll have to look for a new shoe .

 For a cheap made shoe , it is really expensive , but i purchased it anyways for a good cause . Unfortanately , I can not return these -LRB- plus I feel terrible if i do because if I return them , will a child get to give up their free pair from my purchase ?? -RRB- . I was so excited to get them for my trip to NY since I hear everyone tell me `` bring good shoes '' . I thought this would be good . Apparently not ! The shoes are really super cute , but they fit so tight and I am tiny size 6.5-7 !! The shoes are made out of canvas and they do not stretch either !! this is a bust and i wish i would have known to order a size above . The company should give a warning or a heads up on their marketing on how they are made-too small !!

 This is a very poorly constructed shoe . The bottom of the shoe is pealing off in three places within 2 weeks of owning the shoe .

 These fell apart with a few months . The stitching on the rubber on the toe came apart . Merrell is going down hill on quality
 I bought the boots because I spend a lot of time in the woods . After about six months of use and an especially soggy day one of the swivels broke out of the leather.Overall the boot did not preform to merrill standards . What good is a tough sole and breathability if you ca n't keep the thing on because the eyelets for the laces have fallen out ?

 Not typical W&D quality . The design looked like it had been badly hand-painted . I have a similar bag that is very well done .

 They 're not very confortable . Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in . Probably wouldnt order them again . Was n't impress with their shipping practice either .

 Only wore these boots 4 or 5 times and when I returned home the other day it felt like something had stuck to the bottom ; instead , there was a square inch rip in the rubber sole at the ball of the foot . I thought these boots would be a lot more durable .
 I wore these 2 times & one of the heels started peeling from the rest of it . A lady complimented them but noted that the same thing happened to her . This company was nice enough to refund me my money when I let them know what happened .

 You need to order 1-2 sizes smaller than your normal size , these things are massive boats . It does n't matter if you have other Puma shoes in size X , go size X-1 here . Pretty mad that I wasted $ 40 on shoes I ca n't wear now , but that 's what happens when you buy Amazon .
 This one is quite wide on the sides so my toes slide outside the peep hole of the shoe -LRB- I hate when that happens -RRB- . And the shoes look better in the picture . They are very comfortable though .

 I purchased these Teva 's for Kayaking . These are the most uncomfortable sandals I have ever worn . They are even painful while sitting in a boat . I do not recommend them !
 my foot kept sliding to the front and I would have to really tighten the ankle strap to prevent that .
 Uncomfortable - blisters after a week wearing them in ... Got tired of the pain and poor look of my feet due to their poor quality . The leather is patent -LRB- not genuine -RRB- and they make an unpleasant sound/squeak at each step when your feet get a bit warmer or sweatier -LRB- normal during summer -RRB- . Although heel is tiny , I feel unstable ...

 I ordered a size 12 Wide as that is the size that fits best in my other Stacy Adams shoes . But I had to return these because there was no way I was getting my foot in these shoes . Where the tongue goes down and forms the top of the shoe is extremely tight and narrow and I could not get my foot in it . Had to return them for a refund .

 These shoes certainly are beautiful , but they are n't very comfortable , at least not for me . When I first tried them on , even though the egg crate foot bed was cushy but my foot just felt smothered and like it could n't breath . The shoes felt a bit too crowded , and yet the heel was sliding off every time I took a step . I hoped it would go away but it just got worse . By the end of the day my feet were sweating -LRB- and thats very unusual for me -RRB- the outer sides of my feet both hurt significantly , enough that I knew I would have to return them . I had ordered an 8.5 wide size because I had a sneaking suspicion that they would feel narrower than most shoes , from all the cushioning . And I do have feet that are slightly wider than most . -LRB- this was the first pair of Wide shoes I 've ever ordered - I wear normal shoes all the time without any discomfort -RRB- I bought the open backed soft walk shoes instead and they are much more comfortable no pain at all .

 These shoes are so pretty but I did n't have them on more than 1 second and before I even took one step in them , they HURT ! The leather is soooo stiff if feels like knives cutting into the feet . I took them off so fast it could have made your head spin ! What a shame , I just loved the style and the color is a beautiful , true dark chocolate brown . Darn it !
 THE SHOES WERE NOT COMFORTABLE AND VERY CHEAPLY MADE . WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER PAIR .
 The Shoes look good and are comfortable . But they squeak ... alot ! I sell manufactured houses , and squeaky floors are a deal breaker . It 's embarassing to explain to customers that it 's my shoes and not the floor that are squeaking . I bought both a pair of brown and black and have worn them once each and will most likely never wear them again because of the squeaking . For me , a big waste of money . Sorry
 I read reviews saying these were great walker shoes , but all I got were blisters on the ankles where it rubbed . I walked around for two days and I do n't wear them anymore because of the rubbing on the ankles . Look at the top part and you 'll see what I mean .
 After wearing these shoes for only an hour or two , I began to smell something `` funky . '' Turns out it was the shoes . This has n't ever happened to me with any other shoes , so I 'm pretty sure it was the shoes and not my feet . I have n't worn them since . In the meantime , I 'm going shopping for some sort of product I can spray into the shoes to keep them from smelling .
 My FIRST pair of these lasted about 8 months , and the sole on the left boot cracked and developed a huge hole ! I felt really bad because I LOVE THESE BOOTS!They are SO COMFORTABLE ! I could not think of not wearing these , so I bought another pair ... thinking the first one was a fluke ! HA ! My second pair developed a horrible squeaking sound in the left boot , so I only wore them on dog walks and shopping in noisy places ! After about 9 months , it quit squeaking , so I began wearing them daily . Well , it has been a little over a year , and I noticed the sole of my left boot looked odd , so I checked it out yesterday and - HOLY COW ! - the surface of the rubber is off , it has worn really bad , and there are cracks ! Even in the other boot sole - there are small cracks ! Come on PROPET , how can this happen?I have a pair of County walkers -LRB- now discontinued -RRB- which I have worn for 2 years , and another pair of regular village walkers over a year old now , which are also fine.So what is wrong with these soles ? Why ca n't PROPET get it right ? I wrote them and were blown off by them after my first pair fell apart . They just said there is nothing they can do ... I guess this means they do n't know why it happens and do n't care!No , I am NOT hard on my shoes ! I work at an office and I walk my dog , and I shop - that 's about it . I wear Red Wing work boots for my chores!So be advised - buy at your own risk ! I do n't know why Propet ca n't fix this - I only know I am frustrated and upset ! These are the most comfortable shoes you can get and yet the price is a yearly replacement ! I may go back to my more predicable shoes with soles that do n't give out before they wear out !
 These boots literally rubbed me the wrong way -LRB- right at the ankle bone -RRB- so I returned them . They ` re not for me .

 This shoes are el cheapo , to be sure . But , the retail price of 60 bux is completely misleading . To begin , these shoes are constructed poorly . Personally , I wanted a pair of kicks that functioned as sneakers , but had some quirkiness to them so that I could wear them with just about anything . These are not shoes that will replace the comfort of sneakers proper . First off , the leather -LRB- beige or red -RRB- is not reinforced on the interior of the shoe . So basically it 's a single layer of leather without cushioning . As a result , your white socks will turn either beige or red depending on which color you order . Second , the laces are inserted through this cheapo plastic protrusion -LRB- white in color -RRB- that looks like -LRB- and feels like -RRB- it was made from an empty gallon milk container . The only thing decent about this shoe is the rubber sole . But this is not enough to make this shoe function as a legitimate sneaker with comfort . If you really like the style , or if you can appreciate the diadora phenomenon in the late 80 's and want to relive it , then these shoes are probably good for you . The price is certainly decent .

 The product description misled me to buy this thing . I have a very high regard to the Florsheim brand , but I am very disappointed with this one . A typical made in China quality without passing through Florsheim 's quality control . The leather is hard . Comfortable as describe in the product description ? How could it be comfortable when the leather and the inner soles are so hard ? I really want my money back or maybe some discounted refund on this order since it would be so bothersome and expensive already to ship back the items . I ca n't wear them . I just have to give them away .
 This is the worst pair of shoes I ever bought . They are too stiff at the upper portion of toes . Even after a month of wearing they still hurt me . I have no option but throw them out . An international return is quite expensive .

 Only wore these boots 4 or 5 times and when I returned home the other day it felt like something had stuck to the bottom ; instead , there was a square inch rip in the rubber sole at the ball of the foot . I thought these boots would be a lot more durable .

 I would rate these a lot higher if I could wear them . I used to wear Stans all the time , when a pair would wear out , I would go to the store and pick up another pair , size 11 1/2 . I did n't have to try them on , just buy them and go . Beware of doing that with these . I got 11 1/2 and they run narrow , the length is ok , but they are narrow , and squeeze my feet . I could wear them , and they might break in , and stretch , but I would bet they would also blow out in short order where the upper connects to the sole.I have tried to contact the sell Midwest Sports , to get the issue resolved , but the email came back , and when I contacted the website , it did n't get answered . This is a buyer beware situation . The look good , but I do n't want to look good and feel terrible . I would not buy these online , go to an old brick and mortar store , and try them on .
 I suppose that it 's inevitable , but I was hoping that the shoes would be the same as I remembered as a kid . They are not . To say the quality is inferior is being kind . The sizes run small as well -LRB- about a half size -RRB- and A * com will charge you shipping to return it .
 I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths . Just a bland old no name shoe .
 When I ordered the shoes , I thought there would be a screen to change to shoe size or else let me cancel the order . It did not , so I had to return them and have not yet received my refund

 I work for a DOE contractor that supplies all our duty gear and they just went to these boots . The first problem is that the do n't hold boot polish , it flakes of . Whether a brush on or spit shin , after a day it all flakes off . I 've spent more time putting an awesome spit shin on and they flake ... drives me nuts . The BIGGEST problem with these boots is I 'm constantly pulling the zipper back up . Sometimes I 'm walking around and the boot flops right off . I 'm back to wearing a pair of Danners .

 Not comfortable , your toes get pushed to the front and dug into by the criss cross straps . They look kind of cheap once they 're actually on your feet , I was pretty dissapointed but I got them at a really good price so I 'll make the best of it .

 This product did n't fit my foot , and the material was too plastic . It was not comfortable . I have medium-wide width feet , and usually Women 's size 9 fits . Not this time . I returned these shoes and got a Men 's Adidas slide sandal .
 Wow , We have bought many pairs of slides over the years , but this pair must have been a second -LRB- not mentioned -RRB- the white stripes started wearing off after one use -LRB- B-ball camp -RRB- & the side seam ripped out @ sole . Poor quality !
 I wear addidas sandals and when I ordered this pair it was too small . Also , I ordered the all white pair , and the white was not all white . It almost looked like it was eggshell colored . I was n't happy with this order and returned them for a full refund .

 It is really really hard to pull on and take off them . NOT comfortable while 10-minite-above walk .
 I was very excited to get these boots , they looked to be excellent quality and a great value . I ordered them in plenty of time to take them on our planned weekend away . They did not arrive , instead I recieved some sort of excercise ball in what was suppose to be the boots . I immediately contacted AMAZON because at that point I only had 3 days before my trip . I asked them to please send the boots immediately because of the mistake . They instead said that I had to contact FOGDOG directly . I did and FOGDOG said sorry , we can only send you the boots if you order , pay for them again and pay for the express shipping . Then return the excercise ball and get refunded for the original purchase . I had to go out and buy the boots at a local store . I am still waiting for the refund of the excercise ball and it has been 3 weeks.After many great purchases from Amazon over the years I am now saidly disappointed . This will change my Amazon purchase plans in the future .
 After wearing these boots for just one day , my calves are left scarred because the inside lining is too rough for my skin even though I had on a pair of long socks that were soft .
 These shoes are really very stylish . I ca n't say enough about how great they look ! Then I tried them on and I changed my mind about rating them any higher than 2 stars . I purchased a size 6 1/2 , but after trying them on , they feel more like a 6 Narrow . They are not true to size and narrow . I sent them back to the seller for a refund . On the bright side , I did purchase another pair -LRB- size 7 -RRB- because the quality was exceptional . I hope the new shipment will turn out better .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 These shoes are far heavier than other steel toed shoes I have worn . If you are not on your feet all day , and want something that looks a bit more business-like , then they may be a good choice . But otherwise , I would suggest something lighter .

 I was really disappointed that these shoes did n't fit . The size marked as US 10.5 M are more than likely a men 's size 8.5 , maybe ? I 've worn the same shoe size for many years and these are not a size US 10.5 . I could n't even get my toe inside . This makes me wonder if any shoes ordered online will fit properly .
 I ordered the 15W , assuming it would fit the foot of the person intended . In actuality , the shoe was 5 sizes too small ! Lucky for me , another person in the family could wear the shoe , as my message to Virtual Exchanges was not responded to . Buyer beware ! Proceed with caution !

 Laces up awkward , poor traction on the fore foot area , and just a big `` still gangsta '' shout out to all his thugs back home . You should be ashamed Kevin .

 I ordered this item two weeks ago . I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5 . Went through the hassle of getting a refund , repackaging and shipping the item . Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size . However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5 . This is ridiculous . Please beware , do n't waste your time .
 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I ordered the standard Black shoes , but instead received the Black Monochrome ones which were n't even listed as being available in my size .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans

 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 Had to return these ... . I do n't have an unusually wide foot , but these ran very narrow and did n't fit right . Surprising for Rockports ...
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .
 It is really really hard to pull on and take off them . NOT comfortable while 10-minite-above walk .

 I really do like the Naturalizer Mae Loafers and would like to get my hands on a few more pairs ... but this seller sold me the totally wrong shoe ... some really big zebra-like high heel . Not sure what happened to the shoe I ordered . I immediately returned the product .

 the shipping time was great , but they sent me low tops instead of high tops . they said if i send them back they 'll send me the right ones but i should n't have to , they should 've got it right the first time .
 I know chucks have weird sizing , and so a women 's 8 is a men 's 6 and so forth , but the size chart given here is idiotic . There are literally about 50 different sizes listed in the item details , with M -LRB- D -RRB- and all sorts of other inscrutable nomenclature next to each size . Maybe this reseller should take a hint from the converse website which has SIZE/CONVERSE SIZE -LRB- women 's 8/converse 6 -RRB- so the customer can have a chance of ordering the right size .
 I do n't know . They look weird , the sole 's soooo different from my other converse !!! Buuu
 I was pretty disappointed with the store when I opened the shoe box and found two right shoes in different shades of blue . It took some time but they did refund me for the purchase and told me to throw the shoes away because they `` did n't know anyone that could use two right shoes '' .
 I ordered the ` dazzling blue ' low tops because I fell in love with the color . Not to mention , they were VERY fairly priced . They came in a day early . Which , I was extremely pleased about . But , they managed to send me a size 10 in mens . I ordered a size 6 mens/8 womens . So , they are not one , not two , BUT FOUR SIZES TOO BIG . I loved the color , and the price , and the shipping time . I was extremely disappointed in the size . Four sizes is a bit ridiculous . One or two is n't as bad . For such a horrible mistake , they are NOT getting 3 stars .
 The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered . I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box , they were completely black . There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones .
 Ordered for a Christmas gift and never received it . I do not recommend this seller . Never responded to any of my emails until after I asked for my money back .
 nike bought converse . they raised the price and lowered the quality . ive been wearing chucks for 25 plus years and can say with certainty that stitching has been removed and rubber/glue cheapened . these new chinese made nike chucks fall apart fast . they are no longer a long lasting shoe . but they still look cool .
 Grew up in Chucks and love the look -- the coolest one ever . Decided to try a pair again -LRB- am over 60 now -RRB- but found them painful -- like a slab of wood tied to my feet . What we need are geezer Chucks with cushioning ! Converse , are you listening ?
 I am , and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan . I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another , someone in my home owns a pair . My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas . The picture of the `` unbleached '' pair , looked white , so I purchased them . When the box arrived , I wrapped it and placed it under the tree . Can you imagine my disappointment -LRB- and most importantly , my son 's -RRB- , when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck 's ? DO NOT BUY This `` unbleached '' color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time , sizing was as issue , as well . Runs almost a whole size larger .
 I did not get what I wanted . They sent me different color . So , I returned it .
 I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years . They love the colors , light feeling , and comfort of these Converse shoes . They are also not `` ones for leather '' so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable . I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking !
 these shoes are classics and I ca n't fault the style . My son actually wore them for a wedding -LRB- with suit and all -RRB- , however , they run large -LRB- long -RRB- and had to be sent back . I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size . We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5 . It cost me $ 12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake . Always get free return shipping where you order . Just saying .
 if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
 Product never showed up . Also , never got a reply from the seller when e-mailing them . No problem getting a full refund from Amazon however .
 I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA . The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough . I do n't know if it is inflation or what , but why are these shoes 50 bucks ? The whole reason they were great back in the day , was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable .
 By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck-less . Perks
 Image shows Purple HI TOPS , but when you order ... you get LO tops . Also , items that say ` qualifies for super saver shipping ! ' they 're not . So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops ... do n't fall for it !
 We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces . What we received was the all black shoes . That 's not the picture that went with the order we placed .
 i love the converse , but not the store , i have a big problem i made a mistake and they did n't help , now i have two pair of the same color , i and nobody size like me .
 My order was in wrong size because of amazon.com had wrong size convertion chart!A - Z guarantee does n`t help me . I ` m out of country ! They sad that I have to ship my order back , but as I sad I ` m out of country ! Who ` ll pay shipment , me ?! YES ! They sad I have to pay shipment if I ` m out of country ! No help , no order anymore !

 Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe , it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top , be sure in the cart .
 I purchased Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars because they were strong durable shoes . However , these shoes started to come apart less then three weeks after purchase . The eyelets tore loose from the canvass material , I was shocked and in disbelief . Never in years past do I remember any shoe coming apart in so little time . Maybe just this pair was manufactured incorrectly ? Now I have the joy of sending them back . I did hear from the company who sold them to me through Amazon although as yet they have not responded to my basic questions , not sure why the hesitation . I am sure we will get through this but in the mean while I am without footwear .
 Upon receiving the shoe , they look just like my other converse shoes . I expected them to be made in China . They looked real ... but upon very close inspection , I noticed that the white rubber toe part is rounder and bigger . The real converses ' are pointier and smaller . The material also feels cheaper . Another dead give away was the color . The navy blue in the converse stores I went into were a truly dark navy blue color . This one is more of a faded navy blue . There are tons of fake converse out there , some look almost like the real thing . I suppose you just really have to do your homework and probably not buy online unless from the actual converse website . Hey , maybe even the seller did n't know . Like I said , no one would be able to tell these are fakes by the looks of it , but I still give it a 2 becuase I paid the amount of what a real converse would cost and I think it is my duty to let other consumers know . I suppose these 'll fall apart within a year .

 I am a big guy , these boots last me about 4 months and then the rubber on the base of the sole tends to rot out / erode to the point where they split.I really liked these at first but the leather is cheap , and is not fully stained , I have scuffed them mildly and then have had to try to fill in the scuffs with shoe polish .
 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 Problem with this shoe is that they do n't carry my size 8.5 double E . So why is that I am having a problem finding my size . Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department . To me there is no excuse of not carring my size .

 I wear US size 14 on Nike.I made the mistake of buying 2 pairs of size 14 Propet Country Walker recently - these shoes fit terribly . They `` bit '' into the back of my feet , and I had to get them stretched by the cobbler.While the quality is quite good , the sizing of the Country Walker is wrong . If you would like to purchase the Country Walker , please select one size larger . So , if you 're a size 14 like me , buy a 15 .

 Well made shoe , but way too heavy for a mule . Do n't know how anyone could keep them on and walk even with the strap used behind your heel . They do n't bend easily .
 I own a pair of Frye boots and love them so I thought the harness mule would be a good choice . They may very well be a good choice , but not for me . They are fairly heavy and too narrow - not the same fit as my boots . I had them stretched a bit so that improved them but not enough for me to wear them comfortably for any length of time .
 FRYE Women 's Belted Harness Mulei got this mule and it was rather heavy and clobby when i walked . I ordered the tan color . I am sorry , this was about the ugliest shoe i have ever bought . My foot kept on sliding back over the little leather heel when i walked and it was very uncomfortable . Sent back , of course .

 They arrived missing some of the little glimmers ... I have not even worn them yet and they continue to fall off . Pretty shoes , but if the glimmers keep falling off they do n't exactly live up to their name ...

 I wrote a bad review on the shoes and the seller of the shoes . I bought three pairs of the same style . I have other shoes , from this shoe maker and love the shoes I have . The three pairs I bought were cheaply made and very stiff leather . They were tight , heavy and uncomfortable . When I requested to return the shoes , the seller told me that I had to pay shipping.However , I contact the seller and explained the situation and the seller promptly sent me return labels .
 I ordered these and another pair of Life Strides in a 10W , based on a review by someone saying they were wonderful . If you have a wide foot like mine , they were way to tight for my everyday comfort across my toes .
 The soles wore out entirely in 2-3 months . I do not recommend buying these is you use them for work .
 I thought I had ordered The Alpha8 not the Fort Hood . These are NOT slip resistant Alpha 8 . What a waste , its great boot , but no good to me if i have no traction .
 I returned them . Too stiff and hard , and the leather seemed cheap . Sized a little small too , compared to boots that I own and wear .
 Prior to ordering I called Rocky and asked them where these boots were manufactured . I was told &#34; Puerto Rico - USA &#34; . When the boots arrived , the tag inside states Made in China . I would not have ordered these boots if I had been told they were made in China -LRB- perhaps that 's why they tell people otherwise ?? -RRB-
 If you have any kind of foot issues I do not recommend you buy this boot . They are not very flexible and do not offer alot of support without added arch supports . They are good looking boots and would be great for someone without foot issues .
 I ordered this item for my husband . Even though I ordered his correct size it was about 2 full sizes too big . I chose not to exchange them because I had to pay a fee in addition to the return shipping . I just shipped them back and will buy them someplace else .
 What a damned rip-off . Price is absurd . The materials clearly do n't warrant that much . At $ 10 they would still be making 80 % profit .

 Was looking for quality/durable leather boot laces and these unfortunately were not up to par . Snapped the first time I tried to put my boots on
 I have owned several pairs of the AO Sahara . This pair is much , much lighter in color than past purchases . I am not sure why it is not even close in color to others I have owned and those seen in stores .
 I have been using Sperry Top-siders for about 40 years , always size 9.5 . These shoes arrived , marking inside said 9.5 , but there was no chance they would fit . Too small ... return . Replaced them with a pair of Timberline shoes from Amazon size 9.5 , they arrived yesterday , them fit fine .
 I 've been wearing Sperry Top-Siders in 12 wide since the early 1980s , and for well over a decade in the color Sahara.Though I specified Sahara , and what arrived was labeled Sahara , these appear to be shipped mislabeled and are actually Oatmeal -LRB- from what I can tell by comparing to online colors -RRB- . They say Sahara on the box but are not.Worse still , though they say 12 wide , my last pair was roomy in width and just right in length . This pair is tight in length and tight in width , but worse still , the left one is MUCH tighter than the right , and though I tried breaking them in for two days to see if they would stretch , this only resulted in pain and my left foot swelling up.Are they making these in China now ? That would explain so much.These are not the Sperry Top-Siders we have all worn for decades . Something is seriously wrong when a company is suddenly shipping out mislabeled products -LRB- the wrong color shoes in a box labeled as being a different color , and that most likely are also mis-labeled in size at the factory before being boxed . That 's two major errors ? I will never buy these shoes online again with these kinds of quality control issues , and will instead give Sebago boat shoes a try , ending a 30 year run with Sperry .
 I was extremely unhappy even at first when I received the shoes and saw that the insole only extended to the mid point of the shoe . It reduced support and made the inside feel rough and not very comfortable . I wore them for a time over the summer and the sole on both has split in the mid point of the front . I had owned Topsiders from Sperry before and they lasted for years , dealing with salt water from my sailing and other activities.It will be a long time before I can be convinced to buy a Sperry product again . They have obviously totally taken quality out of the equation .
 Got shoes within 2 days the whole insole cracked . It 's like there extremely old and dry rotted . Will never buy sperrys through amazon again .
 The Sperry Top-Sider in Amaretto was a far darker color than the photo on Amazon . I did not try them on , and instead , returned it hassle-free and that went well . I chose a brown/brown replacement as it looked like my next best choice , but the size seems to run small . It 's an uncomfortable fit -LRB- I decided to tough it out and not do a second return -RRB- . My feet are not hard to fit as I have bought several pairs of shoes from other manufacturers on Amazon in this same size and they fit perfectly .
 The Sperry shoes are fine , but be careful in that what Amazon shows -LRB- a reddish brown leather with white sole -RRB- is not the shoe that is actually sent as that one is a tan shoe with a brown sole . Got these for my son 's birthday and was disappointed that what I thought we ordered was n't what we actually got . Went back and double checked to make sure I did n't just select the wrong pair , and now see that the small thumbnail image does n't match the original product page .
 These shoes are very uncomfortable . I was extremely disappointed with what I thought would become a favorite shoe of mine . If support is what you need in footwear , search elsewhere .
 Disappointing is the word I 'd use to describe this purchase . I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old . They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft . Also , there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them . I 've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I 'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I 've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem .
 The shoe I received must have been a second or a knockoff . Quality was not that of sperry . Very disappointing . Could not return it as my son left for college the next day and needed them .
 Ordered the Wide width expecting to shoe to be at least a bit wider than an average shoe . In fact , the shoe was so narrow through the ball of the foot , felt like my foot was being squeezed . Returning this shoe immediately . Also , did n't care for the brassy gold color of the shoe lace grommets ! Very disappointed !!
 The wrong size shoes were in the correct box , box said size 11 which is what I ordered but the shoes inside are a size 13 and the seller has not got back in touch with me . Not very happy here and I paid alot of money for them .
 This shoes are not worth the price or the quality.Ive used them probably 5 months now and they seem to be breaking apart ... the shoelaces especially are most likely made out of chalk or something.Ive ordered other boat shoes from amazong without any problems at all and get complimented all the time!This just dont match up , Get another one . .
 A pair of shoes arrived that did n't meet my color expectations -LRB- shoes were suede not brown leather -RRB- . I requested a return from the vendor and have been ignored to this point .
 Purchased shoes in late May 2010 . Did not wear them until mid 2011 . Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear . Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop -LRB- tm -RRB- . Did not work . Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair . I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart . The leather usually cracks after repeated wet and dry cycles -LRB- over many years -RRB- . In other words normal wear . The latest pair very prematurely failed . Shipped them back to Sperry -LRB- at my expense -RRB- for evaluation . I do n't expect much .

 This boot came in and it was not at all what I pictured . The shoe runs big and the calf of the boot was tighter than it should be . They do not stay up and constantly slide down . I returned them .
 I agree with the other reviews , they run big . I should have bought 1/2 size smaller . I had to buy some insoles to walk comfortably but even so it feels loose . I like the style but I need to have a shoe that makes me feel safe when I walk .
 I have not yet received this product , the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month . And when I attempt to track I get no where , no one is available to answer my concerns ... . so right now I do n't know how I feel about this product ! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for .
 Recieved two right boots . My son was never able to wear these booots since I did n't have time to return them . I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair .
 I order this Idem
 I have always respected Timberland products . Not this time . This shoe came with nearly nothing inside for support or padding . There was very little to it but shell .
 The wrong size shoes were in the correct box , box said size 11 which is what I ordered but the shoes inside are a size 13 and the seller has not got back in touch with me . Not very happy here and I paid alot of money for them .

 I have never bought any other shoe then Stride Rite for my two boys and have never had a problem with any of there shoes until this one , my son complained non stop that his feet hurt and when he took off his socks he ad several blisters , save your money and do not buy these shoes .
 My grandson saw these on TV and HAD to have them . So , I went to Amazon and ordered them . They arrived promptly and fit fine . However all the jumping high into the air , great fun ... nope regular sneakers . Now he is so disappointed he wo n't wear them . Sigh
 So I love the way these shoes look , I 'm a huge Fluevog fan and have a few other pairs . I wear these ONCE and the buckle BREAKS OFF from the shoe -LRB- I 'm already dressed , walking from car to hotel . . so that sucked -RRB- Anyway , from reading other reviews it seems amazon is not so great with damaged returns , so I took them to shoe repair guy who took a week to fix em and that cost me an extra 12 bucks ! I mean I would n't mind if I wore them to death but the FIRST TIME ?? Well , they 're still fierce but as you know with some of his shoes a killer on the ball of your foot.Whatever .
 The soles wore out entirely in 2-3 months . I do not recommend buying these is you use them for work .
 I thought I had ordered The Alpha8 not the Fort Hood . These are NOT slip resistant Alpha 8 . What a waste , its great boot , but no good to me if i have no traction .
 I returned them . Too stiff and hard , and the leather seemed cheap . Sized a little small too , compared to boots that I own and wear .
 Prior to ordering I called Rocky and asked them where these boots were manufactured . I was told &#34; Puerto Rico - USA &#34; . When the boots arrived , the tag inside states Made in China . I would not have ordered these boots if I had been told they were made in China -LRB- perhaps that 's why they tell people otherwise ?? -RRB-
 If you have any kind of foot issues I do not recommend you buy this boot . They are not very flexible and do not offer alot of support without added arch supports . They are good looking boots and would be great for someone without foot issues .
 The soles wore out entirely in 2-3 months . I do not recommend buying these is you use them for work .
 I thought I had ordered The Alpha8 not the Fort Hood . These are NOT slip resistant Alpha 8 . What a waste , its great boot , but no good to me if i have no traction .
 I returned them . Too stiff and hard , and the leather seemed cheap . Sized a little small too , compared to boots that I own and wear .

 I have worn Dan Post Boots for 30 years . This was my first internet purchase . While the boots look very attractive and fit very comfortably , the leather inside the boots has a foul odor that wo n't go away . I even let them sit on the back porch to no avail . So I have a brand new pair of boots that folks can smell from around the corner .
 These are not real naughty monkeys . I bought these and they were beyond cheaply made . If you really like these buy the ones that amazon has for 74.95 . $ 19.95 is a rip off !
 The Softwalk Women 's San Mateo Mule arrived quickly . However the shoes squeaked quite loudly . Upon contacting the manufacturer , I was told the squeak could be easily removed by a shoe repair shop . Unfortunately , the shoe repair shop disagreed . As the company did not have another in my size at the reduced price , I was forced to return the shoes at my own expense . I am not happy about having to pay shipping for a defective product and will not order from this company again .
 I 'm sure the boots are fine , but do n't buy from PapaShoe . They do n't ship the item and you will get the runaround when you contact them . I purchase alot of items from Amazon and have never had this much problem with one of their retailers . They should not be allowed to sell at Amazon.com .
 I had a set just like this . The glue that holds the sole/heel on failed . The 1 year warr is worthless . Rockey will not email you back or call you back . I wore my boots a total of 6 times over 10 months . Junk . Made in china junk . Save your hard earned money and get another brand .

 I really wanted to make the Rocket Dog shoes work . They 're stylin and eco-friendly -LRB- the white hemp version is -RRB- . Problem is Rocket Dog does n't realize guys wo n't wear shoes that do n't fit.I 'm normally a size 11-12 , so I ordered one of each . Did n't fit . Returned and ordered a 10.5 . Did n't fit because the shoes still slipped quite a bit when walking . I could tell they would end up giving me blisters on my heel if I did any serious walking . Returned and ordered a 10 . This time they were too small and compressed my toes.Whoever is in charge of sizing @ Rocket Dog should be fired . I 've never been so frustrated with fitting shoes . If you really want these , find them in a store somewhere and try them on . DO N'T ORDER THEM ONLINE or you 'll be spending lots of money on return shipping .
 they looked ok in the picture . but on the feet they felt simply awful . i just tossed them .

 The product looks great but it is a lot more smaller than expected.I currently use size 9 for several other pairs of golf shoes from different brands.I bought these in size 9,5 thinking they would fit , but THEY DO N'T !!!
 I wrote a bad review on the shoes and the seller of the shoes . I bought three pairs of the same style . I have other shoes , from this shoe maker and love the shoes I have . The three pairs I bought were cheaply made and very stiff leather . They were tight , heavy and uncomfortable . When I requested to return the shoes , the seller told me that I had to pay shipping.However , I contact the seller and explained the situation and the seller promptly sent me return labels .
 Pros
 This might be a great boot but it runs at least a size + small . I ordered this boot in size 12 EE before a hunt in New Zealand and I 'm glad I ordered 2 different pairs because when this one came I could n't even get my foot into it . The other pair was also a Danner boot and it fit perfectly true to size . Maybe something to watch out for with the Danner move to `` made in China `` Cheers
 The shoe runs a little narrow , so if you need a wide , order up a 1/2 size .
 These could have been good shoes but they fall off when you walk . Not because they are too big , but the heel is to loose . I wear a 10.5 and that 's what I got . They fit comfortably but am falling out of them when I walk . Glad they where cheap , if I where not so horribly lazy would have tried to return them .
 I ordered size 10 and I could n't get my feet into them . I would suggest that if you have swelled or just large feet that you order a higher size . Because there is no elastic , the top of the shoes just does n't have any give at all . The shoes were long enough for me but just could n't wear them . My feet are n't all that big either .
 These were a comfortable shoe for the first month or so . Then I started noticing a weird popping sound accompanied by a mild snapping sensation in the sole . Could n't see any sign of trouble at first . During the second month of ownership , the popping got worse and cracks started developing . At the end of 2 months , they were unwearable . You can flex the soles and see a spider web of cracks that literally go thru to the insole . I live in Colorado and wore them in the first couple of months of spring . Did n't wear them in the mountains on sharp rocks . No 130 degree asphalt . I 'm not obese . I just wore them on the weekends and some evenings for working around the house . No reason for the soles to go to pieces like this other than it 's just a very bad rubber formulation . These are complete junk . You 're better off spending more money on some Merrell mocs . I just ordered a pair for $ 66 here on Amazon . They 're more than double the cost but at least I know they 'll last at least a couple of years versus a couple of months .
 I think the shoe is fairly comfortable , but a little too clunky and heavy around the sole area ! Eccos are better !
 Loved the look of the shoes and great service , but shoe just didnt fit my foot . Not much cushion in the heel for me .

 Honestly I would never buy Tribeca again , it 's the dollar store version of Kenneth Cole . It was cheap and stiff if you decide to buy some buy a 1/2 size larger . They are all synthetic which is why I was so dissapointed . I bought from another sight which stated they were patent leather . This says they are Patent -LRB- in one paragraph -RRB- but they are `` FAUX '' patent leather . I guess Tribeca is not a leather goods company , `` high fashion at cheaper prices '' but they go faux . None for me thanks !!
 I espected a quality shoe , But the edges where bad looking over all Not worthed . Sorry !!!
 This shoe is probably the most poorly made shoe I have ever purchased . The first time I wore them out to the movies and when I came home I noticed one of the jewels on the toe was missing . I had bought them to wear to a wedding so I sent them back and got another pair . I should have known that if they did n't hold up going to the movies , they were definitely not going to hold up dancing at a wedding . At the end of the night , 75 % of the jewels were missing from the toe . I do not reccommend this product .
 I never received this item . When I contacted Macys about never receiving it they asked me if I still wanted the item and said they would reship it . Then they never re-shipped but issued a refund for the item instead but did not refund me the shipping which was $ 8.95 ! I am still trying to get my shipping refunded to me . I was extremely disappointed with this purchase !
 Ordered these for my daughter . She normally wears 7 1/2 - 8 Medium width . I ordered 8M for her . When she got these they were smaller than any of her 7 1/2 sandles and MUCH narrower . Totally unusable . Marking on the back was US 8 . NOT ! Also the quality , look , and feel was on par with the $ 3.99 stuff you see in Walmart , et al. . Not worth the trouble of returning . Amazon ... I trusted you and you let me down !!! Amazon should screen their suppliers better , are they trying to grow too fast ??? Reef - you need to watch your quality better - do n't lose your image just trying to make your quartlerly numbers . BTW - the label said `` made in Indonesia '' .
 I bought these flip flops to wear at the health club pool . It appeared from the picture that the straps were stiff so I could slip them off and on easily . They are n't . The ` thong ' straps are fabric and they flop so that you have to use your fingers to situate the straps on your foot . Be fine if I was wearing them all day , but I 'm putting them on and taking them off and it 's annoying , especially when your feet are wet .
 I have worn only these flip flops for years and loved them . I ordered some recently only to find that the rubber they use for the sole is now made of a much cheaper material . It used to be dense rubber with some weight to it . The arches were what i loved the most and the durablity . The new material is lightweight and doesnt hold up well . The arches arent as good because the rubber is so soft . I wore them around the pool and they got a bit wet and I left them in the sun . When I returned the sole was acutally curled . I am so disappointed . I can only hope that they go back to using the old material or I will need to find another brand to replace them with .
 The big toe divider on these flip-flops were much too long for my small feet and I could n't keep them on my feet . I returned them . I also did n't like the curved sole -- which made walking harder .
 The product is great ; but I got sent the wrong color . It was listed as black/blue and turned out to be black/purple and shiny silver . Someone must be color blind .
 I have purchased speedo flip flops many times , these are awful . They are like what you buy in the dollar store , no arch support and a sole that catches and folds up under your toe . I do n't believe these are really speedo 's . Do n't buy .
 I wear 8.5 to size 9 . 9 's were an entire size too small . They do n't issue exchanges , by the time I would return them I 'd lose half of what I 'd paid in shipping costs , deducted and what I 'd have to pay to return . They feel pretty flimsy also !
 The comfort of reef sandals are great -- i have owned several pairs but the metallic colors are plain ugly . oxy-moronic styling in a beach flip-flop . Amazon 's color selection is very limited -- these metallic colors and all black are the only choice . Reef has lots of additional colors -- would be great to see them offered on amazon .
 The pair I ordered was defective and I had to return them . The strap was placed to far back on the shoe bed , so it did n't fit the contour of my foot correctly . I 've since purchased this shoe elsewhere and I 'm very happy with it .
 I just received these reef sandals in the mail and was totally disappointed . First all they do not resemble any of the other reef sandals I have purchased , in look or quality . They look and feel cheap . Secondly , this is not a great price for them -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- , this is the sticker cost , I have since found out .
 I love keens . I have 3 pair of sandals , a pair of boots and these `` flip flop '' type sandals . I 've had two of my regular sandals for over 2 years and they 're well worn . I loved these the moment I got them . They are cute and comfortable . But I 've had them for less than 4 months and they are falling apart . I have n't worn them any more or less than any other keen sandals , so I 'm not sure why they 're falling apart . I may have gotten unlucky , but I would n't buy them if they are n't on sale . Too expensive to only wear a few times for one summer .
 The shoe has many excellent features as I wrote in my review when I first purchased the boot . However , because the heel is aligned behind the foot rather than under the heel of the foot , the heel of the shoe splayed after only a couple of months of wear . I had to throw them away . It broke my heart for such an expensive item from a reputable company . They were broken and unfixable .
 I was really surprised on the how badly the boots were made . First just with the Clark name reputation I had assumed the boots were at least going to be comfortable . No cushioning that I could feel that could hardly last an entire work day . The heel felt like it could easily be pulled from the bottom . And last but most importantly , the look of the boot just looked cheap and I wore my pair twice , then instead of going through the hassle of shipping back and getting my money , I unfortunately gave them to the goodwill and some poor soul who has hardly any money may end up wasting their money on these awful boots . But I still like `` clark '' made shoes but I will be careful in what I order from their name brand from now on .
 The slide over the arch/toe section is an elastic material and is too tight . It made my toes look squished , not to mention how it made them feel . Might possibly work if you do not have a high arch . But also seemed cheap-looking and cheaply made to me for a Donal Pliner product .
 These boots are so cute but will KILL your toes . I can walk and stand in them for less than an hour . I would probably get a half size bigger .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 Worse quality than typical sebagos . 3 time of use I can see the leather in two places , so the black ink is not well fixed . Moreover , they are clearly less comfortable than other sebagos bought recently
 Even though I had ordered the same size previously , this one is too big . Furthermore , the rubber of the toe rubs off on my floor if I am not careful . I bought these because Rockport does n't seem to make Beckington anymore .
 I ordered 2 pairs of Sebago loafers - the `` Classic '' which fit perfectly , and the Sherman which did n't . I wear a EEE width and have a very limited range of products to select from so I was delighted when I got my first pair of these shoes -LRB- years ago -RRB- - great workmanship , comfortable rubber tread ... but this pair from the outset was too narrow -LRB- probably really a medium , not a EEE -RRB- . I 've worn them a 4 times hoping they 'd stretch out , but no luck . Now the `` return window is expired and I ` meFg 'd . These shoes used to be made in USA and always fit perfectly . I generally am a satisfied Amazon customer , and have only had one other complaint which was quickly rectified , but these Sebago Shermans are the WORST FITTING SHOES I EVER OWNED .
 after one half a day , the right shoes is totally out of usage . For the following reason , a default in the way to sew the shoe / / i 'll join a picture of the dammage.It 's totally unusual for such a sebago model . . maybe it 's a copy or something like that.It ` has never happened before . I 'm very disappointed . . Please let me know how to receive a refund or a new one . I stay in France and the cost of the return represent an higher cost than the good itself . other
 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!

 I had an identical pair of Florsheim wingtips for years and years and years . When the time finally came to retire them , I did n't hesitate ordering the same shoe in the same size.Sadly , they fall far short of what they used to be.They fit fine , wore in nicely , and then they just kept wearing down . After about a month of regular use -LRB- a work shoe that was in service any day that was n't a brown day -RRB- the deadly squeak began . I thought I had done something horribly wrong until I read the other reviews with a similar problem . Not a little squeak , mind you . A looong , grating , old-door-slowly-opening-in-a-horror-movie squeak . It was plainly embarrassing to wear them.And they just started looking like garbage . Creases are to be expected , but they multiplied and deepened and even started flaking a little with remarkable speed . The sole was already wearing down to the lining after only a few months . Even without the noise they were not long for this world.Which is too bad . After six months they looked worse than my previous pair had after six years . Eventually I sucked it up and shelled out for a pair of Allen Edmonds , and found the quality I missed.Sorry to see you go , Florsheim .
 I am really sorry I bought these shoes . They look pretty good but they are damn squeaky when walking across non carpet in the office . Embarrassing !
 Let me say that I have been buying Florsheim for about 15-20 years . I noticed when I got this pair that they were made in India . Soon after wearing them , they started to squeak . Imagine how stupid a man dressed in a suit looks walking down the hallway with squeaking shoes . If you want to be that man , go ahead and buy these crappy shoes as for me as for me , they lost a loyal customer as I will never buy Florsheim again !
 The shoe box ... inside the box ... contained only one shoe . It was actually very obvious that something was wrong by simply hold the box . Enough said !
 3 pair of Florsheim Imperials , 3 pair squeaky shoes ! $ 700 down the drain ! They still look as good as 40 years ago , but are now cheap Indian knock offs . Never again !
 When this pair arrived , they looked nice , as expected , but they had an annoying sole squeak on the first wearing , something that usually would n't appear until much later in the life of the shoe . A second pair had the same problem . Clearly , the quality of construction is no longer there . 20 years ago I could buy from Florsheim and expect a few years of wear with care , but now the shoes need repaired before they can be worn the first time -LRB- if you do n't want an embarrassing squeak . Do n't go cheap , and do n't be fooled by what was once a name of quality for the masses .
 Long time buyer of Florsheim shoes - not anymore . The heel fell off after half a dozen wearings . So I tried to glue it back on -LRB- I was out of town -RRB- - it fuzzed all up - it is pressed cardboard . For a $ % ^ & ing heel ? Rubber , leather , something - but pressed cardboard ? not cool .
 The shoe that came was not the shoe shown here . No stitching on the back of the shoe and the cut of leather is inferior . Very disappointed , I have worn Florsheim for a long time -- but never again !
 I had much hope for this pair , but I tried them and the leather quality is awful . While I like lightweight leather material , this one does n't cut it . The inside of the shoe create a crease from the get go , so I decided to return them . The quest for reasonably priced shoes continues ! I would n't recommend these shoes at all !
 Very stylish shoe . Very shiny . A bit narrower than I imagined , but I have a narrow foot so they fit great . They 're real stiff at first , so I now have blisters just under my outer ankle bone on both feet ; I walk about a mile a day though . I expect them to soften , form around my foot , and feel real nice in a couple weeks . If they do , I 'll move them up to 4 stars . . Update -LRB- 5/30/11 -RRB-
 I did n't notice it when looking at the online pictures , but these boots were the ugliest things I 've ever put on my feet , and I am no high-end shoe wearer . Honestly , they resembled those big fat moon-boot looking over-padded snow boots that anyone living in the North probably had as a kid . Thankfully , I had these shipped to work and within minutes of putting them on , I had received enough feedback to make shipping them back a no-brainer . Thank you to Amazon for allowing me to ship them back free of charge .
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes . Not a small hole but it went all the way across . And in both shoes . Not put together right . Very disappointed . To much money to fall apart !!!!!!!!
 I found these to be less than comfortable . The arch support is lacking and I had pain after wearing them for about an hour .
 This is the second pair of White Mountain Sandals I have purchased and my last ! While I love the look , style and comfort of the sandal , it does not hold up . I purchased these sandals specifically for a one week vacation . During this one week trip the bottom , inside of the shoe loosened and began bunching up under my foot . Once it loosens there is no way to keep the material flat under your foot again and it becomes very uncomfortable . The first pair I purchased also did this but I thought it was a fluke and I tried a second pair . Great price but poor quality !
 When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet . In this case it was not ` you get what you paid ' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are ` glorious ` they were also on sale for the bargain price of $ 5 !! . I had to go back and buy all the colors they had .
 These are not worth buying . They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be .
 The Sole of the shoe is coming off at the heel . Wrote to Keen and sent pics . And I will update this review depending on their response . I had them for about three months . I was hoping they would last for three years . Keen failed me !!!! I was such a believer . now i 'm crushed .
 The Nurse Mates were very nice looking and lightweight as described . But I felt they lacked arch support . I stand in one spot for eight hours a day and even after wearing these my feet and back ached at the end of the day . These just did n't cut it for me . : - -LRB-
 I have had my shoes for 2 weeks , I work in a school lunchroom and the white leather is already cracking and the white paint is coming off.If you have to do anything in water like mop these are not the shoes for you .
 I 've had these shoes for a little over a year . They were ok for about the first year . I used to work 10-12 hour days with no real issues with the shoes or pain in my heels/feet . Now I 'm working 8 hour days as a nurse and my heels/feet hurt when I get home . These shoes seem to lack the side support you can get with laced shoes . I am at a loss for what to do ... I like the protection of the slip on shoe , but I like the support of a laced shoe ...
 I always buy these same shoes for work . They are supposed to be bright white . The material on the shoes are discolored . It appeared that they might have been damaged some how , maybe buy extreme temperatures . I 'm not sure . But I 'm sure I will buy these shoes again . But I will not buy from this seller .
 I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it 's only October . The shoes were a real dissapointment . They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes . Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day , so I was expecting better from nurse mates .
 This company is a rip off and has bad customer service !!!!!! I bought some nurse mate Bryars a few weeks ago and when I got them I noticed a strong rubber smell , which I thought eventually would go away . After a few weeks , the smell was so strong that my co workers were noticing the smell . I was so embarrassed !! I tried the shoe powders and inserts but still nothing could make the smell go away . So I called nurse mates and they said the shoes were defective and that they would be happy to exchange them . Well I get a phone call stating that they found no smell and I could BUY new ones if I wanted to ! Are you kidding me !? Numerous amounts of people told me they smelled really bad and all of a sudden they do n't !? I was told they have a guarantee but apparently not . I will never be buying from nurse mates again , I 'm better off without the nasty smelly shoes !!!!
 I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough , but was please to slip these shoes on with ease when they first arrived . I was two hours into my shift when I looked down and saw the leather was already wearing off . I 'm not picky with appearances and since I have a hard time finding shoes wide enough I ignored the issue . I 've been wearing these shoes for two weeks now and my feet are still not used to them and I come home with sore feet and ankles .
 For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .
 The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month , they say I have to return the shoes not used well , the problem happen afther i wore them , so 56.00 down the drain . not buying from this seller again .
 Let me say that I have been buying Florsheim for about 15-20 years . I noticed when I got this pair that they were made in India . Soon after wearing them , they started to squeak . Imagine how stupid a man dressed in a suit looks walking down the hallway with squeaking shoes . If you want to be that man , go ahead and buy these crappy shoes as for me as for me , they lost a loyal customer as I will never buy Florsheim again !
 The shoe box ... inside the box ... contained only one shoe . It was actually very obvious that something was wrong by simply hold the box . Enough said !
 3 pair of Florsheim Imperials , 3 pair squeaky shoes ! $ 700 down the drain ! They still look as good as 40 years ago , but are now cheap Indian knock offs . Never again !
 I had an identical pair of Florsheim wingtips for years and years and years . When the time finally came to retire them , I did n't hesitate ordering the same shoe in the same size.Sadly , they fall far short of what they used to be.They fit fine , wore in nicely , and then they just kept wearing down . After about a month of regular use -LRB- a work shoe that was in service any day that was n't a brown day -RRB- the deadly squeak began . I thought I had done something horribly wrong until I read the other reviews with a similar problem . Not a little squeak , mind you . A looong , grating , old-door-slowly-opening-in-a-horror-movie squeak . It was plainly embarrassing to wear them.And they just started looking like garbage . Creases are to be expected , but they multiplied and deepened and even started flaking a little with remarkable speed . The sole was already wearing down to the lining after only a few months . Even without the noise they were not long for this world.Which is too bad . After six months they looked worse than my previous pair had after six years . Eventually I sucked it up and shelled out for a pair of Allen Edmonds , and found the quality I missed.Sorry to see you go , Florsheim .
 I am really sorry I bought these shoes . They look pretty good but they are damn squeaky when walking across non carpet in the office . Embarrassing !
 When this pair arrived , they looked nice , as expected , but they had an annoying sole squeak on the first wearing , something that usually would n't appear until much later in the life of the shoe . A second pair had the same problem . Clearly , the quality of construction is no longer there . 20 years ago I could buy from Florsheim and expect a few years of wear with care , but now the shoes need repaired before they can be worn the first time -LRB- if you do n't want an embarrassing squeak . Do n't go cheap , and do n't be fooled by what was once a name of quality for the masses .
 Long time buyer of Florsheim shoes - not anymore . The heel fell off after half a dozen wearings . So I tried to glue it back on -LRB- I was out of town -RRB- - it fuzzed all up - it is pressed cardboard . For a $ % ^ & ing heel ? Rubber , leather , something - but pressed cardboard ? not cool .
 The shoe that came was not the shoe shown here . No stitching on the back of the shoe and the cut of leather is inferior . Very disappointed , I have worn Florsheim for a long time -- but never again !
 I had much hope for this pair , but I tried them and the leather quality is awful . While I like lightweight leather material , this one does n't cut it . The inside of the shoe create a crease from the get go , so I decided to return them . The quest for reasonably priced shoes continues ! I would n't recommend these shoes at all !

 These are not the sandals that are pictured and they come in a size range not a specific size . Not a good purchase .
 The sandals were lovely but very heavy for a thong flipflop . Because they were so heavy , they rubbed at the top of my foot . Yikes and Owie !
 These arrived yesterday by the time I got home from work . I immediatley put them on and set off to walk the dog . Within 3 blocks the blisters started . Foolishly , I kept walking . Away from the house . Far away from the house . `` I can tough this out , '' I think to myself . Wrong . 45 minutes later I hobble back through the door , feet bleeding profusely , more determined than ever to break these little torture devices , er , flip flops - yes flip flops , in.My story , and quest has a bit of history . Years ago I bought a pair of flippers by this company but with thin nylon straps on sale for about $ 8 at some beachside store . I had never heard of the brand -LRB- and certainly would 've never paid $ 50 for flip flops had they been full price - little alone for something with a rainbow on it - how old do you think I am ? -RRB- . Suprisingly they quickly became my favorite shoe outside of work , until after about 3 years I eventually wore the soles to the ground . They were no longer shoes , more like toilet bowl protective covers . Enough was enough , I could no longer tote my little toilet bowl cover flippers around so they got left behind in some distant land where the chances that I be able to retrieve them from the trash were distinctly less possible.So this is what brings me here , trying to revive those three wonderful years with my trusty , hippie flip flops , only to be deterred from that happiness . I have a very narrow foot anyway , but the problem is that these straps are hella tight ! As that they are now worn -LRB- not to mention covered in my flesh and blood -RRB- I ca n't really send them back . It would just be rude . Luckily I 'm no deserter . My new plans involve copious amounts of moleskin , wearing them in the shower -LRB- most likely with lead socks -RRB- , and possibly leather softener to stretch the straps . I 'm definitely open to suggestions , but in the meantime I ca n't help but feel my life is slipping away as I think of ways to safely wear a pair of flip flops . That cost $ 50 .
 They do not last any longer than any other sandal . The company does not stand behind the product . It is all marketing . I would not buy again .
 If someone wants to order these Rainbow Sandals the sizing is all wrong - I have to send mine back now and looks like the sizing is off by two shoe sizes.Kim Garrett
 I bought these sandals as a birthday present for my daughter . After two weeks of normal wear , holes had worn into the bottom of both heals . My daughter has another pair of Rainbows that she had for over two years and held up very well . We purchased Rainbows because they are guaranteed . However , when we contacted Rainbow about the rapid wear they refused to honor the warranty . They pointed out that the warranty does cover wear through the top or bottom layers . When I pointed out that the wear occured over a period of just two weeks of normal wear , Rainbow responded that they had never seen this and my daughter must have been skateboarding or rock climbing . She did neither . Instead of honoring their warranty and doing the right thing , Rainbow all but called us liars and refused to stand behind their product . I will not be purchasing Rainbow products again.By the way , before my daughter received this pair of Rainbows , she was wearing a cheap pair -LRB- $ 4 -RRB- of Walmart flip flops . The Walmart product held up much better than the Rainbows.These Rainbow 's sandals were a big disappointment only to be surpassed by an even bigger disappointment in their poor customer service and refusal to stand behind their product .
 I bought a pair of rainbows , at 50 bucks , for the same reason that I 'm sure anyone does ; the `` lifetime '' guarantee . After two months of daily wear the bottom sole wore thru to the middle sole so I contacted Rainbow and this is the reply I received : `` I 'm sorry , but wear and tear on the sandals is not covered by the guarantee . The life of the sole or top sole depends on the wearer of the sandal . Some peoples sandals last longer than others.Personally , I can wear into the middle layer from the bottom sole in one month . It does not mean that the sandals are defective , it just means that I drag my feet a little . Unfortunately , there is nothing that we can do for wear and tear.Have a nice day.STEVE LANECUSTOMER SERVICE-end email-DO NOT BUY RAINBOWS ! for the guarantee . If you like leather flip-flops that cost twice as much as reefs and last a third of the time then these are the flops for you . Otherwise your money will be spent better elsewhere .
 I was not a savvy shopper when I bought these . The salesperson got me when she told me about the lifetime guarantee . Lies ! The guarantee covers manufacturing defects ONLY until the sole gets worn down . Basically , the `` lifetime '' guarantee for my rainbow sandals was one year , which is when the sole broke through to the `` soft colored insert '' - from rainbow website .
 i was not pleased with the product and when I decided to return them there was a restocking fee plus and $ 8.00 return fee which i think is unrealistic when ordering something from the internet which I had n't seen in person .
 While the Earth Lazer is a lite weight shoe and free of animal materials it has poor arch support . There is virtually no lateral arch support and there is no heel cup support . The negitive heel causes to much stretch for the foot and ankle . I would not recommend these shoes to anyone . I think the Birkenstock brand has a great deal more arch support for the entire foot and ankle and keeps the foot in a neutural position .
 I ordered 20 of these with one-click only to find out the shipping was more than the product -LRB- $ 88 -RRB- . Even though product had not been shipped , vendor refused to cancel order . Item received and returned , but vendor did not refund shipping charges . Would never buy from this vendor again .
 The back of this pouch sounded like a stiff waterproof jacket fabric and made noise everytime I moved . I had to exchange it for the all silk or fabric type . The 3 individual pockets and price were nice , too bad it was loud and stiff .
 The quality is poor . After one week of use , the string detatched from the bag . The flaps also did n't close securely at times . I felt it did not meet my expectation of a secure wallet around the neck for travel .
 The tips are way too long , giving an extra 2 inches to my shoe size . It looks and feels awkward and was quickly returned .
 This was my first online shoe purchase and I thought it would be a great buy since it had such good reviews . At $ 25 , the navy blue seemed like a good deal and looked like it would match well with a lot of my wardrobe . I was very disappointed , though , when the shoe turned out to be a much lighter blue than the picture - a bit darker than regular blue but much too bright to be considered navy blue . Also , the fit was very awkward , especially in the front toe area . It showed too much toe -LRB- not just toe cleavage - more like you can see two toe nails , which is n't attractive -RRB- and the outside of my foot below the pinky jutted out . The fit is also on the tighter side - I 'm usually a 7 or 7 1/2 , so I got the 7 and it was very tight ! Two stars instead of one because the leather was quite nice , but I 'm definitely sending them back . My advice
 I was very dissatisfied with this product . When the shoes arrived , they seemed to have been worn previously . In addition , the quality of the leather was poor and the sole of the shoes do not sit level on the ground . I thought this shoe looked like a really cute shoe at a good price online , but once I took it out of the box , I pretty much put it right back in -- and returned it .
 I 've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe . However , in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday -LRB- blue with red and silver -RRB- is synthetic . Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price , you receive a leather shoe ! You are not `` saving $ 50 '' if it 's synthetic .
 I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper , which is why I bought it . I see now that the description has been corrected , but too late for me.also , the sizing does not run true as the current description states . I usually wear 9.5 , but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes .
 I was under the impression that this was a mid level shoe . Higher than a low-cut shoe . The 1st day I used them I rubbed a blister on the back of my foot which I have to avoid doing due to my diabetes . I now can only use these shoes to go out in , not for walking that I was buying them for .
 after one half a day , the right shoes is totally out of usage . For the following reason , a default in the way to sew the shoe / / i 'll join a picture of the dammage.It 's totally unusual for such a sebago model . . maybe it 's a copy or something like that.It ` has never happened before . I 'm very disappointed . . Please let me know how to receive a refund or a new one . I stay in France and the cost of the return represent an higher cost than the good itself . other
 Worse quality than typical sebagos . 3 time of use I can see the leather in two places , so the black ink is not well fixed . Moreover , they are clearly less comfortable than other sebagos bought recently
 Even though I had ordered the same size previously , this one is too big . Furthermore , the rubber of the toe rubs off on my floor if I am not careful . I bought these because Rockport does n't seem to make Beckington anymore .
 I ordered 2 pairs of Sebago loafers - the `` Classic '' which fit perfectly , and the Sherman which did n't . I wear a EEE width and have a very limited range of products to select from so I was delighted when I got my first pair of these shoes -LRB- years ago -RRB- - great workmanship , comfortable rubber tread ... but this pair from the outset was too narrow -LRB- probably really a medium , not a EEE -RRB- . I 've worn them a 4 times hoping they 'd stretch out , but no luck . Now the `` return window is expired and I ` meFg 'd . These shoes used to be made in USA and always fit perfectly . I generally am a satisfied Amazon customer , and have only had one other complaint which was quickly rectified , but these Sebago Shermans are the WORST FITTING SHOES I EVER OWNED .
 I bought these boots for my little sister a definite size 8 . She was unable to get her foot into them due to the tight stiching at the base of the tongue . Great price , but we had to return them .
 Nice materials . Not much support in the footbed , sandal runs loose . I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I 've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible .
 This is the worst walking shoe I have ever owned , and I would not recommend it to anyone . My left toes -LRB- all but the big toe -RRB- go numb every time I wear the shoe . Yes , I have the correct size of shoe ; they 're not too small . My toes do n't feel cramped . It 's just that for whatever reason , my left toes are always going numb . My husband and brother-in-law both have this same shoe -LRB- in the men 's style obviously -RRB- , and they both have the same problem with their left toes going numb . My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk , not even walking . My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment , and his toes go numb while he 's doing that . I 've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood , and it happens every time . I am extremely frustrated because we 're all stuck with these stupid shoes , which were expensive , because they 've been worn a few times , and the store wo n't take them back now .
 Sorry , but these boots LEAK !!!! I went down to the danner store , &#34; NO HELP &#34; just asked me a lot of questions to NOT HELP , questions to disqualify me from customer service . The bottom line is these boots leak . Notice how they sell you a pair of $ 380.00 boots they call &#34; 100 % Waterproof &#34; yet they try to up-sell you on 20 $ waterproofing junk ? Yeah , Trust me , the boots leak just walking in wet grass for an hour and your socks will be soaked . This is a very big disappointment ! I actually own Three pairs of danner , one steel toe , one summer boot , the other two are not waterproof either , but they are my summer boots , these I bought specifically because I need to have dry / warm feet in the winter / fall / spring in OREGON , but NO ! After all the HYPE and LIES about % 100Waterproof , what a CON the boots LEAK ! I have owned these boots less than 6months , each time I go out I come back with wet feet . The thing about Danner is the boots leak . Just go to their website and read the customer service policy , its all about how they disqualify you from customer service ... They do n't want to help you once you 've bought their overpriced junk , they lie and say they are % 100 waterproof they leak bad . In these boots your feet will be wet & cold . I did everything I could do to take care of this problem , but if you tell them you put snowseal or anything on the boots ; they will say that was the problem , if you have a pair of leaky boots from them , they do n't help at all . All they want to do is get you to leave , yeah I bought their waterproofing gel and I used their leather products ... the boots were $ 380.00 and I spent another $ 40 in waterproofing products from them and THEY STILL LEAK !!!!! Top it off danner brags about being made in USA but really ? MOST Of the boots danner sells now are MADE IN CHINA ! What a scam , they act like their boots are the best in the World , but really they leak . I 'd have better luck with a $ 20 pair of rubber boots . NEVER BUY DANNER . NEVER .

 The quality of Propet shoes is not as good as I expect . The shoes are very heavy and stiff and they look clunky also .

 When I first opened the package , I noticed that they were , well , of cheap quality ... I put them on , and they were MUCH bigger than I expected ... The first pair of mukluks that I purchased - not from this company - were a medium ; so that is what size I ordered ... I am a 7.5 in women 's - these were huge on my feet . I was hoping that they would be of higher quality ...
 Comfy , but not made as well as I hoped . Socks are different sizes so I tend to trip over one of them . I ended up taking off the leather because the stiching came undone . Pattern is nice and they are warm but for the price I wish they were made better .
 I had bought the mukluks once before , and although I bought the same size and the same product . They were the wrong size , my daughter could not put them on , and one of the mukluks had a hole where the sole is . The first pair are still good , and she still wears them .
 I bought these for Christmas and wore them a handful of times before they unraveled near the top and a large hole formed .
 I ordered the slippers on December 27th and still have not received them . My Visa has been charged . I am not impressed . I emailed them two days ago and have not heard back . I expected better .
 Hi-I purchased the black color . At first these were great and comfy , but this past week all of the sudden I took them off and my legs were black from the excess dye on the inner shearling material . I also tried wiping some dust off of the surface of the suede with just a normal white towel and -LRB- I did n't even rub hard -RRB- as a result , the towel turned black . I am not sure what to do at this point , it is such a hassle to send the product back but I am unfortunately very dissatisfied at least with the black color I chose . Maybe the manufacturerer should perform colorfastness testing prior to releasing these items in the market . Is there a way to rectify this at this point ? Any recommendations would be very helpful . Thank you -
 There is no flexability in the sole what so ever . I ordered size 9 which is a half size larger than I ware . The boots were tight . I sent them back .
 If you just want the look of Uggs , these are a good idea but they are NOT COMFORTABLE , I should have been wary of other reviews and not purchased them - but they are not comfortable , I ca n't imagine possibly wearing these in a snow storm or even rain - THEY ARE HEAVY , they weight your feet down.I would have much rather have spent 100 + on actual Uggs - there is truly nothing worse than feeling like you totally wasted your money ! Actually not a total wate , my dog is enjoying ripping out the EXTREMELY CHEAP lining !
 I purchased these boots on sale and am disappointed . Even though I ordered a larger size based on what others said , my toes are cramped and my heel is too loose . The boots are very stiff in the toes as well . Hopefully that will change with time if I continue to wear them . I am , however , 100 % satisfied with the first and second pairs of Emu Ridge shearling boots I 've owned .
 BOOTS ARE NICE , BUT A LITTLE TIGHT , WHEN ORDERING THEM , YOU SHOULD GO UP A SIZE .
 I had seen this bag in Saks and loved it ... Well I came home and searched for it at a lower price ... Found it here and made my purchase . When it came it was nothing like the bag at Saks . . It was a dull black color and alot bulker than the one I had seen ... I did not like it al all ...

They do n't want to help you once you 've bought their overpriced junk , they lie and say they are % 100 waterproof they leak bad . In these boots your feet will be wet & cold . I did everything I could do to take care of this problem , but if you tell them you put snowseal or anything on the boots ; they will say that was the problem , if you have a pair of leaky boots from them , they do n't help at all . All they want to do is get you to leave , yeah I bought their waterproofing gel and I used their leather products ... the boots were $ 380.00 and I spent another $ 40 in waterproofing products from them and THEY STILL LEAK !!!!! Top it off danner brags about being made in USA but really ? MOST Of the boots danner sells now are MADE IN CHINA ! What a scam , they act like their boots are the best in the World , but really they leak . I 'd have better luck with a $ 20 pair of rubber boots . NEVER BUY DANNER . NEVER . I WISH I NEVER GAVE THEM A DIME !
 I have probably 50 pairs of shoes -LRB- or more -RRB- . They are ALL 9M . I ordered a 9M in these shoes -- much too small so I returned & ordered a 9 1/2 M . They were also too small but I kept them anyway , because I did not want to pay for shipping again . I was charged for shipping -- this should have been an even exchange . Not satisfied . I would have needed a 10M in this shoe . I have NEVER worn a 9 1/2 or 10 . These are definitely not sized properly . They were made in INDIA .
 These shoes work well , but are very uncomfortable . I would n't recommend them if you have to wear them for more than 15 or 20 minutes . I use them to practice with my daughter ; they work fine for that .
 these are the most uncomfortable boots I have ever owned . the tongue is so wide it wraps around your ankle and digs into your ankle bone . no way to fold it to keep it away . but they should never wear out . after an hour a day for six months trying to break them in they are still stiff and hard to wear . I would not recomend these to anyone .
 Sorry , but these boots LEAK !!!! I went down to the danner store , &#34; NO HELP &#34; just asked me a lot of questions to NOT HELP , questions to disqualify me from customer service . The bottom line is these boots leak . Notice how they sell you a pair of $ 380.00 boots they call &#34; 100 % Waterproof &#34; yet they try to up-sell you on 20 $ waterproofing junk ? Yeah , Trust me , the boots leak just walking in wet grass for an hour and your socks will be soaked . This is a very big disappointment ! I actually own Three pairs of danner , one steel toe , one summer boot , the other two are not waterproof either , but they are my summer boots , these I bought specifically because I need to have dry / warm feet in the winter / fall / spring in OREGON , but NO !

 I love Vaneli and I 've been wearing them for years . These are wonderfully comfortable and chic looking shoes . The style really makes an outfit pop!They are available either online or at Marmi Shoes . I loved these shoes the moment I laid eyes on them.However , this is the first time I have had a problem with any of their shoes . The colorful buttons applied to the shoes are glued on rather than stitched on like Vaneli 's of old.I wore them out to dinner and by the time I got home I had buttons missing from each shoe . Mind you I just sat and had cocktails and nibbles . I did n't move my feet other than to sit , stand , and walk to the little girls room.These wonderful Italian shoes are no longer produced in Italy , but China -- and it shows . I 've compared my older Vaneli 's -LRB- 73 pairs -RRB- to my new Vaneli 's and there is a significant difference.The sole is cheap leather rather than the thick durable leather found in their early versions . The sandal straps on the new Vaneli 's are sown under the liner rather than at the foundation . Making them easier to break.I 'm very disappointed . These were no sale item . I paid full retail .
 These shoes are very cute and are very high quality , however there is absolutely no padding on the shoe . Very uncomfortable when you walk . I returned them because I could n't imagine wearing them for a long period of time .
 I have been wearing Vaneli shoes for many years . . Own many pair . . purchased the Vaneli Bice Slide approx . 1 - 2 months ago and they are already pulling apart around the mesh binding . I have really enjoyed the shoes and was going to purchase in several colors . . but not now !!! Very Very Disappointed .

 I made a poor choice in buying this sandal , they are too slippery when on , the inside and the bottom of the sandal , no support what so ever . The only good thing about this sandal is the color GREAT color
 After reading other reviews I ordered a 1/2 size to big and they are still uncomfortably tight . I ca n't wear them even around the house without them bothering me . Money down the drain .
