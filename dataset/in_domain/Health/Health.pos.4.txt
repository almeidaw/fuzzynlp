 This is a great item ! Its kinda big for me but I still like it because it has different speeds of vibrations . It does not come with `` C '' Batteries . But otherwise a Fantastic Item !
 I first came across Lancome Hydra Intense in a free gift with purchase and immediately fell in love ! It does n't feel like a lotion , but leaves your face feeling moisturized and refreshed ! Better yet , I notice a visible difference in my skin !
 Oh , man , these tasty little bars -LRB- and they are little at just a titch over one ounce each -RRB- are splendid . They taste like a little tropical fruit bomb just went off in your mouth . They 're an odd texture if what you 're used to is the mealier bars -LRB- like those from Odwalla -RRB- or those super moist bars -LRB- Clif 's Bars -RRB- . These are drier , like a dense cake almost , but very flavorful -LRB- and not super sweet -RRB- . You 'd never know they 're gluten free ; the soy powder gives them enough texture for you to think you 're eating something that was made with regular flour . You 'll be able to taste the mango in these , but that flavor is not overwhelming . Neither is the coconut . It 's balanced nicely by the pineapple , and the raisins are n't overpowering.The strawberry version is delicious but a bit sweeter and moister than this one.At 140 calories each , these little bars can get you through a hunger attack without overdoing it .
 I love SoyJoy bars ! The Mango Coconut has a hint of the islands with the delightful mango and chewy coconut . It 's a `` just right '' snack for any time ! I sometimes find myself craving one of these yummy bars . They are perfect for just before or after the gym . I appreciate the fact that they are all natural and filled with real fruit and nuts and no artificial sweeteners . I love all the flavors ; Raisin almond , Berry , Apple , and Mango Coconut ! Great product ! I have recommended them to all my friends and family !
 Satisfying , healthy , convenient , not too sweet , nice chewy consistency , great flavor , good portion size , no high-fructose corn syrup or unnatural fats , WHOLE soybeans , real dried fruit , 4gm protein , wo n't melt - what is not to like ? I 've tried a lot of protein/snack bars . These are the best and have the most balanced nutrition . They are a perfect snack , at work or to keep in the car . All the flavors are wonderful . Check out their website for more info at soyjoy.com . Kudos to Amazon for selling them in bulk .
 These are great ! They taste fruity and nutty at the same time . I really like the texture as well - a little chewy but still soft . If you do n't like raisins though , do n't bother . My husband wo n't touch them - he tried one , but the raisin taste is pretty strong .
 This is by far my favorite flavor of the bunch ! Its got a baked cookie taste to it along with the fruity and nutty flavors . I will admit , the first bite had me thinking , '' ... hmmmm ? '' but by the second bite I was SOLD ! I would eat these even if they were n't healthy ; c -RRB-
 Oh my goodness , the taste of this brings me back to my childhood and the cake my grandma used to bake . This really echoes of mango cheesecake for some reason and even thought I have n't tried it in ten years the first bite teleported me back in time . Hers had candied orange peel in it and that hits similar notes with this bar . It 's actually small , like a thick square french fry but makes for a great snack in-between meals . The bar is breakable and not as dry as other reviewers stated , I found it to be perfect balance of taste and texture and the coconut was very subtle , a whisper compared to the golden ripe mango.This is a biscuit like type of bar , with fruit inside and I just love it , I ca n't wait to try the other flavors although this one completely stole my heart . I also love how each has 4 grams of soy protein but they are n't too filling , I would n't say this would replace a meal but it quiets the rumbling tummy for a little bit . - Kasia S.
 We enjoy these treats and they are LOW in sugar ... . BUT sweet enough to enjoy !!!
 I can not have gluten and this is the only snack bar that does not contain gluten , excellant taste and texture , something you do n't get with anything gluten free !!!
 I just received my sample of this product from the manufacturer -LRB- they were giving bars away on their website -RRB- . This is the perfect snacking bar , dense and full of dried fruit . I 'm not a big fan of the thick , chalky `` meal replacement '' bars that have 150-250 calories and leave you hungry again with a nasty aftertaste lingering in your mouth . These are a great , healthy way for me to snack at work and be satisfied yet still have an appetite for dinner when I get home.The nutritonal contents are n't too bad , either . 140 calories , 6g fat -LRB- no trans -RRB- , 16g carb , 3g fiber , 11g sugars . I can live with that .
 This flavor is by far the best of all the SoyJoy bars . It 's a great treat that 's also healthy !
 I think these are pretty good . I like the not-too-sweet flavor and the consistency is like soft-baked biscotti , which I ejoyed.I have had the raisin-almond , mango-coconut and the apple . I really like the mango-coconut , the apple is pretty good too -- but I DO NOT recommend the raisin-almond , it has a harsh aftertaste that the other 2 do not.It is nice to find a tasty snack bar that I can keep in my purse during the warm/hot months and not worry about a gooey mess .
 This is such a delicious treat ! I was introduced to them by my friend who did n't like them . I 'm so happy I tried them anyway . These bars have replaced my Snickers and Reese 's Candy addiction . The Mango Coconut is by far the best , but the others are really tasty as well ! It would benefit anyone who is reading this to try these bars .
 Even my 5 yrear old lovesssss them . He was sneeking them to school in his backpack.Mango coconut is my fav.What a great deal
 I have tons of toys and I always come back to this one ! I 've bought glass ones with similiar shapes and still have never found another that worked so well . The lumps and bumps on this one are in the EXACT right place - I can not help but cum with this bad boy !
 This brand I have not purchased from before . The dildo is well made ... soft & flexible & is a perfect fit . Take a chance on this `` sure thing '' ... it will not disappoint !
 Quite nice - very effective and fun , but a bit on the small side . A really nice way to start out your toy collection.I would suggest having a special bag for it , as the finish promotes lint sticking . No noticeable smell , except when brand new , out of package , and is very easy to clean .
 I like its unique , classy shape . Some may find it too narrow though , but I love the softness especially at the tip . No significant smell especially if used with a flavored lubricant
 I bought this item 3 years ago and I still love it to this day !!!! I promise you will be satisfied with this product !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I have chosen to use this Vital Nutrients CoEnzyme Q10 brand.Though it is more expensive than other brands , as I have tried other company brands of CoEnzyme Q10.Through experimenting with the other brands , I have found that Vital Nutrients CoEnzyme Q10 has made all the difference for me.The other brands caused me to have different unpleasant reactions / side effects.Do to being very sensitive to foods , chemicals and vitamin nutrients , this is the vitamin I have chosen and trusted to use . I have been using this vitamin for quite a few years and have not had any problems with it .

 THANKS Amazon for offers such as these pops . Great for any habit you are trying to curb . The tastes are great even if you just want a great candy .

 I love this toy because I can leave it out , pretty much anywhere , and no one suspects what I use it for . If anyone asks , I say it 's a replica of ancient Incan art . Of course , the truth is much more private . This is my `` strictly rear entrance '' toy and I highly recommend it to anyone , male or female , who enjoys that type of stimulation . My last boyfriend and I would sometimes pass it back and forth during lovemaking sessions . Just be sure to clean it after that type of usage .
 I purchased for my son . He commented `` It is good , but a little too sweet ''
 Smoothly poured , and smoothly swallowed , this delicate chocolate drink danced in daylight , a creamy delight , as if to tease me , please me into a heightened awareness of all that is succulent and good . And , mmm , it was and is good , this chocolate Slim Fast.We spent a weekend in the fields . I shook the cans , one at a time , completely as their humble label directed . Their cardboard box was sturdy enough only to sit upon the ground and watch the clouds go by , but in this , I was content . Just sipping Slim Fast in its 220 glorious calories , that was enough pleasure for me . Always cool , cold -- chilled in my refrigerator for a fortnight , the flavors were at their peak . One night would 've done well , but 14 sufficed beyond chronological measure.Each of the 24 vitamins and minerals sang out to me , called me their friend , and I called them friend . Calcium was there , ready to drink , ready to nourish . We , the Slim Fast and I , drank together through the weekend , until the sunset , and then , when the sixth can was empty , I slumped into a satisfied grin . Here , I knew 24 cans throughout.This is the way good days are spent , drinking Slim Fast . May yours bring you the same chocolate-flavored happiness . -- Brockeim
 As other reviews have said , this is not J&J 's ELASTIKON tape . It 's a generic brand -LRB- `` Elastiant '' from VetOne -RRB- . I knew that from other reviews and bought it based on price since using for normal use for dog injuries . It is n't as sticky as Elastikon but still works and sticks to dog fur and itself . Just put a strip of medical tape on end prevents any rolling up of end .
 Was just as described . . This is a great product . We have purchased locally at a much higher price and knew what to expect . Our expectations were met and the shipping was immediate . I will continue to use and order this product .
 This is hard stuff to find . I use it for my dogs when they cut a pad or hurt a leg . Not able to find it locally unless at the vet . Of course , you need gauze and vet wrap first , but this product keeps everything stable and safe while the part heals . Top grade . Fast shipment . Great price .
 We needed a significant number of rolls of bandage for our dog post-surgery . Checked all over town trying to find a pet store that carries this , no luck . The vet 's office could only spare a few rolls . Save yourself time and $ $ and buy a case here .

These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 We have tried other `` pocket rocket '' type toys from other makers . They are all cheap , thin plastic and do not last . This Doc Johnson will last forever . It is a very strong vibrator and it is made very well with strong materials . Perfect toy for the bedroom . If you have n't tried one of these , get one today .
 Pocket rockets are quiet and provide very powerful stimulation and intense orgasms . I have tried others and have never found anything that works better for me . I used to buy them at a local retail outlet where I paid $ 29.95 for the exact same vibrator . I like the convenience and price of buying from Amazon.com . They are reliable and provide good life . When they start getting noisy and using up batteries too fast , I replace them and always keep a replacement on hand .
 OK so I only have a wife that thanked me , but this is a great product and works well . We had been using `` The Relaxor '' which is a similar design and was sold at Long 's Drug store for about $ 12.00 . We were buying a new one every 6 months because of the poor quality.This is comparable in price but far superior in quality . Nice that it is waterproof so it is easy to wash and has the purrrrfect speed to keep the fun coming . Enjoy : -RRB-
 This is one of the best vibrators . You are sure to have many orgasms with this one . Not only to be used by yourself ... you can also use while you are with your partner ! Easy to clean and easy to hide :-RRB- I do not have any complaints .
 This little guy works ok . I was expecting a little more `` zap '' but it gets the party started non-the-less .
 Even with all the reviews on how well this product works , it worked better than anticipated . My lady may replace me !!
 This device is not as suggestively shaped and colored as most vibrators , but it seems much more solidly built than the long slim ones . The vibration is firm but not overwhelming , and the twelve little nubbies on the end really get the job done on her . It also uses a standard AA battery , a definite plus . She gives it an A + !
 She has used them for many moons . Quality not all that great and they are throw aways after a couple years , so I just keep buying replacements over and over again . :-RRB- But they do have some bang for the buck !!!
 wow ! my wife likes it , what more can I say , my wife likes it , what more can I say
 This little vibrator put a smile on my wife 's face . This device does quick work and allows me to get the juices flowing for the Big dance . I can be a gentlemen and allow the lady to have o 's first then get what I want and then back to Sportcenter . I 'm a huge fan Doc Johnson
 I was able to order this and recieve it to be given as a Christmas present to my wife . She loves it .
 I love this little replacement me . I can now enjoy my TV shows and I 've even been able to golf more . . Thank you DOC !!
 So let 's start with why I purchased this little baby . I 'd had a generic version for approximately 5 years that recently died on me out of nowhere . I had never heard of Doc Johnson but when I read that this was the &#34; original &#34; pocket rocket I simply HAD to purchase it . I thought mine was pretty bombtastic and it lasted a hell of a long time so I knew that this guy would seriously outrank any achievements it made in its short life span.Uhm ... this is probably the best vibrator I have ever experienced . I dunno if it 's the battery that comes in it or just the sheer awesome radiating out of its little shell , but it 's one powerful beast . I do n't even have time to catch a breath after an explosive moment because another one is right behind it . I was hesitant about the price at first because I had bought my other one for around $ 5 , but this product is well worth the money put into it . I 'm sure I 'll get at least ten years out of this bad boy , and that 's with consistent use.The ONLY reason I did n't rate this product a 5 is because it 's not as quiet as it claims to be . This thing could easily wake up your significant other lying next to you . Now , I 'm not one to choose a toy over the real thing but when I have some me time with Doc here , that 's exactly what I want . ME time . So quiet is a highly appreciated feature . For now however , I 'll settle with sneaking into the living room to get my rocks off . This thing is fantastic , period .
 gives the most powerful orgasms ; a little loud for my taste but with the amazing price and outcome , i do n't mind at all : -- -RRB-
 Nuff said . Lasts a long time on one AA battery . Seems to be well made and powerful enough to do the job .
 I did n't know what in the world I was getting into since I 'd never had a vibrator before , but I was very pleasantly surprised . This definitely has spiced up my marriage and I would highly recommend it to any married couple - I have my O 's very quickly and this definitely makes them very powerful ... sorry , hopefully not TMI .
 This works great and has lots of power ! Sleek and small you can carry it anywhere ! Definitely top of the line , I have bought doc johnson for years !
 Well I just received my Pocket Rocket on Nov 28th . It was shipped ahead of expected time from Amazon . I decided to try it the same day , and I 'm glad I did.It was well worth the money and it does pack a mighty punch . It 's not that quiet but it 's not real loud either.All I can say is I started using it , and I was waking up like 3 hrs later with a smile on my face . I love that I can just stick it in my purse and go . I should Marry My Pocket Rocket !
 I had to replace my old pocket rocket , which I had for many years , and bought this one . What can I say - it 's as perfect as ever : -RRB-
 A great orgasm tool for even the toughest issues . A great product to use during intercourse or while using a dildoe . Great for travel too !
 Wow this thing is great !! I was reading alot about this Pocket Rocket before I bought it , and I was a little skeptical . But in all the reviews I would read people really liked it . So I said what the heck , and bought one . WOW !! I recommend this one FOR SURE ! It gives great orgasms ! Buy it cuz this one will be a favorite .
 This has proven to be a great Christmas gift for my girlfriend who said that it could bring her to climax within two minutes . There appears to be a slight problem with the noise that it makes though , which she hopes could be more discreet . But overall , it does its job in a powerful , bull 's eye way .
 this is the only vibrator i have , so it took a couple days getting use to . its not too loud , and it gets the job done .
 I really like the pocket rocket . Its small and portable , and does its job . It 's a bit noisy though , especially when it 's at a new battery . Oh dear . Hope nobody 's listening .
 This little vibrator is great - very powerful for such a little vibrator . You can also buy sleeves for it , but I prefer it without . The one I bought from Amazon this time was a gift for a friend , but I have one , too , and this is about the third or fourth one I 've bought . The best thing about it is it 's easy to slip into your purse so you never have to leave home without it . You just never know when you might need it ;--RRB- . And because it 's pretty innocent looking , I do n't feel embarrassed packing it in carry on luggage and having an inspector open my bags .
 it 's small enough , and the chassis seems strong enough . The tip warms up a bit with use , but that 's to be expected . it comes with a head with a bunch of knobby bits on it , and if you take off that cap there 's three round metal things , but be careful using them as a surface as one of them pulled a hair when I tried to use it . There 's only one speed , but it 's good enough . I like it well enough , but I 'm still searching for something ... a little more fancy .
 I purchased this along with a vibrating bullet . WOW ! The two used together are very effective , very quickly ! One thing I really like about this product is it 's size , or lack thereof . It 's slim enough to be comfortable and is a good length to hit the lower G-spot .
 I read about this item in the book Love , Lust & Faking It by Jenny McCarthy . And it does everything she said it would do . thank very much.Love , Lust & Faking It
 I bought this for my wife , and it is the best vibrator that we have found so far . The best parts are that it is wireless , and only uses one battery . However , it became a problem that it is so noisy , especially with a new battery . We live in in an apartment building and the noise can be a cause of concern if you do not wish to be overheard . Other than that it is very nice .
 Gets the job done right and packs a punch to boot . Very enjoyable and easy to use . The only flaw is that I wish the top did n't pop off so easy .
 I purchased this for my wife . First time using it she went ballastic in a VERY short time . She would not do without it now . A must buy to spice up you and your lady friends sexual experience .
 I absolutely love this vibe ! It provides intense orgasims while being discreet -LRB- which is a major plus -RRB- . It 's compact so you can pretty much bring it with you any where and it 's a great tool to use with your significant other . Ca n't get any better than this !
 Actually , the Pocket Rocket has been a round quite a while . What 's new is the seven interchangeable massage heads . This handy little gadget is useful as a small massager , though as its one AA battery suggests , it 's not too powerful . It is just right , though , for taking with you , wherever you go , and quickly and effectively massaging sore or tense spots.Even better , though , is using it as a vibrator ! The pocket rocket is small enough to hide in a nightstand , and it 's nice and quiet . It is definitely of the `` outie '' variety , though , so please do not even consider inserting it in any opening.So , if you want a small and quiet `` outie '' vibrator , one that 's light on the battery requirements , then get the Pocket Rocket . It 's a great piece of vacation gear ! -LRB- Review of Doc Johnson The Original Pocket Rocket 4-Inch Ivory Vibrator -RRB-
 My wife really love it ! We used together and this &#34; little devil &#34; in just a couple of minutes did the work
 This was my first `` toy '' if you will , and dear god did it do the trick . This is literally the most amazing thing I have ever used . I 'm a bit of a skeptic when it comes to these sorts of things since I 'm rather difficult , but it literally took two minutes . The vibration is perfect , although all women vary . If this is your first , DEFINITELY go for this one !!!!!!!
 I just absolutely love this little thing ! I bought this 3 years ago and it is still going strong ! I really love this vibrator !
 The title should tell it all . My first vibrator ... I know I have a sensitive button but this thing is amazinggggggggggg
 It 's perfect . Small , discreet , a little on the ` loud ' side but nothing a pillow ca n't muffle out . Worth every penny .
 I 've used this product for many years , and I have to say that after trying others this one is still the best . Forget the Fukuoku and the others . The quality and portability of this little gadget can hardly compare to others . Watch out for imitations though . I tried those too and they do n't last nearly as long ... Also very compact and portable , in case you need to travel .
 This is the best vibrator for the woman who wants a small toy to carry in her purse or to take in her carry-on luggage . It is fairly quiet -LRB- if you use it under the covers -RRB- and it has just the right level of vibration . Enjoy !
 but it does what i need it to do . Not exactly quiet , but its not a big deal . a good addition to any collection
 works like a charm ; what else is there to say ; sole operator ; no assistant required or needed or wanted ; awesome product
 My wife said `` do we really need this '' when I surprised her with this vibe as we have a great sex life but now we do n't have sex without it and she loves it .
 I loved this !!! It works great . Lots of power behind this little thing !!!! Would definitely recommend it to anyone !!
 She loves it ! It gets the job done ! Every time ! It 's very powerful for such a small toy & she takes it with her all the time now .
 My wife has never had a vibrator before so I picked this out as a little surprise for her . All I can say is , `` WOW '' !!! Without getting too graphic , there are claw marks on the ceiling after a `` successful use '' of this item !! Right now my mind is running wild about all the different `` ways '' it can be used ! She told me to give it 20 stars !!!!! Yeah ... this is a keeper !!!!
 It 's a powerful little devil for 1 AA battery . There are stronger out there but not near as stealthy . Get it . You 'll like it . ; - -RRB-
 This is an excellent product for the price . It is small , quiet , effective and uses only one battery . Highly recommended .
 A little louder than I 'd prefer but it works wonderfully . Compact size and good battery life .
 This is such a great little toy . I 've used this baby for a long time and I 'm just buying my third one . I admit that having to change the batteries is a downer , but it 's such a small price to pay for an item that works everytime and does not disappoint . It 's awesome because you can use it alone or with your partner . I highly recommend this to all women !!!
 Sometimes it takes a little something extra to get her `` wet `` and THIS is it !
 this was my first vibrator and i did rather extensive research before deciding to purchase it . the pocket rocket lived up to its praise , exceeded my expectations , and is my recommendation for friends curious about buying their first vibrator.there are only a few drawbacks that i can think of * there are several small ridged around the top that catch if you 're not using the 3 nubbed tip exactly positioned , does n't hurt but startled me several times * it 's actually pretty loud when used in open air * only one speed unless you have several batteries in varying states of use * while it 's excellent for clitoral and general external stimulation , it 's internal uses are minimal and would , i imagine , be uncomfortablebut other than that , it 's wonderful .
 it is a tad loud but ... it gets the job done . . over and over again ... lol
 This is the best out there ... trust me ! Word of CAUTION ... do not puchase the colorful Pocket Rockets . Do n't know why , but I think it is a different type of plastic and it breaks VERY easily . Buy this one , the plain white one . It will last for a very long time !
 I used it for the first time last night and it was great ! My husband used it on me and he was so shocked at how quickly it worked -LRB- wink , wink -RRB- ! It is a great little vibrator and is very powerful for its size .
 It was louder than I expected , for one . I had another off brand mini massager that I 'd had for six months and i loved it . It was quiet and powerful . In fact , someone could walk into the room and not hear it . It broke after ample amounts of use and I finally decided to get the original pocket rocket , which i expected to be better than the off brand.So it is a bit loud , compared to my old one , but it 's still a fairly quiet vibrator . People around the house would n't hear it , but if they stood outside the door for a few seconds , they could probably notice some sound . The metal nubs are n't pronounced enough for me so i prefer the cap , which does n't hurt even though the plastic points look slightly intimidating . It has a pretty good battery life and does its job , though really , you 're not purchasing an EXTREMELY powerful vibrator . Really I 'm biased because I 'm comparing it to the hitachi magic wand , which is incredible . Next to that , the pocket rocket is impotent . But if I wait a couple days without using the hitachi , the pocket rocket works just fine , and it 's a LOT quieter than the hitachi for sure.Overall , it was a good purchase for the money . It 's portable , discrete , and powerful for its size .
 This was my first vibe , and still my favorite . Tiny , not too loud , and portable , but it definitely gets the job done . I 've tried to replace it with more expensive toys and keep coming back . I hate having to replace batteries , but that 's the only downside to this one . I recommend this for beginners or someone looking for a discreet vibrator , and it is definitely worth the price -LRB- over and over ! -RRB- .
 There 's not much to say , most girls like this . And I do too . It 's the perfect little pocket vibrator to have . I actually use it as a regular massager sometimes when I 'm stressed and my back hurts.Likes : Size - its small , it fits anywhereColor - it honestly blends in and just looks like something other than a vibrator , I dont know how it even ended up in my purse , but its been there for the past few months and I use it whenever needed - usually for guys who are n't as `` orally gifted . `` Power - the name ` rocket '' is not an over exaggeration ... it really is strong.Dis-likes : Noise - sometimes its sorta loud , but its amazing that all the strength comes from something so small.Levels - it only goes at one speed , which is cool , but can be Alot for a first time vibrator buyer and annoying for an experienced one.Waterproof - most of all I hate that its not waterproof , because sometimes with all its little strength I want to insert it , but since its not waterproof and since the top has the little gold metal grooves , you really should n't ... Again I love that I can use it as a general massager and I honestly have on several occasions ... it feels so good on my back and stuff , and its nice to have because you can use it on your significant others back as a massager as well.Overall
 Like others said , it 's kind of heavy -LRB- 2 AA batteries -RRB- and hard ... but it works well for `` external use '' . I would n't recommend this for discreet situations ; it 's not all that quiet . Good buy for under $ 10 , though !
 I will never use any other drain cleaner after trying this one . It works without acid or lye and clears the drain pretty much instantly -- with a pleasant puff of lemon scent at the end . You need to buy the starter kit the first time and just refills after that . You place the can upside down into the drain , fill the sink/tub with enough water to cover the cap , plug up the overflow with a wet washcloth and then just push down on the can . It is sometimes easier to do this with two people
 Our shower and bathroom sink drains were emptying s-l-o-w-l-y -LRB- I was standing in ankle deep water by the time I was done my shower -- BLECH ! -RRB- . We had used the standard drain cleaners before but they would take more than one application , and I really did n't like using such strong chemicals . So this time my husband shopped and he came home with Plumb-Away . I was leery because of the price , but it worked immediately and now we have clear drains ! The $ 10 box is good for 8 uses , so it 's WORTH it . We 'll probably use it monthly to keep the drains clear . Yay !
 I never write reviews , but this product is amazing . It really does work . We tried drain cleaners and could not get rid of our bathtub clog . Finally brought this home and it worked in just seconds .
 Tonight I found this product under my sink , it was left by the previous house owners . We never needed a plunger so I opted to use this product on a clogged sink . I found myself quickly looking over the directions for a double sink , passed up the fact that you should hold the stop on the opposite sink you are using plumb away . I also did n't care to read the fact that you should have the whole plastic lid submerged ... I gave it a good push and KABOOM !!! All the crap from the drain was now in my face , the blinds , the cupboards , the floor , everywhere in a 10 foot radius . I have n't laughed that hard in years !! What ca n't say ... This stuff really really works .
 Our bathroom tub clogged up a couple of days ago - no warning and we tried using one of those plastic Zip-It snakes but wherever the obstruction was , it was too deep to reach with the Zip-It . Normally , I would have used Drano or something similar but Plumbs-Away looked intriguing enough , especially its lack of corrosive chemicals so I figured , why not?The first two tries ended in hilarious failure but that was my fault , not the products . I thought it 'd create a tighter seal to remove the overflow valve and then use a plunger to seal it . The problem is that it 's hard to put proper leverage with the plunger AND try to activate Plumbs-Away at the same time . The product is POWERFUL , literally explosive , and it basically blew the plunger off the seal and doused me with a few cups of water . This happened a second time until I realized
 I was skeptical but for less than ten bucks what 's to lose ? We tried enzyme treatments and all the toxic choices . This stuff worked better than all of them . Super impressed .
 This works just like it says on the box . I used it on my bathroom sink and it was unstopped in seconds . I had used other chemical drain openers that just did not work to unstop my sink . Only thing , make sure you stop up the overflow hole with something so that the gunk wont splatter on you . Also , I tried using this in my bathtub but did not work well for me . I found it awkward trying to use this while trying to cover the overflow drain in my tub . Great for using on sinks but not so great for tubs .
 I have used this product for a long time and it sure beats getting a plumber who spends so much time with a snake to clear away the stuff that you can do with a simple push of the the product .
 It is a sturdy piece . It is an ID necklace , not a fine piece of jewelryServes it 's purpose well . .
 Great Product and purchased it as a fob for a work pouch to alert anyone I worked with that I am Diabetic .
 The Medical ID Necklace for men is a very good , high quality identifyer for a diabetic to wear . I got mine in in about 5 days after placing the order , and wear it every day . You will be happy if you need and order one .
 It is necessary for all diabetics to own and wear one , for when they are unable to communicate with the ems/emt , the necklace speaks for them .
 Been wearin this for a while now and It has become a part of me I guess . Like my ring I know when it 's not on me .
 I purchased this item for my daughter , age 19 . She was recently diagnosed as a diabetic . The only complaint she has with this necklace is there is no opening , you have to put it over your head . Thank goodness she can fit it over her head . She was kind of disappointed with it because of that .
 My doctor was on me for a pretty long time to get an id tag but I really did n't want one . I finally realized it is something very important to have on , especially if you work away from people who know you are diabetic . After wearing it a while you forget you even have it on . It is very discrete and lightweight .
 I am diabetic and just in case I am unconscious , I would like it known that I am diabetic . Highly recommended to any diabetic people .
 I recently purchased the diabetic necklace for my ten year old son . He had tried wearing a bracelet but it kept breaking . The necklace is perfect since he loves wearing it . Thank you for the quick delivery .
 This is a very functional , inexpensive necklace and is comfortable to wear . I am happy with this , both the product and the price .
 I 've been looking for a Diabetic specific ID bracelet for a good price . This satisfied me in quality and price .
 I could not find an inexpensive dibetes medic alert necklace at any of the local pharmacys . They only offered expensive custom orders that would take weeks to get . This was just what I was lookingh for and it was quick and inexpensive .
 This is the extra one that we needed in case he breaks the other one we bought and it stays in his work truck at all times
 took it off the chain and put it on a charm bracelet - my cousin loved it -- older lady and she was self conscious about telling the world about her &#34; personal business &#34; looks like a nice piece of jewelry - good shine and size .
 This was a great price for the tag . The chain was a bit on the chintzy side , so I ended up using an older chain that I had on hand .
 I have bought just your typical vibrators before but this little baby packs a BIG PUNCH . It has so much power that you will be amazed . A great purchase and I am thinking about getting a couple more just so that I have an extra if this one happens to break . I would recommend it to anyone wanting to have just a simple vibrator . It is well worth it and a great price .
 At first I thought it was too powerful but the longer I go the more I need to turn up the intensity . I love it . My fiance calls it my new best friend but I do n't know about that .
 This little guy packs a relatively quiet and effective punch . This is mine , my wife has her own and it serves its purpose well since its strong yet thin enough not to cause discomfort . I recommend it for anyone who enjoys some behind play without being overbearing .
 Soft . Slick . Great for times alone or with a partner .
 I regularly replace my own watch batteries and this one still going strong after a few months . I 've purchased several Maxell 's in the past and have n't been disappointed yet .
 Safeguard is my `` go to '' herbal remedy for when I start to feel under the weather - be it sore throat , runny nose , or that sneaky little feeling I 'm coming down with ` something ' . It works every single time and I always try to keep it in stock at home . It works fast and I swear by it . Seriously , I recommend it to everyone I know !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Decided to learn how to changed watch batteries myself instead of letting a watch dealer do this . The watch dealer might installed a generic battery and charge you 10 to $ 20.00 . Installed it myself with this great battery at a great price . Thanks Amazon . .
 Maxell SR721SW 362 D362 SR58 SR721 Silver Oxide Watch Battery good . good.good . good.good . good . good . good . good . good . good . good .
 I have purchased several of these in my lifetime and this is the first one that really does the job . I would recommend anyone that needs this extra support , that they invest is one of these inexpensive yet excellent back support while sitting .
 This is a very good product for the price . This item provides the necessary support and works as intended . Good buy !
 The Back Booster is a wonderful product when it works . But after having 4 of these -LRB- 2 in my office , one in my car , and one for my wife -RRB- , only one has shown that it can hold a reasonably full inflation on a continuous basis . The other 3 have an imperceptible slow leak that requires new inflation about every two hours.I emailed Back Booster 's CEO to let him know about this . He was quite aware and told me he was working on this with the manufacturer . He sent me some replacements at no charge , and those are working fine . Because of this great customer service , I 've increased my rating from a 2 to a 4 .
 I was totally impressed with this product that I recommended and bought it for my sister . The one that I bought leaked so I was disappointed because I have been bragging about it . It was one factory defect but when I contacted the company about it , I was so impressed with the customer service!They have an A + customer service ! The president himself made sure I was rectified and the wrong was make right . He sent me 3 new back boosters in place of the one I discarded ! Thank you very much ! This product works and very comfortable support for your back . I use it for my car and it is great for travel as well . It is inflatable to your comfort and another good thing is that it does not feel plastic to your skin since it has a suede-like surface.You can deflate it and put inside your purse when not in use . Great product !
 Product arrived on time and as discribed small and compact , I will write an update after the product once it has been utilize on my next trip .
 I originally got this because I was taking a bunch of flights in a short period , and I needed some relief from terrible airplane seats . This thing worked very well on planes , although it sometimes pushed me too close to the seat in front if there was n't much legroom.Anyway I began using this every day in my office maybe a month or two ago , and it has worked great there too . Unfortunately , it now does n't seem to hold air , or as much as it used to , so the support is provides is much diminished . I 'm not sure if this will still be usable on planes in the future , but I 'm definitely going to have to get a different one for every day use . Of course , this thing also only costs $ 15 -LRB- at least on Amazon right now -RRB- , so I ca n't really complain that it did n't last that long under every day use.I still give this four stars because it did do the job while it lasted , and it 's honestly more convenient to have this while traveling , rather than a full size cushion that does n't deflate .
 I ordered this item because I was just recovering from throwing out my back and was taking a long flight to Hawaii . Before the flight , I used the Back Booster a few times in the car and at the office , and it felt pretty good . Definitely made the recovery easier . The elastic strap that is attached makes it easy to hold the support in place on a car seat or a chair . This is espescially useful for taller people who may want to position the support a little higher . It takes some time to figure out the right inflation amount for you . I use it half inflated at most.The big test came on the 6 hour flight to Hawaii . Again , I found it to work the best when it was about half inflated . One nice feature is that the support is shaped so that one end is a little more round than the other . The instructions state that the round end should be at the top , but you can also turn it so that the round side is down if you need lower support . On a plane , you ca n't secure it to the seat since you ca n't wrap the elastic straps around the back of the chair , but since you 're sitting in one spot most of the time , it stays in place . I thought that it provided great support . I honestly wish I would 've used this even before I had back pain - it would 've saved me many uncomfortable hours on flights.I give the product high marks for portability and durability . It deflates easily and folds nicely into a small pouch . I 'm a big guy -LRB- 6 ' 4 , 300lbs . -RRB- , and lean onto the support as hard as I need to , but this product has not leaked at all . I keep it in the office now in case I start to feel a little bit of back discomfort . For a portable device that can help with back support and discomfort , I 'm really pleased with the purchase .
 I let out some of the air to get it to a point where it felt right for me for low back .
 I bought this to take on long flights . Its small when deflated so I can store it in my carry on . I just blow it up and it supports my back from the horrible airline seats.I love this thing !
 I love this back pillow , but my first 2 or 3 had leaks over a very short period of time . Why would I even try it multiple times ? Because it 's really a great product : - Easily Inflatable and Deflatable-Folds up so you can travel with it easily-Tremendously comfortable - better to have it inflatable so you can &#34; customize it &#34; . Make it right for your needs . Also , if you 're flying , as cabin pressure changes , you can alter the pillow so it stays the way that you need it.Now ... I had this air leak issue . I contacted the company and they sent me several for free ... just in case it happens again.The first of that batch they sent me is still the one I use ... meaning the issue is solved !
 My husband and I used this for our flight from New York to Hong Kong . We were on Cathay Pacific with their newly designed seats that were suppose to be very comfortable . The new seats were n't that great but this cushion definitely helped , especially since my husband had a back surgery a few years before . It made flying in tight economy seats on long flights more tolerable .
 This cushion provides excellent back support . I 'm one who sits at my computer for many hours at a stretch . This is a comfortable back cushion . Great to use during flights . Highly recommended .
 I bought this cushion for my husband when he 's going on a long flight -LRB- about 16 hours plus -RRB- and he has some serious backpain . It is not comfortable at all being in a long flight where you have to stay too long in a cramp seat even if you do n't have any back problem , so you can imagine how it would be when you have a backpain . He told me that the cushion helped supporting his back while he 's on the plane for 16 hours . When I tried it myself at home sitting in front of a computer , it felt good . I think it feels better than the inflatable pillow we used to buy at REI -LRB- now they do n't have it anymore -RRB- which cost only $ 3 . It 's much more expensive than that old inflatable pillow , but it is more durable and has better shape for your back . Plus it is still easy and light to carry while you 're traveling . So I think overall it 's a pretty good purchase .
 I bought a few lumbar cushions b/c I needed one for the car/airplane , one for the office , one for the home office . So I tried 3 different kinds -LRB- all through Amazon -RRB- . I liked this one the best for the car b/c my subaru outback has really weird uncomfortable seats and this one allowed me to deflate it so I had the right amount of support . It also worked well on an airplane for the same reasons . And it folds up quickly . I am buying a second one for my husband because he has tried to steal it !
 If you drive everyday then I think having a light and inflatable cushion is a good choice . I have n't taken it with me for long distance travel , but so far , it works well .
 We buy the back booster 1001 inflatable lumbar support cushion and this product help my doughter in th high school seats .
 Excellent both for my back and wife 's butt.She 's only 5 foot and uses them to increase her height when driving.I 'm 6 foot and these make it far more convenient to switch drivers during long trips.As they are easily inflated and come in a small package , they re easy to take on vacation and use with rental cars.They 're also great for concerts and sporting events .
 Back Booster provides great lumbar support!Lasts long -LRB- over a year -RRB- - more than most inflatable lumbar supports . . and definitely worth the convenience!Everyone needs better lumbar support or you will inevitably end up with low-back pain and tight muscles.Stretch daily , Take breaks often -LRB- i.e. , do n't sit for more than an hour at a time -RRB- , and do n't slouch ! -LRB- you ca n't slouch if you have lumbar support : -RRB-
 I love this cushion ! It is lightweight and convenient to use . The elastic strap fits over the back of many chairs , keeping it from falling on the floor , which happens so often with other cushions . Since it is inflatable , it can be filled to suit the user , and conforms well to the back , and to shifting body position .
 I use the inflatable lumbar support every day , but find it is very small and does tend to lose air . It would be more effective if larger and if used in a more rigid chair.I did bring to the attention of the owner , the loss of air , and was sent 2 replacements . Now I have a 2nd one to use in my computer chair.May even deflate when I travel and take it on train or plane , similar to the inflatable neck pillow.Rather than use the strap to affix it to me , I velcro the strap around a pillow before placing it behind my back .
 This cushion is great for traveling as it saves space and inflates quickly . I do n't use the attached strap to hold it in place as it 's too short .
 I have a bad back , never felt comfortable with various gadgets , but this back booster simply works , inexpensive , lightweight , and it is very effective . My lower back thanks you Back Booster ! Highly recommended ... I emailed the company with some questions and concerns with the product , the owner , yes , THE OWNER of the company emailed me back within minutes , answered all my questions , took care of my concerns , WOW , you can ' beat that type of service ...
 After back surgery , I needed more support for my back and this is the answer ! Since it is inflatable , it is easy to get a perfect fit . Heavy-duty product material , and great price . I am using this product eight to ten hours a day , and it is comfortable and stable throughout the day . I highly recommend it ! Very fast shipping also!Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion
 Along with theCorflex Medic-Air Seat Cushion 15 1/2 '' X 17 1/2 '' , I purchased this lumbar support for a recent flight from Hawaii to the East Coast . Usually , by the time we hit Atlanta my tush is numb and my back is hurting . The Back Booster , however , proved to be well worth the cost . I was much more comfortable and will never travel again without either.I did not bother with the straps on the airplane seat , however I am using it on my office chair and the elastic straps keep it in place without any problem . So far , I 've had no problems with any leakage . It rolls up easily and fits into its carrying bag without a struggle . A few breaths gives it enough volume without being too rigid , and is easily adjustable.Excellent value , terrific product . I would recommend this to anyone needed a lumbar support .
 I ordered the Back Booster on a recommendation of a friend . I manage a restaurant and am on my feet all day and am spent at the end of a shift . I use the Booster in my car for the rides to/from work and I get out of the car feeling great . I now take the Booster in the house to use as well . As a result , I sleep better and have more stamina to chase my 3 year old around the house . Ive told my coworkers about this item and ca n't stress how much it 's made me feel better . I wish I ordered this a long time ago !
 I like this product . I can regulate the intensity of the support according to my situation . I especially like the `` pack up and go '' aspect of this item .
 Having a very bad back , I need constant lumbar support where ever I go and taking this handy , convenient pillow with me provides that no matter what kind of seat I sit in . It is especially helpful in church pews and the straight back wood pews play havoc with my back . Having the pillow allows me to sit in relative comfort .
 I bought this Back Booster for work . I received it immediately , and it works exactly like the description . Great support , never deflates . It was not very easy to inflate , though , like the review notes . I blew it up and it took more than a few breaths . Overall , I would recommend it .
 I lost one on a plane . I still have one and just bought another . I like the ability to change the inflation . They last a long time . The only negative is that the labels tend to wear off quickly , which does n't bother me . Note that all air pillows change firmess on airplanes as altitude and cabin pressure change .
 I 've had a series of different cushions of this kind , concentrating on the inflatable ones because I travel a good deal & have chronic lower back issues . This one is the best so far.I 'm on a month-long African trip and inflated it 2-1/2 weeks ago when I left home . It is still inflated ! The other ones , sooner or later , leaked , even when they were n't defective , but not the Back Booster ! Before I left , the first one of these I had bought stopped holding air -- I think the valve was defective . I wrote the email address on the box and got an immediate answer
 Having had extensive spinal fusion surgery last fall , I was sent this by a friend who ironically had the same surgery a month before mine occurred . She swore this really helped and I have to agree from my point of view . It makes you `` sit right '' which is half the battle with back issues -LRB- having had chronic problems for many years -RRB- . After approx eleven months of daily use it has finally developed a leak , so I am ordering a new one ! Of note , one month after my back surgery , I took a long plane flight -LRB- overnight -RRB- and I would not have done well without this cushion , it will be coming with me on any future flights !
 I bought this on a whim and wondered if I could have found a better product elsewhere . However , I 'm glad I ordered this . I love that fact that it can be inflated for various degrees of support . It 's good for chairs that do n't have a lot of ` seat ' room ... you just inflate it less . And I like the strap - so handy for lawn and deck chairs . Because it 's inflatable , it 's deflatable ... packs well in a pocket or purse . I own several types of support cushions and I must say I like my inflatable ones best for unwavering firmness .
 This company , gave me no hassle or cost to return this back booster . I received this Back Booster in mid-July 2012 and by the first week of September 2012 it had sprung a leak and became unusable . I 'm assuming that it was just this particular back booster that was defective , because the maker of this product displayed such integrity in offering and quickly following through on letting me return the item for a full refund and they paid the cost of shipping . In fact they sent me my refund before I even returned the Back Booster . So for all of these reasons I give them my five star rating .
 This is literally my first review after ordering on Amazon for many years.This inflatable lumbar cushion is really as good as I had hoped it would be . I 've tried them all , the mesh one , the foam curved one , pillows , an inflatable exercise ball ... What I really like about this is that you can inflate it just the way you want . If it seems a little too much , I just let a little air out . I exercise , stretch , take breaks from the office chair throughout the day , but still need the lumbar support when I sit for and this really has been the best product I 've found so far . Also , I love the portability and have brought it with me to the movie theater , for music rehearsals and gigs -LRB- I 'm a professional clarinetist in addition to my day job -RRB- and other places where I have needed to sit for long periods of time.It did start to leak air after a few months , but after sending an email to Dan -LRB- the owner -RRB- through his website backbooster.com , I received a response back in literally 3 minutes with a message that a replacement was on the way . For only around 15 bucks , I would imagine that an air leak is going to happen in a few products here and there . But rest assured that the owner sticks behind his product and will help work with you .
 I 've been using this cushion for five months and I love it . It gives me great support for my lower back , it 's firm , but comfortable . The strap really keeps it in place on my office chair . Also , I have n't had to re-inflate it yet . I highly recommend this product .
 This product works well for travelers using rental cars or airlines . I gave it four as opposed to five stars because the adjustment process -LRB- blowing into a tube then trying it -RRB- is inherently a litte tedious . And over-inflating can be bad for your back as well.On the other hand , it stuffs into your carry-on/briefcase with no problem and works well once adjusted . So the ability to deflate it completely is also inherent to its value .
 I am a semi-frequent flier , and I like lumbar support when sitting on a plane or in a car . This Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion is the BEST back pillow I have ever used.It is slightly larger than its competition , it is made of thicker material , it has a clever waist belt attached so that the pillow stays in the exact perfect position behind you , and most importantly it has a tough plastic valve for inflation . The problem with other brands , especially the Lewin N. Clark back pillow , is the valve eventually fails , and then the air seeps out while you are using it . The Back Booster uses a heavy duty valve that requires the user to pinch it open while inflating . This makes for a secure seal . Much better than Lewis N. Clark .
 My husband loves the back booster . He takes it to his car and any air travel .
 I like this product . I had a problem with one holding air and , even though the warranty period had expired , I had immediate and positive response from the developer . He will replace the defective item . So buy it and enjoy .
 easy to use and extremely comfortable . I would highly recommend this to anyone who has to sit for any length of time and has lower back problems .
 `` The Back Booster is a terrific product . I have had one strapped to my desk chair for months , giving me the best back support of any cushion or wedge that I have ever used . This thing is very rugged , and the company prides itself in quality as well as customer service . I actually had a problem with one cushion leaking -LRB- in the valve , I believe -RRB- , which I believe is pretty rare . I emailed the company and the owner immediately replaced mine , without question . Again , I think such problems are so rare , but defects do happen , with any product .
 I was nervous about buying this product , having seen all the problems with it , but so far so good . no leaks and it has maintained the air fill properly . have n't used it too much yet , but the times I have needed it , it has been a big help .
 It does the job at a good price . I recommend it for those who need lumbar support .
 Works great on the plane . Being 6 foot tall , the plane seats do not always hit my back right and I can never relax and end up with a sore back . With this all i need is one good breath of air and it gives just enough support for my back for the plane ride to be comfortable .
 This product works as promised . Very useful in a variety of situations , and you can easily adjust the level of inflation to provide more or less support or adapt to different chairs or seats . Recommended .
 Wonderful product , i bought this item for my wife and she loves it for her office chair .
 I am pretty thin so when I sit in an airplane seat there is usually an inch or two of space between the small of my back and the back of the airplane seat . This fills the space , and gives the seat a more cushioned feel altogether . For long flights , this is a must for me and makes the flight pleasant ... without it I am in pain only an hour into the flight .
 This is the product I was looking for . When deflated , it 's small and portable to bring on those long back-breaking airplane travels . I also use it as a back booster in my home office .
 I have one in my car and I fly a lot and I bring another with me on planes . It only takes a few seconds to blow it up and you have excellent back support . Although given the change in cabin pressure , one might want to wait until they reach cruising altitude . The product is durable although I did where one out or poke a hole in it in my car after a few month .
 These pillows do provide good back support , BUT they seem to last only a day or two beyond Amazon 's 30-day return deadline , and then they develop bad leaks which make them unusable . Kinda expensive for 30 days worth of back support ! 05/24/12 - The manufacturer read my review and sent me two new pillows . I took one of them on a 35-day cruise , which included a 10-hour flight , and the pillow performed flawlessly throughout that time . No leaks , and great support and comfort . I have been using the other one in my car and can report the same great results.I appreciate the chance to try them again and am delighted with results now .
 This is great support for the lower back . I like it because you can adjust the size of it . If you set in a chair at work or home this is what you need .
 I got the back booster to relieve minor back ache in various chairs . I can now inflate it to the level I need for any certain chair or for the car . I was concerned the air might shift to the sides away from where I wanted the support , but it is working fine . I do n't have the need to deflate and take it traveling , but that will be a good feature should that come up .
 When I get it down to the right amount of air for the proper support it is wrinkled . Also it 's not very wide . Maybe just barely wide enough for my 36 '' waist . A `` PlUS '' WAS THE ATTACHED PLASTIC STRAP WITH CLIPS TO HOLD IT IN PLACE ON THE CHAIR . Still it 's the most comfortable I 've found . My chair is perfect except for it needed just a little lower back support . Now it 's perfect , except for the ugly Wrindled cushion on it .
 The Back Booster provides Fantastic support for the lumbar . I have a herniated disk in my lower back and require firm back support whenever I sit for long periods of time . The Back Booster back support feels similar to the lumbar support in the high end cars . You can adjust the firmness simply by adding or reducing air . It fills with a couple of breaths . It packs down so you can carry it in cargo pants pockets . CAUTION . If you use it for flying , do not inflate it until you get to altitude . Pressure changes in the plane may cause the Back Booster to overinflate and pop .
 this thing works great ! i have it in a pc chair under a sheepskin car seat cover , i have a gel/water cushion under rear and this on back of seat i found it works best and is most comfortable when its nearly flat , maybe 1 good breath inside , like this it provides support and suspension , inflated to full its too thick and bows my back , i can sit literally all day comfortably , it has been under the seat cover well over a month and none zero leakage issues at all , i think people who complains it leaks got a bad unit or overinflated it and weigh 300 lbs and sitting on it , for the price this is the bomb for lumbar comfort and i recommend it highly
 Great product . Have only been using it when I travel but so far it has been doing its job well . I like it . Makes your travel comfortable .
 Got this to help with air travel after a tough back surgery . The product worked perfectly for me . Easy to inflate , but also easy to adjust . Inflate to a little more than needed and then lean back on the cushion and squeeze the air valve to release air until the support feels comfortable . Folds up into a small bundle and stows easily in the supplied storage bag . Great value for the money .
 I use this on the bus for my commute to work daily and it has kept me from having backaches . I only needed a little something extra and since it is adjustable , it fit the bill !
 It is lightweight and easy to position on the back of a chair . It is very comfortable and gives good support for 2-3 hour keyboarding and most important of all it does n't leak so you do n't have to adjust the comfort level every time you use it . I wish it came in a few more colors . Plan on buying more .
 Easy to inflate and works very well for car , home or office.Inflatable with a carry case makes it easy to carry when traveling .
 Truly works and totally amazing !!! For cars , bars , homes , really anyplace that you 're going to site for awhile . Very sturdy and ability to use as much or little air for perfect comfort .
 it ' s adjustable by simply inflating it to where you want . well designed to help my lower back pain . not at all cumbersome to move any where you want and is very light weight to position for any chair and where on the back you want to place it . . nice texture for bare skin . it even has a strap , which i never use , to place it on any chair . can be deflated and carried on a plane for long flights if you want .
 The item was accurately described , and worked very well for what I wanted it to do for me . For the price , I got a bargain .
 I like how this comes all folded up for easy travelability . I ca n't wait to try it out on my long plane trip to portugal .
 I have a bad back and have to commute to my sons school everyday ! 600 miles a week ! This is has saved my back !!! Thank you is not enough , believe me !!!
 I have to sit for hours at the computer to do my work , and my lower back has been bothering me on and off for years . I tried the Back Booster at the suggestion of a friend , and it is GREAT ! It is easy to inflate and deflate when I move around to another location . The packaging is nice and fits in my purse . I have gotten more to give to other friends with similar problems as well .
 I sit in a chair all day for work and usually finish the day with a sore back . After using this for awhile , I have no more pain at the end of the day and my back feels great ! Also travel alot and love it on the plane too !
 I use this in my nursing chair - before getting it I was always uncomfortable while nursing and rocking my baby and my back would hurt whenever I got up . Now , my lower back is supported , the chair is so comfortable and I am not in pain anymore.It is also great to use on the airplane because you can deflate it and it packs really small to fit in any carryon . I would highly recommend this product to anyone .
 Great product for those who sit at computers for long hours and for airline travel too .
 I have suffered from backpain when sitting for 20 years . I have finally found something that I can take anywhere . I LOVE SITTING NOW !!!!!! Thank you so much . I have recommended this to all of my bad back friends .
 Fly over 200k miles per year . Ca n't do it without lower back support . Back booster works great and very light-traveller friendly
 I ordered this perfect inflatable back support cushion from Amazon which gave IMMEDIATE relief , for about $ 14 . It is called the Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion . I shall recommend it to my physiatrist.I have spent -LRB- too -RRB- much time and money trying to find something that would be just right for travel and have now discovered that item ! It really does fold up small enough to stick in your jacket pocket and it inflates/deflates easily.I have had to return several other products of this nature which just did not feel comfortable and cost as much as three times the price , thankfully I have now been refunded for all .
 This back support is very convenient to move around from location to location . It has helped me in long driving trips . Right when I get out of the car , I 'm not stretching out my back like I 'm sore or anything . The strap is wraps pretty tight around almost any chair , so it does n't move around too much which is great . I think for the price , it 's a great deal.I give it a 4 star rating because it 's just basic versus some of the very fancy back supports out there . But it definitely gets the job done .
 I just used my new Booster support on a trip across the county and back . The material was thicker and more durable than I expected . It was easy to blow up and held the air load throughout all four legs of my trip . It has a good quality valve - one that requires you to squeeze it to release the inner flap . This way that air does not rush out as you are inflating . I was also happy to see that it came with an small storage pouch to contain it while traveling . As for the support , it was pretty darn good . I felt plenty of lumbar pressure -LRB- as I wanted -RRB- in the poor airline seats . In fact , I deflated a bit to reduce the pressure for more comfort . Totally worth the money .
 Just used the inflatable Back Booster 1001 pillow on an airline trip and it was great ! Wonderful help for my lower back - stayed inflated during the entire flight . Highly recommend this pillow .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother .

 I 'm female , not at all handy with tools , but like to take care of small things myself without bothering busy family . For some unknown reason , my toilet gets blocked at least once a month . I 've tried chemicals like Drano before with no results and always worry about the effects on the plumbing . This time all the plunging , etc. , did n't work . I noticed One Second Plumber and decided to try it . I pressed the device once and wham ! The toilet cleared at once ! The house is 20 years old and I do n't know what the condition of its pipes are . But this did not damage them in the slightest and worked instantly . Try it . It 's cheap and effective .
 If it is n't clear from the description , I think this basically fires compressed air down your drain . The idea is it would dislodge any plug . I had a plugged drain and my nearest store did n't have drano so I gave this a shot . It did n't work , but I think it 's because the clog was pretty deep in my pipes . The next thing I tried was a 16 food auger , and that did n't reach the problem either.What ended up working was drano MAX . But if you prefer to not use harsh chemicals , I think plumb away could work for some clogs .4 stars for cool idea that should work in theory .
 Our bathroom sink and tub both had extremely slow drains . We tried various chemicals and they did not help . I was about to ask a plumber to use a drain jetter -LRB- a high pressure water spray at the end of a flexible tube -RRB- to clear it out , when I saw this and decided to give it a try.It worked on the first try . I have 6 more charges left in the system . The cost per use is trivial , way cheaper than using chemicals . The only complaint I have is that it has some kind of `` fresh scent '' . If they got rid of that , this would be a 5 star product .
 I started out drinking Muscle Milk Light Vanilla Creme . I really liked the taste , but did n't want all of the &#34; extra &#34; ingredients they include . I just wanted plain protein.After reading reviews of Optimal Nutrition -LRB- ON -RRB- , I gave the ON vanilla ice cream a try . I mixed it in milk , and there was very little added taste to the milk . It tasted like I was drinking plain milk.I gave French Vanilla Creme a try next , and found that it has a little more vanilla flavor . I prefer it over the ON vanilla ice cream . However , still not as good of a flavor as the Muscle Milk.With my weight training , the ON protein has helped me to add lean muscle . Plus , I do n't find myself hungry later , and end up eating all kinds of junk.By the way , the cost per serving is less with the ON . So , that 's what I 'm sticking with for now .
 Great tasting , disolved better than other proteins I have tried -LRB- I used a blender bottle -RRB- . Best value I could find on the web.I have definately seen some improvement in physique , though that could be partially from a change in lifestyle .
 Been using this for 3 years . Remember , this is protein isolates , so bear that in mind in terms of when you take it and such . Helps me get adequate protein intake each day . Athletes often under -LRB- or over -RRB- estimate their protein needs . I put it in a funnel to go into a water bottle . Add water , shake , and it 's good . No need for filters/strainers to remove clumps . I can basically shake it out.However , if you are looking to mix it by hand in a cup or glass , you 'll get more clumping , in which case you should use a spoon or fork to mash them out , as the clumps are actually dry balls of the power that have been surrounded by the wetness of the water . It also takes a little longer for it to be ready if you do this method.I take a scoop in the morning and bring the bottle with me out the door so it 's very convenient to make.Don ' t really taste the mintiness much , but it 's better than just straight chocolate which I 've also tried , so there 's at least some difference .
 This shake is so good I dream of drinking it . I wonder if I could have like ten shakes a day and grow over 50 pounds of muscle in a year ? Can you imagine ? Actually for the price I think this is by far the best protein . Lots of flavored to choose from too . Although what if you tried a new flavor and hated it ? Then you 'd be stuck with five pounds of the stuff .
 Good flavor , good value for a protein shake . Mixes easy too , I drink after work outs as a muscle replenisher .
 I bought this over a year ago and still have it . I have n't been going to the gym as much as I used to when I originally bought this . It still tastes good a year later though .
 I 've been using ON gold standard for over a year now . The price ca n't be beat . The taste is pretty good and it does mix well . I 'd say using a shaker cup -LRB- any cup or lid will do -RRB- mixes it the best . The price is really good too . Great for my post workout protein .
 PROSGreat FlavorMixes very easily -LRB- no lumps -RRB- CONSNoneI am a big fan of Optimum Nutrition Products . I have used many of their protein products over the years as a form of recovery . This is the best I have had as far as taste and mix-ability is concerned . The product is delicious and mixes very well . For the price , there is no better protein for me . I have used the Platinum before , which is very similar , but slightly sweeter .
 Have been using this for a few years now . It 's simple , digests fairly easily and top-quality whey.Top flavors are Caramel Toffee Fudge and Chocolate Mint when paired with Whole Milk.I strongly recommend a Blender Bottle -LRB- or something equivalent -RRB- . I used to just add a scoop to a cup of milk and stir with a spoon but blending it makes it so much better .
 If you just want some protein that is effective , choose this one . I love strawberry , it tastes great -LRB- i drink mine with low fat milk as opposed to water -RRB- and it definitely helps with your workout routine . I used it mainly for recovery not so much to help bulk .
 This is okay . . I guess . One thing that i do n't really like about this product which i actually got a day before expected -LRB- kudos -RRB- is that it does n't mix well with milk , other than that it tastes pretty good -LRB- i purchased the Double rich Chocolate -RRB- which tastes like Nesquick
 I 'm always afraid to buy a huge quantity of something to have it taste bad -LRB- hello , CostCo -RRB- . This Double Rich Chocolate tastes pretty good and is n't as chocolate-y as I would have expected , which is good for me . Like anything powder-based , you can add more water for less flavor and less water for more.The little spoon was kind of hard to find in the huge tub of powder , but I used chopsticks : -RSB-
 Using this product for years now , and to be honest , you really cant beat it for overall value . Optimum Nutrition is known for making quality products , and Its relatively cheap compared to other proteins out there , The Serving size is only 1 SCOOP compared to other products that require 2 scoops , which means your getting more value . It mixes very nicely with water or milk , and the taste is bearable with water , and pretty damn enjoyable with milk . As a college student its great to use when you have class and do n't have time to grab an in between snack ... just have a scoop of this ! You can use it in the morning , and mix it in with oatmeal for extra protein and vanilla flavor.The only bad thing i could possibly say , is that there is no hydro whey which gets into your system faster , and pro-complex , which contains all essential amino acids ... THAT BEING SAID , both of those products are considerably more expensive.Overall , after years of trying products , this is the best whey protein product for your money . Quality protein , for a good price .
 I have used Optimum Nutrition before and the quality is still very high ! Its the only protein that doesnt cause stomack problems . The price is the best I have found and with the auto re-order it is even a better deal !
 There are a lot of great reviews on this product already so read other ones . I 'm simply posting to say Rich chocolate -LRB- mixed with milk -RRB- simply tastes like CHOCOLATE MILK to me.I was a little nervous ordering 5 pounds after reading reviews saying it tastes bad but using the recommended amount of milk -LRB- 6-8oz -RRB- per scoop it tastes good .
 I 've tried my fair share of protein supplements , and ON 's Gold Standard 100 % Whey is the best by far . Not only does it supply you with high quality protein , it mixes better , tastes better -LRB- I prefer chocolate -RRB- , rinses easier , and has better value than any other protein shake I 've tried to date . A + for quality and cost .
 i ca n't believe how delicious it is ! i want to get healthy and feel better again and this is my first step towards that goal ! thank you amazon.com .
 Best tasting whey protein I 've ever tried ! Do n't skip meals and add this to your routine and you should see improvement .
 I 've been taking this protien on and off for about 5 years and still to this date have not found any whey protien that beats the value . You will find some other powders out there that will taste better , but if you experiment with the amount of water or milk you mix with this , i 'm sure you can find a taste you like . My goal for whey protien in a day is about 100 grams on training days . I train 5 days a week and this bag lasts me 2 months . So if you are on a budget , this is the best value out there .
 This was my first time buying Optimum Nutrition Whey Powder - I went with the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor and it is the tastiest protein I 've ever bought . It 's very sweet , but it does n't have an overpowering artificial taste . It is pretty good just by itself in water , and great in milk . It also mixes very easily . The price is also good . I see myself buying this again as soon as I run out .
 ON products are always reliable . That said , this tastes pretty good when mixed with just water . I love mint chocolate chip ice cream so the mint taste was n't over bearing or too minty at all . I took one star off BC it was difficult for me to mix it with other components like fruit with this flavor opposed to what I typically drink which is the extreme chocolate flavor . Also , I got used to the taste and could n't bare any longer BC of my inability to find good mixes that are low in calorie while tasting great .
 This is by far the best Protein out there ! Also some of the purest ! the taste is amazing even thought that 's not their main focus ! the protein to carb ratio is amazing ! also for the price you get a lot more serving than you do with other companies ! Ive had the chocolate , vanilla , cake batter , banana , french vanilla ! and they are all pretty good ! I loved the cake batter , but the chocolate I could make really good shakes out of it ! I also seen a lot more gains when adding this to my daily workout/cardio ! Like it says on the tub you must consume you body weight/more in protein threw quality proteins spread out threw the day to gain maximum gains ha ! I would definitely buy this/recommend it !
 Best protein drink I have ever had!A little to spendy ???? Was $ 39 now $ 59 ?????? Can i get a better deal next time I make a purchase ????
 I 've been using this product for the past 5 years or so and I 've always been satisfied . I paid a little more this time though because the previous vendor did not have it available . It 's still worth it .
 I have tried many different protein powders and this one is by far the best ! My goal is to gain muscle and lose fat and I have been into fitness for 7 years . I am looking for something low in carbs , sodium , and fat , with high quality ingredients that tastes decent . This product is the perfect combination . Tastes good and does not have added fillers or tons of artificial ingredients . The first ingredient is protein and that is important . I will be sticking with this product and highly recommend it .
 Using the blenderbottle it mixes well , never tried with spoon or any other method . Ive had some nasty tasting chocolate flavored protein before and this is decent with milk .
 This is the only protein I use , pound for price , I love it . As always they are always trying to increase the efficiency of the protein and avoid the waste , that 's where hydro whey comes in but entirely to exspensive to take daily
 I 've bought several varieties of Optimum Nutrition 's whey protein , and I can definitely say that it 's one of the best out there based on the results I saw when using it as a supplement . The powder also dissolves very well in liquids compared to other leading whey protein products and the taste is pretty darn good . That being said , I think some flavors are a little milder than others . The Double Rich Chocolate is one of the less flavorful in my opinion , so if you are looking for something sweeter , I would recommend Extreme Milk Chocolate . All in all , you really ca n't go wrong with ON .
 I find this tastes great and I mix it in water . But it comes with more sugar than I would like , but it 's trade off for the taste . I will use this in rotation with my other protein powders to keep things fresh .
 The chocolate tastes way better than any other brand I 've tried -LRB- and I have tried a bunch -RRB- . Mixes up really well too .
 The ON Gold Standard is amongst the best whey protein powders and they have a ton of flavors to suit just about anyone . It mixes very easily in just a shaker . I love coconut , so the choco/coconut is my favorite .
 I 've been buying this protein for over 6 years now and it never disappoints . High quality , awesome flavor and a nice high 80 % protein count . Do n't bother with anything else but this !!!
 I drink ON 's Rich Chocolate Whey protein mixed with Silk 's Chocolate Soy Milk every morning as a breakfast shake . It fills me up for quite some time and I 've even noticed an increase in stamina while completing both cardio and weight training . Just be sure to mix the appropriate powder to liquid ratio or you 're sure to have lumps regardless of how good of a shaker/blender you own . Good stuff .
 Chocolate is still the best but the tropical punch mixed with some other low calorie drink mix makes it taste good .
 This protein has the absolute best nutritional values on the market , plus great flavor and it mixes better than anything else I 've used . It 's by far my favorite protein powder . Unfortunately , it costs an arm and a leg , so I only buy it when it 's on sale or I can find a great deal on it . Up until about a year ago , it was half the price it is today , but Optimum jacked it up when they introduced their `` starter '' line of protein powder to make this stuff seem more premium . The lower costing stuff still tastes good , but it includes a lot of extra fat and carbs . Highly recommended if you can find it for a good price .
 I love Optimum Nutrition , all they make is really good and works ! This product has a really good taste and feels good . I would buy it again !
 Best tasting protein I 've ever had . Mix it with milk and you 're good to go . Also liked the double chocolate but this is better . Going to try chocolate mint next .
 Just what I expected to get . Good bargain as opposed to walking into a GNC and paying $ 75 or more .
 This is a very good product for me . I love iced coffee drinks and this comes close without all the fat and calories . Also , I 'm not a breakfast person , so this is a perfect morning drink for me , and I 'm not actually skipping breakfast .
 I have tried many different flavor and coffee is the best one so far because it taste very well with water !
 My husband swears by this brand of protien . We found it cheapest on Amazon so we have been buying it here . Great product if you know what you are doing and are serious about a work out routine .
 Protein is one of those necessities after a workout or during the day if you 're training . I 've tried numerous brands and I 've actually stuck with ON 's for quite a while . The profile is nice for a protein but the best part is , it 's delicious with just water ! Some protein powders , I find myself mixing with milk or making a shake to get the taste right . ON 's protein tastes pretty good with just water and in a shaker bottle , it 's so fine that it is easily mixed -- gone are the times of clumps of powder in the middle of the bottle.Overall , good buy and for me , I 've only tried chocolate and I 'm enjoying it !
 This Whey protein mixes VERY easily -LRB- without the need for a blender or shaker -RRB- and tastes great ! No issues , whatsoever !
 I 'm not in a lab breaking this stuff down , but I can tell it helps with recovery . Tastes pretty good , not much different than any other powder , though this one seems sweeter . Cheap and does n't make me fart any more than usual .
 mixes great compared to cheaper brands , I just use cold water in a shaker and I never have any problems with chunks . taste is also decent .
 Great tasting product . This is probably the best tasting gold standard flavor . Just got cookies and cream and its so nasty !
 I have been training with weights for many years , and protein supplementation has always been an important complement to that.In the old days , I got a large portion of my protein from cans of tuna I would carry -LRB- along with a can opener -RRB- in my lunchbox to work every day.The advent of protein powder changed that , and I have used several different brands of whey protein isolate over the last ten years , all of them of good quality.But I think that this Optimum Nutrition product is the best of them . I recently ordered my third 5-pound container of the Double Rich Chocolate flavor.The flavor is the best of any chocolate protein supplement I have ever had . The product mixes better than any other powder I have ever used , mixing completely and leaving no clumps -LRB- I always mix it , with ice-cold water , in a BlenderBottle , another excellent product which I highly recommend -RRB- . Additionally , when ordered from Amazon in the 5-pound container , this is an excellent value.I highly recommend this excellent product !
 It tastes great ! I will definitelly be purchasing this product again . The price is better than any of the grocery stores where I live .
 I have tried other proteins , from local stores and from walmart -LRB- 6 star -RRB- , but I have had very good results with ON . I have used one 5 lb package and now on my second one . Nothing has changed in my workouts except the protein . I have built muscle and my one rep max has gone up.I am 55 years old and have been lifting steady for a few years.I wish I would have had protein supplements when I was younger ... I am now trying Casein at bedtime ...
 This is my third protein from ON . They taste great with water and mixed very well -LRB- 15 seconds in shaker -RRB- . I experiment with mixing root beer with these for root beer float :D Would recommended to anyone .
 I think this is the best protein powder I 've tasted . It 's pretty close with Syntha-6 's chocolate , but I favor this one .
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition for few years . They are cost effective and still reliable brand.I wo n't say it tastes fantastic but it is above average for sure.Nice delivery time . Highly recommended !
 I was usingBSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder , Chocolate Milkshake , 2.91 Poundbefore trying this but decided to give it a shot because of the recommendation of several friends at the gym . ON is my new favorite brand and I will be buying this powder from now on . It has a good balance with low calories and fat . I usually stick with chocolate flavor , so I bought the Double Rich Chocolate . I mix my powder with just water 99 % of the time and rarely use milk . This actually tastes pretty good with just water . It does n't quite beat the taste of Syntha-6 , but for the lower calories / fat content , it 's worth a very slight sacrifice in the taste department .
 This chocolate flavor is bland and chalky but the shakes do n't upset my stomach and they help me recover from my more strenuous workouts . U may want to consider another flavor but ON has a great product .
 I bought the extreme milk chocolate flavor . Maybe I was expecting too much from all the positive reviews , but I 'm not crazy about the flavor . The nutrition facts are great and it mixes well with my blender ball .
 I 've had chocolate vanilla cream and now banana . Chocolate and banana are probably my favorite but it seems that banana mixes the best . Anyway i love Optimum Nutrition and will continue to buy their product
 This is my 2nd order of this product . I 'm very happy with this particular flavor - Double Rich Chocolate . What I like about it is that its not very sweet like the other -LRB- Extreme milk chocolate -RRB- . The protein content etc is the same as others and I wo n't be adding any information about that . I 'm not too much into building , so I have this shake on the days I go to the gym - 3-4 times a week . I would say its a very good post workout supplement.I recommend making a milkshake out of this . Here is a quick recipe
 I have purchased this protein for the last year and cant imagine going to something else.It mixes in water with no lumps , not thick so easy to swallow , and taste great.I have been seeing great results and quick recovery after drinking this vs. other protein supplements.I wanted to push to see if they can provide a subscribe and save on this product so for people like me that order a 5lb container every month can save a little money.I am sure there are many who would love to have this benefit.I have only tried Chocolate and Double Chocolate ... I never get sick of it . Like drinking chocolate milk .
 This is some great tasting protein that mixes very well . I use it with water or milk and it always tastes good . Has BCAA -LRB- Branch Chain Amino Acids -RRB- added in unlike some other proteins . Very happy overall and am on my 5th bottle . I find Double Chocolate too be the best flavor . Hated the Vanilla Ice Cream . Plain vanilla and strawberry flavors were pretty decent too .
 I have tried several brands and flavors of protein , this is BY FAR the best I 've tried . The taste is incredibly good , the texture -LRB- when mixed with a shaker cup -RRB- is amazingly smooth . Even mixing with a spoon is ok , but I recommend using the cup , you will not be disappointed . I 've tried both the Strawberry Banana and the Double Chocolate , and highly recommend both to anyone looking for a protein powder that will give you the results you are looking for . There are many more higher priced brands on the market , but none can compare to the value of ON . I will be buying more and have already turned several of my friends and former Marines on to this product .
 Hands down the best flavor is double chocolate but the ice cream vanilla flavor is more flexible . It 's very quick and easy to make a vanilla smoothie just pop 2 scoops into the blender with non fat milk add some blueberry 's -LRB- or your favorite fruit -RRB- a couple of ice cubes and that 's it . Another tasty way to drink the vanilla is to mix it with sunny delight . I keep both the double chocolate and ice cream vanilla in the house at all times .
 can never go wrong with 100 % whey . Great before and after workouts . Try the chocolate with milk half a banana and scoop of peanut butter and you will never go back
 O.N. 's Whey Gold Standard is the best out there . It 's pure , and it can be added easily to your other supplements . I would n't buy anything under 5lbs because your going to have to use a few scoops per day for any results . Do n't be fooled by many other Whey products that have fillers , like ones you can buy from Walmart . Amazon has the best price for the 5 pound container . Get it .
 This is by far the best whey I have found . The Double Chocolate flavor is good , but Rocky Road is superb . I like to mix a scoop of the Double Chocolate flavor whey with a scoop of Cookies and Cream flavored Casein.It mixes extremely well in a blender bottle . I usually mix it with skim milk , but water works too , although it does n't taste quite as good . The price is great compared to products with similar nutritional value .
 Taste is good , especially with milk . No lumps after shaking in container for 20 seconds . Goes does smooth , no chalk texture . Totally worth it .
 Taste is pretty good mixed with water . I have n't tried mixing it with milk yet . The taste and texture is sort of like vanilla jello pudding but a little more powdery . I 've heard some people complain about it clumping but it does n't seem to clump much more , if at all , than my whey protein .
 Comes in a great flavor selection , the container comes in very handy . I can reuse the container to stored the bag protein shake , i 've purchased.I purchased this item for my husband , he seems to enjoyed it . It 's a great for weight gain and muscle bodybuild.It has an easy measuring scoop . It 's also an excellent source of protein compare to eating raw eggs , or protein bars .
 Really great taste . My new favorite . I used to like chocolate malt but mocha cappuccino beats that hands down.I will definitely reorder this product.Arrival was faster than arrival date I was given .
 Title says it all : &#34; Great taste , reasonable price , quality ingredients &#34; I 've used many other whey powders , and I think this one may be tops on my list as far as all around whey goes . Hydrolyzed whey isolate is quicker digesting -LRB- perfect post-workout -RRB- but the price is through the roof , so I use it sparingly . Besides post-workout and bed-time , I use this whey throughout the day when I need a good quick quality shot of protein and aminos .
 So far I 've tried cookies and cream and mocha cappuccino . Both are good . Prior to Optimum Nutrition , I tried some brand from the pharmacy that tasted like artificial sweetener . The mocha cappuccino is awesome because it is n't overly sweet - plus coffee and chocolate , how can you go wrong ?
 Let 's face it : After a good workout WHEY protein is what you need - nothing else.This product is relatively reasonably priced -LRB- considering the ingredients -RRB- and its definitely worked for me . -LRB- I work out daily and take 3 protein shakes in addition to 4 meals a day ; I have tried pretty much ALL Whey proteins , but this one seems to give me the best results -RRB- To all insiders - no issues with excessive &#34; gas &#34; here ! : -RRB- Top product which I will continue to use .
 This is pretty much your basic vanilla protein . I like that the calorie count is actually pretty decent as protein powders go . Lately I 've been mixing with OJ to make a creamsicle kind of shake , yumm !
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , extreme milk chocolate is the best tasting protein drink I have ever had ! I highly recommend this product . I mixed it with water and with milk and both were excellent .
 Love this protein powder . I 've had a hard time finding a protein powder that did n't taste way too artificial , chalky or too sweet . This double chocolate is fantastic . I mix with regular milk or with almond milk in a shaker ball bottle , and it gets mixed easily . The extra protein has made my hunger/blood sugar levels so much better in the afternoon . Highly recommended !
 Good taste and it is helping me keep weight on . I just think that it is slightly over-priced . I ca n't tell the difference between this and cheaper products .
 I am a college student who lives with 5 other housemates . We trust ON for our standard product . It is cheap and effective .
 This flavor is by far the best we have tried . I eat unsweetened cereal in the mornings and put about a third of a scoop in my cereal - sounds weird - but you have to try it ! Great taste , and my kids love it too .
 Love the taste I love almost all ON products but this by far exceeded my expectations . mixes fantastic with almond milk even when not using a blender . taste great . i would def recommend .
 Been using gold standard for a while now . I find it good ; not too much filler . Easy to use , does n't clump . Taste 's good as well .
 One of the best tasting protein in my opinion . Easy to drink when mixed with water and does not taste bad at all .
 I ; ve been using this for about for weeks and it 's help me to lose belly fat when I started using it my body fat was at 27 % im only 5 ' 7 and now it 's down to 18 % I workout 3 times a week and before taking whey I was getting lower on the fat % be not as fast as with it . LOVE IT . ps get the Creatine .
 After 3 weeks using this product twice a week I got slight results . probably I could get better results if I follow the directions.Good protein !!
 I just got the Double Rich chocolate and I am drinking it right now . The flavor is fantastic . It is much better than any other protein shakes I have had . I will definitely buy this again and I ca n't wait to try the other flavors .
 I liked this , it mixed easy in a small blender -LRB- bullet -RRB- and the taste was chocolaty . I only mixed it with skim milk so I do n't know how it mixes with water .
 Great seller , super fast shipping and well packaged . The whey works great , been using it for a few weeks and already seeing results . highly recommended .
 Out of everything I 've tried and heard about from other people , this is the best whey on the market . It is the best tasting -LRB- at least the chocolate ; strawberry is okay and I 've not tried anything else -RRB- , it mixes with water and milk very easily , it is quite inexpensive , and you ca n't find it cheaper than on Amazon . If you 're into exercise nutrition and you know you 're going to eventually use ten pounds , just get the big bag . You 'll save money .
 The details : Good product , seems to work well -LRB- adds muscle bulk without sending your fat and cholesterol through the roof -RRB- . Mixes quickly and easily , even without a blender , with no nasty lumps.Tastes decent - you can drink it without adding other stuff to mask the flavor.Start with a 1 or 2 lb . container if you 've never had the flavor before . 5 lbs . takes a long time to drink unless you 're pounding it like crazy.I bought this after starting to lift weights regularly last year . I typically drink one shake -LRB- one scoop mixed with about 10 oz . of skim milk -RRB- every night . I mix it up in a blender bottleSundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall , Bluewhich works nicely and saves having to clean a blender daily . They describe it as `` instantized '' which sounds silly , but it 's actually milled much finer than other stuff , and in my blender bottle , 20 seconds of vigorous shaking makes it nice and smooth with no lumps at all.The powder is good . Seems to be nutritionally solid and I 've seen results using protein powder that I do n't think I would have otherwise . The double-rich chocolate flavor is decent - I would n't call it `` good '' per se , but it 's not bad . Ironically , it does n't taste as good as the cheap stuff they sell at Target and Walmart , but I suspect that 's actually a good sign . I have n't looked recently , but I think the cheap stuff has more sugar and less protein to make it more palatable , and that 's not what I 'm after . I 've also got a jar of vanilla cremeOptimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Double Rich Chocolate , 5 Poundwhich is ok . Not as good as the chocolate , but it 's easier to add things to the vanilla to change it up . Around the holidays , I put in a scoop of vanilla whey powder , 8-10 oz . of skim milk , a half teaspoon of cinammon , a little nutmeg , a little ground clove , and a tablespoon of eggnog - best eggnog-shake ever .
 Having bounced around a few times between this and EASs Whey protein powder products , I give a nod to Gold Standard . Its lower cholesterol content combined with less sugars , tips the scale , at least for me . I do have to pay attention to my cholesterol levels ; despite what some would have you believe , dietary cholesterol intake does influence those levels -LRB- it 's not simply related to saturated fats in many cases -RRB- . That said , EAS 's chocolate flavored whey protein powder has a slightly sweeter chocolate taste , something I actually prefer , but overall , Gold Standard 's the product I consume most often .
 This product deserves every gold medal it has won and then some ! I recently purchase some GNC Pro Perfomance protein , and I can not stand the taste . For close to the same price , I purchased the ON Whey Gold Standard , and what a difference ! The protein powder mixes much better , has better stats as far as BCAA 's and grams of protein per grams of powder . Definitely give this a try .
 Bought some of this to see if it mixes better than previous brands . I 'm happy to say it mixes very well in milk , a few stirs with a spoon mixes almost all of it completely . Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is very good , even my two year old grand daughter loves it . Safe bet .
 This is my 4th 5lb tub of ON Whey . I have tried Vanilla , Chocolate , Strawberry and Double Chocolate . Double Chocolate is by far the best tasting of the four . Not that the others were bad by any means , they are all great tasting . The Double Chocolate is just far more superior . It satisfies the sweet tooth while suppling you with great protein and BCAA 's .
 Great price for what you get . Much better than being forced to pay a high price at GNC after buying the Gold Card.Product works real well and tastes good .
 I am a college swimmer , so I 've seen my fair share of supplements get put through the paces in the weight room , on the field , and in the pool . I 've always been told that if I go whey , go Gold Standard . My friends were right . This easily is the best protein supplement I have used.The taste and texture are fantastic , and it apparently digests well -- there was no `` drunk '' effect often experienced by an overload of protein . I toss a scoop with a banana , milk , and a couple ice cubes into my magic bullet after practice and voila ! a perfect recovery drink.My only regret was not buying a bigger container !
 I thought this stuff was pretty nasty at first . Even after shaking it up well and diluting 1 scoop with 10 oz skim milk , it still had a bad aftertaste and I had to gulp it all down at once . After a couple of weeks , this stuff started to taste great , like real chocolate milk , which I know a lot about since that 's one of my favorite drinks . It 's creamy and delicious , I love it . The only thing is that you ca n't just shake it up and pour it into a glass . You have to keep shaking it every time you take a sip . If you choose to spoon stir it , it 's even worse - you have to stir like crazy , take a sip , and then stir again , otherwise it comes out of solution.I was once out of milk and had to drink this stuff in water . I 've never drank out of the toilet , but there is not a doubt in my mind that toilet water would be tastier than this stuff in water . Make sure your fridge is always stocked with milk .
 I got the strawberry flavor . It is uber tasty , and mixes well . My suggestion :8 oz Soy milk , or waterhandful of blueberries , and a small bit o ice . . awesome shake for anytime .
 For quality and quantity you get the best blended protein you can buy that mixes easy , does n't cause stomach discomfort or excessive gas if you are the normal individual who has no food allergies . I will continue to buy optimum nutrition as it suits my likings and budget .
 The flavor is nothiong spectacular . in fact , with water , it 's close to terrible . I think im getting used to it but at the beginning it was very bad . With milk the flavor is OK though . I have only been using it for a couple weeks now -LRB- 3maybe -RRB- and during this time i have gained a lot of mass . I cant say it is solely becaus eof it but it has helped me maintain a very good macros ratio . My protein intake has gone up . Now i am not losing any weight but it is because im getting a lot more protein and am building more muscle mass than before . The product seems to be very good , but i honestly dont have enough time with it as to give a proper rating about its mass building capabilities . It seems to best protein bang for the buck though . 4 stars because i didnt like the falvor too much . I understand the extreme milk chocolate is better than this -LRB- double rich chocolate -RRB- but it doesnt come in 10pounds bag.EDIT . March 25th. , 2008 . This is my second review of the product . I gave 4 stars to the previous one . NOw i feel like upgrading to 5 stars . It was the double rich chocolate flavor . I think the product is very good even when i dont have any reference to compare , since i havent tried any other brand . I ordered along with this whey , a syntha-6 and a ON casein protein . They are both supposed to be great products , with syntha6 being considered the best tasting protein power out there . Some say Muscle milk is better , but apparently is a close race.I felt the need to do another review because of the great taste of the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor and because having taken 10.37 pounds of the product i feel i could definitely comment . After being in a very long diet I have lost more than 65pounds in exactly a year . Even on a caloric deficit Ive managed to build a few pounds of lean mass and I must say I am convinced than supplementing with this product has been a key factor in this success . After I started taking it i noticed a difference in the time i needed to recuperate from workouts and aybe it was just timing but I am looking more muscular than ever . Also , the truth is that I wasnt having near close to enoguh protein before i started using this product , so what i mean is that this is just protein , and it will make your life much easier when it comes to proper dieting and having enough protein every day.If you are concerned about taste , you cant go wrong with the Vanilla Ice cream one . It is so good that after my first cup of milk with 1.5 scoops I felt the need to come here and share . With water it is not good , but what is it ? Even nesquick taste like crap with water ... it is a great product . Remember , have at least one gram per pound of bodyweight ... do that and it will be really hard for you to be on calorie surplus , then you 'll lose fat .
 I felt stronger once i drank these shakes for about a week . Also leaner , great product , probably better than those nitro-tech , and the other whey gnc products . Great buy , absolutely recommended !!!
 The price is fantastic , the taste is great , it dissolves well , and this is the best part
 I have tried numerous protein drinks , either owning or tasting from friends . I must say this is definitely one of the better tasting ones . However , I would not recommend it with water . It tastes more natural with milk and is more tolerable to even the most picky person . I would probably recommend this flavor over any of the other Gold Standard products . The only downside is that this product apparently uses artificial sweeteners , which have been known to cause health products in the long term . Hope this was helpful !
 I 've been taking this stuff for approximately a week . It does help me meet my protein intake goal and it tastes pretty decent.I do n't like milk so I drink it with a small bottle of blue Gatorade followed by a glass of water . If you want to just mix this with water ... be warned . It does not taste very good in water.Again , with some gatorade this is very drinkable .
 taste great , taste even better if you add 3 spoon fulls of peanut butter to it .
 Great source of protein , and not bad tasting . I mix it with fruit and my boyfriend , who is a `` super hard gainer '' mixes it with vanilla icecream for the added calories and loves it .
 This product is the best for me . less calories and very good taste . I know users need someone tell them about the results from using this product , but it 's really depends on the way that you 're diet and exercise .
 It seems Optimum Nutrition -LRB- ON -RRB- has fixed its prices across all vendors at $ 52.99 for 5 lbs . So now you ca n't even shop around for it . I know all protein has gone up in price do the fact that big food companies are now in the market to add this protein to their products . I must concede ON , probably has the best pure protein on the market . However , their higher prices has forced me into shopping other brands . ON is 79 % protein per serving , the highest of any I have calculated . But others come in at 74 % and 73 % . That 's only about 7 % more protein for about 20 % more in price . It 's just not worth it to me . I wish they would at least get back into the subscription program . That would get me back on board 100 % .
 I 'm a protein fiend . I love protein , especially whey , and have tried many different products . For the past year or so , I was quite happy with the whey protein sold at my local Meijer grocery store ... then all of the sudden they changed the formula and it now tastes horrible , like there 's soap in it.This led me to search for a new protein powder . So I searched Amazon to see what had the best reviews , and ordered Whey Gold Standard , Double Rich Chocolate , 5 Pound jar . Thanks to Amazon Prime -LRB- which I absolutely LOVE -RRB- , I had the jar two days later.Let me say this , THIS IS THE BEST FRIGGIN PROTEIN POWDER I 'VE EVER TASTED !!! Ridiculously good . Could not be more pleased . Thank you to the manufacturer for creating such an awesome product . It 's easy to mix , has 25 grams of protein , only one gram of fat , and the taste is fantastic .
 There are a billion reviews on the product as a whole . Obviously , it 's completely awesome , great calories to protein ratio , mixes really easily , etc. I usually only look at the reviews now if I 'm feeling experimental and want to try a new flavor , so I thought I 'd leave a review on a less common one.I just received the Mocha Cappuccino and it 's great . Not a super strong coffee flavor , but a hint of that plus the usual chocolate . I actually typically mix instant coffee with mine in the morning .
 If your goal is to increase muscle mass this is a great retail product . Mixes well . Tastes great -LRB- I 've tried only chocolate -RRB- . ON produced some nice visually noticeable muscle gains I honestly was not really expecting.Over past 11 years I 've purchased dozens and dozens of brands of protein powders . Some in bulk barrel sizes and others in very pricey individualized ` designer ' packets . And everything in between . I figured as long as I stayed away from fillers and excessive fat and excessive sugar and excessive carbs , protein was protein.How wrong I was.None had ever made me say ` holy crap ! this stuff really works ! ' as did ON protein . I 'm no bodybuilder . Just a fitness enthusiast . So my results may be different than yours if you 've been at this longer or with more intensity than me i.e. pro level lifter . Otherwise I think you 'd be happy with the results.Oh . Out of curiosity I 've switched the last two months to a cheaper off-the-shelf product available at a mass mega retailer , to make sure gains were not a coincidence from something else.I 've gotten flabby . No joke . Nowhere lean or as cut as I looked as when using ON . Visibly impressive muscle gains are nowhere near where they were when using this ON product . And yea , I first ordered this from Amazon to try it out when I saw an Amazon ad for protein powder - I guess that 's what I get for adding fitness stuff to my wish list : pCons
 This is the best protein powder ever . More protein grams , less calories , and less carbs than all the others I 've tried . Tastes great too !
 Do n't know about the other flavors , but the Double Rich Chocolate tastes pretty good . With milk that is . I have tried it with water , and it 's drinkable , but not at all pleasant . As for using a spoon to mix it , you 'll find it requires quite a bit of stirring and you 'd still be left with small chunks of powder that could n't dissolve . A shaker is therefore essential , and I think it 's more practical than an electric mixer , unless you 're mixing in chunks of fruit.Lastly , there 's a plastic scoop in there ! Mine came with the scoop buried inside the powder and I had to dig in to get it . I did n't know about it until a friend told me , so just wanted to share this info if you ever receive yours with no visible scoop inside .
 I 've been using Optimum Nutrition 's Whey Protein Powder for a long time and beyond any doubt they are of top quality in the market . It contains a blend of whey protein isolate and concentrate . Each serving contains a high percentage of protein -LRB- 24g -RRB- , low cholesterol and carbohydrates.I have researched both in price and gains , it really kicks muscle growth and Amzaon is the only place where this product is availablle at its competitive price . Amazon ships this product free of charge.Overall , this is the best product whether you are trying to get lean , build muscle or just maintaining your body weight . I have found O.N the only company that has a wide range of exciting new flavors to choose from which are also plesant tasting.Amazon is my favorite shopping place with excellent prices and on time shipping !
 Have used other Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey . This does the job . I 've noticed considerable gains in lean muscle after use . The only issue I have is how over-the-top sweet this is . I prefer the Double Chocolate over the Vanilla
 This is an excellent product in all aspects.BTW , Amazon is great with its commitment , quality as well as shipping etc.Keep it up !
 Hi this stuff is good to balance my protein intake . It 's low on carb , fat and sodium . Watch the cholesterol though . I do n't use it everyday but probably 75 % . It can taste a bit chalky and metallic . I use it with water mostly and I whip it with an aerolatte -LRB- coffee frother -RRB- . I find the taste is better with really cold water . It can also be made with a shaker . Most people make a shake with added frozen fruit and any kind of milk . I do n't like to drag out the blender .
 Good flavor , even with water . Needs thorough mixing , I use a whisk ball shaker . Good protein to calorie ratio and priced comparatively to other online retailers . The scoop got buried in the powder during shipping and is a pain to dig out -LRB- use kitchen tongs -RRB- . Why not just attach it to the lid ? And why is a serving labeled one rounded scoop ? Is it that hard to make your scoop a little bigger ? It is easy to spill powder off a rounded scoop when transferring to a bottle . Anyways , a few stupid packaging flaws , but the powder itself is great and is visibly making a difference !
 Started on Optimum Nutrition when I began to take protein supplements . Changed to a GNC-espoused brand when I could n't find ON at my local grocery store . When I found ON Whey on Amazon , I knew it was an easy decision because of Amazon 's great service , the quality difference between ON and the GNC-pimped brand , and the price . I 'm sticking with Amazon for my supplement needs .
 Optimum Nutrition is a reputable and well respected company . This product is very affordable compared to other protein supplements . It is high in quality , containing 24 grams of protein out of 29 grams -LRB- 5.5 g of which is BCAAs -RRB- , and will satisfy your protein needs . This product has an acceptional taste . Mixing this product is easy and conveniet . I recommend this product to anyone whose purpose is to add in additional protein content or for weight training . Overall this product is a great protein supplemnt for its price , quality , and quantity . Great buy !
 well ... is my second buy from vitamin shoppe and It was sucessfull . It was fast , too fast ... 3 days.I recomend this page to buy .
 Excellent product ! My son introduced me to this brand of whey and it tastes great as well .
 This product is fantastic plus I can re-use the 5lb container for refilling it with Whey Protein .
 This is high quality protein that is more cost-effective than any other brand out there . If you like to get more protein for your buck use optimum nutrition exclusively and buy on Amazon .
 This is an absolute steal at this price . Much cheaper than you will find in stores . And it tastes great ! In fact , it tastes like Cocoa Krispies , LOL . So , if you like them , then you 'll like the taste of this shake .
 Protein is expensive , and this is the first time I 've bought in bulk . I do n't regret it , as it did n't cost much more than a 5lb jug at GNC but will last twice as long .
 I am never disappointed by optimum nutrition products , and their protein is always a great buy at a great price .
 I first bought the vanillia version , However , the taste of is n't really that great and small protein bits can be annoying . However , I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate , and is something you can really enjoy . But in the end I guess it 's all about personal taste , it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n ' cream but not the chocolate . I first bought the Cookies N ' Creavanilla version of the Optimum whey . It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time , and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it .
 Optimum Nutrition 's Gold Standard line is one of the best-tasting and easily-dissolved protein powders I 've tried . It comes in a variety of flavors so there should be something for everyone - but I encourage sampling as not every flavor is right for every person . The nutrition label says it all for this powder ; High protein , low-carb and very little fat makes this a perfect supplementary protein source.Whether you 're an amateur lifter , pro body builder , or just an average Joe it is likely that your eating habits are heavily carb-centric . To a lifter or dieter , the addition of supplementary protein to your overall caloric load will help keep you satisfied as well as foster any lean-muscle adaptations -LRB- whether you 're after endurance , `` toning '' , or size gains -RRB- you may be after . Personally , I use this product as a staple in my diet to offset the cost -LRB- in both price and preparation time -RRB- of my food budget and it is integral to my weight loss and muscle building goals & progress to date.If you 're tired of clumpy tasteless powders , give ON 's whey a shot ! You 'll be glad you did.Some other consumption ideas : -LRB- note
 The taste was not bad when I mixed it with coffee . The quality of the protein seemed good and carried me through much as a light breakfast would .
 This is the first time I 've tried this product , and it is excellent . I especially like the solubility of the mix in milk , soymilk , and water .
 This product is very good for those that are on a budget . It cheap and is effective for someone who is either beginning a supplement program or for those who are trying to maintain gains or leanness . I do n't believe this product would help hardcore bodybuilders and those looking for major gains quickly . As for my personal experience with this product . I noticed that I got a bit leaner with taking this product and my strength increased a little from a month ago . Granted have been working out pretty hard to get ready for the summer season ... so that does also play in as a factor . But I would say the ON whey has help a bit in my quest for the `` beach body . '' I would also say that combined with ON Casein in a supplement program ON Whey has help me recover a bit quicker after a hard work out that I would otherwise . That is an important factor for a somewhat older guy -LRB- late 30 's . -RRB- I like to get out of bed in the morning and not feel like I just work out a hour ago . So high marks in aiding recovery.Mixing and taste . On Whey is easy to mix with all types of methods . Whether it with blender , shaker , even with a spoon , I had no problem with mixing it . As for taste and consistency . It 's very light when mixed with water and taste pretty good with it . Though it does leave a slightly funny after taste . But I prefer a heavier consistency . so I mix it with milk . And as far as I 'm concerned it tastes great with no after taste.So over all a good solid product . The only reason why I do n't give it 5 stars is that this product does not produce big gains in strength or in size .
 Got a good deal on it , its popular , tastes good , and was shipped and arrived on time . Thanks !
 I GAINED 15 KG , IN A 2 MOUNTHS . MAKING EXERCISE AND MIXING WITH CREATIN AND GLUTAMINE.EXCELENT . AND AT BEST PRICE
 I wanted to get some more protein into my diet because I started lifting weights more regularly . Being a woman , I did n't want a product aimed at massive weight gain ; I just needed an easy way to get some extra protein . This powder is so delicious I add it into everything . The price is very good too . I recommend it .
 I received the package in the appropriate amount of time . The product was great and will definitely buy again . Wonderful flavor as well !
 My amazon shipment arrived recently and I am happy with the purchase . The vanilla ice-cream flavor tastes good and the powder mixes out very well . No lumps or cakes while drinking or in the bottom of glass . Cant speak to effect on my body yet as its early days still but happy with the buy . Beware though the 5lb bottle is humongous ! It 's 11 inches tall and 8 inches wide , takes up the space of a whole appliance on my counter ! No regrets still .
 I thought that the price was reasonable and it was a great source of protein . The flavor is iffy but it does the job . I will probably try some other brands too and might end up back at this one again .
 Great source of protein , tastes fabulous ! I take 8 ounces of soy milk and mix with protein powder for breakfast . Easy , simple , taste great and holds me till lunch !
 This is a good powder . It is tasty and it dissolves quite well in a shaker bottle . Stirring it in a glass it clumped up a little , not as bad as most , but I 've never encountered a powder that mixes completely by stirring it . I usually put this in a blender with a banana , skim milk and ice cubes , tastes great .
 Tastes great when mixed with milk , plenty of protein and low calories . Seems to be working . Only negative is as with most protein powders it likes to clump up and not mix in fully .
 The product tastes great and mixes well and is an excellent value with free shipping and a `` subscribe and save '' subscription ... only about $ 35 .
 As a first-thing-in-the-morning , pre - and post-workout supplement , Optimum Nutrition 's 100 % Whey Gold Standard is hard to beat . And , given its quality and effectiveness , it 's the best protein powder one can spend their money on.Before I became a regular user , I 'd read a lot of reviews that said this product was great , and I could n't agree more with those reviewers once I tried it out for myself.And though I first started to take it only as a post-workout supplement , I 've recently found that combining it with plain and strong black coffee -LRB- without sugar -RRB- about 20 minutes before a training session can work wonders for me when it comes to endurance and stamina . In my opinion , it even beats supplements that are to be taken specifically pre-workout in terms of effectiveness.I usually try to keep my weight-training sessions within a one-hour time limit , and if I start training without having taken my scoop of ON Whey , it 's a lot harder to keep things going with mad intensity -LRB- as I like to train -RRB- after the first 30 minutes . If I do take it , then I can rest assured that there 's going to be no crash or burn-outs before I 'm done with all of my sets .
 I was unlucky enough to order strawberry . Anyone ever have pepto bismol ? That will be the exact flavor and taste . I 've asked several friends what this smelled like , and they came up with the exact same answer . After a while I had to force my friends to help finish the rest of my powder . The other flavors are awesome , and it 's a great product which is why I gave it four stars instead of one .
 Very happy about fast arrival of the product . Will continue to order more protein supply . Thanks
 This is the only Whey product I 've used . I purchased it based on the amazon ratings and review comments.It 's got a great flavor and mixes well . I usually mix mine with a banana and chocolate -LRB- yup , I 'm a chocoholic , he he -RRB- soy milk . It is creamy which is good . It 's not watery , nor like a thick shake , so I say ` creamy ' . As I said the whey mixes well , does clump or anything . And , the flavor is good , but not perfect . There is a slight , very slight , after taste which is just a tad bitter . But , as I said , this is the first whey I 've ever tried , so all of them may have an after taste.I would buy this again . But , may try vanilla . I tried mixing blueberries and strawberries with the whey and regular lite milk and I could not taste the berries . I can taste the banana with the double chocolate though , so it works for me . I have heard about adding orange juice to it , and that it is great like that , but have yet to try it .
 Just got this a day ago . So far so good , but a word of advice
 This protein is amazing , period . I 've always shopped around for the best and cheapest protein and this is by far the greatest in both area 's . Aside from some sites that do reduced price for buying large orders O.N. 's 10lb bag is the best deal out there -LRB- and to beat it 's price you have to order 4-5 months worth of protein from the other sites anyway . -RRB- It even beats out any deal 's with GNC 's ridiculous gold card offers . Also the savings increase if you use Amazon 's subscribed shipping -LRB- which I highly recommend to anyone planning to use this for more than a one or two month period , -RRB- which puts it as the best deal I 've ever seen on protein so far.On top of being exceptionally cost efficient it has one of the highest protein per serving ratio 's I have seen on any protein . 155 Servings at 24g per serving , it end 's up coming out to 55 cents a serving if you get the super saving shipping . There are other protein 's that will boast 45-50 cents per serving but most of them only offer 18-22g of protein per serving , so do not be fooled and always compare price per serving to protein per serving.Hand 's down the best protein I have been able to find in extensive bargain shopping , highly recommended .
 I ca n't really add anything more than what has already been written . I feel the flavor of the double rich chocolate is good enough . Not as good as a shake , but who would expect that ? Definitely a good way to get the needed protien needed to grow muscle . I also do n't get the `` gas '' attacks that I sometimes get from other protein that I have tried .
 I do n't buy this anymore because the price has gone up so much . If that does n't bother you then I highly recommend this product for the quality . Mixing the chocloate in a glass of milk tastes great .
 I 've used this product for years . A little cold water from my Britta , a blender and 30 seconds and I 'm getting a quick , balanced and healthy meal . Its now part of my every day regimen.I 'm surprised that others that I 've recommended this product to for a part of an ` Earthquake Emergency Kit ' have also picked it up as part of their daily diet.Not chalky or chemical tasting it goes down as smooth as chocolate milk .
 By far the BEST protein out there ! It dissolves completely ! I have had my range of protein products and this one takes the cake ! It tastes delicious without over powering you , there are no protein chunks , and you can definitely see the results ! I take 1-2 scoops a day after a work-out and I love it ! I just bought a 5lb bottle because I go through it like crazy ! I have never had a protein shake like this one ! After my college suite-mates tried 100 % Whey Gold Standard , they all decided to switch from theirs to mine ! . A + and a definitely recommendation !
 it was a great deal and a great product give it a try not the best taste but people do say `` if it does not taste good its good for you '' and i feel like im geting good results with this product fast recovery after my workout
 Optimum nutrition is # 1 for a reason . I 've tried all their flavors , all of them are great , but this is by far my favorite
 I couldnt be happier and I will buy again . The whey settles well and doesnt clump . also , for the price ill have enough whey for an entire quarter at school and thats wonderful
 Liked the flavor , plus itmixes really well with the milk , not like other kinds that stay at the top and wont mix
 I got the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor which reminds me of the astronaut dehydrated ice cream flavor type of smell but it mixes well with unsweetened almond milk -LRB- reducing lactose -RRB- . It is not too sweet and the aftertaste is minimal . I chose this brand since it had less ingredients than the others and less artificial flavorings .
 Very good , high quality blend of protein . Mixes easily with a spoon , and tastes great . Has helped me achieve a leaner build .
 I 've been using this for over a year now in the morning and after my workouts . After trying many other protein powders , Optimum Nutrition seems to always been on top as far as price , taste , mixture and consistency goes . I 'm no expert , but as far as I know this is as good of quality protein you will get for the money.I wish the subscribe and save still worked though I liked that .
 I found no downside to this product . I was concerned from reviews that the flavor would n't be so good but I think it tastes like chocolate milk should taste . I mix it with a handheld blender so no problem . This has become a permanent part of my daily diet .
 the protein is great but when i got this the bag had a hole in it and some of the powder spilled out into the box . luckily i had some empty protein jugs laying around so i just filled them up . amazon really needs to be more careful with the way they package stuff
 This has been the best protein I 've tried by far . The flavors are -LRB- mostly -RRB- fantastic , the profile is spot on , and it 's one of the few that does n't taste bad when mixed with plain water . My only complaint would be consistency , about 10 % of the time I get tubs that are `` clumpier '' and have some trouble mixing in a blender bottle although a quick hit with a wand blender takes care of those rare orders . It 's also one of the few proteins I 've found I can drink during training without getting a heavy or bloated feeling . Mix in a little peanut butter or maybe some berries and banana and you also get a good meal replacement shake .
 This protein is the best I have ever tried . It mixes well with water and a few shakes . The Double Rich Chocolate has a great taste -LRB- and I hate chocolate -RRB- . I 've seen some impressive gains using this . I 'm sure there might be other proteins that are great but my search is over as I have founds my favorite .
 I bought this just recently and used it only once or twice , but the effects were significantly noticeable right off the bat . I usually forgo eating dinner then jog , followed by a light workout -LRB- pushup , pullups , situps , etc -RRB- , and it kept me going even after I usually stop . So much so that even though my muscles were exhausted , my energy was still going strong and I wanted to keep going only after a short break . What was really amazing was that , I was not sore the following day ! The flavor is not too bad . It almost takes like watered down Yoohoo , but not as sweet . There are tons of smoothie recipes online so taste wo n't be too much of a problem.But enough about the product , I want to commend Amazon for their great service in this review and feedback . . I wo n't get into the specifics but Amazon went above and beyond with their customer service and gained my loyalty for life . If every company had such outstanding service as Amazon displayed with me , then Consumer Affairs would be out of business .
 Love love love this protein powder . It 's delicious and mixes well . Optimum nutrition is my favorite !!! Mixes GREAT in oatmeal !!!! Soo yummy !
 Just received my 10 pound bag of vanilla ice cream gold standard whey . First things first , The bag weighs a little over 10 pounds and it is FILLED to the brim ! that seems to be a major problem with protein lately is a huge tub only filled up half way , well that is not the case here.Taste , I love this stuff because its easy to slam down quick and in my opinion that is what a protein shake is for . I have some Amplified Wheybolic Extreme from gnc that I had to buy in a pinch a couple weeks ago and I can honestly say the Gold Standard stuff is unbelievably better ... not only taste but how it mixes up and the serving size , I do n't even wan na mention the cost lol , think the 3lb gnc wheybolic cost around $ 60 and I payed $ 97 for 10 POUNDS of gold standard ... Needless to say I have found my go-to for protein now !
 I 've used several different brands of whey protein over the past few years and I must say that a lot of the advertising is just to get you to spend the extra $ 20 or so that most brands charge . Sure , people might have their opinions or their favorites and I wo n't knock that at all but from my personal expierence I have gotten great results off this product , just as much if not more than I have any other brand of whey protein and it 's one of the cheapest out of all of them so I have been using this consistently for about a year now . `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it '' . This product works great , once you figure out a flavor you like -LRB- not all taste good -RRB- I highly suggest and reccomend this product to anyone that is looking for an excellent whey protein supplement !
 I love this stuff , this tastes just like super sugary chocolate milk and mixes really well . Wish I had this as a kid
 I have been taking this supplement for about a month now . It is too soon to really tell the results , but the taste is good . It is even better if you mix it with a no fat milk . I will be buying again .
 Good whey protein for great price . Tastes pretty good . Mixes pretty good in a shaker cup . Uses mostly whey isolate , which is good . No complaints .
 First time protein buyer , this product recommended by many friends . Great price , great taste , great value . Would recommend to anyone
 This product is great ! I bought the strawberry flavor , and it tastes great ! Amazon delivered it really quick . This brand of whey protein is a lot better than any other brands out there . In my opinion , this product works the best for me , but I think some people may prefer others . This product is affordable , it 's not very cheap or very expensive . If you are a serious weight lifter , I would recommend buying a bigger package , and save more money .
 Great product . It arrives fast and works great . I would like to see Amazon to carry a wide variety of supplements !
 I have been using Optimum for a few years and love it . The combination of proteins in their specific order are of great use for someone trying to gain lean muscle mass . The ten lb bag is convenience for those using it often . I personally have two scoops three times per day . This gets me 144 grams of protein in addition to the foods I eat.I recommend purchasing 2 5 lb tubs of this product and use the empty containers to use instead of the bag itself . The bag tends to be messy when using so i immediately empty it into the tubs.Great tasting and mixes easily with a blender cup .
 Although I have not tried that many protein shakes out there -LRB- only about a handful -RRB- , this tastes the best . Even with water , it 's drinkable , and with milk , it 's actually amazing . Of course , I doubt people would sit there sipping this and savor the art in its taste , but it 's better than many other shakes out there . Artificial sugar . I personally prefer real sugar , but you ca n't really find a good protein shake with real sugar .
 it taste good , i take it before and after workoutsit 's more delicious with milk , but still good with waterWaleed
 I 've seen some mixed reviews on the taste of this flavor , but I find it quite good , reminiscent of darker chocolate rather than the super sweet stuff like a regular hershey 's bar.This whey mixes well -LRB- as I 'd expect from ON -RRB- with no clumping , no hint of harsh aftertaste.It 's a little more expensive than whey you might get at a local big-box store , it 's true , but a premium for mixability , a great selection of flavors , and a solid nutritional profile is worth it .
 This is a great supplement if you are non-allergic of whey product and require a supplement after surgery . I have taken this product for three weeks and am pleased with the results .
 I bought the 5 pound double chocolate flavor . I have it every morning with low-fat milk . The taste is very acceptable in my opinion .
 No Doubt this item is THE BEST for beginner or Intense workout.I have suggested this to my friends and they went crazy with the performance of this Whey . Quality and Taste surpasses any other protein supplement available in market.And result is simply WOW.Use it and have fun !!
 This is my default protein . No gas or runs , a high quality blend , and its cheap for the quality level . This is a great protein shake , and the chocolate mint flavor is really good , and probably my favorite .
 Got this today after like 8 days after placing the order . I did pick the free shipping option though in case you 're thinking of doing the same.it came sealed in plastic so I knew it had n't been previously openeed . After i did some weight lifting , i opened the bottle . I had to dig a little for the scooper.I use to drink a different brand which was a vanilla flavor which I enjoyed . I got the strawberry flavor of this , and I can say it is actually better.I have read reviews of people saying it 's gross , which I dont really get . It could be a relative thing I guess in the sense that I have done my fair share of drinking , and what anyone knows who 's done shots of 80 + proof hard liquor is that just about everything else is tasty , or at least tolorable after that.I do n't think this is just tolorable , it is enjoyable ; to me at least.I would recommend this for the flavor , I have yet to see any results from it ; today was my first though so I do n't expect anything for at least a few weeks .
 After the first day i could tell a big difference in my recovery . I have been taking this while doing p90 for 2 weeks and feel like it has speed up my metabolism . The taste is great . It taste just like the powdered hot chocolate mix . I drink one in the morning with milk and one post workout with water . There are other brands i have tried and they all have a medicine taste this product does not at all . it cost a little more than other brands but the taste is well worth it .
 This is the best tasting one that I have tried.It is a bit thin , I use about 5 ounces for 2 scoops -LRB- the scoop seems a bit smaller than the other -RRB- . It does not fill me up , nor provide energy , like some of the others did . But the smaller scoop gives more servings per container and good amount of protein per scoop.It is nice because it does not make me gassy like all the others did . Especially good for when I need a break from the others to reduce this .
 I was really surprised at how well this tasted . I do n't normally care for shakes like this , but this tastes like a milkshake would - no chalky taste like other products .
 This is my go to protein for the great mix of price and quality . The taste is n't too too strong and mixes very well into smoothies and water . I generally use it two - three times a day 4-5 times a week . I 've been noticing gains with the protein and I think that it is a solid entry level protein . There are proteins out there with higher quality protein -LRB- i.e. whey isolate as opposed to whey concentrate -RRB- but they are much pricier . This option is reliable and tasty ... but not delicious -LRB- -1 star -RRB-
 GOLD , this product is absolute gold . The last few times I 've used this product i have been lazy to buy when the product is empty . I notice that when im out of product and working out , my recovery takes longer , but not only that , my body is more sore the next day . If you use this product as intended -LRB- use with milk , better for you , and helps bones recover -RRB- , then you will see the results i do . And if their is any reviewer you should be listening to , it 's me . I have been on the skinny side my whole life , and this product still works wonders with me . It does n't matter how big or small you are , this product is for everybody . DO NOT buy the serious mass , it 's a waste of money , this is where your money should be invested .
 I like this a lot . This tastes very good , and its a pretty reasonable price . I think I found my new base for comparison .
 This is a good supplement and has a good taste . I 've gained about 4 pounds in about 4 months , hard work but not unbearable with a good tasting protein powder .
 ON provides great products , and their 100 % Whey is no exception . Low in fat and calories ; high in protein , BCAAs and taste . ON 's 100 % Whey mixes easily with no clumping . This is the only protein for me .
 Ive tried lots of protein but this stuff tastes the best and works the best , theres no substute , this stuff works for whatever your goals are
 I wo n't try to add to the praise this product has already received , except to say I Have tried several others over the years and still end up coming back to what I consider the best . The delivered ` subscription ' pricing makes it even more attractive . Am not using this because I am a Body Builder , but age , diet , and activity level have made a supplement like this very valuable , plus it tastes great . The only other flavor I have used is Vanilla , good , but still come back to this .
 I love this whey protein because it is so easy to mix and it has a light feeling in your mouth . ON is the way to go !
 Been using it for close to a month and and man , these are great stuff!i 'll keep it short and simple . I 'm 5 ' 6 135lbs . Im no some hardcore lifter . but this stuff helps me get my protein and it tastes great ! what more could i want ? This is for Double Rich chocolate though . I dont know how the other ones are going to taste ...
 The protein is very good in terms of performance . It mixes very well and is good for putting on muscular weight . As for taste it is n't to die for but it certainly is good enough for me to go through the whole jar without feeling sick . Very good price and good quality protein . Great shipping from Amazon .
 Great protein with lean muscle gains . I would advise only using this if you 're doing CrossFit or HIGH INTENSITY b/c of the extra carbs .
 This whey is by far the best ive tasted , the double chocolate is really good , and thats with water cause im at a low carb diet IMAGINE with wilk the taste would be way better
 I have tried a few different whey protein supplements out on the market and this is the one that I keep coming back to . I think it is one of the better tasting ones out there . I did like BSN 's whey protien to supplement and thought it tasted better than this but for the price and the amount of protein you get per scoop , you can not beat this product . Optimum nutrition mixes so easily and the double chocolate , rocky road , and cookies n ' cream taste wonderful . I usually just throw some water in a cup and add a scoop and stir it . Mixes well and barely leaves any clumps . Also , the supplement is very effective when it comes to reaching your goals . I usually go to the gym about 3-4 times a weak and lift fairly heavy . The gains with this supplement have been great . It 's not a miracle supplement but it sure does what it is supposed to in terms of fueling your stressed out muscles with fast protein and BCAA 's . Also makes a great snack for when you are hungry or can not get actual protein from food . Low and fat and calories .
 I am not a huge body builder and I only use this stuff for post-workout , NOT meal replacement ! I mix it with milk and it is freaking delicious . With water , it is not the best at all , but it is `` swallow-able '' . I have found good muscle build with this , I go for definition and tone , not mass bulk . This is the second time I bought this product and I am not disappointed with it , it has good flavor .
 I was n't sure how well the protein would absorb but evidence suggests to me that the protein is actually getting absorbed in my body . I donate plasma twice a week for money and they measure the protein levels in your body each time . If your protein levels are n't high enough you ca n't donate . I would frequently be turned away for low protein levels . After using this product regularly my protein levels have always been high enough , so it seems to work .
 Ca n't say enough about this stuff - it has an exceptional amount of protein and takes delicious . And I do n't mean delicious for a protein shake , I mean delicious for any kind of drink . It simply tastes great . Highly recommended for those that do n't want to choke down their shakes anymore .
 Other , more knowledgeable , reviewers have already expounded on the health/training merits of this product and alternatives so I 'll leave it at this
 This is the best tasting and most affordable whey protein product I 've found . I do n't really care about the bodybuilding thing any longer , but I like to supplement my protein intake and this is a nice sort of energy shot in the morning . On days when I ca n't make time for breakfast , this keeps me from getting light headed without stuffing myself with empty calories.It is artificially sweetened , but not over-the-top . Likely just enough to overcome the bitterness of the cocoa.I generally put a scoop in with cold coffee from the fridge and a splash of soy milk . If I do an intense weight session , I 'll have another scoop either in almond milk or in the coffee concoction again.Note
 I was a little let down after reading about how amazing it tastes . It tastes pretty good for protein , but do n't believe the people who liken it to a milkshake . It 's protein powder in water/milk . Do n't expect anything more .
 I had bought this flavor in the 2 pound tub just to try it out . I 've always been a fan of OP Whey products where I usually stick with the double chocolate flavor . I tried the Banana Cream and it is a bit too sweet and the powder seems to be more clumpy and stuck together compared to the other flavors.As far as the whey powder itself goes , it 's great ! It mixes well and tastes great with skim milk or regular whole milk if you like the thickness and calories . It provides the protein needed without much extra fillings or sweeteners . If you 're trying OP Whey for the first time I definitely recommend the double chocolate as that is probably their best flavor . I probably would n't go back to the Banana Cream flavor in the future .
 Great taste and texture . Dissolved easily into water.Great when combined with almond milk and ice cubes to make a smoothie .
 I am not a body-building aficionado , or anything like that , but I started taking whey once a day because every health publication you read talked about how it is one of the best things you can buy to help build muscle and curb your appetite . I tried a few different types of powder , and this is the best I have tried . It is n't expensive , and it taste great . I mix 16 ounces of water with two scoops , once a day , and it fills me up . I have only been using it for about a month , but I can already see results . I definitely recommend it .
 Works great ! Good grams of protein per scoop , tastes amazing -LRB- especially with milk -RRB- , blends really nicely , and tastes amazing . Also tastes amazing !
 This stuff is SO good . Vanilla is where it 's at ! -LRB- I have strawberry too , thats great . Chocolate - ehhh , not so much a fan -RRB- . But yes , vanilla , mm mm good .
 Very good product , helpful for a high protein diets , 25 great of good quality protein powder and zero gr of fat and carbs .
 not much else to say other than the title of my review . i 've been drinking the ON Vanilla Ice Cream for 3 months now . It is delicious and definitely helps me stay on my diet and I know i 'm getting the Protein i need with my workout . I remember the days when i used to have to plug my nose to drink the MetRx shakes . Those days are well behind me , i look forward to drinking this stuff and it does satisfy my hunger . I throw a raw egg white in there for a few extra grams of protein too . I mix 32 oz of skim milk and 4 scoops of shake in the morning with the raw egg white and waaaala i have 135 grams of protein waiting for me for the rest of the day . That along with my other meals gives me plenty of protein for the day . I definitely recommend this shake to anyone wanting to make sure they get enough protein or even anyone that wants to cut down on their carb intake.Ohhh and i 'm very picky about the taste of protein shakes . This and Muscle Milk are my favorites but stopped drinking Muscle Milk ... too many calories and frustrated they stopped making the Root Beer Float . Hopefully ON will make a Root Beer Float flavor one day .
 I 've been using this mix for over a year now with great results . This is a great mix of whey protein with great flavor . Whether making a recovery drink with milk , fruit , yogurt and oj or simply making a ` snack ' with just nonfat milk , I 've really enjoyed this drink . Muscle recovery was improved with this protein as well , and digests very easily ... this is a good one for those like me with a sensitive stomach.The flavor is great , company is respected and the cost is right . The shake also mixes very well without a blender or shake-mixer , which you ca n't often say with good protein powders . Amazon is your best bet for cost on this one too , especially as a Subscribe and Save item ...
 This was the first O.N. protein I have used , and I was very impressed with the flavor ! The scoop was at the very bottom , just found it after using most of the protein , but no big deal . Overall , great product - I will be ordering more soon !
 The cake batter is awesome . My only grip is that i had to buy a 5 pd bucket to get it . I get tired of protein quick so i usually keep 3 flavors around at once to change up . Make the cake batter a permanent flavor and sell it in a 2pd jug please .
 The taste is pretty good , 7/10 , but it starts to get old about half way through the jug.I 've tried most of the ON flavors but this one foams up more than the rest of them for reasons unknown , even in water.It will clump up a lot if you do n't shake it pretty hard . The down time is a pain in the ass , waiting for the foam to settle .
 This is probably the best whey I have tried from ON . I have also had double choco , and strawberries & bananas ; I prefer Extreme choco cause its not as sweet as the other two .
 This is one of the better tasting protein powders I have ever tried . It also mixes very well with water or milk ; unlike , many powders that create an overly thick consistency . The double rich chocolate flavor is so good i am often tempted to drink more than required .
 First I wan na say that the reason i picked this brand was because it has won awards for best protein supplement product and because it was very popular on amazons most purchased list . I am reviewing the Cookies and Cream flavor and if i blind tasted this product i would not be able to guess and flavor . The flavor isnt so much cookies and cream but a sweet something . I also would not be able to tell you this is a protein powder shake because 1 scoop in a blender bottle has 0 chalky texture . There is no chalky flavor just sugar milk . I am going to increase the amount of milk per 1 scoop because it has that same sugar effect as Yoo-Hoo cholcate milk . Its a bit sweet but not chalky . I will continue to use this product .
 i recently purchased 100 % whey protein from here , but i have one doubt about the authenticity of this product.When i opened the container there was no seal at the top . Can anyone comment on whether you had the same issue or is it 's an issue at all?thanks .
 I got the Double Rich Chocolate and the flavor is good , although it could be more chocolatey , triple rich chocolate should come out soon :-RRB- It mixes well . It 's well worth the price . You can easily find more expensive protein that is not as good of quality , or as good of taste .
 This is a good protein shake because of the high protein and low calories per serving but I prefere the taste and mixability of BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder . If you are OK with the extra 80 calories per serving -LRB- 200 against 120 -RRB- BSN is a better choice ; better taste -LRB- I compared vanilla flavor -RRB- and easier to mix.Now if you just want protein and no extra calories for taste , Optimum is for you !
 Overall , this protein is the best for price and quality . I wanted a flavor to mix with water since chocolate is n't too great although it is still consumable . I 've read somewhere that tropical punch mixed with water tasted like kool-aid or real `` tropical punch '' so I ended up buying the 2 lb just in case it was n't so good . Well , it definitely does NOT taste like tropical punch or kool aid ... tastes more like a watered down strawberry shake , or let 's say a very bland tropical punch . it is still drinkable but i do n't enjoy it too much . i would rather have just stuck with double rich chocolate since it tastes amazing with milk and is drinkable with water . for this flavor , i wo n't be trying it with milk . I still give the powder itself 5 stars only because the flavor does n't affect the performance .
 this stuff is great , 1 scoop is 24 grams of protein ... the only thing i hate is that cookies and cream doesnt take likse cookies and cream and it has the worst after taste ... so until i am up using that im stuck with the horrible after taste ... too bad they cant give you samples ! lol
 This is n't a review for the Coffee flavoured protein powder -LRB- though I 'd really LOVE to try it sometime ! -RRB- but I 'm too excited to put this anywhere else right now lolz.I received my On OP Chocolate Mint Whey Protein powder and it 's my favourite flavour so far ! I 've been using the Gold Standard On Protein products on and off for years and they 've ALWAYS tasted amazing . I want to have a range of flavours at my disposal -LRB- of course , will need to taste some first before committing -RRB- . I just recently started a workout regimen once again , this time seriously , and I 've come back to On . I 've amassed my first stack - Opti-Men multivitamin , OP Chocolate mint and Double Rich Chocolate Whey Protein powders , and French Vanilla Casein . Very proud of it , too ! I mix my shakes with water instead of milk because I certainly do n't need the extra calories ; trying to lose fat as well as build muscle . The On products are a safe , delicious , not to mention effective , way to go . No need to look elsewhere ! : -RRB-
 Very satisfied with my purchase . I got the vanilla flavor . Great taste , Goes with everything . Give me lots of energy and does n't feel heavy . My husband loves it too . Very satisfied . I definitely recommend it .
 As a thirty-something father of two , I 'm a little late to the Get Buff party . With work , kid extra-curriculars , and frenetic meal times to worry about , in addition to a body that just is n't 20 any more , I 'll take my fitness where I can find it . After a lunch time workout at the local gym , I need something to help my body recover . ON 's Whey Gold Standard really fits the bill.With a work laptop , lunch , a change of clothes and a towel to wrangle into work each workout day , I place a premium on ease of use and portability . Obviously a 5 pound mega-jug does n't fit the bill , but this powder can be placed in a blend cup with liquid -LRB- I go with 1 % milk -RRB- and stashed in an insulated container with a freeze pack until after my workout . The label claims it 's ` instantized ' and while I 'm not clear on what that entails , it certainly mixes with ridiculous ease . A couple shakes of the blend cup and I have a nicely frothed up beverage for the drive back to work . There are no powder clumps bobbing at the top or lingering in wait at the bottom , daring me to spoon them out to get my full serving 's worth . The drink is velvety smooth.The Mocha Cappuccino 's taste is quite delicious by my standards . It is n't quite as chocolatey as Hershey 's syrup , but it 's a nice full flavor and I could easily see enjoying it for the flavor alone . It also includes coffee as an actual ingredient , which is handy for those of us with caffeine habits.The powder proudly wears its nutritional merits on its sleeve , so I can add little in that regard . If you are looking it up here , you already know that it 's low in calories and carbs , but high in whey protein , the particular sort of protein that is most easily absorbed by your body . This particular brand is well regarded , suffering only from the occasional irritation that popular products always engender from people who prefer their brands to be a little more exclusive and against-the-grain . I 'm sure there are more esoteric varieties available that are marginally better in some precise way , but a pretty wide Google net seemed to reveal that ON is a well-loved fixture even among some of the die-hard enthusiasts . Considering the exceptional taste and ease of use , that 's good enough for me .
 I 'm a 40-something mom who works out regularly and wanted to start using whey protein as a recovery meal after working out . At 24 grams of protein per serving , it 's hard to rival as a quick , low-calorie protein source . I 've had a few other protein shakes before that were barely palatable , but this shake tastes great and I actually look forward to it . I prepare it with milk and a few ice cubes in the blender . My two teenagers love it and usually have at least one shake/day . Sign up for the auto-ship option-it 's a great deal ! I laughed when the 5-lb container arrived
 Did some research and Optimum Nutrition seems to have the best whey product out there . It has the least ammount of carbs and sugar , and the most protein . All the chocolate flavors taste awesome , and you definately see results . This is a lean protein , I am sure there are others out there meant for more serious gain , but this one hits the sweet spots for those who want to cut weight and build muscle . Never any complaints and have easily gone through 30 + lbs of the stuff
 If your experience with protein powders involves endless mixing , a layer of powdery foam on top , a chalky taste , and an overall grossness that you must overtime develop a taste for -- then this is the product for you . Welcome to the 21st century . Put one scoop of this double chocolate power in water , mix it up , and boom - it is smooth , fully mixed , and tastes delicious , like chocolate milk . You can also mix it with milk , or ice cubed in a blender , blend with fruit or peanut butter , whatever ... but the dealmaker is that it tastes absolutely perfect on it 's own in water . You 'll like it the first time you try it . I did , and I 'm the pickiest eater/drinking on the planet .
 This is your basic no frills , trusty old whey standby . Always among the cheapest available , and definitely the easiest to find . Tastes like choco milk . Ca n't go wrong !
 I got a 2lb tub of this . It mixes extremely well and tastes like hot chocolate with just milk . The only downside to chocolate flavored things is limited mixing combos . I 'm getting sick of just banana and peanut butter in my shakes .
 Having tried many different protein shakes and bars , this one is by far the best tasting . It 's not dessert or anything , but if you make it with at least half of the liquid as whole milk it 's really great for a protein shake . It 's not bad made with just water either . With my last pregnancy my OB suggested that I get at least 75g of protein a day -LRB- which is quite a bit if you look at nutrition info -RRB- . I brought in the nutrition label for this product and she approved it as safe for me to have once or twice a day while pregnant . I 'd suggest asking your own OB before starting to drink them all the time , but they 're the best option in my opinion .
 With so many products on the market to choose from , its trial and error to find a quality product protein powder that actually tastes good . I found this and it does taste fantastic !! . Chocolate Mint mixed with some cold 2 % milk ... mmm ... mmm ... good . It tastes just like an ice cream milkshake , but healthy .
 I just received the Cookies and Cream flavor for this product , and it was okay . I was expecting an Oreo type cookies and cream flavor , but this tastes like that fake cookie dough flavor . It is similar to the taste of a cookies and cream Powerbar , except this has too strong of that artificial cookie dough flavor , which is not a good thing . The smell is not what you 'd expect for the flavor , it is quite overpowering with the artificial flavor with a hint of coffee as some other reviewers mentioned.I got this flavor because I wanted to try something different , and it won in a coin toss against chocolate . It is drinkable , but I would not recommend this flavor . It tastes a little better in milk , but I usually take my shakes with water . I would give it a 6/10 . The price is right and the quality is there . I will be sticking with ON , but want to try Double Chocolate or Vanilla Chai next.tl ; drCookies and Cream flavor okay . 6/10 . Would not recommend this flavor .
 I chose the Mint Chocolate Flavor and it was fantastic . I was a little nervous it may taste a little like toothpaste . However , I was pleasantly surprised that it tastes more in line with a chocolate milk shake with a hint of very pleasant mint . When mixed with Rice or Almond milk it 's fantastic . I drink a shake in the middle of the night to preserve a protein levels and use plain water and a shaker cup -LRB- because who feels like getting out of bed at 2a . m. -RRB- and the product taste very similar to YOO-HOO with the water base . Buy it - it 's great stuff !
 I 'm 61 , and have been working out in the gym at McConnell AFB as part of a program that includes low fat dieting . Working out makes me want steak , and since I need to cut down on my cholesterol , steak is not good right now . Instead , I mix this powder with skim milk , and drink about two cups as soon as I finish working out . It gives me the protein I need , and helps me avoid steak , fish and other sources of protein than come with cholesterol . It is also the best tasting powder mix i have ever tried .
 I am new to protein powders and so I ordered a few to try them out . This one is the best hands down . The flavor is good and it is low calorie and low fat . I usually mix a scoop of this , 2 cups of skim milk , and a frozen bannana in a blender for a delicious smoothy .
 Use milk instead of water . Tastes better . Does n't take much , maybe a cup or less per scoop !
 Tastes a lot better than the protein I was taking before . No , you wo n't think you 're having a milkshake or anything , but the flavor is actually pretty pleasant . Seems to be of top quality . Mixes fairly easily . I 'll be buying this again !
 I really liked this protein , mixes well and tastes great . I make it a point to buy Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey after trying it once .
 This Whey Protein is absolutely delicious . If somebody served it up to me in a glass and told me it was a light chocolate milk I would never know the difference ! To be fair , I have not tried other protein powders so I ca n't compare , but this one really does taste amazing.In terms of performance , it is always difficult to tell if a protein powder is working . I would say it is . Over a 6 month span of working out and consuming ON Whey I was able to see muscles take shape across my body and put on about 8 pounds - not of fat either . I would say this stuff works pretty well for me and based on reviews for most other people as well .
 This is genuine Gold Standard Whey Protein for cheap . So glad I found it online for much cheaper than I payed in store .
 I have been using ON 100 % Gold Standard whey for about 15 years . I think it is the best tasting whey with minimal sugar and other additives hands down . ON 100 % mixes well and digests well . The chocolate malt is especially tasty . I think I am going to make this my standard flavor . ON is also when of the best priced proteins on the market . The price here on Amazon is comparable to everywhere else . It may be a little cheaper -LRB- a dollar or two -RRB- than anywhere else . With the free two day shipping with Prime , this is the best deal on the protein you can get . I am , for some reason , always surprised when I run out , so prime shipping is great .
 I got it for $ 97 . It 's great value for money compared to other brands & vendors . Taste is alright - I used to have some extremely overpriced GNC vanilla whey that tasted incredible so it 's hard to compare the two . Taste is similar to chocolate milk .
 I did n't think it was possible to make whey protein taste this good , period , even when mixed in water with a spoon . I 'm throwing away any other I have , nothing else I 've ever had compares .
 The best bang for your buck protein out there ... great taste , always consistent , no matter if you are cutting or bulking ... ON is the choice for all !!!
 Years ago , I did a fairly extensive `` taste test '' of all of the major protein powders on the market . Every single one disappointed me
 I 've tried a number of Whey Protein and this could be my new Go-to protein . The Strawberry is so good . I mix it with water to keep calories/fat down and it tastes great . 24g of protein is a good amount . I was n't looking for much more . Great product .
 I 'm making my way through the various flavors and have yet to be greatly disappointed with gold standard . Okay , tropical punch was a bad idea and i knew that before I got it , but have tried double chocolate , french vanilla , and vanilla ice cream as well and all have been phenominal with milk , water or in a mixed shake .
 I only buy Optimum Nutrition protein and the cookies and cream flavor is one of the best I 've ever had . It 's not too sweet , and even taste good when mixed with water , although I use milk . You ca n't go wrong with cookies and cream !
 I 've tried alot of stuff and have consistently used this and it only gets better and better . . The taste and mix-ability is unmatched for the nutritional value . . It mixed well with water as well as milk . . I enjoy drinking this and it 's almost like i 'm being rewarded : D
 16 oz of 2 % milk , one gala apple , 2 bananas , 2 tablespoon of chunky peanut butter , one scoop of this protein mixed in the blender with some crushed ice and you got heaven in your mouth . Goodbye to sore muscles after the soccer game . It is intended for medium body trainers . People with extreme work out routines need to use casein protein instead . Casein is absorbed a lot faster .
 I was a little skeptical about chocolate mint flavored protein powder . Boy was I wrong . This stuff is delicious . Mixes well . I ca n't think of anything bad to say about it . I highly recommend .
 I 've tried other whey products and always come back to this one . It is not the cheapest but it is the best one that I have used . It mixes very well . Most importantly , the taste is excellent . I used to get the Vanilla Ice Cream . It is really good if you want to mix some fruit in a blender . The Double Rich Chocolate is my standard though . The taste does not get old like some of the others I 've tried . One thing I like best is that I can fill a mixing bottle -LRB- this is a great one Single 20oz Sundesa Blender Bottle -RRB- with powder , keep it with me and fill it with water when I need it . It still tases wonderful with water instead of milk .
 I ca n't believe how well this stuff dissolves in milk . One day I forgot to put my ball in the bottle and I could n't even tell a differences in clumps . Also tastes damn good with chocolate milk .
 This protein powder is very EASY to mix with a spoon . I wish I had discovered this earlier because it is very filling and does NOT require a blender , thank God!UPDATE : The Chocolate Mint is great tasting even though I have not found the scoop in the 5 lbs . container . In the 2 lbs . of Chocolate Malt , I found the scoop VERY EASILY and I still use it . The whey protein helps me maintain and build my muscle strength .
 As far as I 'm concerned , 99 % of protein powders are the same and you know exactly what you 're getting by reading the label -- that being said , compared to other ON flavors , I 've found this to be the best tasting and most mixable .
 Great formula , mixes very well . Started Insanity without this and it was a serious struggle to continue . About a week into the program I 've incorporated this into my post workout routine and it does everything it claims . Love it , will continue to buy it .
 Review based on Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor.There 's a reason they call this `` Gold Standard . '' Each scoop packs in 24 g of high quality whey isolates , aka the pure protein good stuff , with only 130 calories and 1.5 g Fat per scoop . Whey is a short acting protein , so it 's best taken shortly after a lift session . This review is based on the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor . While it does n't taste as good as something like Muscle Milk , I did n't expect it to , since it cuts out a ton of the sweeteners and calories found in Muscle Milk . With 8 oz of water , one scoop of this stuff creates a mild , odd chocolate flavor . I would n't say it 's bad , but I would n't say it 's good either . With 8 oz of skim milk , the flavor improves a great deal , and is borderline `` tasty . '' With milk , it also creates a much thicker drink of a milkshake like consistency . I will definitely stick to drinking this with milk from now on . If the taste was a little better , I would have given this 5 stars.As a medical student , I know that a lot of these protein supplements are not only unnecessary , but can be dangerous . Excess protein wo n't help you build muscle any faster . It has the potential to clog up your kidneys and lead to kidney damage at a young age . I spoke with several doctors I 've worked with in the hospitals during my rotations and here 's the consensus
 This is one of my first protein-powder purchases from the Optimum Nutrition brand . I 'm amazed how quickly ON 's whey protein powder dissolved in a liquid . I usually add 1 serving of ON -LRB- 24g protein -RRB- to a couple of ice cubes and soymilk or skim milk in a blender to make a delicious protein shake , and it keeps me filled and satisfied for a couple hours . I like its consistency and smooth texture ; it does n't have that extra `` stuff '' that you can detect and taste in other protein powders , likeCytosport Muscle Milk Collegiate , Vanilla Creme 5.29 lbs . The reason for 4 stars ? Although you can smell the vanilla ice cream flavor once the container is open , the vanilla intensity just is n't enough , especially when you mix it with water .
 I 'm weight training to be less of a noodle and this protein has really made a difference . My only advice would be to be choosy about the flavor you pick . You 'll be stuck with it for a while as this powder goes a long whey -LRB- tee hee -RRB- . I tried a 1lb bag of the French Vanilla Creme first and loved every scoopful . Just mixed it with water and loved the flavor . Even looked forward to drinking it after my workouts . After the trial run I purchased a 2lb bottle of Delicious Strawberry and YUCK ! It does n't mix as well with a spoon -LRB- though a shaker works great ! -RRB- and it 's got a weird taste to it . Artificial strawberry , not natural strawberry . I 'm starting to get used to it , as I 'm not going to let it go to waste , but I had to come online to find the French Vanilla Creme to order more , as my local vitamin shops do n't seem to carry it regularly .
 I started buying protein shakes back in high school and one after another they tasted DISGUSTING !! You could n't wait to get it down and the pain of actually having any of that stuff hit your tastebuds ... uggh ! So I looked online and found out that Optimum Nutrition supposedly makes good tasting whey protein powders . Well they are n't just good , they 're actually GRRREEAAT ! This is the only type of protein i 've bought since then . Chocolate was the best flavor and they expanded on it with mint chocolate , double rich chocolate , chocolate shake , creamy chocolate , and now `` extreme '' chocolate . Basically , if you buy a chocolate flavored optimum nutrition shake , you 're getting the best tasting protein out there for that price , hands down .
 This has a great chocolate flavor without being too much chocolate . It blends smooth and makes a really great drink in the morning !
 I got this as a gift last Christmas . I want to add to all the good reviews above , it not only gives you quality protein , but is also very easy on the stomach . I noticed this as I switched over from a different product . It tastes great with a fruit -LRB- banana -RRB- , and milk .
 Tastes great ! I loved the cappuccino flavor best but I wanted to try something new without it being super sweet . This is an awesome second choice !
 Does what it is supposed to do . I use as a Pre & Post workout drink . Just add a little dextrose to help get in your system quick .
 This is probably the best tasting protein powder I have used . I have only tried one flavor , double rich chocolate , and do n't think I 'll be switching to another any time soon , since this tastes exactly like chocolate milk ! I use 1 scoop of this + 16oz of whole milk after working out . If you prefer sweeter , you can mix it with 8oz of milk . Either way , delicious . It also does n't feel very filling . Although you wo n't be too hungry right after drinking this , you can still eat plenty . And you will get very hungry around 2 hours later .
 Iv been on an ANTI-FUNGAL DIET for 1month and been waitng for this product and mroe to come.which have come !!! did my arms workout today with heavier weights , more intensity !! and of course . . more love and happiness !!! knowing these products have come !! TASTE -- Amazing taste.iv tasted many flavors from OPtiumum nutrition and this one is the best one so far for my taste buds , this one or chocolate mint.TEXTURE -- Thickness of the shake id say 3/5 not sludgy thick but thick enough to make it creamyproduct came quick and came right in the middle of my workout with creatine !! so really gon na bulk upAlso a tip ... for best bulking up results.do a bulking phase after youve gone through a low carb phase and OR removing all processed foods and milk * including whey * ... this is what iv done and if you know how to time the foods and supplements right.you WILL build mass , about 1 lb a month , even more if your aroudn age of 18-26 . when your testosterone is up the roof
 Not too much to say about this protein . It is one of the top brands that I use , and it tastes great ! I have purchased this multiple times now , and I have yet to have a complaint . The stuff mixes well with anything . If you are looking for a good protein this is it . On top of that Amazon has a great price on it !
 My friends at work told me about Optimum Nutrition Double-Rich Chocolate when I asked them for their recommendation of the best protein powder . They drink it all the time and told me about this Amazon deal . It is a big bag so you will want to try a smaller container first , just to see if you like it . I tried it and liked it so I got the big bag . This stuff is delicious . I used to mix it with skim milk , then a combo of skim milk and water , now just water and ice . It reminds me of the drink YooHoo but it 's good for ya .
 When I was in GNC once I compared the nutrition label on the GNC brand whey with the the Optimum Whey , and the Optimum was the healthier option . So I 've stuck to buying Optimum over the years , and of course buying it on Amazon is always cheaper . I 've found that the Strawberry and Chocolate flavor variations tend to be tastier than the vanilla . It seems like that one leaves more of an aftertaste too , but perhaps everyone 's taste is different . I tend to buy the smaller sizes so I can change up the flavor more often .
 It tastes so good I want to work out more just so I can have more of this protein shake . It goes great with water -LRB- I have n't tried it with milk yet -RRB- . My previous experience was with the regular chocolate flavor . This flavor is WAY BETTER !
 I bought the 5 pound jar two days ago , and was surprised at how much powder was in there . I guess that 's because I never bought a product like this before , but it seems like it will be a pretty good deal for the price . I ca n't vouch for the effectiveness of the product yet as it has only been a few days , but the kind I ordered -LRB- Double rich chocolate -RRB- tastes pretty damn good !
 I 'm not a power lifter or looking to get huge , but I do some working out and running and was looking for a protein powder to supplement my diet . I started with a small tub of muscle milk -LRB- vanilla -RRB- but after doing some research , I decided to get the ON gold standard . It is low in fat and carbs -LRB- compared to other powders out there -RRB- and for the price , is a bargain.It did n't mix as well as the muscle milk in my blender bottle , which is the only reason I 'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 . Mixed with milk , it tastes pretty good . You can tell it 's a protein shake , but the flavor and aftertaste are not bad .
 I got the ` Extreme Milk Chocolate ' flavor and am surprisingly happy with the product . I 'm not that big of a fan of changing products after finding one I like . However , my old protein powder was starting to add up a lot . Not only does this shake actually taste like chocolate milk when you use milk , but it has more protein than my last , more expensive protein powder . It also mixes fairly well when shaken . I recommend this to everyone .
 The best thing about optimum 's whey is it mixes without lumps on the other hand the flavors are a hit or miss . The strawberry banana flavor tasted great with milk as do the majority of the flavors but when strictly combined with water the chemical taste is overpowering.The chocolates and cookie and cream flavors I found to be fine in water but all the fruit flavors taste terrible . Strawberry banana and vanilla ice cream are undrinkable in water but fine in milk .
 I 've never been someone who buys protein powder - I 'm not into muscle building and supplements . However , I recently had a week when I had to work 80 hours . I ate one or two meals a day that week , and nothing terribly nutritious . All I did for 7 days straight was drive to and from work , work , and try to get 7 hours sleep.After it was over I decided that I 'd buy a protein powder , and a green powdered superfood to keep in my pantry so that if I 'm working long hours I can come home , throw the protein powder and green powder in a blender with frozen fruits and have a somewhat nutritious meal in 5 minutes . In fact , if I 'm going to use the blender -LRB- and then have to wash it -RRB- I might as well put in enough to have several smoothies - one for dinner and one to take in the car for breakfast.I did an experiment with this powder today . I put a scoop of this powder , 1/2 cup of skim milk , 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt , flax seeds , a handful of fresh spinach , frozen fruit and a couple of packets of Splenda in my Vitamix . I really enjoyed the smoothie - I could n't taste the spinach at all , the frozen strawberries and blueberries gave me antioxidants , the flax seed provided Omega 3 , the yogurt was good for my digestive system . I 'll end up making smoothies with this whey powder a few times a week to satisfy my craving for something sweet and cold , but without the fat and sugar of a milkshake . And when I have to work long hours this powder , the green powder and the frozen fruit will be a way to fix a quick meal substitute .
 I bought this protein powder -LRB- Vanilla Ice Cream flavor -RRB- after my personal trainer suggested I start taking protein shakes . The protein powder that he wanted me to buy at the gym was way too pricey for my budget -LRB- Xsport brand -RRB- . So I bought this as an alternative because it had a similar composition . It is low on fat and carbs while still giving a high dose of protein.I usually mix with milk -LRB- as I do n't currently have a blender -RRB- and it mixes pretty well but sometimes still get a few chunks . It has also taken me a while to get used to since I have never eaten protein shakes before , which also means I ca n't compare it to other products . The flavor overall is fairly good and it is reminiscent of cake mix . It tastes a lot better when I make it in a smoothie with added fruit , ice , and other mix-ins ; most likely because it hid the flavor better -LRB- I use The Abs Diet recipes -RRB- . I found it is a great snack for me between meals or for breakfast or after workouts . It keeps me full but it does leave me feel sort of bloated after drinking one.Buying it in a larger quantity means getting a better deal . So it 's a good deal for what I think is a little higher quality protein powder .
 this is one of the best tasting protein drinks i have ever had . additionally , the consistency is second to none . it is not thick , it mixes up very well w / a shaker bottle , and only requires a small amount of liquid -LRB- i use skim milk -RRB- . the vanilla allows you to mix it with other flavors so you are n't just stuck w / chocolate , for example . i 've used orange juice to make an orange creme drink -LRB- awesome -RRB- . the vanilla by itself is awesome . add some ovaltine , you 've got an excellent malt . i 've mixed it up with a spoon just to try it out and it worked okay . but not as good as the shaker bottle w / wire wisk ball . bottom line is , i 'm not sure you can do better than this protein . i have n't tried other flavors , but i do n't need to . i also have BSN Syntha-6 , which is equally excellent . i use the ON for post workout and the Syntha-6 for general suppliment . both are incredible in all aspects . some reviewers here have issues with some of the flavors . i wonder if they ever drank protein powders back in the early 90 's . cause last time i did the protein thing , they were all nasty . times have definitely changed . for those not enjoying some of the other flavors , go w / this vanilla . you can add your own flavors , or have it plain . it 's really a great tasting drink . one note
 I think ON 100 % Whey Gold Standard really hits the sweet spot for value/taste/formulation / mixability . I am military and have to mix this with water and it mixes much easier than other protein I have tried with water . I love the vanilla ice cream flavor but am not a fan of the double rich chocolate with water . Some people have said it tastes good with milk and that may be true but with just water it has a odd flavor that is n't horrible but is n't very pleasant . I would suggest trying a few 1 or 2lb tubs of different flavors and then going for the value of a 5lb tub once you find what works for you .
 I used this for 2 years after gastric bypass surgery , and it was definitely the best-tasting powder out there , and was highly recommended by just about everyone . For those concerned about bloating I find that the common method or either blending or shaking adds too much air / bubbles . My recommendation is to stir instead . I also have a great tip to improve taste ... keep it cold ! Glass bottles make a big difference . Plastic containers do n't keep it cold enough . The glass bottles that those Starbucks Frappuchino drinks comes in , I found , are the perfect size for a shake , and they 're highly portable . They come in a 4-pack . After sitting a while , all it needs is a few swirls -LRB- with cap on ! -RRB- and you can see the bottom to know when you 've gotten it all off the bottom . You can wash the glasses and lids and keep using them . I pour my mix into these bottles , and go from there . Here 's my tip for the best way to mix : Stir with a fork in a glass measuring cup . First add a little milk to make a paste . Then add more milk GRADUALLY , little by little , while continuing to stir , until you get the desired amount . Making a paste first is essential . If you just dump your powder into a large glass of milk , it will clump . Pour your shakes into above-mentioned glass bottles.I reiterate that using a blender or shaking it adds too much air . Sometimes people like this effect because it gives it more of a cake batter or milkshake feel , but for me it adds to much air that can affect gasiness and/or bloating.Also , use with milk . It wo n't taste good with water .
 When I was originally looking for a protein supplement I got started with Optimum Nutrition Double Rich Chocolate -LRB- 5-pounds -RRB- . While I was pleased with it , I decided to look into a few alternative brands . I ca n't claim that with any brand I felt a big physical difference . That said I am using whey protein more as a supplement , so I rarely had more than one serving a day and at times did not have any if I felt my food that day supplied adequate protein . -LRB- Yeah , it took me a while to get through five pounds of this stuff . -RRB- - Cost/PricingOne misconception I had as I looked for protein was that comparing price per pound . I thought I was making a good comparison of the cost of each , where it really makes more sense for me to compare price per serving . Since the other two main proteins I tried had a serving size 30-45 % larger , the containers I was buying would not last any where near the same length.For example , the 2.91 pounds of Syntha-6 I bought was not bad on price , but only contained 30 servings because of its huge serving size . The fact that almost three pounds would only last me a month or so made it a much more costly protein . Here 's a break down of serving sizes.Serving Sizes -LRB- in grams -RRB- : Optimum Nutrition - 30.4 g - -LRB- 24g protein -RRB- Six-Star - 39g - -LRB- 26g protein -RRB- Syntha-6 - 44g - -LRB- 22g protein -RRB- - Artificial SweetnersThe other disappointment with the two other protein powders was they both use Sucralose -LRB- witch is more or less Splenda -RRB- . Particularly with the Syntha-6 that advertises on their container that they do not use Aspartame , it is a little deceptive to just replace it with a different artificial sweetener . Everyone varies a bit on their take of artificial sweeteners ; personally I avoid them , at least in anything I would be consuming on a regular basis . With that said , understand Optimum Nutrition is using Acesulfame Potassium as an artificial sweetener in their whey protein . I am torn on how I should feel about that ; it is something I would rather avoid . - TasteSyntha-6 was the best tasting of the powders I tried , but considering it contains six grams of fat -LRB- two grams saturated fat -RRB- , it really should taste pretty good . Fat content is something that I think people freak out about a little too much at times . Syntha-6 is actually intend as a meal replacement as well as a protein supplement , so it makes sense they would have a higher fat content . Depending on your goals or nutritional needs that may or may not be a good thing . I saw it more as a negative since I was simply looking for a way to add protein to my diet , particularly after exercise . Meal replacement is n't something I am too interested in ... meal addition is more up my alley ;-RRB- -LRB- Optimum Nutrition has 1 gram of fat per serving -RRB- - ConclusionOf any protein I have tried for a decent amount of time -LRB- at least three weeks -RRB- Optimum is still my favorite . The taste is good , especially when mixed with milk ; and as most have said it mixed pretty easily . I order another five pound container , it will take me a while to get through that . The down side that I still find with it is the use of Acesulfame Potassium , but I have yet to find a good powder with no artificial sweeteners just yet . Over all I would recommend it , has not given me any adverse side effects , like gas or discomfort . -LRB- I always think it is a good idea though to try a new supplement at half dose instead of full to get an idea of how it will effect you . -RRB-
 Over 20 grams of protein in one tiny scoop with practically no sugar and fat , what else could you ask for ? I lift about 2-3 times a week and had just switched over from an ON weight gainer powder to this pure Whey and I feel dramatically different , stronger , and healthier . It mixes very very easy with just a few seconds of shaking in water or milk . I 've tried also with a blender but it 's really not necessary . Taste wise it 's great like a milk shake -LRB- I ordered Double Chocolate flavor -RRB- . Side note , I had been adding too much water or milk the first few trys and it tasted `` watered down . '' I then tried again with less milk this time , maybe about 4 or 5 oz , it tasted great and I felt even better . Happy training !
 It has a great french vanilla taste and I enjoy it . I had been using a product that had a orange sherbet taste and tired of it . The french vanilla does n't get old though .
 Great protein , tastes good , and easy to mix . I will buy this again . Delivery was quick and the protein was a good price . ON in my opinion is some of the best out there .
 I spent a little more money on this protein than i had with others , but it was worth it . I am not forcing myself to drink it when i mix with water anymore.To me , it is worth the extra $ 10-15 so i do n't have to drink gross protein every time i am done working out .
 Ok , this stuff is great . Simple , and perfect for the high schooler . The first thing I learned though was that THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU RIPPED , only HARD WORK can do that , it will only make the proccess quicker and bigger . Great taste , i put in chocolate syrup and it tastes phenomenal . Great all around product , my first whey purchase and i couldnt be happier .
 This is one of the best powder protein products I have used . It easily shakes/stirs to mix with water , juice or milk and leaves no clumps !! An athlete 's dream !!! Thanks Optimum for the easy mix product ...
 I drink the protein with milk every time after I came back from the gym . After using this protein for one month , I found my muscles were growing . The chocolate flavor is acceptable for me
 Independent lab testing shows this is one of the best quality protein powders on the market and tastes great . If you 're looking for just whey protein , this is the kind to get .
 I like this protein powder it mixes relatively easy and tastes good . It 's not the best chocolate shake I 've tasted but really good . It 's specially good when mixed with milk.I have a very sensitive stomach so it sometimes can be a little heavy but for the most part it 's ok
 I am really satisfied , from buying and consuming this product of Amazon verified . I have been consuming this every day . so far so good .
 I recently started using Gold Standard Whey after only using budget brands from superstores . At first , I thought it was all basically the same , but this stuff is great ! It dissolves much more easily and does n't leave tons of gritty stuff at the bottom of your glass . The flavors are also excellent . I 've tried the Double Chocolate and Chocolate Malt and enjoyed them both . I 'm looking forward to trying new flavors and doubt that I 'll ever use another brand .
 This is the best stuff . You can pay $ 80 + for this at your gym or buy it on here for much cheaper . It tastes great . Goes great with milk .
 This flavor -LRB- chocolate malt -RRB- is very good . I had strawberry banana last time and it was not so good . This powder mixes well and does n't need to be mixed with milk to taste good .
 This stuff is sooooooooooooo good it 's like drinking a candy bar ! I use this every morning after the gym , and sometimes for a dinner replacement . This is the first and only protein powder that I 've used that actually fills me up , keeps me going and TASTES FANTASTIC ! I bought the 5 pound of it , and will probably by the 10 pounds next time ... I go through it so quick.It dissolves effortlessly in water , and mixed with some ice is a tasty treat when i 'm craving ice cream . I 've been able to lose about 10 pounds so far in 3 weeks thanks to this protein ! Really has curbed my eating !
 switched to this from muscle milk -- all i can say is this -- GAINS . GAINS EVERYWHEREhighly recommendedbuy for your son , make them strong like bull
 they set the standard for high quality protein , what else can i say ? you ca n't go wrong with optimum ... hmmm ... but make sure you pick a flavor you like cos drinking 75 servings of the flavor you hate can be a nightmare .
 This is the only protein I 've been using for the last year or so and I will never switch back to any other of the ones I tried . It tastes amazing and mixes great with both milk and water . Love it !
 While I have previously reviewed Synth-6 and loved it , that was when I was first trying out different types of protein drinks . I must say after doing much research and speaking with a few physical trainers , ON seems to be the best for packing on muscle . It is lower in calories than a lot of others and includes glutamine and a lot of BCAA 's which is very essential if you are hitting the gym hard . I 'm on my third bottle now . The taste is n't nearly as good as synth-6 or muscle milk . But the protein , glutamine , and BCAA 's that you are receiving with each scoop are well worth it ! I 'd highly recommend this product .
 I ca n't speak for all the scientific facts on the label , but I can say that this protein is far better than any other I 've tried in terms of mix-ability and taste . The Mocha Cappuccino flavor is downright delicious , mix it with some warm water and it tastes just like hot chocolate . Plus , if you read the fine print , they flavor it with REAL COFFEE , so there 's 15mg of caffeine in every scoop . Maybe it 's all in my head , but I 'd say it gives me a little boost when I take it before my workout . Yes , it costs a little more than what you 'd buy at Kroger or Walmart , but it is far superior .
 As claimed by this product , this is far better in quality.Previously i used this product from some other brand and it was not this great.I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to have an awesome protein shake . .
 Very good product . Mixes well in both the blender and the shaker . Grood flavor ... even better with milk and peanut butter .
 Ive tried almost 3-4 brands of protein powders so far this one is the best . The GOLD series is my fav and the choclate flavour is the best in it ...
 The delivery of the item itself was amazing . Very fast and well done with packaging . I look forward to trying this whey protein out . I 've read some great stuff relating to it ! Definitely a buy off Amazon and can NOT go wrong with the price .
 ON 100 % Whey is by far the best on the market . I love Double Rich choc. , Banana Cream and French Vanilla . I 've seen good gains using this.The only problem
 The French vanilla creme in my opinion tastes great with milk , however with water it is just as bad as any other protein I have tried . The product is safe as advertised and one box lasts quite while , all pros . I am gaining significant muscle mass and definition 4 weeks into my routine , and I have had no consequential side effects stemming from this use . Would recommend !
 I 'm new to the protein world so I do n't have anything to compare against it . But for what its worth , this stuff works and the choc . flavor is great . Have a whey shake before and after workouts and a casein shake @ bedtime , have noticed quicker muscle gains while taking this protein . Will be trying other flavors soon .
 I 've been using Whey Optimum Nutrician for 5 years and it is a great protien supplement as well as very tasty .
 I 've been using ON Whey Extreme Milk Chocolate for a while , getting great results . The flavor was okay , but quite heavy on the sweet side , so I decided to switch to Double Rich . Ugh . That first taste was disgusting . I nearly spit it back out . But you know what ? I decided to give it a few days . I do n't know what happened , but now I LOVE Double Rich . What a difference between today and that first taste . It 's much less sweet than the Extreme , and seems to dissolve better in water for some reason . I 'll probably stick with this , but may check out some other flavors in small sizes . -LRB- 01/06 -RRB- Update
 i purchased the extreme milk chocolate and love the taste . not to mention it was cheaper then what i usually get at GNC .
 I 've used several protein powders and this is one I keep coming back to . When compared to others , it 's inexpensive , has good taste and has the desired effect . I would definitely recommend this product .
 This protein powder taste just like chocolate milk and it mixes well . I got a good price on the 5 pound with a subscription .
 The Milk Chocolate isnt that bad at all . It has a creamer in it that makes it very smooth and milkshake like . I only tried it with skim milk and a little water or almond milk and a little water . either way it tastes really good.I tried the cookies and cream and i like that much better but who does n't like cookies and cream.Next i want to try the toffee one but that usually is the most expensive of the bunch
 I bought the double chocolate flavor . I would mix it into 3/4 glass of water and then add 1/4 milk and the flavor was really good . Almost tasted like chocolate milk . Several people commented that it does n't dissolve well . I found that it took about 20 seconds of stirring to completely dissolve the powder . Results ? I ca n't really comment on that area . I am new to weight lifting , so it is all gains for me .
 Tastes good with water , milk , and in recipes unlike some of the other flavors ON has to offer . Now that subscribe and save has stopped , you can easily find a better deal outside of Amazon .
 This stuff tastes great , with water it tastes like Yoohoo , with milk it tastes like a very chocolatey chocolate milk lol . It is highly filling , and has very noticeable results , not to mention 24 grams of protein per serving , I use two scoops , so it 's 48 grams of protein per serving for me , twice a day .
 actually i just got the shake today and mixed it right up in the blender cup . this tastes phenomenal compared to the whey drinks i 've had in the past . strangely reminds me of mocha-coffee chocolate ... ca n't figure it out , and you do n't have to try . Tastes great , and that 's probably gon na be enough to last me for at least the first month of two of a baby fat revolution i 'm doing .
 I 'm not experienced with different supplements/protein so I do n't have a lot of credibility on the matter , but I 've been happy with my purchase . It 's exactly what I expected .
 ive tried many protein powders . . this is the best by far . i take 3 scoop in the morning and 3 at night . it helped me build bad ass lean muscle in 3 months . i workout 2-3 hours a day . i would definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants lean muscles mass .
 Taste great . I use it mostly for smooties but I also add it to my yogurt . I did a bit of comparison shopping and this was the best price around . Arrived on time .
 Not sure how to describe it but it does n't really taste like coffee . Not that the taste is bad ; it 's actually quite good , but not like any kind of coffee I 've ever had . Bottom line
 I am not sure why this is , but when ever I use this powder , I drop weight . And not just any kind of weight but fat . My midsection gets smaller and my upper body gets bigger . It only happens on this protein powder . I have tried dozens of powders but this one is by far my favorite .
 I was given specific guidelines by my surgeon , post-op Weight Loss Surgery , to drink a protein drink with more than 20g protein and less than 10g carbs per serving , 3-4 times per day . There are so many options on the market that meet those guidelines and making a decision can be quite daunting . I found Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard in a CAKE BATTER flavor and I was sold!Now , for the most important part of reviewing any protein drink ... IT TASTES GREAT !! I 'm so happy for the flavor options . I ca n't wait to try all the others . I am recommending Optimum Nutrition to all bariatric patients .
 This is an excellent product . Not only does it get the job done , but the taste of it is outstanding ! I love this and look to buy more once I 'm finished !
 Of all the protein powders I 've tried to date , this one is by far the best . It almost makes me skeptical that it contains any protein at all .
 Excellent product . This was what I was looking for . A very good protein product for pre/post workout . Highly recommended for those who does intense workout .
 The extreme milk chocolate flavor is the best ! I highly recommend this product to anyone , especially anyone new to protein powder because it does n't have the expected chalky taste I assumed I would have to deal with when taking this . High quality and best value for your money on the market .
 Whey Gold Standard is the only Whey Protein I order and use . Every flavor I have tried has been excellent !
 This tastes so good.When mixed with milk , it honestly tastes like a chocolate mint milkshake . When mixed with water it does not taste as good , but that is to be expected.One of my favorite flavors that I 've ever tried .
 By far the best whey protein on the market!Pro 's
 Gold Standard just may be the best Whey protein you can buy at a good price -LRB- ON 's Platinum Standard Hydrowhey is too expensive -RRB- . Barely any fat and all the protein you need . If you are looking for a fantastic Whey supplement , you do n't need to look any further.Also , for all you vanilla lovers out there , buy French Vanilla Creme , its the best . Avoid Vanilla Ice Cream , its horrible .
 Tastes really good , alot better than the cookies and cream . I can down this stuff with no problem , it 's really that good . Works great for post workout , does what it 's made for .
 Review is about the Rocky Road Flavor.From the 4 different proteins that I have had in the past , this one is by far the best tasting . I have tried Isopure Vanilla , Myofusion Delicious Vanilla , and Banana Perfection . The taste seems more natural , though not perfect , but still pretty close . It does n't have the creamy texture at all like the above brands .
 Not expensive tastes good reputable brand . The only negetive is the aspartame ... you might want to avoid this if you drink a lot of diet drinks and get a natural protein powder .
 I was expecting to add 1 pound of muscle to my body for each pound of Whey Protein , but it 's actually duplicating my expectations ! I have consumed 3 pounds of the product so far , and I already gained 7 pounds of muscle ! And the best thing is that I 'm just taking one serving per training day , after workout . I train one muscle per day , just 1 hour . The flavor is also great , at least the double rich chocolate . I do n't know if this is the best product but it 's working for me so I 'll definitely keep on using it .
 This is a pretty good protein and the company has been around for a very long time . It mixes pretty good in the blender , not sure about by hand . A little sweet n low goes a long way for that extra sweet taste and it has less fat than muscle milk . not bad at all .
 Its what it is , 100 % Whey.The only `` problem '' with it is that sometimes the whey gets clumpy , but i 'm sure thats just a property of whey protein.Good Quality Protein , with good Flavors !
 A friend recommended this product to me and I 'm so glad he did . I use 2 scoops of this Double Rich Chocolate flavor and add a cup of skim milk and about 7-8 ice cubes in a blender . I like that consistency the best . If I want a really thick shake , I 'll add about 10-12 ice cubes . I also add a tablespoon of organic peanut butter for added flavor -- that is REALLY good . I drink this within 30-60 minutes of waking and it keeps me full for about 4-5 hours . Great stuff !
 I really like Optimum Nutrition products . They mix so easily and they taste great . I 'm not a big fan of toffee , but my wife picked it . It is great !
 May be I 'm writing this review too early . So far , I have n't really seen any change . I know it will take a while for my muscles to grow , so i 'll modify this review in a couple of months . For now , all I can say is that the product tastes great !
 Great tasting -LRB- chocolate -RRB- and all around quality whey isolate for the price . You ca n't go wrong with ON . I will continue to purchase this whey .
 Product was as promised and arrived the next day ! I even ordered this item on a Sunday . Very impressive ... I know where I 'm getting every supplement I buy from now one . Ca n't beat the pricing and the speedy delivery . Chocolate whey is a pretty good flavor as well , the best I 've tasted so far , and I 've tasted a lot of their flavors .
 I have been using this for about a year . I still love the taste of the chocolate . I have increased in muscle mass and feel a ton better prior to using this . I was using the GNC AMP protein but that was getting expensive . This is working just as well and has n't given me gas like other proteins at this price or even higher . I will continue to buy and you should too .
 this protein ROCKS . some proteins give me acid reflux , i do not get this with gold standard . Also , for some reason , unlike other proteins out there , i dont get very gassy when supplementing with this protein . very clean , no artificial sweeteners , i 'm hooked for life !
 FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT 'S NOT GROSS TASTING OR HARSH ! MIX IT WITH MILK AND IT 'S REALLY GOOD ! JUST MAKE SURE YOU BLEND IT OR USE A SHAKER CAUSE IF YOU DO N'T YOU GET THINK CHUNKS OF CHOCOLATE ... . I WILL KEEP USING THIS
 The ON Mocha protein powder has to be the best tasting protein powder on the market . It truly tastes like mocha and does n't have that nasty protein after-taste . I normally add a teaspoon of instant coffee per scoop of protein powder to give me a bit of caffeine in the mornings .
 I 'm not going to go into too much detail . But the product is good ! The French Vanilla tastes pretty good and mixes well with fruit and berries . It also mixes well with water . It does n't clump . I recommend it to get some added protein in your diet .
 Love this protein powder . I 've had a hard time finding a protein powder that did n't taste way too artificial , chalky or too sweet . This double chocolate is fantastic . I mix with regular milk or with almond milk in a shaker ball bottle , and it gets mixed easily . The extra protein has made my hunger/blood sugar levels so much better in the afternoon . Highly recommended !
 Good taste and it is helping me keep weight on . I just think that it is slightly over-priced . I ca n't tell the difference between this and cheaper products .
 I am a college student who lives with 5 other housemates . We trust ON for our standard product . It is cheap and effective .
 This flavor is by far the best we have tried . I eat unsweetened cereal in the mornings and put about a third of a scoop in my cereal - sounds weird - but you have to try it ! Great taste , and my kids love it too .
 Love the taste I love almost all ON products but this by far exceeded my expectations . mixes fantastic with almond milk even when not using a blender . taste great . i would def recommend .
 I have been using this product for a few months now and the results are fantastic . I feel like I can lift more weight and go more reps when using this product regularly . Do n't lose faith if you do n't feel or see results right away . Work hard 5 days a weeks and use after each workout and you will notice a difference after probably a week or 2 . It tastes great too .
 Really good protein for the average builder , nice and tasty and is pretty clean . There are better and more clean proteins out there for cutting and toning if you want to look around though .
 There is nothing that ON makes that does n't have the least amount of calories with the most amount of protein and there will never be a better tasting product . I 'll never buy a different brand of Whey/Casein .
 My husband loves this protein . They sell it at our gym for more money so he thought Amazon might have it for cheaper and they did ! He loves it even more since it comes in a 10 pound bag and it lasts longer for him .
 I 'm a pretty serious lifter and have done tons of research on protein . It is pretty agreed upon that this stuff is the best bang for your buck . It gives you some of the best quality at an affordable price .
 This item was a great purchase ... it was a great deal and it arrived sooner than I thought . It was also exactly as described
 Everyone told me how terrible protein drinks were but the French Vanilla flavor of this brand is really good . I actually crave it .
 Tastes fine and its a pretty decent price . I recommend this to anyone who works out or needs mor eprotien in their system
 We are into good meal repolacements when the traditional is not an option . Great quality , easily mixable with cold water or milk or juice .
 This tastes really good . Compared to Dymatize , it dissolves better in water . Overall it is pretty good protein powder and one of the bests in its class .
 I love this chocolate flavor . It tastes good . But 5 pounds are too much for me , I think I need to spend one year using up this bottle of protein powder .
 After tasting the extreme milk chocolate you will never want any other . The extreme milk chocolate mixes well with a blender bottle , taste great and does not foam up from shaking . There are some whey mixtures which taste better , but for a pure whey , this is the only way to go . Highly recommend this flavor . Reputable brand . This combined with intense workouts = success .
 I 've used this for 5 weeks , 3 times/day with total whey intake approximately 0.7-1 gram per lb of body weight . I could go on and on about this product with technical details , comparative analysis and discussions of the pros and cons . Instead , I will put it in what I think are the terms that matter most to people looking to use this product . Remember , everyone 's physique is different and I have a fairly intense workout and diet regimen so your results may vary dramatically . No , I am not affiliated with the maker of this product or Amazon or any muscle magazine or whatever . I do n't know if other shakes would give the same results since I do n't plan to switch .1 . I rarely if ever feel sore when I wake up the next morning2 . My muscles have grown visibly and are measurably stronger . My bench press and lat pulldown have increased by 20 lbs each3 . My new pants fit and my old pants are loose .4 . I can wear form-fitting T-shirts without fear of being like the fat guy in a speedo on the beach .5 . Women who would blow me off are now giving me their business cards and phone numbers .6 . The End .
 I ordered a 5 pound Delicious Strawberry flavor and on my invoice inside the box it said delicious strawberry however the tub i received was Double Rich Chocolate . Im currently in Afghanistan or else I 'd send it back for a return .
 ok so i 'm not a body builder or an athlete , i 'm quite the opposite of that . i 'm lazy , unfitt , and morbidly skinny . for years i 've been trying to put on some weight to no avail . i 'm also a vegitarian and dislike to eat meat , yet needed the protein source ... hence the Gold Standard Whey Protein.i purchased the strawberry kind . i drink it with milk before i have my meals . the taste is n't as bad as i thought it would be -LRB- having tasted protien bars . -RRB- its too early to say that i 've had any real body changes , but hopfully this product can supply me with a dearly needed protein source that would drape my skeleton with flesh .
 After years of struggling with obesity , this product has turned my life around . Two months ago , I was parked on my couch watching reruns of `` Small Wonder '' pondering the idea of having a robot maid that could give me turkey whenever I wished . At this moment , I thought to myself , `` You are stupid and fat . Why are you wasting your time thinking about turkey-serving robots when you could be getting ripped ? '' . So I grabbed my laptop and started researching ways to get ripped quick . I did n't want to exercise because that is hard and I did n't want to change my diet because that 's what crazy people do . After learning as much as I could about bodybuilding , I came to the conclusion that I needed to pound protein shakes if I wanted to look like a professional bodybuilder . So I ordered 6 tubs of protein powder and started a very regimented daily routine of mixing protein powder into all of my drinks and food . It was delicious -LRB- except for the gravy incident -RRB- and you ca n't argue with the results I 'm getting . I have gained nearly 40 pounds and I can tell that in few more months , I will start to see my muscles start to bulge through my sweatsuit . Lookout summer , there will be a new contender for king the beach next year !
 I got this after I tasting a few Gaspari products and like this a little more with just plain water . I would recommend this
 Same great product , new scooper plastic though : - pPhenominal as always.ON is the only product i use for my protein
 This tastes essentially like it 's described . I find that it mixes easily into my smoothies . I 'm not hungry for hours after adding some of this into my smoothies .
 I have used many ON products over the last five or six years , but I have to say that this is probably the best all around product that they have . I would recommend that you use milk , you will be much happier with the taste that way . I take a hit of this mixed with ON 's micronized creatine powder before and after a workout , and that has been doing the job for me . Overall it is a very good product .
 The banana flavor is amazing , and its working very well for me . I plan on looking into some casein by ON soon .
 Mixes well , taste great ! I would buy it again for sure . Maybe the bigger size next time though . Cheaper then buying it on all other websites I could find !
 Best protein Shake out there . I love it . I drink it every day with milk and peanut butter in a blender
 This is by far the best protein shake available on the market . Not only are the numbers great , the taste is really good too , reminding you of a thick and creamy chocolate milk shake . Definitely recommend it !
 This whey tastes quite BETTER than the other products I have tried.Notice however that I DID NOT said that it tastes good . It kind of does n't , in special if you mix the product with water.With milk it tastes like a mix of coffee and chocolate.The results , however , are quite good .
 Delicious tasting protein product ! I 've tried other protein products which are absolutely disgusting . This product is the best I 've tried . I look forward to my work outs because I can drink this after . : -RRB-
 I 've been trying several differents products on the market , but only two products can give you a good balance between power , strenght , recovery
 It is nice to get a protein supplement that tastes like it is labeled . I drink one mix a day with a banana and 2 % milk -LRB- 4 cubes of ice -RRB- and it blends beautifully . I just hope they keep making it because usually when you find something you like , it is discontinued . I recommend it highly for people that love bananas .
 This is my first time purchasing protein for myself , being that I am on a diet , and I was not disappointed . I did n't know what flavor to purchase because they all seem so tasty -LRB- just by reading the name -RRB- so I decided to go with
 If you Google `` Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein '' it wo n't take you long to find out that this stuff is one of the best bang-for-your-buck protein powders on the market . So the real question is , `` How does it taste ? '' The cake batter flavor is OUTSTANDING ... seriously tastes like yellow cake and makes my morning smoothies even better . I 've been told all the other flavors are great as well , but I can definitely co-sign for CAKE BATTER .
 This is my second 5 lb tub of Chocolate Malt . It 's delicious -LRB- and nutritious ! -RRB- . I am a woman who lifts fairly regularly and recommend this to anyone . I also enjoyed White Chocolate flavor , but not as much . Double chocolate was ehhhhh . They 're all good with milk , but this one works with water just fine -LRB- saving the calories -RRB- .
 Been using gold standard for a while now . I find it good ; not too much filler . Easy to use , does n't clump . Taste 's good as well .
 One of the best tasting protein in my opinion . Easy to drink when mixed with water and does not taste bad at all .
 I ; ve been using this for about for weeks and it 's help me to lose belly fat when I started using it my body fat was at 27 % im only 5 ' 7 and now it 's down to 18 % I workout 3 times a week and before taking whey I was getting lower on the fat % be not as fast as with it . LOVE IT . ps get the Creatine .
 After 3 weeks using this product twice a week I got slight results . probably I could get better results if I follow the directions.Good protein !!
 I just got the Double Rich chocolate and I am drinking it right now . The flavor is fantastic . It is much better than any other protein shakes I have had . I will definitely buy this again and I ca n't wait to try the other flavors .
 use it everyday for the price and it taste great , , , , , , can not beat the price for the drink ... very good very good
 Its everything I wanted out my protein supplement great flavor quality ingredients and easy to read labeling so i know what I 'm putting into my body . The only down side to this product was trying to find the scoop in 10 pounds of protein : - -RRB-
 Athletes like Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey protein for their pre workout regimen . Muscle building protein is what they are looking for . The Milk Chocolate flavor helps it go down easy .
 I like mixing this with milk instead of water putting it in a blender and chopping up some bananas or other fruit and it tastes amazing . But if you dont want to mess with that it tastes good with water alone .
 I 've tried a handful of flavors and I 've been pleased with just about all of them . So far , I 've found that the chocolate mint tastes the best if you 're mixing with water , but that cookies and cream does a better job at getting really thick and frothy like an actual shake . Either way , throwing this in a blender bottle -LRB- with the wire whisk ball -RRB- and shaking for ~ 15 seconds is all I 've needed to get it mixed up enough to drink . This is definitely my go-to protein of choice .
 Mixes well , does n't taste nasty and artificial like most other protein brands . ON 's Gold Standard is great for people looking to keep lean with its low carbs and fat . I 've tried other proteins from ON , and other brands and ON Gold Standard is my go to .
 I have only just started using this . I love the fact that when I get tired of vanilla , I can add chocolate powder or peanut butter . I try to eat well but life being what it is , I do n't always eat what I should . I am past 50 yrs old and I am using this to make sure that my protein intake is being supplemented .
 5 lbs of good protein for 50 bucks a sweet deal . Much better protein then Walmart brand and for less
 I use a 5 pound in a month -LRB- 3 scoops a day -RRB- and believe you me I have tried every GNC protein flavor . I can confidently say this is the BEST protein shake flavor I have tasted . It is subtle at the same satisfying . Out of all the flavors for some reason this one mixes the best in water and milk both . It tastes heavenly in milk -LRB- I sometimes add a dash of coffee -RRB- . I like that it does not have the strong sugary taste like the strawberry at the same is perfect to the palate .
 Second protein shake that I have tried . It taste good by itself but I prefer to blend it with milk , banana , oats , peanuts and raisins to enhance the taste .
 This product has the best volume to price ratio I could find . It tastes great , and it really seems to help . I 've been using it since about January , and my 1 rep max in benchpress has gone from 240lbs to 280lbs . The only problem is , it 's a little hard to mix by hand . There are always little globby bits at the top no matter how long I mix it .
 I researched protein powders by reading reviews and forum postins and on whey protein was one i kept seeing again and again . It was cheap too -LRB- comparatively -RRB- so i jumped on it.I 'm trying to bulk up for my first year of college and this was the first powder ive tried . And its fantastic ! For taste anyway , i havent had it long enough to look for results . With water , its ok , kind of bland but not bad tasting at all . A bit gooey , could be a bit sweeter , but i still liked it . I have only tried mixing it with a spoon and it easily dissolves but clumps in goo floaters . Not a problem for me.When i tried it with milk it was delicious ! Tasted just like milk chocolate powder you get at grocery stores . Its almost too good as now when i get close to finishing my workouts i look forward too much to the postworkout snack and lose focus . Highly recommended !
 I have been using this supplement for over 4 years ... It is the best on the market as far as I am concerned with regards to price and taste and the low carbs it has ... I have friends who own a health food store and usually get a nice discount on the product but Amazon 's price is very hard to beat especially with free shipping ...
 Alright so I know there are already 1000 + reviews on here , most of which say how great the protein is so I will spare you the long drawn out pros of this product because those have already been vouched for in great detail . I will just reiterate that this is a great quality protein full of BCAA 's and other important nutrients at a reasonable price . However , the subject of my review is a flavor comparison that I think is useful for people contemplating which of the many flavors to get . I will update this review as I try new flavors by them . I will preface these flavor reviews by saying that all of them are pretty highly rated because ON 's proteins taste significantly better than much of their competition 's proteins.The flavors : French Caramel Toffee
 I had been interested in trying a whey protein to help my workouts for a couple of years , but was hesitant to start using it because I did n't know the effects or whether or not it would actually be helpful.After a little bit of research , and reading the reviews on Amazon , I bought a 2.5 lb . tub of ON 100 % Whey -LRB- Double Rich Choc . -RRB- and am really happy with the results . The biggest benefit I have realized from drinking a whey protein shake after my workouts is that recovery time is vastly reduced . I rarely get sore the day after workouts now . Combine that with the great taste and easy mixability of ON 100 % Whey , it was an easy decision to buy a 5 lb . tub once I finished my 2.5 lb . tub.I actually look forward to drinking this stuff after my workout is over . It 's a motivating factor in my workouts . I do n't allow myself to have a shake if I do n't have a satisfactory workout .
 I 've tried a few different brands/varieties of whey protein -LRB- my personal preference over soy or other forms -RRB- and the pricing plus performance benefits from Optimum -LRB- the pricing when buying on Amazon , that is -RRB- is outstanding.I bought the 5.15 pound size , double-rich chocolate . I do weight-training workouts 3-4 times per week and have 1-scoop with milk about 1 hour before my workout and then 1-2 scoops in a fruit/protein smoothie after my workout . Even with that regimen , I feel like I have not made a dent in the amount of protein powder I have left.More importantly , I feel very good and energized when using this in conjunction with my workouts , and have noticed significant lean muscle mass gains - a testament to this formula packing on the protein without the calories -LRB- in addition to obviously maintaining a reasonably healthy diet , etc. -RRB- With the 5.15-pound container , you 'll be getting -LRB- per scoop -RRB- : - 120 calories -LRB- 10 from fat -RRB- - 1g fat -LRB- saturated , 0.5 g -RRB- -LSB- 2 % of daily serving -RSB- - 30mg cholesterol -LSB- 10 % -RSB- - 60mg sodium -LSB- 3 % -RSB- - 3g Total carbs -LRB- sugars 1g -RRB- -LSB- 1 % -RSB- - 24g ProteinThe mix tastes good , blends `` relatively '' easily with milk -LRB- even after some vigorous stirring , you will still find little `` globs '' of gooey protein powder that never completely dissolved -RRB- , blends very well if you use a blender , and is overall a great product that I 'd recommend to anyone wanting to get more from their workouts or who simply want a good protein isolate/essential amino acids supplement -RRB- .
 As a personal trainer , I eat alot of protein - 250-300 grams a day . I know my protein . This is the best . It mixes well , it has both whey isolate and whey concentrate , contains a complete amino acid complex , very few carbs , and tastes great ! Other brands lack in at least one of these areas , and if they are equal , are much more expensive . I recommend this brand and flavor to all my clients .
 First off , this is the best protein drink out there . Cookies and Creme , Chocolate and Vanilla are the best for me . I still have Chocolate Mint -LRB- new for me -RRB- left to try in the pantry . I will say strawberry ended up being given away to a friend . Not that it was aweful , just not my taste nor close enough to strawberry for me . With that out of the way here 's MIXING 101 . The simple way to stir this stuff without LUMPS is as follows :1 . Pour the milk -LRB- LOL -RRB- .2 . Get your spoon .3 . Get your scoop of powder in one hand and spoon in the other hand4 . Start stirring the milk vigorously -LRB- get that funnel/tornado look going in the milk ! -RRB- and add powder in a continuous poor . NEVER stop stirring until scoop is empty . This is extremely important for LUMP FREE drinks : -RRB- I realize this is a `` pat the top of your head and rub your stomach '' at the same time sort of deal but it 's quite simple in practice . Also do not PACK the powder in the scoop so it will easily flow from it . I can add 2 scoops to a single 8-10oz glass of milk without ANY lumps ! No joke . No blender . Just a quick stirring of milk and a steady pouring of powder . Hope this helps someone . NO MORE LUMPS ! Works with other powders.Aaron
 Vanilla ice cream taste really good . I use a blender bottle with a ball whisk so it mixes things really easy . Before that blender bottle I was just using an aquafina water bottle with a wide mouth . That did the job as well . I get no clumps and I make no funny faces when drinking it like other protein powders have done .
 Great product double rich chocolate is the best $ 40 plus free shipping can not beat the price and it tastes amazing Best Product out there in the market with great taste .
 This item came in great condition and on time . The taste is a little funky , but as Protein Supplements go , you ca n't be the nutrition stats or the price .
 I bought this along with the chocolate one and both are great . The flavor is delicious . I do n't even have to use a blender to make it . All I do is measure out a scoup of the powder and slowly stir in my liquid Nothing could be easier than that . I mix mine primarily with water . The flavor is so good you really do n't need to mix with anything else unless you want to . I have though bought those strawberry/banana smoothie drinks you get in the produce section to vary up the vanilla . I use 1/2 cup of the smoothie and 1/2 cup water and it make for a yummy treat , great for a quick breakfast . I love getting that punch of protein without a lot of sugar . I think this product is high quality and have recommended it to my family and friends .
 This whey protein dissolved fairly well , as advertised by the `` instantized '' feature . Taste was good , but could use a bit more sucralose . Recommended .
 Use probably 3 - 4 days a week for a blended breakfast drink with some fresh fruit and frozen yogurt . Great !
 I mix 2 scoops with a cup of chocolate Silk and a frozen banana . The soy protein by ON makes a much better shake , both in taste and consistency , but this stuff ai n't bad . There 's a faintly bitter taste , but it 's still pretty darn good , and it does n't upset my stomach after a hard workout .
 This is a good price for a good product . It tastes vaguely like vanilla ice cream , which is somewhat unnerving at first , in terms of subconscious urges to eat ice cream , but you get used to it quickly . It goes nicely in lowfat milk , although if you use water it tastes fine . I like using a shaker to mix it , but you can stir it and it is instantized so it mixes better than some other whey products . If you have Prime it makes it a really good deal .
 awesome taste and results ! Definitely my new favorite ! I used to only buy Choc . Mint
 I had them all and this by far the best tasting one , I only hope they do n't get rid of this flavor !
 Easy to drink , not too sweet and I hear its one of the better proteins as well .
 Awesome Protein !! Some Protein makes you feel like your going to throw up its so thick and heavy . This product mixes and tastes awesome !!! I thought the protein I had before was good . . this is way better !
 There are many protein powders on the market . Really , do we need them to have all sorts of exotic names and have strange ingredients ? All you need to build muscle , stay lean and stay satiated , is plain whey protein . Chocolate is by far my favorite , I 've had vanilla , strawberry and other flavors , but chocolate is still the best tasting all around . I have been using this for literally years , and would not know what to do without it . Great as a pre-workout , and post workout protein drink , as well as an evening drink before bed time . I have had the casein powders before bed , but they take a bit to mix up , do n't taste as good , and it is milk based , but add this powder to milk , and you still have a casein protein mix . I mix one scoop before my workout with milk , one scoop with water afterward , with milk before bed , and I even keep some at work to help me through some hunger pains now and again . This sells for a great price too , ca n't beat it . I love it .
 Mixes very well . I would n't describe the flavor as `` double rich , '' but it 's not bad . Actually , I prefer it over most other chocolates because it 's not nearly as sweet . It almost tastes slightly bitter , like pure cocoa powder without nearly as much sugar , which suits me just fine . All that said , I 'll try vanilla next time ...
 Tastes great when mixed with milk , though I 'd recommend a blender-type bottle , as it tends to clump up . Good balance of protein without a lot of extra fat .
 I just reordered this product after trying to save $ 9.00 on another brand . Not worth it if I ca n't drink it . I guess I have been lucky at ordering the best tasting whey protien drinks and thought they were all the same , WRONG . I will stay with this protien drink from now on .
 I 've used this protein for over a year now , and I keep ordering for a reason . Best value for product and tastes good .
 Mixes easily with waterLow FatLow CholestrolForms a creamy shake with cold milk .
 Having tried numerous products , we find this brand offers two important advantages over others . It mixes well - spoon and water , leaving almost no traces of the powder in the cup . Taste - very good chocolate taste . I mix it with water and find it enjoyable . Wife uses yogurt and fruits then blends it for -LRB- what I feel is a week -RRB- for about 30 seconds . She refuses to try any other brand .
 This product is great . Not only does it taste great , but you get fast results . In order to recieve great results , you should be dedicated to going to the gym 4-5 days a week and you should be dedicated to a high-protein , low-fat diet . I got better results by taking this for two weeks then I did by using Muscle Milk for over a month .
 Really does smell like cake batter - the taste is closer to a very sweet vanilla . Has been delicious either straight or mixed with strawberry protein , and even in baked goods . Have n't found a stinker Optimum Nutrition flavor yet , though , so it 's to be expected .
 Mixes fairly easily like other whey proteins I have used . I put in two scoops , put in a little bit of milk just to cover the mound of protein in the cup , mix , and fill up the rest of the cup with milk after mixing . I got the double-chocolate flavor and it tastes just like chocolate milk when mixed with skim milk .
 it 's not as tasty as twin labs , but it 's healthier in some degree . . when i mix it with a blender bottle , if i do n't shake hard enough i get some white specks on the side of the bottle . . beats me what they are.i like it though and will prob purchase again .
 I use this product to give that extra fuel to the muscle after workouts . The most important thing to remember is not to consume in over-dose quantity.For instance , I take less than-half the spoon powder in about 9 Oz of cold milk.Also , I always look for the freshness of the product . The I got here is good through Sep 2012 . That 's good enough!In short , good product , good packaging , good price and good for overall muscle building .
 There is a good amount of protein per serving , and it was very cheap , but it also tastes cheap .
 The flavor is great . Much better than EAS vanilla . It mixes well , with water , or milk . A shaker cup is highly recommended .
 Good flavor and mixability . Whey is best upon waking and after workout . Problem is I got 10 lbs of this stuff . Oh well !
 I started dieting and working out again , and this product has really helped . In just a month I can see real definition in my arms and legs , and I do n't get quite as sore when I work out . For those who want better muscle tone and definition , you should definately supplement your diet with protein , and I 'd recommend this over almost anything else .
 I was looking for something to give me that extra edge in my workouts and games , and ON 's Gold Standard Whey worked beautifully . It is especially important for me to supplement my exercise this way because I do n't consume a lot of protein in my diet - I frequently get very fatigued only halfway into my workouts . I 've tried some protein powders in the past -LRB- namely GNC 's Wheybolic Extreme in vanilla -RRB- and while I got some boost to my workouts , I just could not handle the taste . I do n't have to tolerate ON 's Extreme Milk Chocolate - it is a pleasure to drink and easy to mix -LRB- I use a shaker bottle -RRB- . Yum !
 The vanilla ice cream tastes real good with 8oz of milk and this is a great whey supplement .
 I have my daily dose of milk , but I do n't really eat fish so I do n't always get a good amount of protein in my diet . I started taking Whey earlier this year , but it was the BodyTech Vitamin Shoppe stuff . Essentially tasted like flavored splenda and mixed in fairly well though there was some clumps on the side of the cups . It was only 18g of protein per scoop but it did the job and I noticed an immense boost in my stamina . Not `` I can lift 100lbs . more than I could before ! '' but more along the lines of doing more sets and just feeling tired instead of exhausted . What I like the most about Whey is you can neglect your diet a bit , have some Whey , and still get in a good workout.That being said , I bought the ON brand this time and have found a couple things I like more . First , its still in a 5 lb . tub but there is more protein in each scoop which means more servings . So now I just use a half scoop in the morning , half scoop shortly before my workout , and a full scoop after . When your working out 5 days a week and you drop 5 scoops , it adds up . HOWEVER , it only adds up if you get this stuff on the cheap like when you can find it for $ 35 - $ 40 . I went into GNC and they had this marked up to $ 53 + tax!Secondly , it mixes in WAY better than the Bodytech stuff . Not to say the Bodytech Whey was bad -LRB- my worst experience being with powdered Slim Fast shakes , what a clump fest without the aids of a blender -RRB- , but with ON , 5-8 seconds of stirring its completed mixed in with a spoon and no clumps . Upon consumption , you 'll only notice a light filament sparsely covering the sides.Last , it tastes great ... in milk . It actually has some flavor to it , like a better tasting version of those pre-made milk shakes you can get at a gas station or convenient store but with almost no sugar and very healthy for you . As for its taste in water ... anything less than a full scoop is fairly weak and fairly gross . This is for the Vanilla kind -LRB- ca n't speak for the Double Chocolate -RRB- . I 'm still trying to find a balance though with this and food . What works great in the mornings -LRB- for me at least -RRB- is some wheat toast , strawberries , and one of these in milk and it puts me off to a great and energetic morning . Using this as a meal replacement is ILL ADVISED . You will lose weight a lot quicker than you can imagine and really not put on any muscle -LRB- which for me is the point -RRB- . Also , neglecting your diet too much combined with this results in an accelerated weight gain , but not in the muscle department , more so in the fat department . This only happened to me when I was eating out like 3 days a week.Overall , I can say ON gets the praise it deserves . It mixes in well , so your not wasting any of your powder that you bought , tastes great , and really helps with muscle fatigue . Compared to the Bodytech stuff , they seemed to work about the same so to me Whey is just Whey , but I would still pay the little bit extra for the more protein in each scoop and the better taste any day of the week .
 This is the second tub of whey that I 've bought from Optimum Nutrition . The first was theOptimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100 % Natural Whey , Chocolate , 5.13-Pound Tub . In the future I 'll go back to buying the 100 % Natural version because this one is just too sweet . The 100 % Natural had just the right amount of sweetness but was not overwhelming . The first time I tried this one I almost gagged because it was so much sweeter . Now , this is coming from a person who thinks most of today 's popular cereals are too sweet . It still tastes very good and packs the same amount of protein . Strictly as a protein I 'd rate it a 5 , but , with the 100 % Natural tasting better , I 'm only giving this version 4 stars .
 I have been using this product for over a year and more consistently in the last four weeks . Use it about twice a day and I have seen massive gains in my muscle mass . Great product to use as a snack mid day or for your pre and post-workout shake .
 This stuff is excellent as protein supplements go . I mix mine with water , and would compare the taste to water-dilluted yoohoo . Then again , we arent consuming this stuff for the taste now are we?It mixes up easily in a shaker , and on one occaision in a standard glass -LRB- forgot my shaker -RRB- I was able to mix it just as well with a fork.I 've been using the product 3 times a day -LRB- breakfast , mid-morning , mid-afternoon -RRB- for about a week , with one more dose immediately following my workout on lifting days . It 's too early to talk about results , but I 'll follow up down the road .
 Ok , so I 'm not a breakfast eater . However , I do need something every morning . I have found that a protein drink works best for me . I have tried a lot of brands , and this one is the best . It tastes great . It mixes easily - without clumps . It is not thick and congealed . I actually mix it with hot water to make a hot chocolate drink . It satisfies my hunger for several hours . I like it .
 Good product , great price , decent taste . This was my second `` tub '' of protein I 've purchased . The first was a big drug store 's own brand in vanilla . The generic brand actually tasted better ; but this one 's not too bad -LRB- but I mix it with water only -- might taste better with milk and some additives -RRB- . Filling and feels good after a workout . I 'm hooked on protein !!!
 I expected the product in a week but it came way before that . Thank you for the fast delivery .
 Tastes very good mixed with milk . Clumps if you do n't use a blender or good shaker - standard for protein drinks - so you should have or get either one when buying this . Subscribe and save makes this product extremely affordable , and is n't binding - you can cancel single shipments or your subscription at any time . I will be keeping my subscription . : -RRB-
 This whey is the best amazon is the best has it at the lowest price . I drink this stuff 3 times per day . I will definitely buy again .
 Well , i have previously rated this protein in a different , worse flavor and gave it 5 stars , but after having tried the BSN Syntha-6 products , the most i can give it is 4/5 , but that is in the flavor department . I can not put them at the sasme level . That would be unfair to Syntha-6 and anyone reading reviews to try to make a decision on a purchase.In terms of quality of the protein I think everybody knows this is a very high quality product . If you are training and are not supplementing with protein you are probably not at your 100 % because the requirements of protein for a good balanced diet are way above the FDA suggested ranges . This product is very good for people trying to lose weight because it gives you a lot of protein and practically none carbs and fats . Mixed with one cup of skim milk tthe shake has barely 200 calories giving you a total of about 30grams of protein -LRB- 24g the protein powder and 6-8 the milk -RRB- . As i said , this is a very tasteful produt , but if you are trying to get something to make the protein comsumption delightful you need to look to Syntha6 . You will have to pay a much higher price per dose though . That is why this product must be consider excvellent too
 Of all the protein powders i 've used , this is the best tasting and easiest to mix . I strongly suggest mixing most flavors with milk instead of water , for the chocolate and banana flavors it makes it taste much better . Of the three flavors I 've tried , on a scale of 1 to 10 -LRB- 10 being some theoretically best tasting protein powder in the universe -RRB- , I 'd rate them : Banana Cream
 Very good protein powder . I prefer this to the thicker &#34; shakes &#34; because it feels very light and is easy to digest . The glutamine and BCAAs are helpful and useful in ON 's lower cost protein . I 'd recommend this over the more expensive ones because it 's less marketing , more value .
 I 've tried almost every major protein product on the market and this is the best by miles . Easy to mix and pleasant to drink -LRB- Some flavors even with water -RRB- you can a ton of value for your dollar . When you mix most protein powders you get clumpy parts but this dissolves pretty easily and makes taking your shake simple and enjoyable .5 / 5 Stars for me and a perfect product to take before/after you workout or as a quick snack .
 The good thing about this Whey is that you know what you are getting . If you are n't into a specific kind of workout plan this is a good baseline of your average gym rat . : -RRB-
 best $ around , if you like your protein powder get it from these people , tastes great , nowest price I have seen
 Pros : - Low carb-low sugar-low calorie-24g of protein-dissolves completely in very little water-cooks wellCons : - taste is n't that great -LRB- for an ON protein powder -RRB- . Definitely does n't taste bad , just not as fantastic as their other flavors.-thickens a little when it sets -LRB- only have had this happen with this flavor . Possibly from the artificial caramel bits -RRB- Overall awesome product , but I 'd just suggest the mocha or extreme chocolate milk flavors over this one .
 Put this in my coffee in the morning . Was getting tired of vanilla . I use a hand mixer to make sure it 's stirred well . Tends to settle out a bit toward the bottom but a gentle shake of the thermos before decanting a cup helps to minimize that . A small price to pay over the typical chalky taste many of these products have .
 ON does a great job and delivering the pure needs through their supplements . When I 'm not on a low-carb diet but still need good sources of protein , this is the stuff I take and can still enjoy it .
 This showed up on time and this waaay cheaper here then it is on Optimum Nutrition 's site . This kind does n't make my stomach hurt like other protein powders . Also it tastes & mixes better too , it does n't get in nasty clumpy chunks in the shaker cup . I 'm not in love with the price , but i really do n't know where you would get this any cheaper .
 I first bought the Cookies N ' Cream version of the Optimum whey . It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time , and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it . However , the taste of Cookies n ' Cream is n't really that great and small cookie bits can be annoying . However , I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate , and is something you can really enjoy . But in the end I guess it 's all about personal taste , it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n ' cream but not the chocolate.On a side note ; Taking protien shakes does not develop your muscles , or give them an complexion or even make you bigger . It all depends on the type of workout you have . You grow outside of the gym not inside the gym , however , muscles need to be repaired after a good workoutm and that 's what protiens do . They repair damaged muscles and strengthen them , and at the same time make them bigger .
 Here are my ratings for the flavors that I 've tried so far.Extreme Milk Chocolate
 People often say in reviews of protein powders and other health and fitness dietary products that the product is delicious . I try it and am underwhelmed . The people who rave over protein powder are clearly unaquainted with good food -LRB- that 's what comes of living on egg whites and skinless chicken breasts -RRB- , or they 're comparing it to some of the really horrible stuff out there . The best I can say about the flavor of any of these products is that it 's uninteresting . So let me say that the flavor of this whey protein is uninteresting . It certainly is n't bad . It could certainly be made better by the addition of ice cream , but that sort of seems opposed to the spirit of drinking protein powder.I 'm sold on this stuff because it passes the kid test . My kids like it . Like most kids , they are n't into interesting flavors , and they are n't into eating the delicious and nourishing food we put in front of them every night . Also like most kids , they like chocolate . The double rich chocolate version is convincingly chocolatey to anyone who does n't know better -LRB- like my kids -RRB- . I put this powder in a Nestle 's Quick can and tell them it 's chocolate milk -LRB- note
 So - you 've been researching the 7000 options for Protein Powder and you 've landed on Optimum Nutrition 's Gold Standard . Good choice . The quality of the product , the price and the reputation are all great . Now you need to decide on a flavor . After all - if it does n't taste good - it does n't matter how much it costs . You 're a chocolate guy/girl and think that 's the safest bet . If you 're getting 5 pounds of something , you need to minimize your risk ! But do you go with Chocolate or Double Chocolate ? I had the same question , so a co-worker and I each got one and did a taste test . Here is what we found : Chocolate
 I just wanted to point out that I 've now tried every flavor with only water , ranging from the merely ok -LRB- Strawberry Banana -RRB- , to pretty darn good -LRB- Chocolate Caramel Toffee -RRB- . However , my last three orders have been identical . I have discovered the best flavor by far which is ... Drum roll please ... CHOCOLATE BANANA!But wait , there is no chocolate banana ! That 's right , I now order two containers of Banana Cream , and one of Double Rich Chocolate , to make my 2:1 Banana : Chocolate shakes . I encourage everyone to try it , it 's beyond delicious , even with just water .
 I recommend it because I am trying to lose weight -LRB- and succeeding -RRB- . I 've lost 20 lbs this month , but that 's incorporating eating healthier -LRB- higher protein diet and organic food -RRB- and excersize . I drink one shake in the morning -LRB- I just mix it with 8 oz of skim milk -RRB- , and one after weight training . It works for weight loss because it does not contain all of the fat , calories , and carbohydrates that other protein powders contain , e.g. , Muscle Milk . Do n't get me wrong Muscle Milk is good for those trying to bulk up , and pack on the muscle . This protein powder simply gives me the protein that I need to build/maintain muscle compostion which subsequently burns my body fat .
 I 've been using protein supplements for over ten years . There are a variety of factors that determine the price of protein powders , the two most important of which are quality of the protein and taste . For the most part , you get what you pay for . Cheap protein is n't very high quality and often tastes like chalk . Really expensive protein is high quality and tastes good , but you 're often paying for advertising . Optimum Nutrition is a solid quality product - not the most pure , but very good -LRB- and I 'm not convinced there is a big difference between moderate range and elite range proteins -RRB- . So , the quality is very good , but on top of that , the Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey line is one of my favorite tasting protein powders I have ever used . I have tried most of the flavors , and they are all above average ; Most I would rate 4 to 5 stars -LRB- you can buy a package with a single serving of about 15 different flavors - I got mine from Bodybuilding.com -RRB- . For the price , this is by far my favorite protein company . I go through one five-pound jug every two months . I recommend it to all of my friends . My favorite flavor is Extreme Milk Chocolate -LRB- 5/5 stars -RRB- . It is fantastic with just milk , and I like to make shakes with it in the blender using ice , milk , bananas and peanut butter . It has been one of the best selling supplements on Bodybuilding.com for years for a reason . Try it , and you wo n't be disappointed .
 I like vanilla vs. chocolate - more versatile . Can always add chocolate flavor or mocha mix , etc. . The French Vanilla Creme mixes well and tastes great - no after taste . Besides my afternoon fruit smoothies , I add some to my morning -LRB- Kashi -RRB- cereal to up my protein intake in morning . I add some frozen triple berries -LRB- Costco -RRB- to my bowl , thaw in microwave , add about 1/2 scoop over berries , add low carb , hi protein Kahsi cereal , top with fresh bananas and or strawberries , add Silk Almond Milk or Coconut milk and voila , have a complete meal with balanced Protein , Carbs , Fats . I also tried and liked ON vanilla Ice Cream . Very similar to the French Creme . I switched my subscription from the vanilla ice creme to French vanilla creme - so I guess subconsciously I give the French vanilla creme a slightly higher rating . As for nutritional value - I 've found Optimum Nutrition to have quality products . I 'll let others that know more about nutrition write about that ... but as far as taste - this is a great product . Mixes well without lumps -LRB- I use a blender -RRB- and tastes great.I also add a little to pancake mix when making pancakes ... and add some berries -LRB- triple mix or blueberries -RRB- . If not eating meat , it is hard to get protein level to where it should be -LRB- for me about 25gm per meal -RRB- . I read that using protein powder should not exceed 50 % of your daily protein intake . In other words , is not a substitute for high quality meat protein.I also use Muscle Milk -LRB- purchased at Costco -RRB- and alternate using ON and MM ... MM also taste great -LRB- Vanilla & Chocolate -RRB- and mixes well ... between the 2 I prefer ON Gold Standard .
 good stuff ... comparing the nutritional label to the CytoSport from the Makers of Muscle Milk 6 lb bag I usually get at Costco for $ 30 's , but the price is creeping up increasingly . I 've also bought EAS Whey which among these 3 I 'd rate bottom on taste and mixability , it also gave me a bloaty/gassy feeling . The ON has a lot less Cholesterol , Fat , and Sodium per serving . Both of their chocolate flavors taste great . I work out everyday doing 5-8 mi of running , followed by weight/strength training so I ordered 2 - 10 lb bags w / Amazon 's Subscribe and Save for my morning protein smoothie and my post work out protein supplement.Price is good/competitive w / the S&S ; and cost effective bulk sizingNutritional facts are goodTaste is goodMixes and goes down well even in plain water.here is the Nutritional facts from the 3 that I 've tried .

 Out of all the whey protein powders I have tried , this by far is the best . It does n't give me the stomach disturbances the other wheys did and the recovery time is shorter with this product , which means , you can workout with better intensity . This is my favorite whey and will always use it . It tastes great too .
 Got me bigger is a really good protein product and im looking foward to get a new one i defenitley recommend it !
 We love this brand of whey powder and keep several of the flavors on hand . The banana whey always runs out first . I wish Amazon would put it back on Subscribe-and-Save and offer the discounted price that 's available on Vanilla and Chocolate whey .
 I bought this protein powder in the double rich chocolate flavor upon receiving a raving review from a friend of mine . I have n't used protein powder in a while because the ones I 've had in the past tasted awful , but I decided it was time to give something new a try . This is THE best tasting protein powder I 've ever had ! After a run yesterday I mixed a scoop with a little bit of soy milk and I thought it tasted even better than traditional chocolate milk . I ca n't wait to try it in other smoothies and snacks . If you are on the fence about what flavor to get or what brand of protein powder is for you , I can tell you that this stuff tastes great and the stats are really good as well . It 's very low in fat -LRB- only 1g per scoop -RRB- and high in protein -LRB- 24g per scoop -RRB- with fairly minimal calories -LRB- 120 kcal per scoop -RRB- . Also , I ordered mine through The Vitamin Shoppe and they provided a great price and free shipping for any order over $ 25 . I figured since it was free shipping I may have to wait the 3-5 days to recieve it , but was pleasantly surprised when I came home the day after ordering it and it was on my door step . So thank you Vitamin Shoppe for your great service and great product - I ca n't wait to try some of the other flavors !
 Great Protein !! Especially for the price I bought it for . Please mark it down again because I will make sure that I will buy another one from you .
 I bought the Whey Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate on the recommendation of a friend . While I know that everyone says GNC is way overpriced , I 've been using their Wheybolic AMP 60 for a long time and have been very happy with it , both in terms of taste and performance . The Gold Standard is just as good in terms of performance/recovery as far as I can tell . It 's less expensive , but there is pretty much no taste . This is n't a big deal to me , but some people might care . The good news is that it does n't taste bad , it just does n't taste like much at all.I 'll probably continue to buy it , although I may buy both this and GNC 's AMP 60 and just mix them together and blend both the supplements and the price . That 's typically what I 've done in the past with different protein powders while transitioning anyway , but I thought I 'd try this on its own so I could write a fair review of it first . Where this product works really well is if you want to mix it into food , like oatmeal . It does n't really affect the taste that much , whereas most other protein powders I 've used would be pretty noticeable if mixed with oatmeal.Hope this helps someone .
 There 's a reason why it 's rated # 1 . This is the only way to go and has great tasting flavors , well so far I have only tried chocolate and vanilla , but it 's perfect.I have had probably about a dozen different brands of whey protein and this is hands down the best . No foamy or synthetic tasting stuff here.Nothing left to say except `` buy some '' .
 I found this Gold Standard Coffee very tasty . Gold standard is very well known in nutrition world and this presentation is no room for error.I used this protein mix with unflavored cereal . I can combine this as good meal.I felt the same effect than other gold standard proteins . Easy to digest and it has a mix of different proteins ; you can use between meals or after exercise.Highly recommended for someone who needs a protein for all purpose and avoid having 1 type of protein for pre-workout and after-workout .
 Great product . By far the best whey protein on the market . Would recommend to anybody , regardless of fitness goals , because it 's simply a great supplement staple to have .
 I have been working out pretty heavily for the past 3 months . I work out for 2 hours 4 days a week and 2 miles before that . I never thought in a million years that I would buy this stuff but after seeing the reviews , I had to give it a shot.Taste : Not too shabby , another review said the strawberry tastes `` deity '' . It does have a slight hint of something other than sugar but all in all the stuff resembled a bland Strawberry Instant Quick . ... which is good , since quick was the sweetest thing I think I have ever drank . 1 out of 10 I give the flavor an 8 . As in I could drink this stuff for a month with out any worries.Results : After using it for 2 weeks I did start to see more of a build after a work out . Before taking this supplement I noticed a plateau in my muscle growth . After 2 weeks my arms started gaining again . ... This stuff works.How to use it , for men anyways : Take your weight and then use that number to use the number of grams of protein per serving . Example
 I have used this product in the past and have always found it to be as good as the ads and literature say it is . This Optimum Nutrition product comes in several flavors and I have tried several but the Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite . It is easy to mix with skim milk `` my favorite '' even if all you have is a shaker . I would highly recommend this ON product to anyone seeking a high protein powdered drink mix .
 I have only tried the Double Chocalate flavor but it taste really good . I drink mine with water and even then the taste is still better then some of the other chocalate flavored protein I have had .
 Although a great protein supplement the price has been sky rocketing for the past few months . I bought this thing for 27 bucks around 3 months back and then it went to 36 about a month ago and now its 41 !! I 'm sure there isnt a a good reason for this price hike . The sellers are just trying to rip the buyers off for a good tasting protein . It seems my days with this protein are over . Will have to research for a new protein now .
 I 've reviewed several different brands . ON had high protein per serving similar to the $ 40 - $ 50/2lb . container brands but I paid like $ 15 shipped.I have n't noticed much muscle gain yet but given the number of lifters claims It should start soon . I have noticed that I do n't get as sore after lifting.The taste with milk is delicious . I got the banana cream and it tastes just like a shake . I tried it with water the first time and it was pretty bad.I 'm happy with it and will continue to order more .
 I read reviews on how people did n't like the taste , to them I say get a life ... what do you want ? Build muscles or get fat eating candy ? It does taste good , it could be better , but I did n't buy it for taste alone . Some people do n't like brocolli either , but it is very good for you too . Bottom Line
 I used to use Designer but switched to Gold Standard 100 % Whey.Gold Standard tastes great , mixed better , has more protine , and has more servings . What more could you ask for?Thank you Optimum Nutrition for making a great protine.Dan
 Assuming its doing what it supposed to be doing , this product is excellent . Throw in some ice cubes , ice cream , a banana , a mango and a scoop of this in a blender and you have a very nice smoothie .
 This whey powder has a lot of proteins and will help you develop your muscles if you have a regular trainign routine . This product wo n't work if taken alone without excersicing.Best served cold . The chocolate flavor is kinda artifical , vanilla is great . Enhance the flavor by adding some milk and a fruit -LRB- like a banana -RRB- .
 Been doing P90X and wanted a protein supplement to help me recover after workouts . I went for the `` Extreme Chocolate Milk '' flavor and mixed a scoop up with a glass of milk and it tasted like just like chocolate milk . I used a whisk to stir so I would n't get any lumps and this tastes delicious . I thought I was going to have to force myself to drink a protein shake , but not with this!Love the flavor and it 's a great way to get a boost of protein !
 This protein was by far the best I have ever taken ! I have taken several but this gave me the best recovery . I strongly recommend it !
 Does what it is supposed to do . Does not taste bad at all . RAWR I 'm a dinosaur two words left .
 This whey powder is by-far the best product I 've tasted . I 've also shown a lot of growth in pure muscle after using it . I 'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great protein supplement . Just mix with milk or water and you 're set .
 I usually get the chocolate flavor protein powder and it taste just fine to me . I have been using Gold Standard for years . No complaints .
 I got the 2 pound chocolate malt flavor from my gyms nutrition shop about 2 months ago , and this stuff is great . It was pretty expensive there , but I 'm so glad I found this on amazon for about half the price ! The chocolate malt flavor was n't that good , and at first I did n't like it that much , but I 'm used to it now . I see that a lot of people recommend the double chocolate flavor , so I 'm just about to order the 5 pound double chocolate and see how it is .
 I 've tried my fair share of protein powders and have to say this is one of the best.The POSITIVE : Good Taste - The Double Chocolate tastes more like rich chocolate milk then the generic brands.Mixes Well - This is a big one for me ... I hate when there 's chunks no matter how well you try to mix it . This Gold Standard Whey protein seems to mix well , especially if you blend it.Cost - The price is n't too bad especially if you buy the 5 pound container . It 's not as cheap as you 'd find some generic brands , but there 's a reason it 's cheaper.The NEGATIVE : Nothing I can really think of ... I 'm strictly speaking about the Double Chocolate flavor though.OVERALL : It 's a great protein powder . I definitely recommend it to everyone .
 I bought this protein power because chocolate and mint is always a winning combination and this powder lived up to that expectation . I wanted something that I could easily throw together in the morning since I rarely have time to make myself a filling breakfast . I ended up also purchasing a blender bottle which worked perfectly with this.At first I mixed the shake with only milk which was very filling as I usually make between 24-28 oz -LRB- to last me until lunch -RRB- . Since I was going through milk very quickly because of this I started mixing half milk/water and eventually only water . Even when only mixed with water this flavor was still really good and I could finish an entire 28 oz shake easily.Overall this flavor is very good since it can be mixed with either water or milk and still be tasty while also filling you up .
 GOLD STANDARD is a proven product . Ive never been a fan of Protein Shakes because of the taste/after taste but GOLD STANDARD have changed all of that . This particular flavor is hands DOWN the best . Its rich and creamy . It taste so good I almost feel guilty drinking it lol
 the best supplement on the market for protein , &#34; taste great , more muscle &#34; . love this whey protein brand . gym rat must have .
 I do not like the taste of this at all an will stick with the vanilla from now on ... Still provides the same top performance despite the taste .
 All of the flavors I 've tried have been great tasting and the vanilla ice cream is no exception . The powder mixes easily in a shaker cup with no clumping , even if you add a little too much powder . The flavor is great with milk and still very good with cold water . Warm water is drinkable , but not necessarily the best . I have had no ill effects -LRB- upset stomach , cramping , etc -RRB- while using this protein . It 's a great protein , not really much else to say !
 If you want to get large with better tasting stuff , guzzle this shake.My biceps now have triceps ... Doooo eeettt !
 I 've been using this protein for the past 6 months now , and it is one of my favorite out there . The price at Amazon is the cheapest thus far and the quality of the protein is great ! I have tried countless brands or types of pro tine out in the market , but non have had such a great taste with only using water as this . I 've gained approximately 20 pounds of muscle mass from only taking this protein , some creatine , and lifting weights 4 days a week for the past 6 months . The fact this pro tine comes with 71 serving is amazing for the price . Do n't get all caught up in all the hype over the latest and greatest by salesmen out at your local stores or online . Stick with what has worked for others and most of all , what works for you . Here is a quick breakdown ... Pros : - Taste-Ease of use -LRB- water to keep the calories down -RRB- - Price-Amount of servings you get-Results !! Cons : - Other flavors may not be as good such as `` Natural Strawberry '' - Large tub to carry around-Having the same flavor over and over gets a little old after 6 months-Making sure you have a reserve tub before you run out = -RRB- Not too much of cons if you ask me . I 'll try the cookies and cream next to see how the taste is . Try the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor , you wo n't regret it . Best of all , it is very light and goes down easy . Hope this helps !!
 Simple the best protein I have ever used . Extreme milk chocolate is surprisingly good , and tastes great when mixed with oatmeal or soy milk . It might be a little expensive compared to other brands , but you get what you pay for . No cramps , bloating , or gas . . Ever !
 Tastes great and high quality . After reading that consumer report which showed a number of top whey protein shakes -LRB- like Muscle Milk -RRB- had bad for you heavy metals , I sought out this powder because it scored well on food safety . Happy to report it also tastes great . Tastes best with milk but doable with water if you just want the protein and no carbs .
 Optimum Nutrition Classic Whey , Vanilla Ice Cream , 2 PoundThis is the best tasting Whey product as you can make it straight or mix with with your favorite coconut water and fruits ... Its a must for me every day !!! Love this products and have been using it some time ... Highly recommend the ice cream vanilla !
 Best Protein on the market . Best flavor by far is Extreme milk Chocolate , trust I have tasted all the rest and Extreme Milk Chocolate beats them out ! Even mixing it with just water is Delicious !
 I do n't usually rate products because everybody has their own brand or product they like . But for me whose looking to become lean and maintain a good muscle mass this is fantastic choice . In addition of taking Optimum Nutrition Pro Complex and 100 % casein . It provides a 24 g of protein and with 5 grams of BCAA . You can take it before workout , after workout or even when you need some Protein in your system . Overall , great product , great taste and if you want to make it better add milk and slice of banana for even greater taste .
 Just received and tried out the French Vanilla Creme . It mixes well with water and tastes pretty good -LRB- tastes like watered down French Vanilla ice cream , or something along those lines -RRB- . But tastes better than I expected and mixes easier than I expected . I just used a funnel to put a scoop into a water bottle , filed it up with water and shook it , that 's all it took . I 'll buy this again , and maybe try out some of the other flavors . But this one is pretty good .
 Great product . Exactly as described . Does everything it says it will do . Has an OK but not great taste . Came in fast time and perfect condition . Would recommend !
 This chocolate milk is really delicious . I used to be a big supporter and fan of nesquik -LRB- sp ? -RRB- but ever since I bought this chocolate milk I wo n't turn back.Tip
 I can Only comment on the taste . I just received My can today . It came just in time too . So i threw in a scoop of it in the blender along with a banana and ice . It made a great smoothie-like drink .
 This by far is the most delicious shake I 've had ... . literally tastes like an ice cream milkshake ! I added peanut butter that was awesome . Also purchased cream of coconut that I 'll try later today . Definitely recommended .
 I picked up ON 100 % Gold Standard Whey Protein Powder just a few days ago and I love it . I got the double rich chocolate and the taste is n't that bad . It is n't as sweet as most other powders but its a no-nonsense powder with no extras . I checked some of the powders I was using and was upset with all the additives such as crystalized taurine and creatine but ON is a straight and to the point powder.One additional thought
 Bought the vanilla ice cream flavor of this whey protein powder and I am not dissapointed ! Best whey protein out there ! Getting noticeable results . Girls are all over my biceps now that I lift and drink this shake after every workout ! Does n't taste good unless you mix with milk . I drink with water so it is a low calorie shake so I keep those washboard abs for the ladies . Enjoy !
 Sure if I had tons of money I would diversify my proteins a little more . With that being said , I truly do not believe that you will be disappointed in this product if you use it in accordance with a proper exercise program and diet . All their products taste great , do not give you gas , and mix quickly.I chose The Vitamin Shoppe as my vendor because `` Bodybuilding.com '' wants to charge $ 18 for shipping to an APO address and The Vitamin Shoppe did it for $ 5 . I use to think that Bodybuilding.com had the fastest shipping , but The Vitamin Shoppe got me my protein to Misawa , Japan in less than 6 days !!!!! That is record time . They shipped the order the very next morning.Thanks again Vitamin Shoppe !!!!!
 When i was on my diet , I could not eat chocolate . and instead i had this stuff all over the place ! I would make some after my work out and it would calm my hunger , and it would speed my metabolism i think its a great product
 This protein is the standard of the industry . I do prefer the other vanilla flavor . Buy this stuff here for the best price !
 Great price for the amount and protien contentMixes extremely well -LRB- this is super key for me -RRB- Tastes Pretty Good -LRB- I like the Banana just a little bit better -RRB- I do n't look like Arnie or Stallone yet , but hey I 've only had it about a week ... I say give it at least 2 more weeks and then I will look like them .
 I have used BSN Syntha 6 for quite some time now . Figured with all the great reviews and price I would give this a shot . Protein itself is okay I guess with fewer calories , less fat , I think 2g more protein per serving BUT for me , the taste and consistency is no where near my Syntha-6 . Using same ingredients -LRB- 8oz water , 1 banana , 12 cubes of ice -RRB- Syntha is much thicker and I feel , much tastier . Do n't get me wrong . Great product , great price ... loses a star for taste . For a few bucks more ... going back to Syntha 6 as my daily drive .
 You might think this protein is expensive , but know this
 This product can have great results if used in the right way -LRB- e.g.
 24 Grams of Protein in about 60 seconds flat . It does n't get any easier than this . This is THE best-tasting protein whey I have tried . It tastes just like chocolate milk , only thicker . The powder mixes easily in my shaker bottle , even without the wire-whisk ball . I 've noticed that some other protein shakes are gritty in texture , but the Optimum Nutrition stuff is smooth , with no hint of grit . I 've tried it with water , 2 % milk and Silk . The best flavor/consistency can be found by mixing one scoop with 7 ounces of Silk ... excellent stuff !! However , it should be noted that the `` 5-lb '' container is not 5.15 lbs -LRB- 77 servings -RRB- shown on Amazon or Lindberg . It 's 5 lbs flat , which will net 74 servings . I opted for Double Rich Chocolate , so maybe there 's a discrepancy that 's dependent on flavoring .
 I take some daily for breakfast & some before going to bed . Taste pretty good in water , not delicious but good . I got the vanilla one .
 It is an odd thing , the taste of cake batter . But it is very tasty . I can down it no problem in water ... but in skim milk or Almond Milk , it is a very nice drink.I have tried this and the chocolate and I prefer the Cake Batter .
 Like the title says , it 's the best whey protein supplement for the price and Amazon has it for the best price . Any other store is going to charge you around $ 15 - $ 20 while Amazon will deliver it to your door for free . It mixes up easily -LRB- I use cold water and a spoon -RRB- , and it tastes surprisingly well ; easy to get down just in water . Now if you really want it to taste good then try it out in a blender with fruits and maybe some OJ , milk -LRB- almond milk is awesome -RRB- , etc. . . But hands down I 've been using this for years and it 's the best . Do n't fall for the hype of over priced junk . Protein is all you need to gain muscle and you can gain it just fine without this product . But this product is great for post workout and can do what regular food ca n't in that short hour after your workout when you body is begging for protein . And it 's just the best way to get those extra grams of protein in , in between meals.Consider their Casein protein for bedtime protein too as it digests slowly throughout the night.This is the best guys , I speak from many years bodybuilding experience . Just look at the reviews for yourself and decide .
 Gold standard is incrediable , great tasting , and reasonably priced , the blend of strawberries and bananas works well it was a nice change from the chocolate varities I normally bought . I usually make a shake out of it add a few more bananas to it and low fat frozen yogurt . some ppl like to mix it with water me personally I go for soy milk -LRB- silk -RRB- it comes out just like a milk shape taste great and this is one brand you dont have to hold your nose to swallow . because it desolves to well its easy to take right to the gym as long as you have a shaker . I would recommend this flavor to anyone . . FYI if your not sure what flavor you want if your looking for a new one everyones taste is different try the packettes . . different varities for one use only this way you can rule out the ones you dont like when your purchasing larger sizes this way you wont waste your money learned that lesson the hard way .
 I have tried several other brands of protein powder , and by far , this is the best brand I have used ! It mixes very easy , it has MANY flavors to choose from , and the vanilla flavor -LRB- s -RRB- mix very well with fruit , etc. . It has a great mix of many of the vitamins , and nutrients that you have to take with `` other '' brand protein powders.All this , and add to it the low Amazon price + subscribe and save feature , and you have near perfection ! I am currently buying the 10lb vanilla ice cream flavor , and paying slightly more than if I were to buy the 5lb tub at GNC stores .
 This is great value for money . Though a bit more expensive than other powders , the protein per serving , taste and mixability ranks highly . I dont have a mixer and simply used a spoon and that worked just fine with minimal clumping at bottom -LRB- very minimal -RRB- The vanilla ice cream tastes great and is a pleasant drink to enjoy , not merely tolerable . Very smooth when mixed with milk.The cookies and cream is OK but sweet and not as creamy as the vanilla . My cookies and cream also has a slight bitter after taste could be a bad batch.Overall very good value . No regrets -LRB- except will only buy vanilla as of now -RRB-
 Great product I use this Gold Standard Whey as a daily dietary supplement and found the brand to be one of the better on the market . Will continue to buy this product
 Better get it from here then any other place . the prize is awesome . and this is the best it gets if ur in protein shakes . all you got to do is mix it with banana and it tastes awesome ohh and milk lol dont use water
 Gold Standard packs a lot of protein into a single scoop , so you do n't have to mix a ton of powder . I have been using the chocolate flavor for three years , but I have recently switched over to the banana flavor . Not only does it taste much better -LRB- to me -RRB- , but it mixes more completely with the milk . As for results , this protein powder has assisted me in moving from 147 pounds to 172 pounds over the last three years of working out .
 Our family has used Optimum Gold Standard 100 % Whey for years . Both my adult boys are athletes and use it every day . One of them is sensitive to milk products and this does not upset his system at all . My husband is a bodybuilder and feels that this is one of the best products of its kind on the market . We make smoothies , use it in coffee drinks , mix is on the go with water ... whatever the use , it tastes great . We like vanilla as it mixes best with all types of frozen and fresh fruit .
 This is by far the best flavor I 've had as far as whey protein goes . I 've tried strawberry banana , double rich chocolate -LRB- ON Whey Gold Standard -RRB- and strawberry milkshake Muscle Milk . ON Whey wins by far , the other stuff was complete junk compared to this . I will always have a tub of both strawberry banana and double rich chocolate sitting around - strawberry banana to mix with my oatmeal in the morning -LRB- DELICIOUS ! -RRB- and double rich chocolate for the much needed protein after workouts . I 'll be sticking with Optimum Nutrition for a long time .
 I 've bought several tubs of this protein and really enjoy it . I have NEVER had a protein powder that mixes this easily , which really makes a huge difference . The taste is awesome as well , maybe a tad on the sweet side , but that can be easily adjusted by adding a little more milk , water , etc. . I usually mix a scoop with oatmeal every morning . A great buy in my opinion .
 Taste great if you use milk and put the right amount in . It does n't taste as good with water though .
 If you 're like me you do n't like wasting money on useless supplements . I spent over $ 300 a month trying lots of Different products and after almost a year of testing this product , ISO-pure zero carb , and ON 100 % casein are all I use . Yeah you could spend more but why ? I use this for bulking along with maltodextrin . Now food sells big 12 lb bags as a complex carb .
 Optimum Nutrition has been # 1 rated protein for years now . There is good reason for it . Its the highest quality of protein , the taste is absolutely amazing , and the price point is better then anything your going to find.it doesnt contain other supplements , just straight protein . It doesnt clump up when your mixing it , it doesnt have a horrible after taste either . Its just straight wholesome goodness.This stuff cuts recovery time from muscle exhaustion dramatically . Literally over nite muscle soreness evaporates into a figment of your imagination . Im not a rep for Optimum , just a proud user for quite a few years now.I will always buy Optimum , and nothing else !!
 Okay , I will admit that the only other whey protein I 've had is muscle milk , which I guess is a whey/soy blend . The two flavors of muscle milk I tried were disgusting . That is why I love 100 % Whey by Optimum Nutrition . Not only does it have some great nutrients and a lot of protein for the price , but it is also a pleasure to drink . I like to put it in my shaker with some crushed ice and it comes out tasting chocolaty , delicious , and refreshing after a hard workout.I have been doing the P90X workout program , and I started using this whey protein to supplement my diet . I drink it before and after workouts -LRB- if you 're on a budget , just drink it after your workouts as that is when it is most effective -RRB- . I went away on vacation and did n't take any whey powder , and I noticed I was more sore after workouts and became fatigued more easily . I can honestly say that I am currently in the best shape of my life right now . My flab has been shrinking and my muscles have been swelling and I have this fine product partly to thank for my success.The only complaint I have ever had about this stuff is that when I ordered my last 5lb tub the scoop was buried deep inside the powder . Since I had just finished my last tub I still had that scoop to use , but if someone was ordering this for the first time , they would have had to fish it out somehow . Aside from this minor inconvenience , this product is the best bang for your buck I have found on the internet and makes a great compliment to your exercise regimen .
 ON Whey Gold Standard lives up to the hype ! Very easy to mix and great tasting ! This is without a doubt a cut above the rest ! I used EAS for years and have tried Muscle Tech . This is a little more expensive , but definitely whey better ! Plus , mucho savings through Amazon 's subsctription program ! Best price I could find .
 love this stuff will order it again when i run low best protin money can by dont by anything else but 100 % optimum
 I tried the `` Extreme Milk Chocolate '' based on a review below . It 's not bad but far from the best tasting protein supplement I 've tried -LRB- my fav ' so far is Bio Chem -RRB- . The powder does dissolve better than most and the price is right - especially with a subscription . I wish it used stevia for a sweetener rather than sucralose and other artificial sweeteners . Next time I 'll try `` Double Rich Chocolate '' for a chocolate flavor , or skip chocolate altogether . All in all , I 'm very happy with ON protein powder .
 Seriously tastes great , or at least , it does n't taste terrible . I have no problem drinking it . Mixes just fine for me , as long as the water is around room temperature , and not refrigerated .
 This product is high in protein and has great flavor which I never seen before in high protein supplements . I received the product in timely manner and it 's more than I expected .
 I 'm really happy with this product . I 've tried many protein powders and have always been very disappointed . In my experience they usually smell better than they taste . That is definitely not the case with this powder , although it does smell good . It dissolves well with just a little cup with a lid . I shake it for about 1 minute which is longer than when I first got it , before I would shake until it seemed combined but I would have some little clumps in the first sip and lots of bubbles . Then , I found that if I continued shaking for a while longer the clumps were all gone and so were the bubbles . I got the Double Chocolate and it tastes like regular chocolate milk , no weird after taste and no weird smell . Makes me feel great after a good morning run . I have n't tried to blend it with anything yet but there is definitely potential with bananas and/or peanut butter with some yogurt . The only draw backs are that it uses aspartame which you ca n't taste but I generally try to avoid artificial sweeteners and it is not Organic whey so probably has the growth hormone that I spend $ 4 on a half gallon on milk to avoid . I was just nervous about the bitter aftertaste complaints about the Optimum Nutrition 100 % natural powder , and it did n't look like the flavors were going to be as good . I 'll probably try it down the road but for now , I 'm really happy with this .
 This is our second order on this product . It has been beneficial to me and my wife to keep us going and able to do all the things we want to do and places to go.In fact , we have a standing order to ship every other month .
 excelente producto , proteina de altisimo nivel , la recomiendo para despues del entreno , gran precio para este gran producto , especialmente en la presentacion de 5 libras
 Please note this is for the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor.This powder is well worth it , at the time of this writing it 's $ 53 for a 5 pound tub of it . That is an absolute amazing price for what you 're getting . It 's about the same amount , per ounce , as the Six Star/Body Fortress -LRB- Wal-mart -RRB- powder I used to get.The flavor I have is a bit average . This is both a good and bad thing , with one scoop per 8 fl oz of milk it has a very mild milk chocolate taste , it 's not overpowering nor is it underwhelming . It 's an average taste with very little after taste.I have yet to try it in water though , as I 've never liked protein powder like that.It mixes extremely well with my Blender Bottle , within 5-10 seconds it was completely mixed and I had zero chunks leftover . I would have to highly recommend this powder . -LRB- And if you have the extra money , the Blender Bottle is a good pair with this . -RRB- One last note , be aware of the ingredients , there are artificial sweeteners in it . If you do not like this , I would recommend getting the natural whey from ON which is sweetened with a form of Stevia .
 Ive been takingON whey and casein for about two years now , mocha is the best flavor . Rocky Road smells like sour milk and makes me want to throw up but since I threw $ 20 on it im still taking it . Dont get cookies and creme or rocky road and you will be happy !
 This protein powder blend is one of the best I 've tried . I first used the product in 2003 . Almost 10 years and it 's still one of my most preferred recovery drinks after weight lifting , running , or martial arts . The protein is hydrolyzed and can be blended into a fruit-protein-shake or works well with powder + water in a shaker bottle . Research different brands and professional metrics per brand on bodybuilding.com to be sure this is what you need . Particularly important is the low metal count found in the Optimum brand . I found the unadvertised low metal values of this product to be quite acceptable for the price and excellent quality!TRAIN HARD WIN EASY !!
 This is the best whey protein you can buy . It is top quality , it has BCAAs for post-workout recovery , glutamine-it 's all there . Just take a scoop after lifting weights and in the morning for some added protein . The taste is also super great . I like banana cream the best , but strawberry banana is good as well . It goes great in shakes . My special recipe
 Taste is always subjective , but this one is pretty good . Clumps a bit when made and requires a vigorous shaking to mix but otherwise a good product .
 The quality of this protein powder is some of the best I 've ever tried . Syntha-6 move over . The taste is n't like any sweet milkshake or syrupy juice but it 's not bad either , and I usually mix any of the chocolate flavors with some unsweetened cocoa powder for an extra boost of flavor and antioxidants . It usually does n't all dissolve easily with spoon stirring but there are n't any large , hard-to-swallow clumps left behind either and it goes down easy . If you use a blender on it or shake it up vigorously in a thermos then it should all dissolve . Women should not be afraid to try this stuff , it will not buff you up or turn you into some She-Hulk creature , but it will effortlessly help create long , lean muscle mass on you if you are relatively active , plus it helps increase the speed of muscle repair and helps prevent muscle loss when you 're inactive for a stretch of time . Only 120 calories per scoop without excess sugar and fat , very light when compared to other powders or supplements . If you take a scoop a day of the 2 pound size it should last approximately a month but you can also take more scoops as needed or based on your activity level . Added to a breakfast or mid-day shake it can be filling , in combination with physical activity you can see the results of it almost immediately and it 's quite affordable too . Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard is my new go to protein powder .
 What further can be said about this product ? Mixes well in a Magic Bullet , tastes good , reasonably priced -LRB- comparatively speaking -RRB- , and does seem to help my muscles stay fuller longer , must really have some BCAAs in it . I 'll just keep showing my appreciation with dollars .
 This was just the protein I was looking for . For the quality it was a great price , I had to switch from a more expensive protein because I was going through it too fast . I ordered Chocolate Malt flavor , and I was nervous about the taste , but was very surprised it has a great taste . Mixes very well , no stomach aches , overall a great product .
 This is a great protein shake
 I have always been a fan of Optimum nutrition 's protein powder , but I wanted something more natural . So I mistakenly bought hemp protein powder , it may have been `` healthier '' but it tasted like I was on fear factor every time I drunk someI just bought vanilla ice cream because it was $ 10 cheaper than plain vanillaI am very pleased with the vanilla ice cream . I thought it might taste like fake vanilla flavoring , but instead it tastes like a well polished vanilla with hints of vanilla bean
 Great chocolate tasteRead great reviews about the productMade in the USA!Great priceExtremely fast deliveryLove the Vanilla ice cream flavour too .
 I love this product for its taste , not too sweet . the double chocolate mixing with milk taste like smoothie ... . hmmm . I love it . Recommend this product .
 My wife has been using this product for years ... usually available at health food stores . When we found it at Amazon we were amazed at the low price .
 One of the best when proteins out there . Most whey proteins if you look at the ingredients labels will have whey protein concentrate or some other less form of whey as their first ingredient . Not this on first one is When Isolate !!!
 Could n't be happier with this protein ! Defintaly works well . 24g of protein is a great ammout . And the added BCAAS and other stuff is a great addition to the protein , best of all it dosent taste like cardboard like most proteins ! The taste is actually really good , Esp with some added Peanut butter ! I defintaly highly recommend this product .
 If I had to review ON Whey with one word it would be `` Awesome `` Best Whey I have ever used by far . Me being into MMA and Crossfit , I look for a quality protein/meal supplement , and ON is by far the best . I 'm not going to say `` oh this stuff will get you jacked or that you will get massive gains '' because as a fighter I 'm not looking for that in any way , But I will say if you are looking for a quality protein supplement ON sets the bar for me and my training . But that 's just one mans opinion.Using Coffee flavor right now and man its SoOoOoOooo Good
 It is a good protein . Works well for me . I do not feel tried the following day after a workout . Taste is good . Does the job .
 Very popular and good all-around
 I 've been using ON 100 % Whey for about a year now , and I will continue to use it . It 's a great product , goes down well , and in combination with my 5x per-week lifting routine I 've noticed great results.I 've tried chocolate , vanilla , and cookies 'n cream.They were all pretty good , but my favorite is the chocolate . While the vanilla one tasted fine , for some reason no matter what I mixed it with -LRB- whether it be water or milk -RRB- I would always have a TON of foam after mixing it ; I would then have to let it sit for a few minutes for the foam to turn back into liquid . So , beacuse of the foaming issue with the vanilla one , I think I might go back to chocolate.But still , it 's a great product and I will continue to try other flavors as well .
 i am very happy with the taste of the extreme milk chocolate powder . it taste just like hot cocoa mix either in water or milk . it is okay in water but much better with milk -LRB- creamier -RRB- it doesnt quite dissolve in water or milk as quickly as the tub says . that is my only complaint . i would have like to seen an airtight peel off seal under the lid instead of a plastic seal around the lid .
 It 's great very delicious ... and reasonably priced.This is very good also . We are finding that a lot of supplements are over priced . We appreciate Gold Standards pratice of not gouging it 's clients.We love that too !
 Good protein is hard to find . There are a lot of choices but I 've heard good things about this brand before I even purchased it ... and I 'm glad I did.Price is great and the taste is better than most protein products I 've tried . The Mint Chocolate tastes like a Thin Mint shake . Musclemilk tastes a little better but it 's not a pure whey protein product like this is.Back to ON . It mixes really well so you wo n't get too many protein chunks floating in your shake .
 Good quality at the best price I could find . It tastes pretty good for a protein powder , and dissolves easily in a shaker bottle . Dollar for dollar , this is probably the best protein powder available .
 It really is `` instantized '' as the label says . You need n't a blender , hand mixer , nada . A spoon will do fine . The taste is more neutral then anything approaching delicious , and that 's a good thing . I mix it with 6 ounces of water and its perfect . Mild but real chocolate taste , it probably taste even better with milk . But as it is its lite , thin , easy to drink , and completely inoffensive . It 's not thick like other powders and leaves no sticky protein sludge at the bottom of the glass or elsewhere . Plus it has little if no vitamin taste . Or whatever that terrible protein taste is in other mixes.I have never liked protein drinks / shakes . Hate them as a matter of fact . But I can honestly say I do n't mind this at all . I actually like it pretty good . And since you can mix a whole scoop with just a little fluid and a spoon it makes it all the more easier to take .
 It is the best whey protein product available in the market ... Love this product . . have been using it for last two years ...
 The protein is of high quality , especially for its price . It tastes good , very easy to mix , and it 's good whey protein overall .
 There are other types of protein that I have tried over the years , and this is by far my favorite . With various different flavors to choose from , my personal choice is the Vanilla Ice Cream . With the vanilla base and a blender , you can create fantastic protein shakes by adding strawberries , peanut butter , or even chocolate . Drinking protein shakes every day , I prefer the option to change the flavors , without buying additional flavors of protein.This is also an effective protein source that I have had personal success with , and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to add muscle .
 Okay , so I 've been using ON Whey for a while . I feel like it gives me a little more bang for the buck compared to the traditional store brands -LRB- especially since it includes the BCAAs -RRB- . My only complain -- which I admit might be completely in my head -- is that the chocolate/coffee/whatever flavors that ON makes do n't mix anywhere near as well as the fruit flavors . Typically , the `` heavier '' flavors leave lots of unmixed globs no matter how well you shake up your serving . Meanwhile , the `` lighter '' flavors tend to mix rather well.Pretty minor complaint , though . If you 're trying to build some muscle , I suggest ON over any other brand . It 's hard to beat for the price .
 The product I received was exactly as ordered , and arrived earlier than expected ! I am extremely satisfied with the product and it tastes great as well . I will definitely buy this product again !
 very good whey , great value , taste is very good , mixes pretty well , the best product in it 's class for sure !!
 This is a great tasting shake . I use it in smoothies . I usually add frozen strawberries , blueberries or whatever fruit I have on hand . With a little ice in the vitamix , you ca n't beat the end result . Keeps the hunger away until lunch .
 Love it ! Tastes great and the results are what I wanted!I will buy this product again ! If you are looking for a quality product this is the way to go !
 Heard good things about ON products so I decided to try this . It mixes well with soy milk , but it has a weird aftertaste . However , i 've tried other products with even worse aftertaste , so it 's not a total deal breaker .
 This really does taste like coffee ice cream . I used a scoop with a cup and a half of soy milk . Excellent .
 We all know ON gets consistently rated # 1 whey , so thought I 'd try for myself . The ingredients in this protein are good , i.e BCAA 's , glutamine and whey blend , so it really comes down to taste . This double rich chocolate was delicious and mixed well . I had it with milk but think it will be pretty good with water too .
 I love the taste of this with my almond vanilla milk because it taste just like a strawberry and banana smoothie . adding water is alright but it just does n't taste as great . The powder blended really well you do n't really need a shaker and i did n't feel bloated after . low on carb and fat so overall best protein shake i ever had .
 The product came quickly , and the price was the cheapest that I have found on the internet or in a store .
 The Chocolate Malt flavor is delicious with either water or milk . I usually take two scoops after a workout and sometimes one in the morning . AWESOMEEEEEEEERAGEEEEEE
 I can not believe I did not discover this protein powder sooner . I 'm not a body builder , but I do like to finish my runs with a protein shake . I have no clue why I previously suffered through other various powders , but this one is a keeper . It 's sweet , but not overwhelmingly so -LRB- just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth -RRB- , and blends easily - A good 30-40 second shake in a bottle completely dissolves the powder . I most certainly look forward to trying the other flavors . On a more serious note
 I have had just about every flavor from optimum nutrition , The extreme milk chocolate is the best of all of them.The consistency is very creamy and the flavor is very rich in water.it tastes more chocolaty than the double rich chocolate.and its very easy on the stomach .
 This whey or that whey ? One of life 's great questions . Well this is the whey to go . One time I lost my whey , but then I found my whey again . The Kurds had it . Kurds and whey just dont go together . Keep the Kurds awhey from your whey .
 I absolutely swear by Optimum Nutrition ! This protein powder is amazing , and it 's definitely helped my muscle building and recovery . I 've tried a few of the flavors , all on other people 's advice , and I did n't care for most of them . That being said , I recently decided I 'd go against the warnings about strawberry flavored protein powders and try Delicious Strawberry . WOW ! Anyone who said this flavor was gross is absolutely mad ! The name says it all ! It tastes like strawberry milk , but with a hint of strawberry candy flavor . It 's honestly the best flavor I 've tried and I 'm completely in love with it . I 've tried Cookies and Cream , and yuck , the cream flavor is WAY too strong and it tastes more like a really sweet cream and mocha flavor ? I had to hold my nose while drinking it . I 've also tried Extreme Milk Chocolate , which I also did n't care for but it was more tolerable in milk . Vanilla was good for it 's mix-ability , but it tastes more like sugar cookies than vanilla . And it sort of makes everything you mix with it taste like sugar cookies , unless you mix it with something strong like orange juice -LRB- which actually does taste good -RRB- . However , I was unable to drink any of these with just water without gagging . With Delicious Strawberry it 's PERFECT in a nice cold glass of water ! So refreshing and yummy ! If you like strawberry milk and have a sweet tooth , DO NOT be put off by what other people say ! Try it !
 Optimum Nutrition 's Extreme Milk Chocolate is a very tasty product ! I have tried their French Vanilla Creme , Vanilla Ice Cream , Cookies and Cream , and Double Rich Chocolate and my wife and I both agree on the Milk Chocolate being the best of the bunch there.Both of the vanilla flavors tasted pretty similar to one another and were pretty good and easy to mix other `` things '' in . What will turn either of them into AWESOME is to take a scoop of whey , about a cup of ice , half a cup of low-fat vanilla yogurt , one cup of frozen strawberries , and one cup of skim milk -LRB- need a big glass ! -RRB- . Blend that together for a shake that tastes sinfully good ! We have used other fruit , but if you like strawberries , you ca n't go wrong there.Another option with either of the vanillas is to mix just like above , but leave the fruit out , bump the milk up to one and a half cups , and put in about one quarter teaspoon of nutmeg . It takes a little imagination , but it will have an eggnog flavor that is pretty darn good.Both of the chocolates are pretty similar tasting too , but the milk chocolate is our preference . My `` normal '' shake there again is about one cup of ice , half a cup of low-fat vanilla yogurt , one and a half cups of milk , one scoop of whey , and I like it sweeter , so I add in 8 drops of toffee flavored Stevia -LRB- also sold here on Amazon -RRB- . Love it ! Every now and then if I am needing more calories for the day , I will make that same shake but add in 1 tablespoon of peanut butter . Ok , so Reeses still does it better , but you 'll appreciate this recipe if you are a fan of peanut butter cups ! Instead of peanut butter , try a scoop of instant coffee for a mocha.The Cookies and Cream flavor kinda missed the mark in my book . It has a twang to it that I just do n't like . Chocolate and vanilla are way more versatile in my opinion and let me make them into whatever I want them to be , so I 'm going to stick with them !
 I originally bought the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor at a local shake store and was impressed by the flavor and consistency . It really tasted like a good milkshake . I bought my next container from Amazon because it was a little cheaper and I wanted to try a different flavor . The Double Rich Chocolate is okay but not as yummy . It tastes slightly bitter and not as sweet as the Extreme Milk Chocolate . When I finish the Double Rich Chocolate , I think I 'm going back to the Extreme Milk Chocolate .
 Each serving has one gram of sugars . This is a great product for people looking for a low carb protein source . The French Vanilla Creme is wonderful , like a vanilla milkshake .
 Bought it for making high protein smoothies . TASTES GREAT !!! Mixes easily . Low -LRB- er -RRB- calorie count . I would recommend this to others .
 optimum nutrition never disappoints . I 've been buying this stuff for 4 years now and the 10lb bag is the bets
 I was recommended this flavor by someone who had tried way more Whey than me ! I have to agree compared to the others had tried this one is superior if you like Chocolate . Do n't be afraid to pour a little Organic Valley Whole milk in there with it . Taste the difference .
 If you 're a choco-holic , you 're going to love it as much as I do . I love having a post-workout shake that consists of this protein , bananas , and peanut butter . It 's ' heaven in my mouth :D Good buy .
 The Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor is delcious and does n't leave an aftertaste ... It is a great product , with lots of protein !
 this product is definitely delicious !! When I finished this container , I ordered the Strawberry flavored one and that was a BIG mistake . I 'll never order anything else sbut the chocolate . that is SO GOOD !
 Same great protein powder as GNC 's optimum whey but for a mere fraction of the cost . Both protein powders are produced by Optimum Nutrition , Optimum uses higher quality ingredients .
 We 've tried several different brands and flavors for whey protein powder , and the Extreme Milk Chocolate by Gold Standard is by far the best tasting . My kids LOVE when I make a shake with Publix low fat frozen yogurt , milk and one scoop of this delicious protein boost . This is their favorite quick breakfast during the school week .
 This is the best tasting whey protein on the market . I make it with Skim Milk and have three shakes per day . This is ideal for people who have undergone bariatric surgery * gastric sleeve * and need to maintain their protein intake .
 I work full time night shift and I like taking this protein drink to work . I vary the flavors -- this one tastes great . It fills me up and is very convenient . I am not hungry the rest of the night .
 I 've always liked Optimum Nutrition products , as they use high quality ingredients and overall have good products . So naturally , when I started my new diet/exercise regimen , I knew O.N. would be the protein I would use.I purchased the double rich chocolate , and the flavor is pretty good for a protein powder . It 's even better in milk , but I ca n't currently do that in my diet . Aside from the high quality whey , I like the fact that it has BCAA 's , including a significant amount of Glutamine.It 's also a good value , although next time I 'll go for the 10lb bag , as it 's even cheaper .
 Great taste , great balance of high protein , lower carbs and fat than some of the others out there which works well for me since I think my carb intake the rest of the day seems high that I do n't need to add a ton with my protein .
 This stuff is the best ... hands down ... I lose weight and keep muscle with this . Period . No fluff or filler .
 Tastes great , and it 's good for a normal weight training person like me .
 First off , I 've used a lot of protein powders in the past . I ca n't tell you which ones have worked better than the others or anything like that . No change in protein powder is going to make you bigger ; you get bigger and stronger by lifting consistently and correctly , and also by providing your body with the correct amount and type of nutrition.That being said , from the nutrition facts label , this is by far one of the best proteins out there on the market . The taste is great -LRB- and I just drink mine with water -RRB- and you can tell that there is n't too much sweetener in this powder . I 've used muscle milk before and still do occasionally when it goes on sale , but there 's way too much sugar in it . Optimum is always consistent and holds itself to the highest of standards ; they put out products that you can trust in . Aforementioned , I drink this as a supplement after my workouts . It 's a well known fact that one must provide him or herself with a healthy dosage of both carbs and protein shortly after a workout , and that 's precisely what I use this for , especially when I know I ca n't get a meal in within forty five minutes of finishing a workout.In conclusion , you ca n't go wrong with this protein . I have n't had any problems with it and I 've been using it for a while now . It is my protein of choice . 5 pounds should last a while . I definitely recommend it . Four stars
 I ordered this just to try out since I ran out of my ISO Pure protein shake and wanted some change . So if you 're switching from Dutch Chocolate ISO Pure to this Double Chocolate ON Whey , you would find that ISO Pure had a much better taste when mixed with water.It took longer for ISO Pure to mix with water and it leaves some sort of residual white granules after you drink it all , which to date I do n't know why they were there in the first place . However this product mixes easily and well with water a little too well to an extend that you 'd feel you 're just drinking flavored water . So initially it took me a while to get used to it but then I found a great way to get around its viscosity , I started mixing it with my Banana shake in the morning and to tell you the truth , my shakes never tasted better.I would recommend this product for two reasons . 1 . It tastes amazing with milk and 2 . that it is more affordable than ISO Pure by almost 30 bucks or more for the quantity . Both of them have similar specification so the results should be similar too .
 Good product , the only negative is that if you are not using a blender the powder never dissolves very well
 This protein has excellent flavor , like a strawberry banana smoothie ! Dissolves well . Large size lasts a long time , good deal compared to prices at chain stores !
 Taste - amazing compared to most on the market . Not for you if you like the super sweet saturated fake sugar proteins . High in BCAA 's and glutamine for recovery . Best protein for the price I have tried , and I have tried almost every major brand . Only down side is cholesterol as with most whey proteins .
 This is a very good protein powder and my boys love the taste ! It is not chalky like many are .
 I like ON whey , I just am not a fan of the artifical ingredients in the whey I can afford . My favorite flavor is extreme milk chocolate , but rocky road and double rich chocolate are so-so . Not bad .
 This powder tastes good and works well . Optimal Nutrition includes high quality products and ingredients in their supplements . Never had any problem with this product .
 I 've been buying this stuff regularly for the past 5 yrs -LRB- every other month -RRB- and love it . Tastes good , great source of protein , and easy on the stomach .
 It 's rare to find a protein powder that tastes good ... this is it !! Banana cream is the best flavor followed by the double rich chocolate . So good !
 At the current rate of $ 53 with tax/shipping , this is the cheapest quality protein powder I 've found . 33.37 grams per dollar . It has extremely low fat and carbs as well , which makes it easy to control those factors as desired . I mixed one scoop with one ice cube , 1 % milk , half a banana , two tablespoons of crunch peanut butter . It 's really a dessert and does n't upset my stomach like some other brands I have tried .
 This was the first Gold Standard product I tried and it was effective and delicious . I either just mixed it with milk or made a banana and peanut butter smoothie with it . Not only did it taste good , I saw results .
 This flavor is tasty when mixed with water . It is definitely worth the upgrade over cheaper chocolate brands , which I did n't like enough to purchase again . I would order this flavor again
 noticeable lean muscle growth in the first month of use . lean great tasting post workout -LRB- double rich chocolate -RRB- . relatively low in calories , great taste , great results , and great price . 5 *
 ON products are a great value . This stuff is hard to beat , and it has glutimine already in it ; Bonus ! shop around you will be hard pressed to find better bang for the buck on protein . Tastes good too .
 Lightweight and delicious . Ive been slurpping this stuff down for two years . What more is there to say?Best blended with milk and a banana !
 This is still my favorite protein next to their Pro Complex series , which I occasionally switch to for the higher protein content , depending on the training . Both the Gold Standard and Pro Complex lines blend , digest and absorb very easily and are n't all loaded down with sugar like CytoSport products -LRB- although they are sweetened with Sucralose -RRB- . For my money , I want great quality , and when it comes down to it , you ca n't beat brands like Optimum Nutrition , BELDT - Force Thermogenic , MusclePharm , and MRI . Especially when locked into bouts of high-intensity training.I normally blend the Gold Standard double-chocolate with ice and water , but cheat days I 'll toss in a couple scoops of sugar-free vanilla ice cream . Beats ANY Muscle Milk .
 I have tried other powders such as EAS , GNC , etc. . This is by far the best and easiest to mix . I use a blender bottle to make sure is mixed well but forgot it one day and just put some in bottle water which worked with no lumps . Great protein too , 24grams in 1 scoop ! Also taste is much better than others I have had . French Vanilla creme has the creme aftertaste which I am not a huge fan of -LRB- even with rootbeer -RRB- , but still much better taste than other name brands . Will try chocolate next .
 The cookies and cream flavor is by far the best flavor I 've had of this product . It works just as good as the platinum standard and its a lot cheaper . Overall great product .
 Well I have been lifting for a couple of years now and optimum has a great product . I have always gone to walmart and grabbed whatever whey protein they sold . The biggest difference I noticed was the quality of the product . Optimum whey protein mixes very well and is easy to drink . The brands at walmart had more calories and were very hard to swallow . If your like me and trying to lose weight this product is great because of the low calories , compared to other brands .
 Its a great product tastes good and if you do n't like it there like 20 different flavors . Only thing is i prefer the ones without sucralose .
 My wife and I enjoy smoothies for breakfast but run out of whey powder quickly . This 5 pounder not only is delicious , but is also a good value !
 I have used optimum 100 % whey for a few years . It tastes pretty good and mixes easily and it does not contain milk products to upset my stomach . Amazon has supplied this product at a great price and is an excellent company to do business with .
 The price is n't too bad on this protein , especially if you subscribe to receive it regularly through Amazon -LRB- which I do -RRB- . From what I 've read , it is a very effective protein for the price . Would recommend for those looking to start a protein regimen .
 I like this protein powder a lot . It tastes very good and is also easy to digest . It does not upset my stomach at all . In contrast , some other proteins give me acid reflux which is very inconvenient . Price wise it is also competitive with other products in the market . I will be using this in the future as well .
 I switched from protein plus -LRB- jillian 's recommended -RRB- that i bought at Target to Optimum Nutrition based on a friend 's recommendation . He claims it is better , higher in protein isolates . I 'm not sure . it has 5.5 grams of BCAAs ; PPlus had 5 . It has 24 grams of protein vs. 25 of PPlus.I had my first shake tonight . I can say , using the exact same ingrediants , this tastes much better . Seemed to blend better , but that might just be appearances . However , I do like the tastes . Seems to cost about the same also . Not enough of a difference to dicker over .
 Easy to use , good taste , and mixes very well with just water and a spoon . A product that I plan on buying in the future !
 My son is a hockey player and I purchased this for him to use as supplement after practices and games . Previously , we purchased the EAS powder , but after reading the Consumer Reports article decided that it would be better to find a brand that had less issues with dangerous impurities . The Optimum brand items reviewed in Consumer Reports passed . He mixes it in milk and it tastes fine , not great . It would be nice if it disolved easier , but it is no worse than the EAS powder . My daughter -LRB- a soccer player -RRB- makes fruit smoothies and adds the powder . Really ca n't say if it helps or not , but we are happy with it . As a parent , I like it for my kids as a snack replacement after exercising , but not as a meal replacement .
 OK , so this review will cover the taste and smell because I just started taking it but I will upload a result review along with exactly the list of other products I 'm using ... The smell when you open this is like you just opened the front doors to the willy wonka chocolate fountain room ! Your mouth instantly starts to water ! And the taste is just as amazing ... feels almost sinful if your on a great diet . I drink this every morning before my morning jog and as my 1st meal replacement . I put in my Black 28 Oz . Blender Bottle W/wire Shaker Ball with a raw egg ,2 1/2 teaspoons of peanut butter , about 1/2oz vanilla bean soy milk , and also a teaspoon ofOptimum Nutrition Creatine Powder , 600gand 6-8 oz of water . I think the taste is delicious and I am ready for it every morning ! Now again I will post up a results review after faithful routine usage .
 Great product and taste good too . Ca n't say much more about this product but had to use 14 words.One more word was required .
 I love this powder really fulfills my hunger , and it 's great after working out ! I combine it with shakeology and improves so much the taste of it and the you get much full with it . I personally use half and half of a regular scoop to take more advantage of shakeology since is SO expensive .
 I do n't know about you , but when I 'm done getting swole , it 's time to get my Wheys on . I always reach for ON Gold Standard Whey , because the taste and price ca n't be beat . But I did not expect to be in for such an amazing treat when I ordered my latest jug of protein goodness . Optimum Nutrition has given their 100 % Whey Gold Standard a Gold Medal facelift , with a balls awesome gold foil label . But they did n't stop there . The scoop in the jug has been refinished with gold as well . I feel like a champ scooping out a double scoop serving of pure awesome into my blender . The blender trembles with anticipation at getting a chance to mix all that double chocolate madness into a shake for my enjoyment , and nourishment.If you 're serious about becoming the man -LRB- or goddess -RRB- you can be , then you have to get yourself some of this amazing Whey .
 I 've tried many without much difference - the cheaper ones at Walmart , etc. as well as the bulk EAS at Costco - but after trying this I noticed a very big change in taste and performance .
 It tastes far better than vanilla ice cream , but cookies and cream is still my favorite . I would not order the vanilla ice cream again .
 Great protein , easy to mix , tastes great and works ! The best protein I have tryed and it is easely digestable as well .
 First time I buy protein powder . Read many reviews of wired tasting products . This one has an excellent taste even with water . Go for it !!!
 I use the Vanilla Creme protein powder in oatmeal in the mornings and in smoothies sometimes . Drinking this with water is less appetizing , as the drink will foam up a lot and it tastes pretty synthetic . Not bad , just not outstanding . I use the Extreme Milk Chocolate , which tastes great , for drinking after workouts or throughout the day . The chocolate is not as good for mixing with other foods , however .
 excellent choice for smoothies or by itself.mixes very well and tastes good too.i used GNC whey for a long time before i tried this.i can only say i wish i had found this sooner
 Super delicious . Need I say more ? Why is there a god damn requirement for words in this review . Nobody will find this helpful .
 I 've had miriads of horrible tasting powders in my days and most are damn irritating to mix as well . This powder is fair priced , easy to blend -LRB- I use a high quality immersion blender -RRB- , and tastes so good I even have it for a healthy dessert sometimes instead of a sweet . Choc Mint fan for life .
 This is a great product ! I was able to gain 10lbs of muscle in one month with help from this product . It 's cheap , taste great and the results are amazing .
 I first tried a 2lb container of the ` Natural Strawberry ' and loved it . I mix it with bluebrries and it 's a great way to start the day . I liked it so much that my next order was for the 5lb container . I thought I was getting the same thing - strawberry , but the 5lb was ` delicious strawberry ' and it 's not good in comparison . It 's got a plastic artificial sweetener taste that is so overpowering I ca n't even taste the blueberries . Be careful when selecting a flavor . The product mixes well and I definitely feel better ... more energy .
 Bought this product and it works as it does . I 've used about half the tub , drinking 2 scoops post workout . Taste is on the bitter side but I do n't care about taste , results only matter on my boat . The product came in 2 days after purchase , which is average/fast . Great purchase nonetheless 5/5 !
 This is a great tasting product for those looking for a protein shake . It has a great flavor and dissolves great . I would recommend it to anyone looking to add more protein to their diet for whatever reason .
 This is a great supplement to take for nutrition . I take a serving after breakfast every morning and it improves my brain function throughout the day . I also take this before my workouts -LRB- usually basketball or weights -RRB- providing me with extra energy to exercise longer . IMO , it 's definitely good to have a bottle of this around to get that extra nutrition . I will always have this stuff around going forward .
 ON whey gold standard , Double Rich Chocolate was the first protein i tried . The taste is very enjoyable just like quik chocolate milk even though i drink it with water . I use a blender bottle and i never have a problem mixing it up.I have tried other brands of whey protein and i cant get my-self to enjoy them as i enjoy ON whey gold standard.About gains well I 'm working on it so cant really comment on that.For me this is the best Whey protein out there , I would definitely recommend it .
 This stuff mixes so easily that I have added it to yogurt , oatmeal , and even iced coffee . Granted , that was usually the Vanilla flavor , but I 'm sure you could get brave with the chocolate -LRB- or other flavors -RRB- . Less than $ 0.50 a serving if you sign up for the auto-renew is a great deal .
 They manage to give you a good price per serving and you can see results in about 2 weeks . I consider a great deal compared to the prices of all the other proteins out there and it really helps you out with you want nice lean muscles .
 I love this protein ! It is the best protein for the price that I have found -LRB- including bodybuilding.com -RRB- . With my Amazon Prime account I get free 2 day shipping and you ca n't beat that . This protein tastes pretty good and even with 1.5 scoops after a workout it 's lasted me more than a month .
 This protein tastes wonderful . It mixes easy and blends very well . I believe that this is the best protein available right now . I used to get protein at Costco , but this protein tastes better and performs better . I like the Double rich chocolate the best -LRB- personal preference -RRB- . I would recommend this to anyone looking for the best protein out there for the money .
 The best whey protein out there , in my opinion . Tastes decent , but I 'm not looking for taste in this type of product anyway . Definitely recommend this to anyone buying protein supplements .
 Its not a bad taste for a protein shake . For the most part its just ok , although there are some days when i ca n't handle it . I still love my chocolate !!
 I have used Whey Optimum nitirition 100 % whey gold for over a year and a half now . It is packed with protein and does help with muscle building and shorten your recovery time after you work out . I have tried the vanilla creme flavor and would say it 's a 4/5 , but stay away from the cookies and cream . The cookies and cream taste more like a coffee flavor and it 's not that great ; more like a 2/5 . I would recommend this to anyone who is starting to build muscle because it does help out . The shipping was fast in that it came in a week and cheaper to buy on amazon than in-store .
 The banana cream flavor tastes quite good with 1 % milk . I am truly surprised by how good it tastes . Highly recommend!The Chocolate Malt was quite disappointing . It 's drinkable , but not enjoyable by any stretch of the imagination . If I had a way to exchange it for a Banana Cream , I would do so in a heartbeat.Average score of 4 stars
 Chocolate flavor is delicious . Mixes fairly well . A couple of scoops in the morning on my cereal keeps me strong all day .
 Optimum Nutrition has great products in my opinion , not just taste but quality . Having had access to trainers from around the world , many different regimes ect this product is one of the best proteins I 've used . Only a couple of things with this product for me are , if you mix it with water it seems pretty thin . Not saying that 's bad , and it still has good taste with water . Just do n't expect it to blunt hunger for any amount of time . If you 're eating right , it wo n't matter anyway . Mixes well with creatine , cost is great comparably and I will buy it again . My opinion is that some of the other proteins add fillers , and say it has a lot of other ingredients to make it more appealing and ON does n't do that . If you want straight up protein that taste great , low fat , low carbs , then you will be happy with this purchase . If you 're chasing more of the all in one product , this is n't your bag then .
 If you 're looking for a protein supplement to add to your workout/muscle building routine , I highly recommend this on multiple levels . 1 -RRB- Price - I think I bought the 5 lb jar for about $ 45 on Amazon . At other health retailers , that price is easily in the $ 60-75 range . 2 -RRB- Taste - This is my second 5 lb jar . The first was milk chocolate , which I generally liked . The cookies and cream that I 'm on now is OK , and is the only reason this is n't a 5-star review . I had heard good things about this flavor , and figured I 'd try it , but it 's very vanilla-y for me . Finally , 3 -RRB- Results - I 've only been doing weight lifting/resistance training to bulk up for about 4 months now . The mornings on my workout days I drink a serving of the protein powder and then another serving after the workout -LRB- usually within 30 minutes of my cool-down -RRB- ; and in those 4 months , I 've gained 15 pounds of muscle . I had seen other products boasting `` 16 pounds of muscle in 4 weeks , '' but I wanted gradual change . The combination of a consistent workout schedule and this protein powder are definitely helping me achieve that .
 I like this protein , it was good . Taste like chocolate milk when mixed with milk awesome stuff . Optimu . Nutrition is good . It also mixes good
 I 've tried a few other protein powders out there and Optimum Nutrition is my favorite . I 've been lifting weights/working out for almost a year now . When I started , I was n't taking anything and was getting adequate gains , but I soon hit a wall.Adding this protein allowed me to get the amount of protein I needed to feed my muscles . My gains shot up dramatically and now I will not work out without this product.The taste is great too because I went through a 5 lb container and still loved it . I highly recommend this .
 This is the second 5 lb tub of protein powder I have purchased from Optimum Nutrition . I also purchased the Natural Whey they offer . They both taste really good , but I would say that the Natural version tastes a bit better . The Natural also seems to dissolve more quickly in liquids , which results in fewer powder chunks if you are mixing with a shaker bottle . Both versions are absorbed quickly and cause me no digestive problems . I really like both , but if I buy another tub , it will be the Natural Whey .
 Achieves the 3 things I look for in a protein powder . Good price , tastes good in a shake and cooks well . Highly recommended .
 I blend mine with milk and it tastes just like chocolate milk . Add a little extra powder or less fluid for a more sweeter taste .
 Whey is a siginificant source of protein . My son has been a user for over 3 years . He exercises and uses it as a source of protein as he lifts weights sometimes . He states that he fills satisified and not interested in eating junk food . His muscle mass has improved according to him.Whey 's claims on the nutritional label appear to be true and effective . My son would recommend Whey for other interested individuals.Great product!Yoli Navarro
 ON really hit a home run on the cake batter . I hope they make it a permanent flavor -LRB- it 's limited edition -RRB- because it 's definitely my favorite flavor I 've had yet . It does n't seem super cake-battery tasting but its a sweet vanilla-type goodness . I have n't tried it with water but I usually mix it with just 6 ounces of milk to get the thick batter experience . Lumps not an issue , mixes great . All around awesome buy !
 I 'm a hard-gainer with an overly lean frame , so I knew I should n't skimp when it comes to whey . Been using the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard for several months now , and it 's the best whey isolate I 've ever used -LRB- but that 's common knowledge anyway , there seems to be a consensus in the fitness community that this brand is the best -RRB- . The Mocha flavor is really good , the best one I 've had so far out of three -LRB- Strawberry Banana , Double Chocolate , and this -RRB- . As I said , I 'm not a coffee drinker , and this is still my favorite . Protein shakes always still manage to taste worse to me , compared to a standard milkshake of the same flavor . This one was different - something about the coffee flavor does a great job of masking the `` protein shake '' taste . Mix this with milk and it tastes just like a coffee-flavor shake from a creamery .
 I have found the protein powder for me.I will continue to buy this product for as long as I can .
 Exellent protein , classic , i dont care if there are new proteins , im going to choose the classic and the best one , Gold Standard from ON .
 I have gone through this product 4 times now , and I must say that I have only tried two flavors
 Very good happy medium protien . PLEASE WHATEVER YOU DO , DONT TRY THE CARAMEL TOFFEE - INSTANT TICKET TO TASTEBUD HELL ! Worst tasting flavor experienced . Banana cream , strawberry banana , chocolate , delicious straberry are all very good .
 This flavour is the far best compare to the rest of them I tried from ON . This Vanilla whey is very smooth powder and mixes very well with the water/juice compare to the rest.The only thing that i do n't like was a little weird after taste . Overall great product !!
 My husband has gained 4 lbs in 3 weeks drinking 2 shakes a day . Also has better energy through the day . He started out mixing this flavor in white milk but tried it in chocolate milk and says it helps with the flavor so just an fyi , the 2 lb will last approx month so not bad for the price . Once he finds the flavors he likes we will buy larger for the price cuts .
 Optimum Nutrition has always done well in the whey protein category . Now , with the addition of the hydrowhey peptides , this just made the industry standard that much better!Great recovery protein at -LRB- considering the price jump in protein as of late -RRB- an amazing price .
 great product , really shows progress if used everyday . lasts about 2 months or so if you get the 5 pound jug
 This stuff is awesome . I mix it with water , about one scoop - 6-8 oz of water and I make sure to mix it right when I dump in the scoop . With fifteen seconds of mixing you let it sit for 30 seconds and you have the most delicious almost milk shake you could ever have . It tastes like melted french vanilla ice cream , which is amazing . Mixing it like I do I rarely if ever get chunks and when I do they 're small and still taste great . I would highly recomend this product . It is super awesome . I would ask anyone to find a downside to this product , for what it is -LRB- whey protein -RRB- it could not be better . It 's perfect and I love it . Now only if I could affford an unlimited supply ...
 This product has a great taste . I mix it with skim milk and I have it for breakfast . The chocolate flavor is good , too !
 Just received it a couple of days ago , I had not been working out due to a hamstring injury so I was eager to get back into a routine and I was looking for the right supplement . It seems like they are too expensive , or so cheap they taste like crap , and most are full of artificial ingredients . I ordered the Mocha ! Mixed with unsweetened Almond Milk , half a banana , and one tablespoon of peanut butter , it made one of the best protein shakes I 've had . It does have a small amount of artificial ingredients , but is mostly whey and cocoa , which I like . Compared to most other protein supplements , short of buying pure whey -LRB- which is hard to choke down -RRB- this is a better option in my book.I have the 2 1/2 lb . container and at one shake a day it seems like it will last awhile . All in all , not the cheapest or maybe the best , but in my opinion it is easily the best value for folks looking for a protein supplement to their diet .
 I 've had some protein powders that are truly nasty . I actually enjoy the taste of this one . It also mixes well with water without having to use a blender or special mixing device .
 double rich chocolate is just greatit taste good with milk , reasonable taste with wateryou might notice that flatulent smell nasty sometimes
 I could barely tolerate the vanilla . . but the extreme milk chocolate is pretty decent . GNC 's stuff still ways WAY better -LRB- and every flavor of theirs is good -RRB- , but Optimum Nutrition is a bit cheaper and works very well . Taste should be pretty much the last factor on your list when choosing supplements anyway . This stuff makes a noticeable difference and performs on bar with , if not slightly better than , GNC 's whey . Also as shown in some of the customer pics , its purity is very good as well . Some people do n't care , but I do think it 's important to pay attention to all the contaminants and keep them at levels as low as possible . I would rather not be consuming a bunch of heavy metals and other toxins multiple times per day in my supplements . So in that respect , for the most part , more expensive IS better . . do NOT go with the super cheap stuff from other brands . . stick with the well-respected ones like GNC and Optimum Nutrition .
 High quality protein at a great price when you buy in bulk 10 lb bag . Works great , no digestion problems .
 Absolutely the best protein I 've tasted . I gave it a 4 star because I was disappointed that the price went up $ 10 whereas every other flavor did not .
 It was strange to try this flavor after drinking the plain chocolate flavor for a while . The mint seemed overpowering , and ... different ... not like mint chocolate ice cream , like I was expecting . I was n't a fan of this flavor the first couple times I tried it , but since I bought it , I figured I may as well get my money 's worth . Well , after the initial flavor shock wore off , I really began to enjoy the mint chocolate . Now that I 'm used to it , I think it 's perfectly delicious , and would definitely buy it again . I just had to realign my taste expectations with reality .
 I 've been around the world and back in the supplement world . From designer supplements to fad supplements . To trying different so-called miracle supplements . I have found out through all the supplements I 've tried and all the results I 've had and all the money wasted , that there are only 3 supplements that will ever do anything worth while for muscle building for the money you pay :1 -RRB- Whey Protein2 -RRB- Creatine3 -RRB- Beta AlanineAll the other stuff you hear about is basically based off these 3 ingredients . Those that are riding the bandwagon of pre-workout supplements like Jack3d , well the majority of those are based off on caffeine -LRB- which is cheap and easy to get -RRB- , beta alanine -LRB- which can be bought separate and cheaper -RRB- , and AAKG -LRB- the so-called pump cure which in fact does nothing -RRB- . You have your other supplements that are filled with who knows what and causes side-effects and very little actual muscle building . Why do I mention this other stuff ? Well your hard earned money is going to this other trash according to top sellers on places like bodybuilding store sites . Creatine and Beta Alanine are great . But Whey Protein is a must . I say `` whey '' and not just protein because I am talking supplements . Obviously , if you ca n't man-up and eat lbs of chicken or other clean meat along with complex carbs like potatos , oatmeal , and pasta daily for months and months straight , do n't bother with whey protein . However , whey is great because it can be used before and after gym and waking up . I use it even before sleep but then you will get the casein crowd telling me I do n't know what I 'm talking about even though I walk year-round at under 10 % bodyfat and have a 515lbs deadlift.So back to why this is great . It is clean and has a decent profile for the money . I have used Isoflex by AllMax nutrition that has a far superior profile but you pay for that -LRB- 27 g protein for 30 g scoop = 90 % + protein per serving -RRB- . Optimum only gives you about 80 % at best of protein per serving . Not talking about the name guys -LRB- 100 % Whey Gold -RRB- , but the actual product based on serving scoop/protein amount ratio.Bottom line , I have tried every flavor of ON Protein and 2 of the 16 or so flavors suck badly . However , Extreme Milk Chocolate is where its at . Never puked it beforee and it does nothing but slowly , but consistently pack on the muscle.Sorry for long review , but I hate seeing people get suckered into crap supplements and wondering why they still look the same after years of training .
 I 'm definitely not a professional body builder by any means . Until recently , I was a college undergrad , and now I 'm working full-time . In general , my workouts usually consist of weight lifting at home , with a set of adjustable free weights , and occasional trips to the gym for exercises not easily done at home . More recently , I 've been doing P90X , and am finishing up the third phase now.This whey protein works wonders . In general , if you 're only going to supplement your workouts with one thing , it would almost definitely be whey protein . It speeds up recovery , gives more energy , and really enables muscle growth . As far as whey goes , I 've tried a few other brands , and ON Gold Standard is the winner when it comes to the balance of amount of protein , ease of use , price , and taste . I 've tried three flavors thus far . Vanilla is okay , when mixed with milk it tastes mostly like runny , melted vanilla ice cream . Not disgusting , but not exactly my cup of tea . I went through a couple jars of the Double Rich Chocolate , based off the recommendations of many reviews , and ended up sticking with it for a while . I 've never been a fan of chocolate milk , so the Double Rich Chocolate is n't amazing to me , but it still tastes good and is easy to get down.I recently tried a tub of the Cookies n ' Cream flavor , and I 'm not going to be sticking with it . It 's nice , as a change of pace from the months of chocolate I had , but mixed with milk it was waaaay too rich for me . I usually mix it with water , which makes it taste sort of like a Jack in the Box Oreo cookie shake . It tastes kinda weird if it 's warm , though , so I usually either pre-mix it and stick it in the fridge for a long time , or throw in a couple ice cubes when I mix it , to cool it down . Some reviewers have commented on a bitter aftertaste -LRB- for Cookes n ' Cream only , not the other flavors -RRB- , some say they have never encountered it . I seem to be stuck in the middle . Every once in a while , one of the gulps will hit me with a slightly bitter aftertaste . It 's not often enough to make me hate drinking it , but it 's worth a mention . It seems to happen less often if I pre-mix the shake and leave it in the fridge for a while , so temperature may have something to do with it.One last thing I want to mention , if you 're just someone who works out a bit in their free time to stay in shape , there 's one other supplement worth taking a look at
 I have tried a lot of protein powders , but this is my favorite by far . The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is good on it 's own in milk or soy milk . That said , I have loved it mixed into lowfat pudding , greek yogurt , frozen fruit & milk smoothies , and I have even mixed it in with my coffee creamer & added it to decaf coffee if I need to jump start my protein total for the day . It is never gritty or chalky - it just disappears into whatever you mix it into . I 've even successfully stirred it into homemade lo carb dark chocolate gelato -LRB- just before freezing it -RRB- . I 've never had a more versatile form of protein , and before this I only used soy protein since it had a better taste/texture than whey .
 I have lactose intolerance and find myself getting uncomfortable with alot of Whey protein powders I 've tried before . Not with this one.It also easily dissolves in cold water , which I like . I do n't even use a mixer , most of the time I bring a coffee sipper and swish it around there . I love the taste of chocolate mint with cold water , it 's very refreshing after a workout .
 Mixes fast , quick and easy with water.Tastes great , add 1 splenda packet for even better taste !
 Actually tastes like chocolate . Even when using water to mix with . I use two scoops in my coffee in the morning and it 's awesome , almost mocha like . Super easy to mix , doesnt need a blender . I put it in a nalgene with water and just shake it and it mixes fine with no clumps . Gives me heartburn though , but then again everything else does too so I cant really blame the powder .
 By far , the Optimum Nutrition brand is the best for the price AND taste . I 've tried Double Chocolate -LRB- mix with instant coffee -RRB- , Vanilla -LRB- great with fruit -RRB- , and my fav Cookies and Cream -LRB- eat with a 1/2 banana and you 're set -RRB- . Lost 35 pounds while gaining incredible upper body muscle , and I have this brand to thank . Four months later , it still does n't get old . That 's a big plus . I 'm ordering anoth 5 lb tub as I type this review .
 I 'm not usually a big fan of vanilla-flavored products , but I bought this in the vanilla flavor since I had several recipes on-hand that called for vanilla protein powder . I 've bought ON 's chocolate and strawberry protein powders in the past and they are among my favorite flavors , and this vanilla one is no exception . It 's rich and creamy , and has a nice `` ice cream '' taste to it . It 's also available here on Amazon in two smaller containers -LRB- instead of the large bin like this one -RRB- , which are much easier to store if you do n't have a lot of space.After doing a weight workout , try blending a scoop of this with some water or skim milk and some fruit -LRB- like a frozen banana and strawberries or blueberries -RRB- , and you 'll have a nice post-workout treat.I 've also been using it to make French toast in the mornings
 It tastes alright , but the problem is that it makes me gassy . Try a smaller quantity somewhere local first to see if you get the same reaction !
 I bought this for my boyfriend just because . He is big into protein and he was running out ! it was basically the same as what you 'd get in store without me having to try and find a place to get it at ! it was shipped quick and maybe even a little cheaper then the people at gnc would have bargained me for . it was a huge 5 lb tub but i 'm pretty sure amazon shipped it for free . really great service !!
 Hi , The prompt delivery of OPTIMUM NUTRITION - 10 POUND 100 % WHEY GOLD STANDARD PROTEIN STRAWBERRY PROTEIN POWDER WAS FANTASTIC . I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS!Thank you kindly , Jude
 Out of all the whey protein powders I have tried , this by far is the best . It does n't give me the stomach disturbances the other wheys did and the recovery time is shorter with this product , which means , you can workout with better intensity . This is my favorite whey and will always use it . It tastes great too .
 Got me bigger is a really good protein product and im looking foward to get a new one i defenitley recommend it !
 We love this brand of whey powder and keep several of the flavors on hand . The banana whey always runs out first . I wish Amazon would put it back on Subscribe-and-Save and offer the discounted price that 's available on Vanilla and Chocolate whey .
 I bought this protein powder in the double rich chocolate flavor upon receiving a raving review from a friend of mine . I have n't used protein powder in a while because the ones I 've had in the past tasted awful , but I decided it was time to give something new a try . This is THE best tasting protein powder I 've ever had ! After a run yesterday I mixed a scoop with a little bit of soy milk and I thought it tasted even better than traditional chocolate milk . I ca n't wait to try it in other smoothies and snacks . If you are on the fence about what flavor to get or what brand of protein powder is for you , I can tell you that this stuff tastes great and the stats are really good as well . It 's very low in fat -LRB- only 1g per scoop -RRB- and high in protein -LRB- 24g per scoop -RRB- with fairly minimal calories -LRB- 120 kcal per scoop -RRB- . Also , I ordered mine through The Vitamin Shoppe and they provided a great price and free shipping for any order over $ 25 . I figured since it was free shipping I may have to wait the 3-5 days to recieve it , but was pleasantly surprised when I came home the day after ordering it and it was on my door step . So thank you Vitamin Shoppe for your great service and great product - I ca n't wait to try some of the other flavors !
 Double rich chocolate is my favorite flavor by far . Tried the vanilla flavor but it tasted more medicine and chemical like than vanilla . Double rich chocolate , on the other hand , tastes exactly as it sounds . I 've tasted just about every Chocolate whey protein powder out there and this one is by far the best tasting and it also mixes the best if you do n't have time for a blender and you just shake it up . I mix mine with skim milk mostly . Also I sometimes put two tablespoons of peanut butter in it for extra calories because weight gain is a big focus for me right now . I think it tastes even better with the peanut butter btw . I like this protein a lot because of the high protein and low carbs and fat ration . When I 'm in a bulking phase I just add the needed calories to the shake . When I 'm cutting , this and water is the ideal protein shake to slim down quickly.I 've been taking this for well over a year now and what first made me want to try it was because the reviews online were near perfect for this protein . Another reviewer mentioned something about adding Citrulline Malate powder into the shake . It is a body building supplement meant to reduce fatigue and recovery time and it turns out that it is very helpful in both those areas . I 've stopped taking creatine a while ago because I hate feeling bloated . The Citrulline seems to mirror the gains I get when I use to take creatine so I would recommend it for anymore looking to gain strength/mass in the gym too.Overall , ON has a great Protein product and as long as they do n't change the ingredients or something crazy like that , I will continue to buy .
 When it comes to a no non-sense protein powder , one that has extras such as glutamine and BCAA 's , and at the same time has a minimal amount of fat and carbs ... this is the protein to get . This is n't a meal replacement or should be used as one , if that 's what your looking for try muscle milk which is high in protein but also other calories as well.This is your post-workout protein shake plain and simple . I always add one banana either in the blender or just eat it separately , and when I 'm in bulking phase I 'll also add one tablespoon of peanut butter and bam , you have yourself a meal replacement too if that 's what you prefer . Not to mention , its freaking delicious with the peanut butter!One simple thing I have been adding to each shake is Citrulline Malate and Beta Alanine , Primaforce Citrulline Malate 200 Grams + FREE Beta Alanine Powder 250 Grams . My recovery time has literally been cut in half since adding this to the mix , also worth looking into if you are involved in intense training of any kind .
 As a fitness enthusiast and a Science guy , I am always curious to find the real value of a supplement . What works and what does not work . More importantly , I believe the analysis of a product should be based on strong scientific knowledge base , combined with good old fashion practical use of the product , and only then one should come down to the final conclusion.This product review and analysis was conducted based on 3 parametersA . Constituents
 GeneralI 've tried a couple of whey protein brands in the past and this one is by far the best . It 's the best price for quality in the market and ON really put in some effort to develop a quality product.Cutting or bulking . Works excellent both ways.I started using this product in a cutting cycle Feb ' 11 , after being off from working out seriously for about 1-2 years . This helped me drop from a 19 % body-fat to a 6.5 % -LRB- current -RRB- without losing any considerable muscle mass -LRB- my arms stayed at around 16 ' through the whole process -RRB- . After I dropped to a low BFP I started a bulking cycle a couple of weeks ago to try and reach 17ish size in my arms , and then drop body-fat until I 'm happy.I 'm telling you , either if it 's bulking or cutting if you combine this product with a solid diet you 're going to have awesome results.Serving Size24gr of protein per serving is pretty good considering that the scoop is relatively small , which means that this product is highly concentrated -LRB- being a whey protein isolate -RRB- . FlavorsSo far I 've tried -LRB- in both water and skim milk -RRB-
 I have been a personal trainer for 12 years . Trust me , I have tried MANY types and brands of protein powder . Optimum Nutrition brand has the best tasting , highest quality powdered protein - bar none ! I will never ask a client to try anything I have n't tried myself , so I can say with great certainty , the flavors are excellent . There is no funny `` after taste '' when you make this powder into a shake . I usually put a scoop of dry powder in a small shake container . The powder stays fresh in your car , messenger bag or gym locker until you are ready to use it . Try that with a bar !! Just add 16oz . of cold fountain or bottled water at the gym , for an after workout muscle recovery drink . At home , I use skim milk , but the shake tastes just as good with water and a good shaking . Many protein bars and powders cause excessive gas ... bad news if you are going out in a public place after your workout ! This protein powder is an excellent quality whey and does not cause tooting ... really . Ca n't beat the nutrition for 120 calories . Chocolate mint is a fave . I keep trying other brands as my clients ask about them , but ALWAYS come back to O.N.
 I like this product . Let me first start by saying that I do not think this is `` the BEST '' protein product ever . However , I 've tried many protein products and this comes rather close.In my honest opinion , `` the BEST '' protein product out there would have to be `` Profect '' by Protica Research . It 's actually the stuff used by gastric bypass patients . It 's 25 grams of high-absorb protein in only 2.7 fluid oz that literally tastes like fruit candy . But , it 's way too expensive and a two-months supply can set you back a couple of hundred bucks easily . Because of this , it 's better suited strictly toward its medical purposes.This product is also not the `` most cost-effective '' . There are plenty of other whey products out there that are much much cheaper and have just as much protein content , but they all pretty much taste like doo doo . What 's the point in torturing yourself to save a few bucks ? Cost is definitely an important factor , but not the most important.Apart from all of the hype and apart from all of the hate , I would say that I really do like this product . It tasted a bit gross with just plain water , but when I added it to a cup of enriched soymilk , I could n't tell the difference between it and a regular kid 's chocolate milk shake . That is amazing . And this product did mix pretty well . I usually have problems with that when it comes to powdered shakes and it 's always great when you can get a shake that does n't just sit on the bottom of the cup and cement while everything else just floats to the top . I even added a serving of Benefiber fiber supplement , and it still did n't clump up.One problem that I have with this product is that it does use artificial sweeteners , but I 'll let that slide for now , since I do n't intake too many products with them anyway . Still , it is a cause for concern for those you who want to avoid such things in your diet entirely.Overall , 4 of of 5 stars . I 'm pleased but not impressed . This product is definitely one of the superior brands out there but most definitely not a `` gold standard '' . A lot could be done to improve it .
 I have tried many protien powders and this is by FAR the best tasting yet . I have the double rich chocolate and the vanilla ice cream flavors . The vanilla isnt that great though . The chocolate on the other hand ... by far the best . I use half a cup of water and half of milk , half cup of ice , and blend it for about 5 minutes to make it really thick . I found the longer you blend it and the thicker it gets the longer you will feel full . Its also really good if you add a banana too . It taste more like a dessert than a protien shake . Its delicious and I highly recommend it !!
 First of all I am a huge fan of this stuff and have been using it 5yrs , I 've bought the strawberry and vanilla flavors , My goals are weight loss and nothing else comes close to this product , I 've tryed countless others.Reasons I only buy the strawberry or vanilla flavors is I do n't want a gunky flavor , if I wanted a junk flavor I 'll eat junk , I add 10oz water 3 medium strawberrys , half medium size banana , 1/4cup blueberries , scoop of whey powder , and 1 tsp glucomannan powder , and 2tbls ground flax seeds and 1tsp l-glutamine powder , 1 tsp greensuperfood . I drink this for breakfast a half hr before I go to the gym , then I drink another protein shake after , adding only vegtables with the vanilla whey protein , I have been full of energy and have lost 30lbs in 5wks , along with drinking plenty of fresh squeezed lemon water and lots of fresh vegtables and fresh cooked fish dinners tilapia wild caught ... back to the product I love this stuff and will not switch to another .
 I have been using ON for at least 4 months now everytime after I work out . The flavor never gets old , and I mix it with water ! It supplies 24 g of protein everytime . That is equivalent to a burger without all the carbs and fat . Recovery rate is fast and I feel stronger everytime I go back to the gym .
 I am a regular ON-Whey customer . I 've always made it a point to drink Whey Protein 3 times a day to cover my protein requirements for my lean weight , which is 1 gram of protein per pound of my body weight.The only con I would give is that , for a Double Rich Chocolate flavor , it 's not that chocolaty yet . I hope that they could keep on improving the flavor -LRB- without adding sugar or fat of course -RRB- . MUSCLE MAINTENANCE : - I always make sure I drink whey on breakfast to replenish lost muscle cells after that long sleep . - I always drink whey protein before sleeping , to fight midnight hunger , and to keep my muscles fed on the first 4 hours of sleeping
 To each his own . If you do n't like strawberry milk , then you wont like this . I use this 2-3 times a day for the past year and it is my favorite flavor . ON protein is awesome , So if you like Strawberry Milk then this is the protein for you : -RRB-
 Whey Protein is critical for any athlete doing intense exercise . Whey is supreme over other protein for post-workout due to its fast rate of absorption into the bloodstream to prevent catabolism and aid recovery . I choose Optimum Nutrition for all my whey needs.I follow ABC bodybuilding 's article on the Window of Opportunity . Everyone should read this article and use this formula . This is the best guideline on essential supplementation.Please keep in mind that it is a guide , not a dogma . Do what feels right and what works for you.The Window of Opportunity is a post-workout shake that I used when I put on over 30 pounds of muscle within 3 months . My bench went from 215 pounds to 450 , body fat from 7 % to 3 % , and mile time from 6 minutes to 5 . It works.Here 're the quick basics , although you definitely must read the article yourself.After the work out , you should consume .22 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight and 5 grams of carbohydrate -LRB- half dextrose , half maltodextrin -RRB- per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for bulking , or 2.5 grams of carbohydrate -LRB- half dextrose , half maltodextrin -RRB- per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for cutting.You should also consume 5-10 grams of creatine , 5-10 grams of glutamine , and a multi-anti-oxidant formula . All this must be done over a 45-60 minute period.The 45-60 minute sequence is vital : Step One : Blend 1/3 protein -LRB- experiment to find the exact number for you -RRB- , 1/3 dextrose -LRB- simple sugar -RRB- , and 1/3 maltodextrin -LRB- complex sugar -RRB- with enough water -LRB- water should be at least 92 % of the total mixture -RRB- . Add 500 mg of sodium per liter of water used.Shake the ingredients well . Put creatine powder in your mouth -LRB- 5-10 grams when starting , 2.5-5 grams once body is saturated with creatine -RRB- and drink the shake to wash the creatine down . It is better to do this than to mix the creatine in water , as that makes creatine lose its potency.Drink one half of the shake within 5 minutes of working out . After this 5 minutes , allow an additional 10-15 minutes for the solution to settle in your stomach.Step 2 : After the solution has dissolved in your stomach for 10-15 minutes , consume 5-10 grams of Glutamine and your multi-vitamin with one gulp of the shake.Continue to drink the remaining half of the shake for the following 30-45 minute period.It is vital to drink small sips of your shake for the entire 30-45 minute period . This allows for maximum absorption rate of the nutrients into your body.Step 3 : Take fish oil with a meal , preferably at breakfast.Take ZMA on an empty stomach , 30 minutes before you go to sleep .
 I have been working out pretty heavily for the past 3 months . I work out for 2 hours 4 days a week and 2 miles before that . I never thought in a million years that I would buy this stuff but after seeing the reviews , I had to give it a shot.Taste : Not too shabby , another review said the strawberry tastes `` deity '' . It does have a slight hint of something other than sugar but all in all the stuff resembled a bland Strawberry Instant Quick . ... which is good , since quick was the sweetest thing I think I have ever drank . 1 out of 10 I give the flavor an 8 . As in I could drink this stuff for a month with out any worries.Results : After using it for 2 weeks I did start to see more of a build after a work out . Before taking this supplement I noticed a plateau in my muscle growth . After 2 weeks my arms started gaining again . ... This stuff works.How to use it , for men anyways : Take your weight and then use that number to use the number of grams of protein per serving . Example
 I have used this product in the past and have always found it to be as good as the ads and literature say it is . This Optimum Nutrition product comes in several flavors and I have tried several but the Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite . It is easy to mix with skim milk `` my favorite '' even if all you have is a shaker . I would highly recommend this ON product to anyone seeking a high protein powdered drink mix .
 I have only tried the Double Chocalate flavor but it taste really good . I drink mine with water and even then the taste is still better then some of the other chocalate flavored protein I have had .
 Although a great protein supplement the price has been sky rocketing for the past few months . I bought this thing for 27 bucks around 3 months back and then it went to 36 about a month ago and now its 41 !! I 'm sure there isnt a a good reason for this price hike . The sellers are just trying to rip the buyers off for a good tasting protein . It seems my days with this protein are over . Will have to research for a new protein now .
 I 've reviewed several different brands . ON had high protein per serving similar to the $ 40 - $ 50/2lb . container brands but I paid like $ 15 shipped.I have n't noticed much muscle gain yet but given the number of lifters claims It should start soon . I have noticed that I do n't get as sore after lifting.The taste with milk is delicious . I got the banana cream and it tastes just like a shake . I tried it with water the first time and it was pretty bad.I 'm happy with it and will continue to order more .
 There is really nothing about this product that I do n't like . I like the banana cream flavor.If I had to complain about something , its that they bury the scoop so darn deep in jug that it is sometimes hard to get out without making a mess .
 This is the best protein for getting lean mass . Can see the results soon but will have to work hard for it . Tastes very good as well . The vanilla ice-cream is the one I got .
 I am a heavy lifter , and so I need to consume lots of protein in order to recover from my workouts . I love ON whey protein . I especially love the double rich chocolate flavor , although I alternate between chocolate , strawberry and vanilla.I start out my morning with a shake made of two scoops mixed with milk , which is low in calories but great in everything I need . It also keeps me going until lunch . When I lift hard consistently , and use ON Whey Protein , I can feel the muscle growing and experience excellent gains.I will always have some on hand , and go through a tub every month or month and a half . I would definitely recommend .
 Excelent product . Great flavor -LRB- even better than chocolate -RRB- . It really do what 's supossed to ... adding lean muscle mass to your body . No complaints
 It 's not so bad with water when I drink it with milk it comes off to sweet for the small amount I use but it 's still not bad tasting and is doing its job
 Great product . Great taste . Just ordered a 5lb tub . Tried many of ON 's flavors , this is my favorite . I need two more words . ok good .
 Wow this is GREAT ! Love the fruity taste and is a nice change from Vanilla , Chocolate and Strawberry that I have tried and like as well . I think this is my new favorite . Blends well . If you like Hawian punch cool aid you will like this .
 This is the best price I could find for this product . Would buy again here . No problems and I love the taste with milk and a bananna
 love it . probably the best tasting whey ive ever had and shakes up in a shaker really nicely wish i would have gotten more !
 I am a vegetarian and it is hard for me to make 200g of protein as a full time graduate student and intern . I 've been using protein shakes for almost a year and literally dreaded it . I could n't even drink as much as I should , thus no serious gains . I literally downed those Pure Protein and Cytosport powders like gross cough syrup.This powder is different . I am already incredibly satisfied with the nutrition label and how much less ingredients it has than the other ones I 've used -LRB- text is so small I 'm not even completely sure of what I 'm taking -RRB- . Not only that ... I absolutely enjoy drinking this shake . It tastes like Nesquik chocolate milk or some really nice quality chocolate milk with a bit of a minty undertone . I can drink two of these a day .
 This stuff tastes pretty good , but you have to mix it strong . I like it with nonfat milk and cinnamon . I bought it becuase it was lower in carbs than alot of other which is nice during low carb non training days .
 My nutritionist recommended this brand and its great ! Low carb higher protein ! I have n't tried them with water I always use Fat Free milk . The cookies-n-cream satisfies my sweet tooth . And if you use a shaker bottle and it gets frothy is the best ! I also mix 1/4 scoop with those yogurt smoothies as an afternoon snack . I also have had no digestion problems with this protein like others I have tried . Double chocolate is good . The Chocolate mint was good but you get tired of it quick if you get the 5lb but we switch from the two for variety .
 Stronger vanilla flavor than what I have used before . But when blended with fruit and soy milk for a smoothie it is delecious . It also has more calories than other proteins I have used but I just use a little less .
 I have tried lot of whey flavors of various brands but Cookies N ' Cream stands out among all . I read lot of good reviews about double rich chocolate also , so I ordered it first . It certainly was n't bad , esp . for a protein powder but cookies n ' cream is amazingly good tasting . I do n't know how many other protein powders can I take with just cold water . Just put it in a shaker and it dissolves easily even in cold water and tastes even better with a dash of orange juice ... I know this concoction sounds little weird but I like it ! I do n't get any bloated feeling afterwards like I used to get with GNC whey . In nutshell , this product is a winner ... try it once and you might not opt for anything else later .
 I have used both the Chocolate and Banana flavors -LRB- sometimes I even mix them for extra goodness -RRB- and I can say that they are the best tasting powders I have tried -LRB- of 6 or 7 brands -RRB- . They do taste best when mixed with milk instead of water , though . Lots of taste plus lots of cost-effective protein makes a great protein powder !
 You really ca n't beat this whey for the money . ON has the best flavors and great quality . It mixes well , is comparatively inexpensive , and I like my results . I 'm no pro , but this whey gets the job done .
 I 've been using ON 100 % Whey for about 2 year now , and I will continue to use it . It 's a great product . My favorite is Chocolate , I 've tried others such as vanilla , and cookies 'n cream , but I did not like the taste . However I like to mix it with banana and straberry . This is it a great product and I will continue to try other flavors as well .
 I 'm a newb in strength training , but this product has helped me to achieve my daily required protein intake , which is not possible just by eating `` real food '' . And the cal-carb-pro-fat composition is just perfect for someone like me who 's in a cutting stage.Side effect
 This stuff really works and tastes great . This is the third brand of protein shake I have tried , and it 's by far the best I 've used so far . Great value for an awesome product that really speeds the bulking process .
 I have done quite a bit of research and this is the cheapest , best tasting , fast acting whey on the market that I can find . It mixes easily and one of the best things I like about it is that it does n't have any chemical sweeteners , and yet is sweet enough without . This is low cal , low/no fat , and very low -LRB- almost no -RRB- carb - almost pure protein - great for pre and post workout - and I take it with me everywhere I go on trips . I highly recommend this product .
 First off , this is the best protein drink out there . Cookies and Creme , Chocolate and Vanilla are the best for me . I still have Chocolate Mint -LRB- new for me -RRB- left to try in the pantry . I will say strawberry ended up being given away to a friend . Not that it was aweful , just not my taste nor close enough to strawberry for me . With that out of the way here 's MIXING 101 . The simple way to stir this stuff without LUMPS is as follows :1 . Pour the milk -LRB- LOL -RRB- .2 . Get your spoon .3 . Get your scoop of powder in one hand and spoon in the other hand4 . Start stirring the milk vigorously -LRB- get that funnel/tornado look going in the milk ! -RRB- and add powder in a continuous poor . NEVER stop stirring until scoop is empty . This is extremely important for LUMP FREE drinks : -RRB- I realize this is a `` pat the top of your head and rub your stomach '' at the same time sort of deal but it 's quite simple in practice . Also do not PACK the powder in the scoop so it will easily flow from it . I can add 2 scoops to a single 8-10oz glass of milk without ANY lumps ! No joke . No blender . Just a quick stirring of milk and a steady pouring of powder . Hope this helps someone . NO MORE LUMPS ! Works with other powders.Aaron
 I 've tried this same brand of Whey in vanilla and tropical fruit ... not a fan . The vanilla was fake and way too strong . The tropical fruit a little better but nothing to write home about.This stuff though is awesome.What I do is get a big 64oz mug , fill it a third of the way with ice , then water till it is above the ice , then 2 bananas . Blend it all until the I stop hearing the ice break , pour in a scoop of the whey , blend for a few more seconds . Done , great tasting smoothie , 24 grams of protein -LRB- plus whatever is in the bananas -RRB- . Maybe I should try milk instead of water ... hmmm ... I 'm not a bodybuilder really , I am just trying to get in shape , and while I do n't know how much the whey is doing for me I have put on a lot of muscle since I started using it .
 Love this product . I 've been using Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey for almost 5 years now , and it 's fantastic . Very low calorie , great taste . I 've tried lots of flavors , so far I 've had : - Chocolate-Vanilla Ice Cream-Strawberry-Cookies & Cream-Tropical PunchThe tropical punch in my opinion is the best , because it tastes great when just mixed with water and ice . All flavors are best when mixed with milk -LRB- adding yogurt is also great -RRB- , but I find that some flavors with just water are tough to choke down . It tastes like fruity pebbles . Great for a meal replacement , as it curbs appetite for several hours too . But I like this for its versatility . Not too heavy , great tasting , mixes great with water or milk . I like to blend it with 2 ice cubes , 12oz water , and a heaping scoop post workout for best results . Be wary or the vanilla ice cream flavor - very strange taste that I 'm not a fan of . Cookies and cream is probably the 2nd best , followed by strawberry .
 White chocolate flavor is the best one so fat . I have tried Mocha capuccino and vanilla ice cream , but this one is the best .
 ON whey protein is a great way to add protein to breakfast , supplement nutrients in your coffee , your favorite smoothie , and of course your pre-workout and post-workout . From what I 've read and in my opinion , it 's crucial to get at least 30g of protein within 30-45 minutes of waking up . For me , that 's where ON comes in . For those on the go , ON whey is perfect to get the protein you need quickly . Also , vanilla ice cream flavor , mixes easily into any smoothie , shake or blended coffee . With 24 grams of protein and only 120 calories , why would you choose any other protein?UPDATE -- I 've had Vanilla Ice Cream , Chocolate Coconut and White chocolate flavors and would say the flavor breakdown looks a little something like : Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Vanilla Ice Cream , 5 Pound
 This product is not for gaining weight2g fat 4g carbs . If you take this for weight gain your an idiot . This protein is one of the best quality and price on the market for fueling your body with quality protein . Feeding muscles after an intense workout and helping you build lean muscle . Buy something higher in carbs and fat if you want to gain weight.They do sell weight gain powder if you want to spend much more per serving .
 I purchased this product due to its reviews . It does mix well with water for those who are trying to avoid additional calories . It taste pretty good as well .
 I have gotten multiple of this product and it never ceases to amaze me ! I was considering getting the hydrowhey from the same company but I realized from other reviews that its basically the same and the scoop is bigger so actually when they say it has more protein , it actually dose n't ... it has just a little more protein per serving but not too much more ! I 'd rather get this one its cheaper and I can drink more scoops and it 'll last longer for me . I got mocha cappuchino and the taste blew me away ! With milk it tasted just like a mcdonalds iced cappuchino ! Amazing product !
 This product tastes great and works wonderfully ! I had started working out again after a long long hiatus :-RRB- I started with a hot yoga class going everyday for 30 days and the whole month long my muscles were very sore . Every time I sat down for over 20 minutes my muscles would stiffen and I hobbled around like an old lady until my muscles loosened up again . I then heard that I maybe needed more protein in my diet . I looked around for a protein powder that would work for me . I am not a body builder and have no desire to be one . I just want to get in shape . Well , I take 1 scoop of this stuff in almond milk right after my work out and my muscle soreness is greatly reduced ! I was amazed that it made such a difference .
 There is n't a lot more to add from what others have said . ON gold standard whey is just the best basic protein powder . If you want a before bed shake , check out the Casien protein but for breakfast or snack or post work out protein shakes , this stuff is the best . It tastes great and blends into milk really well , even if its just skim milk . I like the chocolate flavor enough that I have n't even tried the different flavors .
 This is my favorite flavor of whey protein . It mixes great with water , ice , and a banana . Or you could use one of those blender ball cups and bring it to the gym and just add water . Either way , it tastes great . The 5 lbs tub is a good size to buy because the container is sturdy and stands upright , as opposed to the 10 lbs sack . Makes it easier to scoop and reclose the lid . The smaller sizes are also more expensive per serving .
 Item shipped quickly . The Whey tastes great even with water . I am pleased with the product thus far and would buy again !
 Well it 's supposed to be protein so I was n't much thinking about how it will taste as long as it does n't taste or smell gross . But now that I think of it , I think I would surely not give a name as Double Rich Chocolate . No it is n't like chocolate nectar so no . But hey its a great deal for a whey protein , not so expensive and surely drinkable , I 've been having it 5 times a day for 2 months and I ai n't complaining . Although it 's either this or casein -LRB- which I take at night -RRB- that some times gives me gas !
 Have tried all kinds and and all flavors of whey proteins that are out there . The gold standard whey works great for my digestive system -LRB- I am trying to gain and go thru like 13-15 scoops a day -RRB- . Have seen great results , love the taste , the price and the results . Banana is my fav and I think least ` powdery ' of all the other flavors when you are mixing it with water . Be sure to use an electrical blender though .
 Not bad for the money and taste good with milk.Mix with water not so great . I give it a B + . thank you
 This is a very good product for the price . It delivers a big protein bang for the buck and keeps fat and sugar to a minimum . The flavor is good when mixed with water and great with milk . Hard to go wrong with this stuff .
 Giving this one 5 stars because it 's one of the few whey powders I have tried that when mixed with the correct portion of milk , taste good enough to look forward to a tasty treat . Flavor is mild strawberries and cream , fairly light and has a fair amount of sweetness to it.The taste combined with better-than-most protein content makes this a strong recommendation for anyone who wants a strong departure from the standard chocolate/vanilla flavors .
 USE IT EVERYDAY . . Love this , got it on a subscription to save even more money . Taste is n't the greatest at first , but one gets used to it . I 'm at a point where I feel that it tastes like chocolate . . Its packed with protein , and good for you . What else is needed to say . . Big tub , I thought it was way smaller . Works well .
 I 've only used this in smoothies , not by itself . It mixes completely and gives a great vanilla taste to my smoothie . AND , I 'm getting all the benefits of Whey !
 I 've been using ON whey for years now . It mixes extremely well in a shaker bottle or with a spoon and it tastes good -LRB- not great , but good -RRB- . It provides an excellent amount of portein per scoop and is very cheap on Amazon . The only downside is that it can taste a bit thin or watery , but that 's still better than the chunky taste most proteins have .
 I remember the days when the only way you could mix a protein powder was with an electric blender . This mixes easily in my shaker bottle and tastes pretty good too . I spoon in some creatine powder with it a few times a day and I 'm ready to go . Buying the 10 lb bag makes it a great value too . Do n't let the fools at GNC trick you into thinking their gold card is a better deal than this !
 This stuff works great for after workout shake . I do n't follow the frequency it recommends just after a work out . The taste is good also .
 I use this to get my protein in for the morning , however , I 've read a lot about the use of artificial flavorings -LRB- sugar , etc. -RRB- in which I do n't mind , but for those who do , maybe the Natural powder would do -LRB- which only comes in Chocolate and Vanilla -RRB- . Overall , I enjoy this flavor as well as a few others of theirs ' .
 This stuff is great for everyday protein supplement for anything that you do . Not that tasty though , but a great price . That must mean its good for you if its yucky . lol
 Tastes good , easy to mix and has a good protein to carb ratio . I switched from the cyto sport complete whey , both products are great .
 I purchased the Rocky Road flavor of whey protein because I had read it was absolutely delicious . That was not the case ... at first . Upon opening it , it had a scent I was not used to . One of my friends compared the smell to that of Smores . I tried it in 8 oz . of milk -LRB- as I do with all the other flavors of Optimum Nutrition -RRB- and it did not blow my socks off . However , the taste did grow on me and now I ca n't get enough of it!As far as efficiency of the product goes , I do n't really notice a difference . I use it as a protein supplement along with chicken breasts at meal times , not as a recovery drink -LRB- I use Endurox R4 for that -RRB- . I do , however , drink it 40 minutes after I drink my Endurox post-workout .4 / 5 because I had to get accustomed to the taste . * Side-note , it tastes pretty good in 6-8 oz . of water
 This is absolutely the best protein powder on the market . Mint Chocolate is very good -- just mix with water . I see some people need to mix with milk and/or other ingredients , and I would agree for other products , but the flavor of this mix is so good you only need water . No aftertaste .
 Great Whey Protein . Use it , get results . Great price , great taste . I do n't blend , I shake in a bottle . It mixes very easily with water and milk and I have n't found a flavor I did n't like . I take 20 grams pre and 40 grams post . Get ON this Whey .
 This is good protein . I was not looking for anything too fancy and this is a great deal as far as whey goes . The product is a little lacking on the flavor side . Make sure you drink it in milk , anything else is going to taste like crap . If are really into flavor , check out BSN Syntha-6 . It is not 100 % whey but the flavor beats anything else I have tried ; you could mix it with water and it would taste like a milkshake .
 I have tried many whey proteins in my lifetime , and ON is the brand I 've settled on , not only for cost , but the lactase allows even the lactose intolerant to drink it with milk , and the `` instantized '' feature allows it to mix without any granules to choke down ! However , if you have not tried any flavors , the chocolate mint falls second to the rocky road which is the best tasting pure whey protein around .
 This product does what it needs to . It tastes great and I have seen results over just normally working out . It could mix better , but does a decent job of it in water .
 I absolutely loved this product . I bought the strawberry and it taste really good . I have tried other proteins and didnt taste as good . It doesnt disolve completely with a spoon but its alot better than other products that I have previously tried . Also noticed that I 'm noticing that my workout routine is working . Will keep on buying .
 I was amazed at the rich flavor . It was like I was drinking a cappuccino from Starbucks only without all the fat and calories . I belong to a Bariatric Support Group and I have told all my co-gastric bypass friends about the great taste of your product !
 I 've been using ON whey for a couple years now . Through heavy lifting and high protein intake , I have had immense strength gains . The ON protein seems to work well , it mixes well , and tastes relatively good . -LRB- Not many protein powders taste good , but that 's not the point . You are n't eating it for taste . You are eating it to PWN ALL NOOBS . Grow up and chug . -RRB- Toodles , B
 This is one of the best protein supplement I have had in the last 5 years that I have been using them .
 The delievery was fast and arrived promptly . The product is expensive , but is one of the best out there .
 This is the most delicious , clean protein you can get for the price ! I have used it for the past 4 years and absolutely love it !
 I went through 3 x 5lbs in the last 3 years . This is my favorite whey powder . It tastes good and smells even better . It 's great amount of protein for the price .
 Best value , best taste , and great results . Only whey protein that I buy and take after my workout . Never been sore after a workout while using gold standard and have to give it up to double rich chocolate , it tastes great .
 I have been lifting for 12 + years and have used supplements for about half that time so i know hoe hard it is to find a good price on whey . This fit the bill and provides plenty of protein and essential vitamins/nutrients . I tried but couldnt find a better product or better pricr per serving !
 I usually really hate protein shakes , so my goal in trying a bunch of samples was to find one I could drink without visibly grimacing . I have n't tried most of their lineup yet , but I just tried the Chocolate Mint , and it 's magic . Not only did I not hate it , I really like it ! I 'm annoyed there was only one in the sample pack ! So if you 're like me and you 're tired of seeing `` tastes just like chocolate milk '' reviews only to end up with something that tastes like gritty chalk , try this . It really does live up to all the claims the cheap stuff makes .
 I bought the double rich chocolate and it is delicious . It mixes so easily I can take double the amount of protein than if I were to use a different brand .
 Of all of the protein powders I 've used , this one is by far the best . I do n't get tired of drinking it every day like others with an odd taste . Even if you like chocolate or other flavors , I 'd recommend this flavor . I prefer chocolate , but just add a tablespoon of Ovaltine to the mix and voilah ... chocolate ! ... and it tastes much better than the actual chocolate .
 Amazing taste ! almost goes with any fruit except apple which I felt quite thick to consume . All I do is just ice/water/one fruit -LRB- tried S.berries / orange/apple/pineapple / banana -RRB- with one scoop of whey and it tastes amazing . I already place my next order as the price is damn good and I could not get anywhere cheaper than this.Would love to use as long as it 's available .
 Shipping is fast , product arrives in good condition , and the price is the best I 've found . If you like ON Whey Gold Standard this is where to get it . As for the product itself I experience better recovery times and more muscle growth with it than without it . I find the key is to drink it within 30 mins of a workout and use skim milk to keep the calories down .
 The flavor is slightly chalky and bland but not bad . I used syntha before this and with milk it becomes nice and thick , this however with milk still stays thin and more like chocolate water than chocolate milk !
 This is by far the best whey I have found . The Double Chocolate flavor is good , but Rocky Road is superb . I like to mix a scoop of the Double Chocolate flavor whey with a scoop of Cookies and Cream flavored Casein.It mixes extremely well in a blender bottle . I usually mix it with skim milk , but water works too , although it does n't taste quite as good . The price is great compared to products with similar nutritional value .
 Taste is good , especially with milk . No lumps after shaking in container for 20 seconds . Goes does smooth , no chalk texture . Totally worth it .
 Taste is pretty good mixed with water . I have n't tried mixing it with milk yet . The taste and texture is sort of like vanilla jello pudding but a little more powdery . I 've heard some people complain about it clumping but it does n't seem to clump much more , if at all , than my whey protein .
 Comes in a great flavor selection , the container comes in very handy . I can reuse the container to stored the bag protein shake , i 've purchased.I purchased this item for my husband , he seems to enjoyed it . It 's a great for weight gain and muscle bodybuild.It has an easy measuring scoop . It 's also an excellent source of protein compare to eating raw eggs , or protein bars .
 Really great taste . My new favorite . I used to like chocolate malt but mocha cappuccino beats that hands down.I will definitely reorder this product.Arrival was faster than arrival date I was given .
 OP Gold is top of the pack as far as protein powders go . Mixes well , tastes decent , no giant scoops . Good buy for this on Amazon .
 This drink is like no other protein drink that I have ever tried . It 's so light , and dissolves quickly , plus it really taste just like chocolate milk ! ON rocks !
 This is my first time taking Whey . So I do n't have a lot of experience in reviewing it . However I think the taste is n't bad and its easy mixing . I have had it less than a month and have put on a few pounds of lean muscle . I 'll be getting it again .
 My husband uses this product for protein shakes . He has tried other brands and did n't like the flavor . He says this is good .
 I 'm on a quest to try all of ON whey protein flavors . This one is definitely good , but does n't beat out rocky road . No complaints arrived on time .
 Love the taste , the quality of the protein is great . It 's a blend , not an isolate , but that really does n't matter to me . If I had the cash I 'd be getting a 10-20 pound bag of the stuff to save in the long run !
 I have been having this for a many months now . Its a highly rated economical product with nice taste and I dont get bored by it . I see myself sticking to this product for a long time .
 Great taste . Good amino content improved recovery . I 'm a long time buyer and will continue to do so in the future . Just do n't up the price
 Excelent product I recommend it , I recived the product faster and it was good and I recommend it al all .
 I have always been a huge fan of optimum nutrition protein . Theirs is held to high standards and is always a very clean and pure protein that tastes good and is not in huge clumps . I wanted to buy a lot because you get a better deal when buying it in bulk . So when I read that the coffee flavor was a limited time , I went ahead and bought 5 lbs of it . -LRB- For those wondering , I use two scoops after lifting weights -RRB- The taste of it is just alright . I enjoy coffee for the most part , and this is not really like a cup of coffee -LRB- then again , you can not expect it to be -RRB- . I have had a few of my friends try it and a lot of people like it , but to me its just ehh . It tastes like coffee but its not high end coffee . I honestly prefer the chocolate over it , so I advise you , if you already have a flavor you like , stick with it . If you are going to get this flavor , I would advise first getting a smaller size amount and if you like it , buy more . Like i said , I do not really enjoy it , but I have no problem taking down two scoops every other day.I would not buy again -LRB- I would get a different flavor -RRB- .
 Name brand Whey For a good price !! This particular whey came recommended by my personal trainer as the best one around ! 1
 This has a decent flavor but a little sweet for me . I sometimes add a little unsweetened cocoa powder to give it a deeper flavor . Easy to mix , low in carbs . Add extra flavorings to mix it up , peppermint , rasberrry crystal lite , good instant coffee crystals for mocha . Enjoy
 This was my first protein powder purchase , I 'm a 31 year old male that just wants to add some bulk to my muscles . I tasted it today for the first time after my morning workout and was very pleasantly surprised that it tasted kind of like rich chocolatey Ovaltine . It had a bit of an aftertaste , but nothing bad . Very pleased with the taste , now just hoping that it does it 's job . We 'll see !
 The Extreme Milk Chocolate is probably the best tasting Whey out there . The sweetness is not overwhelming and it does not have the artifical taste of the other flavors . Taste even better with low fat milk .
 So far the best tasting protein shake my husband and I have ever used . I also like it because of the low sugar and carb count . Great when blended with black coffee !
 this is my favorite protein by far , easy to mix , great taste , good BCAA 's & i could n't ask for more .
 Long time user of the product -LRB- which by the way is a great product to begin with -RRB- , and just found a lot of value in buying it from Amazon and actually have even scheduled a delivery on the same . Great new feature for a discounted price . : -RRB-
 There are already a thousand sites that recommend Optimum , the fact is it works so I 'm not going to go over it again.Of every product i have tried , this one is by far the better tasting -LRB- double chocolate is the one i bought -RRB- . I think 5lb is the perfect size just because it is easier to store .
 This product mixes very well with just a shaker and tastes great . I work very long hours and dont always have time or the ability to pack the proper lunch/dinner . It is so easy to carry in the truck and just make a shake to get me the proper nutrition I need . i highly recommend the optimum nutrition whey protein . There are so many flavors to choose from there is a flavor for anyone . I prefer the stawberry and tropical punch .
 This stuff tastes great and I 've actually noticed It has helped me bulk up over the past 6 months of use .
 I bought the coffee flavored version and this along with some milk taste great . Very high quality protein that disssolves easily with no clumps .
 Taste great , dissolves well , quick and easy protein power . Would recommend for those who like to drink protein powder . Filling too for after workout drink .
 Liked this product , but prefer the all natural . Has a little different taste than I am use to . Like the double chocolate flavor .
 Receiving this Whey made my day . First of all , it came literally overnight . It was supposed to come in 5-7 days , but it literally came in a day . That says nothing about the product itself , though . I 've just finished a tub of the extreme milk chocolate , which had a sickening , cloying fake-chocolate taste and I was eager to get rid of and unsatisfied with . I love coffee , and this Whey - actually tastes like good coffee - . I was simply blown away at how high quality the product was , I do n't have much more to say .
 I really like this protein shake . I mix it with fat free milk and it tastes great . I usually mix it in a bottle and it leaves some chunks on the bottom . I guess it would be better to mix in a mixer .
 Being a bigger guy i go through this stuff real fast ... this container lasts me 1 month ... and as much as i like chocolate ... i needed change . The chocolate coconut scratched that itch ' -RRB- It 's as good as any &#34; good &#34; protien mix , little sweet but the coconut is a good change for anyone who is getting bored with plain chocolate . I drink protien for the benefits not for the taste , so any perks -LRB- flavor enhancements -RRB- are just bonus 's . Because lets face it everyone , you aint goina be comparing this to a chocolate malt from the diner down the road haha . .
 I chose the chocolate mint flavor and I would actually choose to drink it rather than just get it down like some other protein powders I 've tried .
 You get the best bang for your buck with this Whey . The sales consultants at GNC have also admitted it . This Whey tastes great , dissolves well and is relatively low calorie . After trying many different brands , both my wife and I have stuck with Gold Standard for the past year .
 One of the best protein powders available on the market . I bought the last one at GNC for almost 10 bucks more . It is a good deal from Amazon . Double rich Chocolate flavor . Taste is pretty good if you drink it with non-fat milk . Tastes better and mixes better than the GNC brand protein . This is my usual after-workout drink . I will most likely order my next one from Amazon too .
 This is the only protein powder which tastes like chocolate and nothing else , I highly recommend this flavor . Moreover , I used the ` Subscribe and Save ' and got an additional 15 % off - better deal than anywhere else.Pros
 Best tasting whey I have ever had ! No additonal `` stuff '' in it I do n't need - GREAT protein drink ! Mixes great with no grit - Will get again !!!
 The product came in the estimated amount of time which was a plus.The taste is n't as good as I heard it would be but it 's bearable.I use this when I ca n't get a meal in after morning workouts before school . 24 grams of protein a scoop is great and works well . Also was cheaper ordering from here than say certain supplement stores .
 This stuff is effective and well-priced . I 've had better gains on it than I have with other products . The downside is that the vanilla tastes like chalk .
 It tastes and works great for a good price.I recommend the chocolate its great with skim milk and peanut butter.I drink two 150 gram protein shakes a day and include a whole chicken baked at a local grocery store with seasonings only each day . While taking this for two weeks now I see an improvement already compared to my regular whey .
 I love this product . As a person who exercises regularly I have enjoyed the quick results with this product . This is a quick and easy way to get the protein needed to help the body heal after a workout . Very reasonable price !
 Delicious , mixes well , decent price . I have tried a handful of differnet kinds of protien and this was by far the best .
 This is some of the best tasting protein powder there is . I 'd like to vouch for its effectiveness , but how does one really know when you are supplementing it with other diet and exercise . Nevertheless , this is a quality tasting product though not as good as the double rich chocolate IMO . I 'll be getting ON whey for a while into the future I am sure , after it replaced my ProtaQuest -LRB- also very very tasty -RRB- which got a little on the expensive side .
 the package and taste and price are great ... 63 dollars ... doesnt get cheaper than this ... and doesnt taste likee met rx products which give u a sachharine like taste ...
 I had tried other whey protiens from my local grocery stores and GNC . After seeing all the great reviews for this product I decided to give it a try . It mixes much better than other proteins I tried and the flavor is awesome . The vanilla ice cream tastes really good mixed with milk on my morning cereal I have since tried the double rich chocolate and it tastes so much better than store bought chocolate milk . All around a great product without all the extra junk found in other whey proteins . Amazon and Optimum Nutrition are now my goto source for my future suppliment needs .
 Very high in protein , tastes great . I add a heaping tablespoon to my cereal in the morning to add 10 grams of protein .
 Fine consistency makes it easy to mix , it tastes pretty good , and the brand is one of the most reliable out there . Would buy again
 In my opinion this is the best protein out there because this is cheapest protein if you buy in bulk and its high quality whey protein . That is why I only buy the 10 pound bags because you 're going to eventually run out and you save $ in the long run . Also , i put on like 10 pounds of muscle in the first 6 weeks i started taking this protein .
 Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey is great . The company does n't lie and the protein powder is great . I 'm actually writing this review because there 's just something weird going on with this flavor . It tastes funky , I do n't think I 'd recommend it , and now I have 75 servings left to finish . Tastes a little like ground up cookie crisp with a weird aftertaste , not like the oreo milkshake that I was going for . Anyway , just my two cents . The stuff is still super useful for hitting my daily protein intake.On the other hand , Vanilla ice cream and extreme milk chocolate both taste pretty great mixed with skim milk . Mixing with coconut or almond milk is pretty tasty too , but I would n't recommend mixing with water if you 're sensitive at all to taste/texture . It makes the powder super watery and not that tasty . But you do what you got ta do .
 ON products are always reliable . That said , this tastes pretty good when mixed with just water . I love mint chocolate chip ice cream so the mint taste was n't over bearing or too minty at all . I took one star off BC it was difficult for me to mix it with other components like fruit with this flavor opposed to what I typically drink which is the extreme chocolate flavor . Also , I got used to the taste and could n't bare any longer BC of my inability to find good mixes that are low in calorie while tasting great .
 This is by far the best Protein out there ! Also some of the purest ! the taste is amazing even thought that 's not their main focus ! the protein to carb ratio is amazing ! also for the price you get a lot more serving than you do with other companies ! Ive had the chocolate , vanilla , cake batter , banana , french vanilla ! and they are all pretty good ! I loved the cake batter , but the chocolate I could make really good shakes out of it ! I also seen a lot more gains when adding this to my daily workout/cardio ! Like it says on the tub you must consume you body weight/more in protein threw quality proteins spread out threw the day to gain maximum gains ha ! I would definitely buy this/recommend it !
 Best protein drink I have ever had!A little to spendy ???? Was $ 39 now $ 59 ?????? Can i get a better deal next time I make a purchase ????
 I 've been using this product for the past 5 years or so and I 've always been satisfied . I paid a little more this time though because the previous vendor did not have it available . It 's still worth it .
 I have tried many different protein powders and this one is by far the best ! My goal is to gain muscle and lose fat and I have been into fitness for 7 years . I am looking for something low in carbs , sodium , and fat , with high quality ingredients that tastes decent . This product is the perfect combination . Tastes good and does not have added fillers or tons of artificial ingredients . The first ingredient is protein and that is important . I will be sticking with this product and highly recommend it .
 Tastes amazing , no stomach aches , no need to eat before , and mixes well with water . I love it , and will designate it as my go-to protein mix for my workouts .
 Great tasting , cheap price , top of the line protein . I got a great deal through amazon . I 'll be getting some more tubs of protein once I 'm done with this batch
 I was very pleased with this product . It mixes well and has a good taste . I am also not left with a chalky taste in my mouth . I have now bought this brand in several other flavors with equal success .
 I 've tried multiple flavors of the Optimum Nutrition , and all of them have been pretty decent . This one tastes to me like the Hershey 's style strawberry syrup . It is still slightly chalky , but it mixes well with other things like in my oatmeal , in a milkshake , etc. . It 's a pretty nice flavor .
 I ca n't really say if it 's effective in terms of providing protein , but I leave that up to the science guys to test . I can say , however , it tastes good enough that you wo n't gag drinking it . I got the chocolate milk flavor . It does not taste exactly like the real thing ... if you know how the sugar substitutes -LRB- e.g. , equal , splenda , sweet and low , etc. -RRB- taste like then I would say that it 's tastes like chocolate milk with the `` fake '' sugar -- makes sense b/c otherwise the product would have loads of carbs .
 The ON Gold Standard is amongst the best whey protein powders and they have a ton of flavors to suit just about anyone . It mixes very easily in just a shaker . I love coconut , so the choco/coconut is my favorite .
 I 've been buying this protein for over 6 years now and it never disappoints . High quality , awesome flavor and a nice high 80 % protein count . Do n't bother with anything else but this !!!
 I drink ON 's Rich Chocolate Whey protein mixed with Silk 's Chocolate Soy Milk every morning as a breakfast shake . It fills me up for quite some time and I 've even noticed an increase in stamina while completing both cardio and weight training . Just be sure to mix the appropriate powder to liquid ratio or you 're sure to have lumps regardless of how good of a shaker/blender you own . Good stuff .
 Chocolate is still the best but the tropical punch mixed with some other low calorie drink mix makes it taste good .
 This protein has the absolute best nutritional values on the market , plus great flavor and it mixes better than anything else I 've used . It 's by far my favorite protein powder . Unfortunately , it costs an arm and a leg , so I only buy it when it 's on sale or I can find a great deal on it . Up until about a year ago , it was half the price it is today , but Optimum jacked it up when they introduced their `` starter '' line of protein powder to make this stuff seem more premium . The lower costing stuff still tastes good , but it includes a lot of extra fat and carbs . Highly recommended if you can find it for a good price .
 This is by far the only good tasting protein shake i have had yet , i will defiantly recommend it to someone that has n't tried it yet .
 This is one of the best products , but I did not like the banana cream flavor , I will be trying another flavor .
 I was taking Pro Complex by ON , but the price of that was just too much . I decided to try these instead and love it . Not only is it affordable , but it tastes really good . I usually mix it with fat free milk and it pretty much tastes like a chocolate shake with a hint of the protein taste . Although this has less protein per serving compared to Pro Complex , it will benefit most people who use it in their diet and workout routine .
 i love this brand of protein . I have tried all brands and this is the only brand i will ever use from now on . Only reason i didnt give this one a 5 star is the taste . I did n't care for this one as much as I likes the chocolate mint . but it is still pretty damn good
 I really enjoyed this product . It has a great taste , not like some of the other products I have tried . This is my second purchase and as long as they sell it , I 'll keep buying it
 If you like banana 's buy this . Delivery was on point . Taste is fantastic.I mix with ice milk oat mill and peanut butter .
 price is good and paper bag is more flexible than the giant bottle.find out costco has different brand name product with same size.This big size should have more discount.After all , this is good product .
 this is an amazing delicious out standard protein . it help you recover fast and best of all its taste.I am very skinny and helped me gain some musclesso yeah highly recommend it
 I think you ca n't get a better healthy product for body building then this , and to be able to make a nice shake too is such a bonus
 This tastes like the old Frankenberry cereal . It dissolves very well and is easy going down . It is much better than the strawberry-banana and the vanilla ice cream that I have also tried .
 Both my husband and I are very pleased with the Optimum Nutrition Gold Whey . We are both weight lifters and in our 60 ` ies.We have tried different brands and , in our opinion , this product beats all the others . The ingredients are much healthier than what other brands contain.We highly recommend it!Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100 % Instantized Whey , Double Rich Chocolate , 10-Pound Bag
 I have been taking this powder for a couple years now and can honestly say it is the best protein powder I have ever used . It mixes very easily and tastes great even in water . At 24g per scoop it is one of the highest sources of protein in a powder shake . The price here at amazon for the 10 lb bag is very reasonable . You wo n't be disappointed . Do it !
 Well from a flavor standpoint this stuff is great . I mix it with real banana and frozen strawberries . I have been using it for about a month so I cant comment on the effectiveness , but others I know that use it say it works . Will be trying other flavors in the future and will comment on those too .
 Both my wife and I have been using this product at least for the last four years . We like the fact that they have a great variety of flavors and it mixes well in water without the clumping .
 I used to use the wheybolic Extreme that they sell at GNC , but it had way too many calories in it . This was a nice mix of relatively low-calories , decent taste , and just enough protein . I drank this throughout the day , not just before or after my workout , so I went through the whole thing in a month . I have no qualms with this product .
 I love the flavor and it mixes great in a shaker or blender . My favorite recipe is 8 oz of vanilla soy milk , 1 scoop , and one frozen banana . May need a high end blender for frozen fruit.Update
 What I like about optimum protein besides the nutrition facts is the taste . It is not too sweet like other brands that I have tried .
 I like a tasty protein , without having to add honey or some other sweetener . This protein gives you about 26 grams per serving . When you work out you need 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight , so if your target body weight is 190 lbs then you need 190 grams of protein a day.The taste is quite good -LRB- vanilla cream -RRB- and mixes easily . I have been replacing meals with a protein drink , and have lost an inch on my waistline in a week . I am not hungry . Plus , I 'm weight training 3 days a week . Five stars !!
 This protein is really great . It uses very high quality fast proteins , mixes really easy , tastes good and is not expensive . None of the others that I 've tried are as good on all counts . I 've found that nearly all of Optimum 's products are very high quality
 Bought a 2-pound `` tub '' to try it out before I commit to a 5 or 10-pound . Most of the time I mix it with water , sometimes with milk , either way this tastes just fine.It 's not nearly as sweet as some other products , which could be a pro or a con depending on your tastes .
 PROS : Mixes easily.Tastes great . No milky tang common of cheaper whey products.Easy on the stomach.CONS : Wish it was cheaper .
 This is one of the best protein powders out there . It is fairly cheap in price , but not in quality . The double rich chocolate is the best flavor since it goes well with milk or water . It has no gritty taste and it mixes very well . Highly recommended .
 Not much to say other than it actually taste like chocolate , unlike their vanilla and strawberry -LRB- yuck ! -RRB- . I 've been buying this brand and flavor for a couple of years now and have no intention of switching . The price is the lowest I 've found to date so I 'll be buying again from this vendor when I need more .
 I was told about this product by a friend , and I found Amazon provided the best price . I am very happy with the protein , it tastes great and provides key nutrients for the body .
 my biggest concern was that it would not taste good . But that concern was been taken care of . It tastes awesome ! Chocolate mint all the way !
 My son-in-law recommended it . It takes good , even though I only mix it with water . It is low in fat and high in protein . I drink it after I workout with my trained for a half and hour , then I do a half hour of cardio . I think that it is much better than the Kroger Brand which I have also tried .
 I am so impressed with how this product got here so fast with free shipping . I got a great deal , it 's a great product , and I look to order again . The expiration date was still 2 years away , one of my main concerns before ordering since its a food product and it was n't listed .
 This product mixes much better than all other comparable products that I 've tried . It also tastes pretty decent as well .
 Gold Standard whey protein is IMO some of the best . But I would advise to stay away from the TROPICAL PUNCH flavor ! I tried it with water , then tried it with berries and bananas . Gross either way . No recipe has saved my shake from this overpowering , chemical-tasting fruity flavor . I will update this review , when I try another flavor .
 Optimum Nutrition Gpld 100 % Whey is the best tasting power protein drink mix that I have found . 60mg . of protein in one glass . The product mixes easily with water , but I prefer non-fat milk and some ice in a mixer . The taste is great . Many flavors - I like to mix Milk Choc . . or Double Choc . with the Vanilla Ice cream mix . Yum ! Great for Gastric ByPass patients to get your protein fast . Online price is good too !
 This is my third time buying a 5 lb container of Chocolate flavored ON Gold Standard Whey . The flavor is just ok , which is the best you can expect in a whey supplement . If you 've ever had Trader Joe 's vanilla soy protein , this product will taste like sweet ambrosia.It is super easy to mix , which is very important . I usually dump a dry scoop of it into a used disposable water bottle and mix it with water at the gym . It mixes so well , there is no need to have a special shaker bottle , unlike some other products.The flavor is ok . I made the mistake of buying the vanilla flavor last time - it 's sickeningly sweet . Do not buy vanilla ! Stick to chocolate or double chocolate.I noticed that after a while , the unused product starts to thicken a little and stick to my plastic funnel ; I assume that the powder starts to absorb moisture . My solution was to tie a cheesecloth sack full of uncooked rice to absorb the moisture , and it is working pretty well .
 This product is awesome and tastes GREAT ! This is a perfect addition for a boost of protein in your diet .
 This is the best protein powder that I have consumed compared to other similar products . I did some research on the type of protein that is good for muscle building and everyday consumption and found a lot of information about whey protein . I researched different brands and found Optimum Nutrition very popular . I feel good after drinking protein shakes . I got the best deal on Amazon for a 5 lbs protein powder tub . I am so happy with the product that I have signed up for frequent automatic shipments .
 Easy to mix with water . I use a Blender cup , and it 's ready to drink in seconds ... even if I put in ice before I mix it . Tastes awesome-like a treat vs a necessity . Wish it were cheaper . But if you go in to Vitamin Shoppe , they 'll price match their online price .
 I 've tried GNC and Muscle Milk proteins and the Optimum Nutrition is my favorite so far . It has a good flavor , mixes easily , does n't have any irritating side effects and it 's a good value ounce per ounce.I took it down to four stars for two reasons
 I bought the Strawberry flavor and it tastes much better than I expected out of a protein powder . I take a scoop with a glass of milk after every workout . It goes down easy and keeps me full so I do n't feel the need to eat other foods loaded with carbs or junk food . The protein is a plus too .
 This product came highly recommended from my Dad and brother . The cookies n ' cream flavor is actually quite delicious and it is easy to mix . Makes a great breakfast after a morning workout . My muscles always fell better .
 Did everything I expected it to . I bought it on a sale , and just finished it . Low cal , low carbs , low fat . You can find lower of those three with the same whey protein amount , and you can find better quality , but not at this price point.High quality and usable by pretty much anybody . Vanilla , Chocolate Malt and Cookies and Cream are my favorites .
 I 'm not much fan of this particular flavor . Like any of the other ON whey protein powders I 've tried , they dissolve great in water , and they seem to produce less `` gastronomical events '' than the other protein powders I 've tried .
 This product taste awesome ^ ^ . This Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard will give u everything that u need ^ ^ .
 This is the best protein I have ever used . The taste is not the greatest but pound for pound this stuff is the best in the industry . And if you buy from Amazon , they have the best customer service and shipping I have ever seen . I highly recommend this product through Amazon.com .
 Protein supplements have come a long way . This really is the Gold Standard . Good taste , mixes easily , and there 's no quicker way to remedy a protein deficiency . Delivery was unbelievably quick .
 Pretty happy with this product , I will buy a different flavor next time . Not a huge fan of the vanilla ice cream , does n't go well in fruit smoothies .
 The product tastes great and mixes well and is an excellent value with free shipping and a `` subscribe and save '' subscription ... only about $ 35 .
 As a first-thing-in-the-morning , pre - and post-workout supplement , Optimum Nutrition 's 100 % Whey Gold Standard is hard to beat . And , given its quality and effectiveness , it 's the best protein powder one can spend their money on.Before I became a regular user , I 'd read a lot of reviews that said this product was great , and I could n't agree more with those reviewers once I tried it out for myself.And though I first started to take it only as a post-workout supplement , I 've recently found that combining it with plain and strong black coffee -LRB- without sugar -RRB- about 20 minutes before a training session can work wonders for me when it comes to endurance and stamina . In my opinion , it even beats supplements that are to be taken specifically pre-workout in terms of effectiveness.I usually try to keep my weight-training sessions within a one-hour time limit , and if I start training without having taken my scoop of ON Whey , it 's a lot harder to keep things going with mad intensity -LRB- as I like to train -RRB- after the first 30 minutes . If I do take it , then I can rest assured that there 's going to be no crash or burn-outs before I 'm done with all of my sets .
 I was unlucky enough to order strawberry . Anyone ever have pepto bismol ? That will be the exact flavor and taste . I 've asked several friends what this smelled like , and they came up with the exact same answer . After a while I had to force my friends to help finish the rest of my powder . The other flavors are awesome , and it 's a great product which is why I gave it four stars instead of one .
 Very happy about fast arrival of the product . Will continue to order more protein supply . Thanks
 This is the only Whey product I 've used . I purchased it based on the amazon ratings and review comments.It 's got a great flavor and mixes well . I usually mix mine with a banana and chocolate -LRB- yup , I 'm a chocoholic , he he -RRB- soy milk . It is creamy which is good . It 's not watery , nor like a thick shake , so I say ` creamy ' . As I said the whey mixes well , does clump or anything . And , the flavor is good , but not perfect . There is a slight , very slight , after taste which is just a tad bitter . But , as I said , this is the first whey I 've ever tried , so all of them may have an after taste.I would buy this again . But , may try vanilla . I tried mixing blueberries and strawberries with the whey and regular lite milk and I could not taste the berries . I can taste the banana with the double chocolate though , so it works for me . I have heard about adding orange juice to it , and that it is great like that , but have yet to try it .
 Looking to build muscle , try this great tasting whey . The value ca n't be beat , I looked and could n't find it cheaper .
 Best protein powder I have ever used . I place it in my coffee in the morning and it always mixes easily and stays mixed .
 This is my second bag . It came fast and in great condition . Tastes great and i 've definitley seen results . Highly Recommended.I 've been lifting hard for almost 3 years now and have tried a lot of different proteins and this is by far the best
 As a picky eater , I must say this flavor protein is not bad at all . I use 2 scoops with just about 5oz of water in a shaker and it goes down fine .
 I 've tried a lot of protein shakes and this one just tops them all . The taste is excellent ! So far i 've tried vanilla ice cream and cookies 'n cream and they 're both excellent , not too strong of flavor like most shakes . Which is a plus & it does n't make your shake all thick and hard to take down . My friends also say chocolate mint is a good flavor too . This is an excellent post workout protein , since it absorbs a lot quicker than other shakes out there , ie . Muscle Milk . Muscle milk is a great product also , I use to take it before bed . . since it slowly gets absorb so it 'll last through the night . I 'm sold this will be the only whey protein I will ever buy !
 I used to use Nitro-Tech but the Double Rich Chocolate by Optimum Nutrition tastes great and seems to work just as well as the pricer Nitro-Tech stuff . Just make sure you do n't over do it with the milk and you should be fine ! I made the mistake of mixing 2 scoops with 4 cups of milk and that left me with horrible stomach problems days later .
 ON Whey protein is effective for those who want to build big muscle but it also helps in any sport as most sports rely on body muscle , and this product prevent protein deprivation in our body , and protein is the raw material that our body use to develop strong muscle , hence it improves our performance each time after workout . It contains BCAAs amino acids that eliminate fatigue in our body muscle after heavy workout . Price is good . I have tried strawberry flavor before , so when I first try vanilla flavor , it is not as good . I still prefer strawberry flavor . The reason that I choose vanilla is because I guess vanilla flavors do n't have artificial coloring whereas strawberries are . Since I 'm taking it very regularly I tend to be cautious .
 This is a great supplement ! Tastes good , mixes pretty easily , and I 've really noticed the difference in how it helps burn fat . Plus , it 's reasonably priced for the amount you get . Of course , you still have to work out hard too , so if you are commited to doing that , I would highly reccomend this product.Mark
 I have tried quite a few whey protein 's but this one is by far the best . I have the double rich chocolate and it is awesome there is usually no clumps and usually i dont even use a shaker i will just by a bottle of milk like the 16 0z . from the gas station and drop it in there , of course after you drink a little bit of the milk so the mix will fit in the bottle . The best part is that is just one small scoop not a huge shovel you have to put in the liquid . good product cheap and easy .
 When I first started working out I just bought the regular GNC brand protein and it was ok but I really did n't want to drink it so I gradually left the weightlifting scene behind . Now that I 'm back in it I read some reviews and decided to buy this brand but unfortunately GNC only had Double Chocolate -LRB- not a choc fan -RRB- but I bought it anyways . I just use water since I ca n't tolerate milk that well and it still taste amazing and I do n't even like chocolate all that much . I shake mine and have never had a problem with clumping or anything . There are other products that have a lot more protein per serving but why down a shake that taste like -LSB- ... -RSB- once a day when you can drink this at every meal and more . Will order Vanilla next since that flavor is my favorite so hopefully it taste just has good . Buy from Amazon , GNC is too expensive .
 I 've been taking this stuff for approximately a week . It does help me meet my protein intake goal and it tastes pretty decent.I do n't like milk so I drink it with a small bottle of blue Gatorade followed by a glass of water . If you want to just mix this with water ... be warned . It does not taste very good in water.Again , with some gatorade this is very drinkable .
 taste great , taste even better if you add 3 spoon fulls of peanut butter to it .
 This is a great product and it is highly effective!Papasan in AZP.S . O.N. is NOT one of the protein powders reviewed in Consumer Reports !
 mixed well , tastes good , but honestly there are better flavors available . tastes a little like peptobismol . id stick with vanilla .
 It 's not a pure WPI , but dollar for dollar , it is one of the better Whey Protein Concentrates -LRB- with WPI mixed in -RRB- that you can get , it is a consistent formula with good quality control , and it comes in a huge bag . This reliable , affordable averageness is how Optimum staked their claim and many customers are happy with that . If you 're buying designer , pure 100 % WPI whey , maybe you take yourself too seriously and you ought to eat better food anyway.This does have sucralose but it is gluten-free , and it also has very low lactose . I am pretty lactose intolerant and this whey has never caused me serious issues . The amino acid profile is just plain excellent.The flavors are ok . Like the 100 % WPI person above , if you care too much about the flavor of whey supplements , maybe you should check your head and go eat some pudding or something instead .
 i never use any protein , i purchased this product by reviews and rating , so the taste is good and easy to prepare , but for result i will comment after when i will fineshed
 im a lifter so i try every natural advantage i can . i love the taste of this stuff and its become the treat i look for after a long workout .
 the product seams good but it has no big effect on my body , but I think it 's my body resistance toward gaining weight .
 When I decided to start using whey protein powder , I did extensive research and found ON Whey Gold Standard was reviewed to be the best . And it was . Best taste , best consistency , best protein . I started out at 120 pounds of skin and bones and now I 'm a robust 220 pounds and it only took 6 weeks .
 I 've been using O.N. Products for years . As for this one , I 've been using after taking a break from lifting for a while . Starting this a few weeks ago , I 've managed to pick my strength back up and see immediate gains in lifting . I only take 1 scoop in the morning in a shake , and that 's it . Many people stack the protein throughout the day as suggested on the container , which should n't be done . This stuff works well , and is more efficient if you do n't take it multiple times a day , reason being your kidneys can only process so much protein at once and the waste just builds up and can destroy your organs . Just be smart about using it . There are n't enough disclaimers out there about supplements.As far as this protein , the flavor is great , the size is affordable , and this stuff helps your body recover and grow mass , while still cutting you . It i definitely one of the leaner proteins out there .
 Everyone 's taste buds are different , but this Whey blend is too sweet for my taste . Otherwise appears to be a good product .
 I 'm very happy with this product . It tastes great and mixes better than any other I 've tried .
 I love this stuff !! I can not get enough , I drink it every morning . I always get the double chocolate flavor . This is the best tasting to me . Not too sweet , so I can drink it on a daily basis and never get bored with the flavor . **
 Great protein supplement , I buy this because it 's also low in calories . Because of this though , its not the best tasting , but it is n't nasty either . Getting it for a deal on Amazon is cheaper than getting it for more money at GNC , and this comes to your door .
 This is a good protein at a relatively decent price . There are some cheaper options out there but Optimum seems to have a good reputation for quality . The powder mixes easily in milk and water . I use a Blender Bottle , without the wisk , and there is no clumping or mixability issues at all . Also , I 've had no issues with digestibility , again in milk and water . I 'm somewhat lactose intolerant so this was something of a concern for me -LRB- I only drink it in 8 ounces of milk once a day to avoid any GI issues -RRB- . Also , the double rich chocolate tastes really good . Mixed with water it 's okay but mixed with the Skim Plus milk that I use when I take it before bed , it tastes as good as any chocolate milk or milkshake . I wish I could say the same for the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor , which tastes terrible . I bought a 5-gallon jug in an attempt to mix things up but the flavoring is terrible . I 'm definitely not looking forward to choking down the rest of that jug . I started to mix one scoop of this flavor with the vanilla to make it more palatable but now I 'm just looking to finish it off as quickly as possible .
 Great protein . Mix it with soy milk and it tastes like cocoa puffs . Do n't know how they do it with such little sugar content .
 I have a pretty sensitive stomach and when I mix protein with milk let 's just say I am not a pleasant person to be around lol . A friend gave me a scoop of his and let me tell you I have n't looked back . It 's an isolate protein so you wo n't be getting all that proprietary blend crud that god knows what 's in it . I mix this with soy milk 3 times a day and I swear it tastes like a chocolate milkshake and absolutely no gastrointestinal issues .
 good quality . 5 lbs finish quickly , so I am glad I tool this product . That is it , three more words = -RRB-
 Optimum Nutrition has done a great job with this protein , its got a lot of great whey protein with a great taste , its good with water but great with really cold milk , if you need a good whey that taste great here is a great big tub of goodness .
 I have tried three different flavors so far and extreme milk chocolate was by far the best . Double rich chocolate was a disappointment but mint chocolate was also quite good . I ca n't tell if this product works better than other protein powders , but it is in the middle of the pack pricing wise and at the top taste wise . Highly recommend.EDIT : Tastiness of flavors I 've tried so far : Mint Chocolate
 Best flavor hands down . Been ordering it for almost a year now and Amazon is the cheapest . I 've ordered at bodybuilding.com , massnutrition.com , ebay , all of them . The most bang for your buck = Amazon . Check for yourself if you do n't believe me : -RRB-
 The Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Double Rich Chocolate , is the most delicious protein I have ever tasted . It is perfect for oatmeal breakfast mix with sliced bananas as well as a protein shake with soy milk . The aroma contributes to the taste as it is an aroma that overtakes your taste buds and makes you want to take a spoon and just eat the protein .
 I 've been using this for about a week now , and while I ca n't vouch for its effectiveness , but I can vouch for its deliciousness.Tips for delicious consumption : Double Rich Chocolate ProteinPlain Greek YogurtHoneySplash of vanilla extractWhen you mix it up it seriously tastes like Brownie Batter !
 I used to spend lots of money buying meat and other items high in protein at the grocery store in order to get the necessary amount of protein for weight lifting . The problem with doing that is that for one you are spending a lot of money , and the second problem is that there is a lot of fat in meat . I have been using a 2 lb of this product for 1 month and I am already loving it and seeing results . I have blown away my old max in bench press ! I love this stuff because it tastes good and has no fat ! Also , if you 're interested it seems like Optimum Nutrition thoroughly researches all of their products and tests them for quality assurance . That is something I can really respect about a supplement company .
 This is the second time I purchase ON whey , the first time I bought the double rich chocolate . It was very rich and sweet , too sweet at times . Then I bought the cheap stuff at Costco which said was the same as Cytosport Muscle Milk and the taste just was n't good at all . So this time I went with ON Coffee flavor . Reading the reviews here , people said its very good , some said it taste like coffee ice cream and some said its like Starbucks Frappuchino . I tried it just now and I absolutely love it . Its very tasty , not as sweet as the double rich chocolate and definitely not like Starbucks Frappuchino which I find too sugary . I would say its like a low fat coffee ice cream flavor . Being a coffee lover , this is absolutely perfect . I usually drink whey after workout , but it looks like I will drink it more often even on non-workout days since it can satisfy my afternoon coffee craving ! Definitely recommend this to others needing to buy whey and for coffee lovers too since it is much more heavy than Starbucks cold coffee drinks !!! Good source of protein and use 1 % or low fat milk .
 Ever have waffle crisp cereal ? If so , this is what it tastes and smells like . SO GOOD ! If not , you 're missing out !
 it is the top selling product in it 's category on amazon.com and bodybuilding.com for good reason !!! Very good product . I highly reccomend it !
 I bought 3 flavors so far of Gold Standard Whey Protein
 Great product ! Taste is really good ! Especially mixed and blended with 2 scoops peanut butter , a banana , blueberries , and a few strawberries !
 This is the perfect quick shake for me right after my workouts . I usually just shake it up with a little skim milk & ice . Even my 12 year old son loves the taste!I am a Nutrition major so I read the labels carefully & this shake meets all of my needs with the amount of protein , low in carbs , and low in sugars.All of that combined with it 's great taste are the reasons I will order again.I 'm looking forward to trying the banana shake next .
 I have never set taste as a very high priority when determining what brand to go with . I could always just wolf it down . This is by far the tastiest protein shake I 've ever had -LRB- i am big into bananas -RRB- . Tastes great with low-fat milk or water . I will update with results in the coming weeks because i just began using this product along with my second time through p90x -LRB- first time through was last year -RRB-
 THIS is what protein was meant to be . I was using a Sams Club 5 lb bag of chocolate protein for a while , and let me say , this stuff is a million times better . The Sams Club protein mixed `` syrupey '' and thick , whereas ON Gold Standard mixed SMOOTH and `` loose , '' like a good protein shake should be . It even mixes easier . The taste is phenomenal , just a great quality protein overall.I still have yet to see it 's after-workout effects , but I believe it 's gon na be good news.I would definitely recommend this protein to a friend , and this is the only protein I 'll be buying from now on ! Very happy I decided to try ON .
 I was always against supplementing . To me , it seemed somewhat unnatural and I wanted to build a strong athletic body rather then one that was huge but had no purpose or practical use . I did n't want huge bulging arms , a 200lb chest or be able to bench press 400 . As a martial artist -LRB- I do chinese wushu , which is similar to advanced gymnastics in terms of the toll it takes on your body -RRB- , I needed to build a body that was lean , fast and flexible . I accredit this product with helping me , and currently , achieve that goal . You wo n't get BIG of this product . What you get is exactly what you need if your aiming for the build that I am still working on getting . If your a man / woman who wants to build that athletic body everyone ogles at in health magazines , this product is probably right for you . If you want to get huge , you may want to try something else .
 5lbs of protein for less money than 3lbs of other products -LRB- for example , GNC AMP -RRB- . Dissolves very well , an entire serving in an 8 oz cup and it dissolves , I am not used to this . The product works , it 's cheap , and above all , it 's a supplement . It 's there to help you , not do the work for you . Do n't think twice , buy ON 100 % Whey , and buy it from Amazon .
 I often start feeling depleted in the middle of the afternoon , probably because blood sugar levels are dropping . Rather than spiking those levels with sugary drinks , or eating fat - and carb-laden snacks , I 've been mixing a cup of the French vanilla flavor with skim milk . This typically results in higher energy levels within 30 minutes and carries me until dinner.This is also very good as a remedy for diabetics who may start experiencing hypoglycemia from medication . While orange juice is the standard remedy , this works about as well with longer-lasting effects .
 This is the best protein i 've used by far . For those of you who do n't know , Optimum Nutrition makes and packages all their supplements in their own factories as opposed to many other brands ... which is one of the reasons they can put out such a high quality product . . tastes AMAZING -LRB- french vanilla creme is where its at -RRB- and completely dissolves in whatever you mix it with and goes down smooth . I 'm no expert , but imo you ca n't go wrong with ON products .
 I just started drinking protein shakes , and this is the first powder I bought . I like it . I had always heard that protein tastes chalky and bland , but that could n't be further from the truth . Optimum Nutrition Double Rich Chocolate tastes great to me .
 This is the first time I have tried ON . This protein poweder easily dissolves in a shaker bottle & it definitely taste good . It 's like drinking chococlate milk , but healthier . I will definitely buy again .
 Tastes great and mixes well . I use a small old immersion blender and this blends perfectly with no clumping at all in about 30 seconds . Good quality rivaling and even better than some more expensive brands .
 I hate the way most whey protein brands tastes . This is one of the very few I tried that is not gross . It is helping meet my protein needs , which I need because I workout a lot . I am not a huge meat eater so it is wonderful staple of my diet .
 Good product and taste very good . If you want put up some muscles go for it . The Chocolate flavor it 's amazing
 This is a very good product . It tastes quite good actually and has a good amount of protein . A real milkshake tastes better but this has no sugar and lots of protein . Worth it !
 Great taste and easy on the stomach . Overall the best protein shake for your money and quality one the market .
 Love this place , shipped right to my door for less than I can but it in any store around.I would recommend this company to anyone .
 Using as a meal supplement as well as for a boost after workout . I usually just mix with 8oz 1 % milk but sometimes will also add 8 oz of water -LRB- and a second scoop -RRB- to fill me up and hydrate after workout . Taste is very good . I 'm very pleased with product and plan to purchase again .
 This is a good product , I love the chocolate taste , I have to admit , I use a little more than suggested to give it an even stronger flavor , plus it blends pretty easy in my cheap blender .
 If your just introducing Whey into your diet , this is a great flavor to start with . It tastes like a chocolate milkshake , even when it 's just mixed with water . I just recently bought the All Natural Chocolate and I 'm not as happy with it . Happy lifting : -RSB-
 Best tasting whey out on the market ! I use ON immediately after my work outs and follow up with syntha-6 before bed and in the morning . I find that ON is much easier to mix and taste somewhat better than syntha-6 . But for straight up whey this is the best route to go .
 I bought it just for my wife 'cause she is a Vegetarian ` did n't eat meat and eggs ` so i thought the Optimum Nutrition can fix it ` need time to see '
 This is some great protein . I usually take three scoops plus 20 ounces of water and shake it up . It mixes very well with water and tastes great . Does not taste watered down at all . The protein has worked great for me so far . I work out around 4 to 5 times a week and this is perfect for quick recovery needs . 24 grams of protein a scoop keeps me from drinking shakes all day . I drink 2 and a half of these a day and feel fine . No bloated feeling after drinking which is a plus .
 This is my 2nd time ordering this product . I have tried other similar products but this one has some of the best nutritional info compared to others . Plus the chocolate taste goes wonderfully when added to cereals or taken with milk/water . I will definitely continue ordering this . Plus Amazon has extremely fast shipping on this , I got the free shipping and it still arrived in only 2 days !
 I have try other protein products , but this the best whey protein in the world . The taste is really good , many people say that cookies and cream is not good but form me is the best flavor of all .
 I love this product - I add a scoop to my morning smoothie and voila ! I have protein in my breakfast for only 120 calories . It has a mild favor -LRB- ca n't taste it much over the fruit -RRB- and dissolves well . I 'm very happy with this purchase . Its a huge container , so I 've shared with friends for the same purpose and they seem to really like it also .
 I moved from drinking `` Pure Protein '' to `` Optimum Nutrition '' because of its lesser cholesterol . Pure Protein had 80mg of cholesterol as opposed to Optimums 30mg of cholesterol . The lesser the cholesterol , the better for me !! If there 's another protein shake with less than 30mg of cholesterol drop me a message . Otherwise , I 'm liking this stuff . So far no bad aftertaste . Blends well . Nothing bad to say .
 This is one of the easier to mix and better tasting whey protein powders out there . I use a Blender Ball , and it mixes in seconds .
 I do n't have the biochemistry background to say weather or not this is a superior product . I feel stronger , with a better recovery time , but I am taking several different supplements and vitamins so it would be impossible to isolate the effects of one over the other.What I can tell you is that this is a great tasting supplement . I ca n't speak for every one of them , but I have the ON Milk Chocolate whey in a two pound canister at home and I have bought the five pound Chocolate Mint flavor off of Amazon here . The milk chocolate is better than average , but the chocolate mint is tasty to the point that I worry about over-indulging in it . I 've been mixing it with two percent milk , and it is a creamy and delicious drink that -- and this is important -- blends nicely even in the milk . TheSundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall , Bluehelps , but I 've even spoon-mixed it at home and it worked well.You can find whey at the five pound size for maybe fifteen bucks less , but this is a good price for a good product , as long as you stay away from GNC . They 'll try to sell you this for retail .
 Have tried both the vanilla ice cream , and the double chocolate and enjoyed both . I would recommend optimum nutrition 's protein powder to anyone looking for a something tasty , lean and cheap .
 I had used this product some number of years ago and started a regimented workout routine after a few years absent from the game ... The new formula looks , mixes , tastes and works exactly like the former . It mixes well with just a spoon , and tastes about as good as products like this come . I use it to supplement a protein laden diet , typically first thing in the morning , pre-workout and later in the evening . It is quickly soluble , so I am likely changing to a casien protein mix or cottage cheese or lean meat before bed because of longer protein provisioning while asleep , but for those who are n't particluar it can be used whenever you need that quick protein ingested . If you can find an equivalent product for a better price let me know !!!
 I grew tired of using Wal-Mart stocked whey protein powders because of the high level of cholesterol and fat in each scoop . So , I decided to give Optimum Nutrition a try a couple of months back based on its reviews and its low cholesterol . I have noticed an improved muscle gain with Optimum over the other brands I had tried , though this could be because I used it more frequently throughout the day since I am not concerned about the cholesterol content . Whether or not I plan on working out that day , I will use a scoop in my bran flakes to get me going with most of my nutrients for the day . With half of my recommended daily protein intake for the day in each scoop , it is actually a very cost effective way to maintain a proper protein intake . So , whether you are a body builder or just conscious of proper nutrition , I highly recommend this product because it is one of the healthiest , pure sources of protein available , and it is very reasonably priced.Thus far , I have purchased the French Vanilla Creme and the Coffee flavors , and I have been very pleased with how much I actually enjoy the flavor of the powder . Let me begin by saying the powder dissolves very easily when mixed with a liquid , so it can be versatile in its use . The French Vanilla Creme is very appealing as a generic flavor that works well with most foods or liquids you would normally add it to . However , the Coffee flavor is more distinct , and does not work with everything the French Vanilla Creme will . I am a coffee lover , so it is n't a problem for me , and I really enjoy the Coffee flavored powder . When ordering it , I had my doubts about its `` coffee '' flavor , suspecting it may be just a powdery and light flavor . But , because it actually has very finely ground coffee in it , the coffee flavor is really strong ! I suggest mixing it with a low-fat milk for something resembling a cappuccino . If you like coffee , get the coffee flavor .
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard is without a doubt the best product on the market for anyone looking for a protein drink that has solid nutrients , is low in sugar/fats/calories , and concentrates on giving the consumer a product that uses the best most expensive whey protein . Optimum Nutrition creates high-end products that prove great results all while managing to provide their products at affordable prices in comparison to the ingredients they use . The 100 % Whey Gold Standard comes in a myriad of delicious flavors ; I highly recommend the chocolate flavors if you plan to simply drink the protein straight . If you are like me and you love to spruce up your protein drink by adding fruit , oatmeal , milk , yogurt , etc. then I recommend the vanilla and fruit flavors . Studies show that whey protein is an extremely important nutrient for muscle recovery and Optimum Nutrition provides a top-notch whey protein drink that is sure to keep you feeling sustained and energized all while doing what whey protein does best , helping the body recover from any workout and building long-lasting lean muscle !
 I have been using this protein powder for more than a year now.This is by far the best of all i have had . It easily dissolves in water and tastes very good . You can mix it with milk or some fruit and blend it to make a complete protein meal . Worth the price ... Go for it ...
 I 've tried various chocolate flavored protein powders , including BSN Syntha-6 , Body Fortress , and Designer Whey ... this one -LRB- Double Rich Chocolate -RRB- is by FAR the best when added to milk . I also like that it has a low amount of fat , low amounts of heavy metals , and a high proportion of protein . I 've never found a protein powder that successfully dissolves in water/milk through stirring -LRB- I always have to shake it in a bottle -RRB- , but I do notice that this one tends to dissolve faster than others.All in all , a great tasting protein powder that does n't make me feel nauseous .
 Love the product . Great protein , low in carbs . The Cookies & Cream flavor could definitely be better but when I make it into a smoothy with milk , a banana , and some ice it becomes much easier to drink . Will buy definitely buy again !
 I signed up for Subscribe & Save , which cuts the price down to only 15 dollars -LRB- for the 2 pound container -RRB- . I also got free overnight shipping - wonderful ! It tastes great . Not to mention that it does n't have ridiculously high levels of arsenic and mercury - or anything detrimental to your health -LRB- unlike some other protein supplements I wo n't name -RRB- . Recommended .
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard for the past year now . I always purchase it from a popular place by my house . The pricing on Amazon is so much better an with prime , product came really fast . This time I ordered the French Vanilla Creme , per other reviewers ratings but have yet to try it as I want to finish the prior one that I have opened . I previously purchased Tropical Punch . If you are not able to mix it with milk -LRB- Atkins so water only -RRB- , it is n't the best choice ; ok and doable but there are much better flavors out there . I hope the reviews of the French Vanilla Creme are correct ; which I am sure they will be . Happy Shakes !
 The powder is easy to mix and tastes great ! Substitutes for a meal if you are trying to lose weight , and can be mixed with water or milk . Comes in many flavors which is nice to give variety . I would recommend this to anyone to give it a try !
 OK , so I carefully instruction on the box . It says mix with water and stir for 20 seconds . I did that . Didnt mix . Then stirred for another 20 seconds . Nothing yet.Finally I blended it and ... . it was perfect . Rich smooth chocolate taste and flavor . I enjoy it after every workout .
 I bought this product on the recurring plan and it came out cheaper that anywhere else . The taste is not rough at all , it goes down like juice . I believe this is the best quality protein out there .
 This stuff really works . It fills you up , satisfies your protein needs , and is some of the most affordable protein on the market . Highly recommend for those wanting to put on lean muscle mass . Its low carbohydrate content makes it harder to gain weight however so not as effective in that regard . Other than that , tastes great and highly recommend !
 I have a chocolate or vanilla ON shake almost daily , usually for breakfast . It has a great calorie profile -LRB- almost all protein -RRB- and tastes good for a protein shake . The vanilla tastes good in milk or juice blended with berries and spinach -LRB- add ice or freeze the berries -RRB- . Then chocolate is great in milk , blended with a banana and spinach -LRB- add ice or freeze the banana -RRB- . I do n't care for the taste in water.The shake goes down easily and is great as a recovery drink too . The price is competitive with other cheaper protein shakes , particularly with subscribe and save .
 Great product , would rate 5 stars if not for sucralose -LRB- artificial sweetener -RRB- I like to avoid all artificial sweeteners , so I will buy the natural one next time.Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey , Natural Chocolate , 5 Pound
 This is a good supplement and has a good taste . I 've gained about 4 pounds in about 4 months , hard work but not unbearable with a good tasting protein powder .
 ON provides great products , and their 100 % Whey is no exception . Low in fat and calories ; high in protein , BCAAs and taste . ON 's 100 % Whey mixes easily with no clumping . This is the only protein for me .
 Ive tried lots of protein but this stuff tastes the best and works the best , theres no substute , this stuff works for whatever your goals are
 I wo n't try to add to the praise this product has already received , except to say I Have tried several others over the years and still end up coming back to what I consider the best . The delivered ` subscription ' pricing makes it even more attractive . Am not using this because I am a Body Builder , but age , diet , and activity level have made a supplement like this very valuable , plus it tastes great . The only other flavor I have used is Vanilla , good , but still come back to this .
 I love this whey protein because it is so easy to mix and it has a light feeling in your mouth . ON is the way to go !
 The best tasting whey protein I 've tried . With milk , it tastes like a chocolate milkshake ; with water , it 's still delicious . Wait for it to go on sale and then stock up .
 I 've been using ON Whey exclusively for a number of years . I absolutely love this stuff and drink a scoop or 2 after every lifting session . As for flavors , Rocky Road is by far my favorite . I can add plenty of water for a bigger drink without worrying about it tasting awful . I tried strawberry , but it tastes too much like pepto for me - and double rich chocolate needs to have the right mixture of powder to water or else it tastes nasty . My buddy has even recently switched from his protein to ON due to better price and positive reviews all over the net and at our local supplement store.This protein tastes good and is very filling . It is smooth , no chalky feeling of after-taste like some other brands . It also mixes very well with water . I used to mix vanilla with orange juice and that worked well too . Mixing with milk produces a very thick drink though , and hard to stomach after lifting -LRB- personally -RRB- .
 I normally do n't like chocolate but based on the reviews for Extreme Milk Chococalte I decided to give it a try . This tastes awesome ! I prefer it over my vanilla now ! Highly recommended !
 I just finished a 90 day fitness challenge and Gold Standard whey protein was a part of every single day . It made a great protein supplement . I enjoyed the taste -LRB- only used the `` double rich chocolate '' -RRB- . For me , the only downside was that it was a little hard to mix . I ended up using it in a smoothie most of the time as it would n't dissolve completely just in a glass of milk . However , this is the first protein supplement I 've used and that might be par for the course with protein . Overall it 's a great product and I will continue to use it now that the fitness challenge is done .
 Heard about this product through StrongLifts.com , and was very satisfied with my purchase . The taste was bearable - unsurprisingly , mixing it with milk instead of water makes for a much more enjoyable beverage . I 've tried other flavors since my first tub , and would definitely recommend the double rich chocolate over anything else .
 Was recommended by a friend and now my turn to recommend it . I really like this product , the chocolate flavor is delicious and the price is right . It is not expensive but that does not mean it is not good . There are other products cheaper but do not recommend them . Not a good taste !! I have used it for several months and these muscles have been growing naturally . I take it with milk , but also I have taken with water or soy milk . Always tastes good!The protein dissolves perfectly smooth.I can tell you that the product is not the best but I give it 4 of 5 stars.There are several flavors to choose which they like Extreme Milk Chocolate , French Vanilla , Double Rich Chocolate , Vanilla Ice Cream , Cookies N ` Cream , Chocolate Mint . I have tried them all and are good and soon find their Favorite . Mine is the Double Rich ChocolateI drink a glass of milk in the morning before going to work and a cup in the afternoon after my workout .
 Great tasting powder if you mix with milk especially vanilla flavored milk . Taste okay mixed with soy and almond milk too . Good price too .
 This is a great product , I am a crossfitter that works out about 5 times a week so I take 4 scoops a day . What I have seen with this product is that I feel solid , so I have gained lean muscle and my recovery time is much faster . I have used the AMP GNC before and it was good as well but this product seems to be the same and cheaper .
 After having used the CVS brand whey flavored cookies and cream , I almost yelled for joy after trying this . The flavor is great !! Does n't have this overly-artificial sweetener taste , mixes easily and it 's actually yummy . And the price ? Beats much of the competition including CVS brand . So glad to have discovered this product . Highly recommend !!
 Easy to mix , tastes fantastic in anything ! Add diet orange soda and it 's like drinking a cream-cicle ! Best tasting powder I have ever had !
 Tastes good enough and dissolves easily . NitroCore24 is also a good choice , though much more expensive , it also tastes even better . I 'd recommend having this 100 % Whey before/after workout and the NitroCore24 before bed and/or in the morning .
 Have tried several different brands of protein powder and did n't like any of them . Read the reviews on this and deceided to try . It is very good . I mix with 1 cup of milk and a couple of ice cubes in a blender . If you like chocolate you will like this .
 Tastes and mixes much better than Jillian Michaels protein powder . Also , about 2/3 of a serving is equivalent to 1 Jillian Michaels serving .
 good price and good taste . Excellent taste , with water , milk or almond milk . Also a good price for high quality protein . I highly recommend it , and it 's the only brand and flavor I buy now
 Not much to say about this whey protein other than it tastes great and mixes easily . I ca n't speak much for the other flavors but this one is n't hard to get down . I only use mixer cups and never have had an issue with getting this to dissolve using one of those cups . I find it hard to want to take a risk and try other brands/flavors when I know this one is as good as it is . If you 're on the fence about this I say pick up the smallest size available and give it a try , at worst you have a small amount of protein to get through . But if you 've tried a bunch of different kinds looking for one that meets your needs , I can promise you that you 've had worse than this one .
 I 've been using ON Gold Whey for over 6 years now and it really is the best protein . Mixes well , tastes great with milk . Price is hard to beat on Amazon too with the subscribe and save feature .
 The Optimum Standard Whey Protein definitely lived up to my expectations for quick whey protein . The taste is great , it actually does taste like French Vanilla Creme when you mix it with skim milk , and mixing it into a smoothie gives a wonderful sweet taste . I make a very simply smoothie from a banana , some vanilla extract , skim milk , and ice , and to me this protein complements it quite well . I will note that when mixing just with milk it clumps a little initially so it 'll take some good shaking to get it well mixed if you 're making the effort yourself . Overall I was n't disappointed with this is protein powder and would recommend it to anyone who likes the vanilla flavor .
 Of all protein supplements this is my favorite . I might experience with different flavors , but two scoops + handful of walnuts + a cup of soy milk is an AMAZING shake . I got great gains from this as well , more so than the cheap stuff I used to buy from department stores .
 Got the Tropical Punch flavor for the first time and to be honest the taste is horrid . It is basically the artificial bubblegum flavoring you find at the dentist when they use fluoride treatment -LRB- the only way I can describe it -RRB- . I doubt whey drink mixes are ever going to taste `` good '' but this is definitely not tropical punch , I was imagining koolaid or something ! . I would suggest sticking with the flavor you like or usually get . Other than that , the powder blends easy with a spoon and works better than other brands in my experience .
 I like the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor , as well as Double Rich Chocolate and Chocolate Mint -LRB- the best one , in my opinion -- really tastes like a treat , even when just mixed with water -RRB- . I have also tried Extreme Milk Chocolate and Cake Batter . Maybe because I 'm a supertaster , but these were so overly sweet and chemical-tasting , I could hardly swallow them.I later examined the ingredients and found that these 2 flavors contain sucralose in them . The 3 I listed above do not . So , by my very scientific study , I have concluded that this sweetener just does n't work for me , which unfortunately means most of the other flavors are also out.Oh well . The top 3 suit me just fine , and I 'm able to enjoy them with water + ice , or just water . -LRB- With milk they are tastier , but since I 'm watching calories , I typically just add H2O . -RRB- I also occasionally add peanut butter to the vanilla and chocolate flavors , and it 's quite yummy !
 Very good protein shake , and I had awesome results.mixes very easily in water or milk.flavors tried : - chocolate coconut / / really tasty . but after 4 pounds of it , I am now disgusted of the flavor . - strawberry banana / / delicious !
 This is my second order of this product . Tastes very good especially when mixed with coffee and a little Hazel Nut or Irish Cream Sweetener -LRB- Torani , sugar free sweetner -RRB- . Both my wife and I are using this product for weight reduction .
 Drink a scoop with water after every workout , makes the workout feel complete . I like how big the bottle is , and it tastes pretty good -LRB- vanilla ice cream -RRB- . I did n't give it a 5 because i have not seen the results , Ive only been taking it for two weeks .
 It has a great french vanilla taste and I enjoy it . I had been using a product that had a orange sherbet taste and tired of it . The french vanilla does n't get old though .
 Great protein , tastes good , and easy to mix . I will buy this again . Delivery was quick and the protein was a good price . ON in my opinion is some of the best out there .
 I spent a little more money on this protein than i had with others , but it was worth it . I am not forcing myself to drink it when i mix with water anymore.To me , it is worth the extra $ 10-15 so i do n't have to drink gross protein every time i am done working out .
 Ok , this stuff is great . Simple , and perfect for the high schooler . The first thing I learned though was that THIS WILL NOT MAKE YOU RIPPED , only HARD WORK can do that , it will only make the proccess quicker and bigger . Great taste , i put in chocolate syrup and it tastes phenomenal . Great all around product , my first whey purchase and i couldnt be happier .
 No reason for me to go into detail as to why nutritionally this is a good protein powder , as others reviewers have much more knowledge and background in this . But as far as taste , it 's amazing ! Nothing artificial tasting about it and not chalky like some others . We use 2 rounded scoops with 8 oz of 1 % milk and blend up with ice . I think it tastes like a Mocha Blast from Baskin Robins , my husband says he thinks it tastes like a Jumpin Java from Juice It Up . Either way , it 's delicious !! Not too sweet either like some other good tasting protein powders . Perfect flavor .
 Mediocre with water , delicious with almond milk , SUPER delicious with almond/coconut milk blend and at least a teaspoon of instant coffee for a blast of caffeine . This is a great post-workout meal when you need the protein but do n't have time for a `` real '' meal . When I ordered it , I had planned on trying other flavors when this is gone , but it is so delicious I do n't want to order something else and be disappointed !
 This review will be on three different flavors . Tropical Punch , Extreme Milk Chocolate , and Vanilla Ice Cream.First , I am not a gym rat or anything like that . Like many people after the new year , I decided I wanted to lose weight , but this time I actually started working out . lol . I know that protein is a great thing to have especially after a workout . I have tried Whey Protein in the past and it always tasted absolutely gross . I was shocked beyond belief when I received my first Whey Protein order of Extreme Milk Chocolate and how good it tasted . That 's when I bought the Vanilla Ice Cream and then the Tropical Punch and I have placed an order for the Mocha Cappuccino . The previous protein powders that I did not like were not Optimum Nutrition if I remember correctly.I titled this Tropical Punch because I had a heck of a time finding reviews on that particular flavor.I make my mixes 8oz plus one scoop of powder . You 'll understand this later . I also use one of those hand shaker blenders -LRB- I think that is right -RRB- . TROPICAL PUNCH - After reading some of the reviews , I opted to try this with Gatorade -LRB- or maybe it was Powerade -RRB- first because many people said that this tasted nasty with milk . I have not tried it with milk and I do n't plan to after trying it with the Gatorade and Powerade -LRB- both were fruit punch and I also tried it with the White Cherry Powerade -RRB- . It tastes pretty good to me , but it does n't taste like tropical punch or at least not any tropical punch I have ever had . I use 4 - 6 oz of either sports drink and the rest water to make 8 oz . Thus far , I have one of these after a cardio workout . I know that these sports drink have a lot of sugar -LRB- 21g per serving -RRB- but that is for a serving size of 12 fl . oz . Basically , 7 - 14g of sugar is a heck of a lot better than downing a 12oz can of soda -LRB- I had a &#34; discussion &#34; with a friend and needed to vent that line . lol -RRB- VANILLA ICE CREAM - This also taste pretty good to me . It taste like it says . I mix this with 4 - 8oz of 2 % milk -LRB- sorry fitness extremist , but skim milk is just not that great tasting to me and yes I have tried it with skim and 1 % -RRB- . Of course , if you use 4 oz of milk then use 4 oz more of water to make the drink.EXTREME CHOCOLATE MILK - I saved the best for last , for the ones I have tried . I love , let me repeat this , love this powder and I never thought that chocolate would be my favorite flavor -LRB- I 'm one of the odd people that prefer vanilla over chocolate -RRB- . If you want to try one Whey Protein to see what it is like , then you have to get this one in a 2lb jug to see if you like it . Since I 'm not the only one using this powder , my first one -LRB- purchased about 3 weeks ago -RRB- is almost gone and I just ordered a 5lb jug of this because it is that awesome . I mix either soymilk -LRB- If you told me ten years ago that I would enjoy a chocolate flavored soymilk , I would have cried laughing over the improbability -RRB- or my 2 % milk 4 - 8oz . When I mix this with the 2 % milk , it tastes almost identical to Barber 's Tru Moo Chocolate Milk . When I mix it with the soymilk , it tastes a bit off from the &#34; Tru Moo &#34; like chocolate milk , but not comparing it to that , it taste really good.I will add more when I get more flavors . I hope this helps people decide on this product .
 Good product ! Come fast to Ogres house ! Build mussels ! Lift more heavy things ! Amazon say Ogre need three more words .
 Optimum whey is simply the best and has worked for me over the years ... but why does the price keep rising EVERY TIME I PURCHASE HERE ?? Used to be $ 35 ... then $ 40ish ... now $ 52.99 ??? for a tub of powder ??
 I love mint flavors , and the chocolate mint is really good ! When I was looking to try flavors I was looking through posts trying to find a comment so I 'm putting one here for chocolate mint .
 I have been experimenting with different whey proteins and this one is definitely a winner . I chose it because it had just enough sugar to make it bearable with just water and a lot of protein and barely any carbs , since I refuse to drink any of my carbs ! I tasted Double Rich Chocolate , Chocolate Malt , and Mocha Cappuccino . The Double rich is NASTY even with milk ! The Chocolate Malt is AMAZING no milk needed its really good with just water . The Mocha Cappuccino is okay , a little to rich with milk ; okay with water ; BEST with a half water/half milk mix .
 This is the type of protein i always use because it is the best one i 've tried . It tastes good , it mixes well , its not too expensive , and it works great ! I 've noticed I get stronger a lot faster when I am consistently using this stuff .
 As far as I know this tastes good to me . It 's my first protein shake so I do n't have any other to compare it to . I mix it with almond milk in my BlenderBottle and it mixes well without many or any clumps . I got it in the Caramel Toffee Fudge .
 I have found this to be the best proteinas it has extra nutrition . I had purchasedthis for my son , however , I started using italso . I am highly lactose intolerant.This is the only brand I have found that I candigest . Of course I did not look further afterfinding this one . This was the best price so it was aterrific buy .
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition 's Whey Protein Powder for a few years now and it is no doubt the best all around protein powder on the market . I workout 6 days a week - weights 4 days , cardio two days and ON Whey is always the first thing I grab post workout . It does a great job helping my muscles to recover and I always feel energized the following day for my workout.Results aside , this stuff just tastes so much better than any other product . I do n't like drinking milk , so I only use water and it is still incredibly tasty . Before finding ON Whey , I tried many competing products and they were simply awful . It felt like a chore to get my necessary protein . However , with ON whey I crave it after my workouts . If you are having trouble finding a good tasting protein , look no further.There 's a reason this is one of the best selling protein supplements ; it gives you the results you 're looking for , it tastes great and it 's a good value .
 I recently started to become `` health conscious '' and a friend recommended this product to me . She actually tried to fool me with the unsweetened version -LRB- seriously -- not sure how she thought she could get away with that given she was dealing with a major junk food eater -RRB- , and when she found out I was putting in Equal to help it taste better , she revealed there was an artificially sweetened version.I love it this product . Sure , it could be a little chocolaty-er -LRB- I 'd like to think me using a little less skim milk helps with getting more of the flavor -RRB- but all in all , with the help of milk & a couple of ice cubes , I 've come to view it as a frozen treat that I really look forward to every day . Like a little chocolate shake . Which is really saying something because I do n't think there 's anything that I love to eat/drink that is healthy for me , other than blueberries ... . but I digress . . this stuff is really good . As good as a Haagen Dazs chocolate milkshake ? Absolutely not . But for someone trying to shift gears , trying to get away from the dark side of foods ... and trying to eat healthier & lose weight , the taste -LRB- and a little bit of mind games -RRB- can fool me into thinking I 'm having a Haagen Dazs shake -LRB- ok , maybe a lot of mind games but still -- I view it as my healthy Haagen Dazs shake -RRB- . Big clue -- the unsweetened version has the word `` natural '' in there . I 've read complaints about this one having artificial sweeteners -- sure , that should be in the description/review of the product so maybe that 's what the complaints are about because if otherwise , the solution is simple -- buy the unsweetened one.As for me , dare I say a former junk food junkie who has a big sweet tooth -- I 'm happy there is something out there that can satisfy my sweet cravings without me having to add anything else -LRB- besides the milk & ice of course -RRB- and without me having to eat anything else .
 As far as protein goes this one in m opinion is the best . No bloated feeling after no having to just swallow it without enjoying it . I mix 1 scoop with no fat milk and a bit of honey . It is great ...
 Decent tasting protein and good price for value of protein . I prefer fruit flavors to the regular chocolate and vanilla shakes and this fits the bill . The best tasting fruit flavor is still 4ever fruit whey isolate , but this is much cheaper . It mixes easily in water or crystal light . Tried it in almond milk and it was not so good . Also it only requires a shaker bottle no blender , big plus for me since I carry it with me to work and the gym .
 I have been using this for about 3 months now and still have not got tired of the flavor . It helps fill the gap for me when I am not getting enough protein due to being too busy to eat right sometimes .
 I buy Vanilla ice cream because it has no sugar or sucralose . Unless you get ON 's `` Natural '' line which has sugar the other flavors are sweetened with sucralose . It has a very natural vanilla flavor . The best of all the proteins I have tried .
 I 'm now over half-way through my 2nd Double Rich Chocolate 5.15 pounder and in a month or so I 'm sure I 'll be on my 3rd . Occasionally I try to research the best protein for a pre or post-workout snack , but my brain usually starts hurting and I have to lay down . The consensus at least seems to be that protein isolates are the most effective form of protein -- and this stuff is mostly just that , with some whey concentrate and whey peptides blended in as well . I figure that covers the bases a bit . And it 's got those amino acids you 're also craving . Whatever . In the last 6 months I 've added ~ 100 lbs to my squats/deadlifts and ~ 50 to my bench . I attribute this mostly to a new 80/20 workout program I 'm trying , but obviously nutrition must be playing some part , and I am gulping down a protein smoothie daily . The same smoothie too . The exact same smoothie for weeks and weeks and weeks . I think that speaks for the taste . This has probably already been posted but my recipe is a banana , 1 protein scoop -LRB- sometimes 2 -RRB- , 1 tbsp of peanut butter , 2 cups of milk , and a splash of coffee -LRB- if its handy -RRB- , blended up with a hand mixer . Every day . It was pretty delicious months ago and it 's only now starting to bore me , so I might move on to Vanilla for my next tub and do the standard strawberry , banana , milk & honey thing . In my opinion , chocolate protein and strawberries do not mix . Oh yeah , this stuff dissolves pretty completely which is nice , although my Kitchen Aid hand mixer is pretty mean . On the rare occasion I 'm spoon-mixing , I get a little bit of the protein globs which feel weird swallowing and cement themselves to the side of your cup . The only real complaint I have about ordering this is trying to find an existing flavor/size combination . Those drop-down selectors include a bunch of imaginary options . Somebody knows what I 'm talking about , right ?
 I ordered this 2lb jar to see if I liked the taste enough to use Amazon 's subscription service for the 5lb product . In a little over a week of changing my dietary habits to multiple small meals -LRB- 5-6 , at least two or more are just a protein shake -RRB- spread out every 3 hours , while exercising daily , I have noticed myself being more energetic , less fatigued in the mornings and a loss of two pounds . Not bad for a weeks work . The best thing is , is that I 'm not hungry most of the day . Keeping your meals spread out to a 3hr max keeps your metabolism working continuously and keeps you feeling satisfied all day.But about the product , Its mixability is superb , its taste is subtle enough to mix with water or milk without it being too sweet . In water it taste like Mexican Horchata , in Vanilla soy milk it taste like a true vanilla shake . Whey contains the best protein for your body , meaning your body absorbs it and utilizes it more so than other types of protein -LRB- ie . soy -RRB- . For weight loss and muscle gain , this is a no brainer since about a third of your daily calories should come from protein .
 Purchased the double choco variety and thought it was great . Dissolved the best of any whey protein we 've tried so far , and it tasted good too .
 The reviews for this protein powder were so overwhelmingly positive that I went out on a limb and ordered two 2-pound containers -LRB- Chocolate Mint and Vanilla Ice Cream -RRB- . I was nervous that they would be gross because that 's what usually happens when I try protein shakes people have recommended but they are actually as good as everyone says . Do n't get me wrong , you are not going to confuse this for a Wendy 's Frosty ... but you might ALMOST confuse it . I had the chocolate mint today just mixed with cold water and it was even good without milk!One thing
 I am very satisfied with my purchase . ON 's 100 % Whey Gold Standard has worked great and is extremely efficient . The item is exactly as described . Thank You
 We use this product in a smoothie type shake each morning -- mixing with cow or goat or almond or rice or . Adding cinnamon and ground flax seed add to it . We can have a glass of this and that is it until lunch .
 Been usuin this for years . This helps feed your muscles after working out . Speeds up recovery . Recommend this for all who want to see growth .
 I have been using Gold Standard Whey for awhile now and the product in general is superior to anything else that I have ever used . However , this particular flavor hits it out of the ballpark . If you like , or love , chocolate then you will love this flavor . It is now my favorite and I will be buying over and over again . You will love it !
 This is the best whey protein you can get . Do n't take it from me though , just look at any fitness website and you 'll see it in the # 1 spot . AND amazon has the best price on it with free shipping ! Amazon is the greatest !!
 this i by far the best protein powder I 've ever tried . i have gone through countless tubs of powder to help my `` lean mass '' look , but no other protein powder has made as much of a difference as gold standard . it only has 24g which is perfect ! do n't be fooled by other protein powders claiming 50g because anymore then 25 and you will just shit it out . Like most protein you wo n't see an immediate change , but it will bring consistent results and make you feel great ! tastes amazing too !!
 I buy Optimum Gold Standard for my whey protein all the time . There are n't very many whey proteins that are better . A good place to check for ratings is bodybuilding.com they constantly have tests , ratings and reviews from serious body builders and people who train hard . Price is the selling point on this though . Just four years ago you could ge the ten pound bag for under $ 75 on Bodybuilding.com . It is at or above $ 100 on all sites now . The positive of getting it on Amazon though is the free shipping which will cost you at least $ 15 on BB.com . So I buy it through Amazon now as well .
 I have tried all kinds of protein powders and this is hands down the best tasting . It is reasonably priced , comes in a wide variety of flavors and mixes well . From what I have read Optimum Nutrition is considered to be one of the better proteins.All the flavors I have tried , except Vanilla Ice Cream , are full of flavor .
 ON is always the brand to beat in whey protein . It has the best performance , tasting , and amount of protein in each serving.Since ON has introduced 2 more options in this category , I 'll add in my comparisons . The cheaper alternative being Performance Whey , the standard being 100 % Whey Gold Standard , and Platinum Hydro Whey.Performance Whey does it 's job . It does deliver a good amount of protein per serving . However I notice that it does perform differently . It feels like I 'm absorbing weak ingredients and much more slowly . It definitely tastes sweeter than the other two . If you want cheap powder , I would still recommend this over any other brand . Also by far it is much better than any generic GNC or Vitamin Shoppe Whey . However , for that money I would invest in 2 boxes of protein bars .100 % Whey Gold Standard is the most reliable for me . If you can afford to buy performance whey , I suggest paying a little more for this . Compared to the others , Gold Standard Whey is more versatile . Since it is somewhat fast absorbing , but not too fast , I can drink it anytime during the day . This one I 've used it to get `` cut '' and also to gain mass -LRB- with added ingredients of course.I must say the Platinum Hydro Whey is my favorite . It is much finer and absorbs much quicker than the rest . It is the best IMO for post workout only . I see most results for 2 months of Hydro Whey .
 Other than a protein bar , this is the first protein product I have used . It really has helped my recovery and overall feeling from a hard work out . I will rebuy this when I run low .
 I was n't sure what to expect - I 've never taken whey before , but from everything I 've heard about it , I expected to be underwhelmed by the taste . My `` trainer '' warned me that any decent whey would `` taste like crap . '' I ca n't wait to hear his reaction to it.Well , this does NOT taste like crap -LRB- not that I actually know what it tastes like , of course -RRB- . It tastes great - I mixed it in skim milk with a vintage Tupperware shaker , and it was a lot like how I remember Nestle Quick tasting . I can completely understand how that one reviewer manages to get his kids to eat it as `` chocolate milk . `` I did n't even notice a weird artificial sweetener aftertaste , which is usually an issue for me.So this choice was a win , win win , as far as my tastebuds and lean muscle mass are concerned .
 This is very good for just a whey protein mix . It is low in fat and carbs , so there is no way it 's going to taste like Muscle Milk or anything , but this is lightyears ahead of other low carb , low fat whey mixes I 've had . It mixed VERY well , and it actually tastes pretty good , downright tasty when mixed in milk ! It even includes a healthy dose of glutamine , aminos , and other complexes . And with Subscribe and Save and Super Saver shipping , I really could n't be happier ! I 've heard good things about the vanilla flavor too , I 'll have to give that a shot next ...
 The double rich chocolates flavor tastes and mixes much better then GNC 's chocolate flavored protein . It also contains a mix of whey proteins -LRB- Isolate , Whey Concentrate , and Peptides -RRB- which is good . The only bad things I noticed is that is does not have all the vitamins and minerals that GNC 's whey protein has and that it contains artificial sweeteners .
 I 've used EAS 100 % whey protein for years and it 's been a great product , but I decided to give Gold Standard a try since the reviews on amazon were so high . I got it about a month ago and am very pleased with the quality of the powder . It tastes and mixes better than EAS 100 % Whey . It 's not near as thick and mixes pretty easily -LRB- couple minutes -RRB- in water . Tastes pretty good with vanilla soy milk too . Great product .
 Undisputedly best Whey Protein in the market . I tried the double choclate flavor . Its very good . i didnt changed any flavors , i was addicted to it . i might change the flavor in future.Have a Rich Protein Shake after your workout as below . . Very Delicious and Nutritious !! 1-11/2 scoops of ON 100 % whey1 full banana5gms of Dextrose or sugar -LRB- use dextrose for spike and fast absorbance to muscles -RRB- Blend it . . Its really very delicious and nutritious post workout shake.Taste - 9Mixability-8Efficiency-9Price - 9Value-9Pros - Its taste , value , results , mixability and price.Cons - it smells a lill uncomfortable if you uses just with waterStack it with ON 100 % Casein -LRB- slow releasing or bed time protein -RRB- if you are looking for serious gains or into a body building.Go For it !! U will Never Regret :--RRB- !!
 After trying the Nitro-Tech Hardcore , I am really glad that I found this product . It seems to have the same effect , but is by far richer in flavour and cheaper in price . Even my girlfriend , who did n't like Nitro-Teck at all , now takes a shake from time to time after her workout .
 Optimum has achieved a great tasting protein shake with probably the best ratios , excellent amount of proteins and low in carbs and calories . As a bodybuilder and nutritionist expert i recomend optimum whey protein .
 I got it for $ 97 . It 's great value for money compared to other brands & vendors . Taste is alright - I used to have some extremely overpriced GNC vanilla whey that tasted incredible so it 's hard to compare the two . Taste is similar to chocolate milk .
 I did n't think it was possible to make whey protein taste this good , period , even when mixed in water with a spoon . I 'm throwing away any other I have , nothing else I 've ever had compares .
 The best bang for your buck protein out there ... great taste , always consistent , no matter if you are cutting or bulking ... ON is the choice for all !!!
 Years ago , I did a fairly extensive `` taste test '' of all of the major protein powders on the market . Every single one disappointed me
 I 've tried a number of Whey Protein and this could be my new Go-to protein . The Strawberry is so good . I mix it with water to keep calories/fat down and it tastes great . 24g of protein is a good amount . I was n't looking for much more . Great product .
 good value for rhe price and mixes well . the taste is good to me , however , taste is up to the individual .
 The product mixes well with a small amount of milk . It taste great and has worked well as a meal replacement . After I drimk it I stay full for a while and it does not make me feel bloated like some products . Will buy again !
 I use this product every day . It allows weight loss without hunger . Try it for yourself . Delicious too , if you like chocolate .
 I purchased this product after reading many reviews and deciding that ON was the best way to go . This is now the second time I have purchased from Optimum Nutrition and so far all has worked very well . I use the product to help me rebuild muscle after fatigue from exercising . It also works good to hold you over if you do n't have time to eat a meal right away , it will keep me full for around 2 hours .
 ON Whey is great ! If you do a little research you will find that it is one of the best Whey proteins you can buy . I bought vanilla ice cream , and to be honest i 'm not entirely sure what it tastes like plain because I bought it specifically to blend in with fruit for a fresh post-work out drink -LRB- much better than those syrupy emerald city shakes they sling at my gym -RRB- . Throw in some milk , a scoop or 2 of this protein , half a banana , frozen berries , strawberries , and/or some high pulp OJ and you are golden !
 All-around a solid product . Gets me the protein I need at a decent price and a good taste . The banana cream gets old fast though , but that 's my fault for picking it !
 I bought the cake batter flavor . Its pretty good , but if your expecting it to taste amazing your wrong . It has a protein grainy taste like all others ive tried . But it mixes better than most other brands and is pretty low priced
 The Double Rich Chocolate has been the best flavor of any Whey Protein I have tried , especially in milk ! Highly recommend .
 This protein powder is actually great ! I was a little skeptical because it has been so chemically altered , but I have not noticed any bad side-effects from it . A few precautions though : Your liver is stressed out by high protein intake since it has to break it down and send it to your muscles . Drinking 10 glasses of water a day will help keep your kidneys happy and balanced . Eating something like oatmeal will ensure that your GI tract gets scrubbed clean with fiber , since high-protein diets tend to lack significant amounts of fiber . If you use plain oatmeal and add raisins and honey , instead of buying pre-packaged stuff with tons of added sugar , this should n't be a big deal for your diet plan.With that in mind , protein intake is key to any plan to build muscle . In fact , working out without consuming lots of protein immediately before or afterwards is almost a lot cause , since you are breaking your muscles down without rebuilding them . At $ 20 for five pounds , this stuff gives you all the protein -LRB- 24 grams a serving ! -RRB- you need for your money.p.s . the taste of the double rich chocolate is totally good , even when mixed with just water . It 's not the greatest taste ever , but it just tastes like water-down chocolate milk , nothing too bad .
 I go to the gym religiously for about 5 times a weeks and I drink this stuff like water . My muscle restores pretty quickly and this proten shake does not give me the gassy feeling other protein shakes give me . I have high energy level during workouts and I do n't feel so sore . I like that it is low sodium so i dont have to worry about high blood pressure . I am not picky with food so this shake taste pretty good to me . definitely recommend it .
 This is n't the best tasting protein that I have ever drank but it is very good . The calories are very low compared to some other brands . 280 calories for 48 grams of whey protein blend .
 Before i discovered Optimum Nutrition , i hated protein drinks . They always seemed to taste nasty , clump up , and would trigger my gag reflex . Well i got ta give it to these guys , their protein tastes just like chocolate milk . I take it every day and this is the only protein i will buy from now on .
 While the product mixed very well and tasted fine with milk or water , it was VERY SWEET to my taste . I did not expect it to be sweetened since , silly me , I only checked the label for sugar content and did n't think to check for artificial sweeteners.I bought the vanilla flavor so it would go with smoothies . It also makes a kick-ass iced latte -- out of coffee or tea . Brew it hot with twice as much coffee/tea leaves , pour over ice , swirl it around to make it cold , and then take out the ice cubes before you add the whey product or else it will clump all over the ice.Overall this is a good product , but I would prefer an UNSWEETENED variety . Maybe that would taste like crap , but I would rather add honey , maple syrup , or Stevia to something if I want it sweet . I will try the `` Natural '' version of Optimum Nutrition 's whey protein when I am out of this one .
 I 've tried a few different kinds of protein , and this is my new favorite . Most importantly to me , it 's more easily digestible than some of the cheaper protein powders out there . The double rich chocolate is also quite delicious . And to top it all off , Optimum Nutrition is n't too expensive for the amateur weight lifter . Give it a try !
 I have tried Syntha-6 , Muscle Milk , Muscle Tech , and a couple of other protein drinks . My favorite is ON 's Rocky Road . It tastes amazing . I can gulp it down it tastes so good . Tastes like hot cocoa ... that is cold .
 I bought this before and really loved it ! It has a great taste that is n't too strong and washes out easily with water . I think it 's great for those who casually work out and want to get a little bigger without having to spend tons of money .
 I ca n't say much in regards to the quality of the product as I have no way to test that . But I can say I feel better when I drink a glass in the morning , and the Banana Creme is the best tasting one I have ever had . It 's actually quite sweet , and is not at all gritty.Pro 's : Many Flavor choicesGreat Flavor -LRB- at least the banana creme -RRB- Actually a very sweet flavorNot at all gritty like many of the othersInstantly mixesIt 's a drink , not a thick shakeCon 's : Price , while not outrageous for the quality , it 's still on the high sideIf you are looking for a protein drink , then I would recommend giving this one a shot . Start with the smaller size at only $ 25 that will give you a good idea what you are getting and allow you to try several flavors . I hear some of the flavors are hit and miss , but the banana creme is great if you enjoy those flavors .
 The strawberry flavour is delicious , like strawberry ice cream . No detectable sweetener aftertaste . Mixes really great even when I 'm lazy and just give it a few shakes in a normal cup -LRB- not the awesome BlenderBottle -RRB- .
 I have consistenly been working out for the last three years and have tried just about every store bought whey protein , mass gainer , creatine and other suppliments out there . I 've used this for the last 4 months and I think I found my new favorite suppliment . I use alittle more than the average serving , but mix it in 24ounces of milk with a bananna and a few other vitamins . I have n't changed up my workout schedule , but I notice a considerable gain ... and its not just waterweight like creatine or other suppliments I have used . HIHGLY Recommend
 I Bought Double Rich Chocolate . I have had Strawberry and Chocolate Mint as well and they are also very good . Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite out of the 3 flavors I 've had . This protein is great in that it 's low in fat and carbs . My trainer has me buy this brand .
 I like the relatively low-carbohydrate profile of this powder compared to some others . I also like that , according to Consumer Reports , it contains lower levels of heavy metals than comparable whey powders.However , it has an annoyingly artificial taste , probably due to the artificial sweeteners and possibly partly due to the artificial vanilla flavor.I thought about switching to Optimum Nutrition 's `` Natural '' whey powder , which does n't use artificial sweeteners , but I did n't like that the Natural version contains more carbohydrate -LRB- and sugar -RRB- per serving than this one.The best alternative I 've found is Whole Foods ' store-brand whey protein powder . Like the Optimum Nutrition powder , it 's relatively low-carb , but it achieves this by using stevia extract as a -LRB- zero-calorie , natural -RRB- sweetener as opposed to Optimum Nutrition 's sucralose and acesulfame K. Due to that and , I suppose , its use of natural vanilla flavor , the Whole Foods whey powder does n't have the artificial taste that the Optimum Nutrition powder has .
 Most people here highlight all the important stuff . I just wanted to add a few of my own comments that would be beneficial to others in my situation .1 -RRB- Double Chocolate is good . If you like the flavor of coffee -LRB- like the sugary cappuccino coffee @ gas stations -RRB- , coffee is way better . You can mix it with water , and it tastes just as good as if you use soy .2 -RRB- I use this one to two times a day with p90x , and have seen great results . I 'm on my second round of p90x , and would recommend this stuff to anyone . To clarify what I mean by results , all the major muscle groups have gotten larger -LRB- especially chest and legs -RRB- , and yet I 've still lost around 15 pounds . I credit the results to hard work , and p90x , but this protein is my breakfast each day .3 -RRB- I workout every morning at 5am , then go work construction for 10 hours . Thus , I combine this with accelerade -LRB- also available on amazon -RRB- and feel pretty good throughout the day .
 This has a good taste . If you are going to mix with a spoon , it is much easier in water ... although the taste is obviously watered down . Tastes better in milk , in my opinion , but it is also tougher to get the powder to completely dissolve when mixing by spoon . Of course if you 're using a blender , you will not get any lumps no matter what you mix the powder in . I typically have a scoop before lifting in the morning . For breakfast afterwards , I 've found that it tastes great mixed in with oatmeal , fruit , and nuts -LRB- the chocolate coloring of the powder makes this look like gruel , so if you like your food to be aesthetically pleasing , maybe this is not a good change of pace for you -RRB- . I 've used this product for several years now to supplement my diet because I 've always felt that it is relatively cheaper than other protein powders but without sacrificing too much in quality . I 've consistently bought the chocolate flavor because it is typically the cheapest , for whatever reason . Occasionally I will buy a 1 or 2 pound bag of a different flavor just to keep my tastebuds interested .
 I 'm finishing up my first 5lb tub . Getting ready to order my next tub . I only take it after I work out , so I 'm definitely not hard core with it.The issue I was hoping it would solve was that as I 'm approaching 40 , it seemed that my recovery time was getting worse and worse . I especially found that as I lifted legs hard , they would just get more and more sore . Sometimes being sore for 4 days after I 'd lift . And I try to lift legs 2x a week which was getting more and more difficult.Since taking this I 've found I am not nearly as sore as I was before . I 've also noticed myself going up weight much quicker . I 'm also putting on a bit of muscle -LRB- which I do n't really want although I look better -RRB- , but I 'm willing to deal with it for the improved recovery.I 've always drank 2 16oz glasses of skim milk every day . Now I just take one of those glasses of milk with the Double Rich Chocolate after I work out . I honestly think it tastes better than most chocolate milks . I do n't understand how anyone could complain if they mix it with skim milk . However , I 've never tried it with just water.I could not recommend it more if you are like me and maybe not recovering like you did in your 20 's and early 30 's .
 I bought this for a friend of mine , but I have used the 5.15 lb version of the Gold Standard Whey Protein powder . After using it after a few months , I have to say it does really well to increase muscle mass and decrease fat . However , I heard that this helps with lean muscle , and I have come to basically a dead-end where I 'm not noticing as big of an improvement while not noticing that much more muscle , which is the reason why I gave this 4/5 stars.As an FYI , the package advises eating a gram of protein per pound you weigh everyday . According to the instructions and my friends , that 's the only way to notice big improvements . I should note that I did n't follow this rule all the time , which may have limited my ability to lift more .
 For all you buff , rough , and tuff athletes out there , this is an excellent source of protein to get you boosted up for your game ! Need a little extra edge ? This protein supplement comes in double rich chocolate , chocolate mint , pina colada , strawberry and vanilla so your taste buds will be singing just like your results ! I know , I use this stuff and I think it 's really improved my endurance for both my tennis game and my three times a week five mile jogs .
 I am a 19 year old college student that was looking for help lifting weights . I have a skinny frame , 6 ' 1 '' 165 pounds . My friend and lifting partner has been using whey protein for some time and I decided to buy some for myself . The fitness center at my college only sells ON -LRB- Optimum Nutrition -RRB- 100 % Gold Standard Whey Protein . I decided to buy some French Vanilla flavored whey just expecting it to be average tasting . It actually mixes in with milk very well and tastes like a milkshake . I started to notice gains in strength and definition within a couple weeks . ON is a fairly priced protein , but I would not suggest taking the two to three scoops per serving that they suggest . Your body can only take in about one and a half scoops , the rest just runs through your digestive system . I would recommend this protein to anybody that is lifting weights . It is safe , relatively cheap , and works very well . Good bang for the buck !
 As others have said , this is n't necessarily the best stuff on the market . However I 've yet to find something better on paper for value , at least something that is n't heavily reliant on soy . It 's high density of protein -LRB- 24 grams per protein per roughly 30 gram serving -RRB- , high levels of essential BCAA , mixes well -LRB- I prefer with a shaker but have done it with a spoon -RRB- , and goes down and digests nicely . It does have artificial sweeteners , but I 'm alright with such things in moderation -LRB- but beware if that concerns you -RRB- . I 've had Natural Chocolate -LRB- another product on Amazon -RRB- , Double Rich Chocolate , Cookies and Cream , Vanilla , and Strawberry . The Chocolate flavors , Strawberry , and Vanilla are fantastic . I got Cookies and Cream recently to change things up and honestly , it 's too sweet for me . It goes down nicely enough but I do n't enjoy it nearly as much as some other flavors I 've tried .
 This is the best protein on the market . Tastes great mixed in water or milk . It may be more expensive than other brands , but it is worth it . I lift weights 4-6 times per week and this protein has helped me reach my goals faster than compared to other proteins I have used , and I have tried them all .
 I 've been using optimum nutrition gold standard double chocolate flavor for 4 years and simply put , it is great for me . I 'm a 180 lb guy who works out a 4-6 times per week . I usually make a shake for breakfast with chocolate soy milk but have drank this brand with water and it dissolves well and does n't have the terrible protein bitter after taste . I actually look forward to my morning shake because it 's essentially a chocolate milk shake after adding some ice cubes.If you 're an intense body-builder/sculptor there are leaner and more effective protein supplements available but for the work out to be active/look good/be healthy set who are n't as concerned with body fat % this stuff tastes amazing , is a great cost -LRB- $ 0.40 -RRB- per serving , and gives you plenty of protein .
 I got the 2 pound chocolate malt flavor from my gyms nutrition shop about 2 months ago , and this stuff is great . It was pretty expensive there , but I 'm so glad I found this on amazon for about half the price ! The chocolate malt flavor was n't that good , and at first I did n't like it that much , but I 'm used to it now . I see that a lot of people recommend the double chocolate flavor , so I 'm just about to order the 5 pound double chocolate and see how it is .
 I 've tried my fair share of protein powders and have to say this is one of the best.The POSITIVE : Good Taste - The Double Chocolate tastes more like rich chocolate milk then the generic brands.Mixes Well - This is a big one for me ... I hate when there 's chunks no matter how well you try to mix it . This Gold Standard Whey protein seems to mix well , especially if you blend it.Cost - The price is n't too bad especially if you buy the 5 pound container . It 's not as cheap as you 'd find some generic brands , but there 's a reason it 's cheaper.The NEGATIVE : Nothing I can really think of ... I 'm strictly speaking about the Double Chocolate flavor though.OVERALL : It 's a great protein powder . I definitely recommend it to everyone .
 I bought this protein power because chocolate and mint is always a winning combination and this powder lived up to that expectation . I wanted something that I could easily throw together in the morning since I rarely have time to make myself a filling breakfast . I ended up also purchasing a blender bottle which worked perfectly with this.At first I mixed the shake with only milk which was very filling as I usually make between 24-28 oz -LRB- to last me until lunch -RRB- . Since I was going through milk very quickly because of this I started mixing half milk/water and eventually only water . Even when only mixed with water this flavor was still really good and I could finish an entire 28 oz shake easily.Overall this flavor is very good since it can be mixed with either water or milk and still be tasty while also filling you up .
 GOLD STANDARD is a proven product . Ive never been a fan of Protein Shakes because of the taste/after taste but GOLD STANDARD have changed all of that . This particular flavor is hands DOWN the best . Its rich and creamy . It taste so good I almost feel guilty drinking it lol
 the best supplement on the market for protein , &#34; taste great , more muscle &#34; . love this whey protein brand . gym rat must have .
 This stuff is just like any other protein powder I 've had . The flavor selection is great compared to other brands and they do n't taste terrible . I 've had the chocolate mint and the strawberry banana and they 're both good when mixed with rice or soy milk . My boyfriend and I buy the 5lb size and it lasts a very long time between the two of us .
 This product is considered one of the best ... it is ! It mixes well with water or other liquids . It has excellent flavor .
 this stuff works great , Ive been drinking anywhere from 2-3 shakes a day for a month now and still have a ton left . You CAN NOT deny the value of this product . . at GNC the same amount of this stuff is almost $ 100 not kidding you , thank you Amazon !
 So far I 've tried the chocolate malt , delicious strawberry , and now the vanilla icecream . The chocolate malt is my favorite so far , but the vanilla icecream is a very close second . The strawberry was n't bad either . Optimum Nutrition in my opinion is the best there is . I crave this after every workout . It is n't something I have to force myself to drink . It dissolves well in milk , but you will have to stir it for a while as well as a couple of times while you drink it .
 I tried protein shakes from a few different companies and this is by far the best tasting . None of that typical protein smell/flavor . This taste is mild chocolate with backings of coffee , since I am not a big chocolate fan I like that the chocolate is not very strong . Its a great way to start my day and keep me full for a while .
 THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT AT A GREAT PRICE , ONLY ONE PROBLEM ITS TO THICK . YOU HAVE TO USE THE BLENDER IN ORDER TO DRINK IT OR ELSE YOU END UP WITH CHUNKS AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR CUP . OTHER THEN THAT I RECOMMEND IT .
 I heard about Whey Protein when I started working out at the gym . I could definitely feel the improvement and energy after using this product for a week . The price on amazon was perfect , as it was a lot cheaper than the one in stores and on other websites . I would recommend the `` Chocolate Malt '' flavor . It tastes awesome .
 There is n't much to say here that has n't already been said . This is a great powder . It mixes very easily . I regularly take three different types of powder and this is the only one I do n't need a blender for . It goes down smooth . It tastes great . I buy the Chocolate and mix it with skim milk , but water is okay too .
 The seller delivery like what they said , very on time and the item was packed very good . But not too much sure about how good the product is ... so far I have used for a couple of weeks ... but seeem not working to me .
 The product came very quickly , about 3-4 days , and did n't have any problems . As for the protein itself , it definitely has a rich , pure chocolate taste . In water , it 's not very sweet , but still has a rich chocolate taste . In milk , it 's a little sweeter/tastes better , but still has a strong chocolate taste . I guess rich chocolate just is n't a flavor that 's for me , but it 's not so bad that I do n't want to drink the shakes . Also , the powder mixes ok with a spoon - there 's usually a few small clumps of protein left . However , if you blend it , no clumps .
 This is definately the best whey protein i have ever used . First time using the strawberry flavour and to my surprise it tastes gr8 .5 stars !!
 Does what it says . Tastes like chocolate , provides protein . I highly recommend using milk over water .
 I have been using this brand and flavor for a while now . I made the mistake the last time I ran out of ordering `` Natural Strawberry '' , and that was the worst tasting powder I have ever had . I bought a 5lb version and after one shake I could n't take it and threw it away . I went back and ordered the delicious strawberry and this is so much better ! This is an excellent product and tastes great . It fills me up so that I do n't eat too much throughout the day .
 very tasty . Had to stir it in with milk slowly in order to avoid clumping .
 I usually hate protein shakes , protein bars , meal replacement bars , etc. . You name it , I think they pretty much all taste disgusting.Well I ca n't say that anymore . Optimum Nutrition Gold in French Vanilla Creme tastes GREAT , especially when you use milk instead of water -LRB- I 'm trying to gain weight , so I can get away with that -RRB- . It tastes good enough to be a shake on its own , which means I 'm more likely to actually stick with it through out my weight training . Could the rest of Optimum Nutrition 's supplements possibly taste this good ?
 Taste
 estoy muy contento con la rapidez con que fue enviado el producto , solo tardo 2 dias en llegar a miammi - mas tardo quien me lo trajo el pais .
 tastes great . I 'm currently drinking 2-3 shakes per day and this stuff tastes great . The only downside is with this much protein , my farts can peel paint . But I think that would happen for any brand protein shake .
 This flavor was n't the best . Good mixability however . The best I 've tried . Price is worth it . I highly recommend it .
 whey is way good -LRB- haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha -RRB- and exactly as advertised .
 I do n't know how to test this product . I buyed because somebody recommended it . I drink it just after exercise . My only complaint is about flavor . It feels artificial . I gave 4 stars in name of the recognition it has but I didnt feel an specific effect in my body .
 I began to weight lift with a friend not too long ago simply to bulk up . I searched online , all of them will surely mention Optimum Nutrition Whey on their top choices . Considering the price is only about $ 5 more than other brands , I decided to give it a shot.I picked the coffee taste since it is an easier flavor to be blended into milk , soy milk or even water . With a mixer cup and some vigorous shaking , the powder dissolves quite well . To me , the taste is better than the usual chocolate or strawberry flabors.I managed to gain 5 pounds in the first 2 weeks of lifting -LRB- 3 days per week , about one hour each session -RRB- . However , that 's just me , YMMV .
 Use : Daily Supplement , Occasional Meal Replacement , weekend athelete.Pros : TasteDigestibility -LRB- as someone prone to gas , this is important -RRB- ValueQualityMixes wellCons : I ca n't possibly store all the flavors!Overall : I have used this powder for a long time and love it . Does n't get my as gassy as many of the other popular powders I have tried . Mixes well and works well in recipes -LRB- Pancakes , baked goods , shakes -RRB- . My girlfriend is picky about drinks and she loves as well .
 ON 's 100 % whey gold standard is the best of the best , bar none . it is made with primarily whey protein isolates and very little whey concentrates . for the layman , that means a lot more of the protein is actually getting absorbed into your body and less being stored as fat or being excreted , much like comparing ground beef in a Taco Bell burrito to a big hunk of steak . It 's just better -LRB- although i sure do like taco bell , but we are getting off topic :--RRB- -RRB- . In short , the higher quality the protein , the better your gains will be.If you are someone who is just trying to maintain their body type without working out , this protein is not for you . let me re-emphasize : DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU DO N'T WORK OUT!why do I say this , you ask ? whey is a fast-digesting protein , and your body wo n't be absorbing much of it if you do n't take it after a workout . try something that digests slower in the body , like egg or casein.however , if you do work out , this is the best money can buy . it offers among the highest protein per gram ratio of any protein supplement out there , and has a lot of servings . the artificial sweeteners is a turn off for some people . be warned . if you do n't care -LRB- like me -RRB- the taste is great ! I 've tried the vanilla ice cream , and it actually tastes like vanilla ice cream ! fancy that . also the strawberry tastes good too , which oddly tastes a bit like real strawberries -LRB- ie
 Just like Optimum Nutritions 5LB tub this 10.5 lb bag is great ... The strawberry flavor is so good I feel like I am cheating by drinking a strawberry milk shake . I highly recommend this product .
 The whey protein is nothing more than a rich protein source that disolves very fast in blood with less carbohydrate.Taste : Very delicious try -LRB- getting chocolate mint also -RRB- Effect
 ON/OPTIMUM has done it again . They have managed to keep producing an outstanding Whey Protein . If you think it could n't get any better then get your hands on some of their new stock -LRB- just look for the new label -RRB- . I found that the whey grains are finer , its mixes better and it tastes even better . Plus they decided to give samples sachets of their new release products , like Vassive in some containers.The new look label is very neo . I really like how it looks . They have really boosted the whole deal considerably.Switch any bodybuilder 's Whey Protein drink with some Optimum 100 % Whey Protein and watch as he wants to put a barbell through your head for giving him a McDonald 's shake . Once you have convinced him that it is indeed a Whey Protein supplement he will want to see the list of ingredients with the important protein to carbohydrates to fat ratios that will prove its fatty content ... only to discover that Optimum 100 % Whey Protein just beats all other Whey Protein into submission with its astonishing lack of fats and higher protein content . So automatically the bodybuilder assumes that the stuff is probably twice the price of other Whey Protein supplements with half the amount until you whip out the bottle that is twice the size of other Whey Protein supplements for the same price.The end result is simply - every single bodybuilder is switching to Optimum 100 % Whey Protein . The only downside is finding out that it is not available and having to pay up for a Whey Protein supplement that gives you less and does not taste as good . Once you are supplementing with Optimum 100 % Whey Protein it is difficult to swallow another brand . This stuff has revolutionized bodybuilding supplementation.Calories 130Calories From Fat 15Total Fat 1.5 g 2 % * Saturated Fat 1g 5 % * Cholesterol 30mg 10 % * Sodium 60mg 3 % * Total Carbohydrate 4g 1 % * Sugars 1gProtein 24g 48 % * As an added note
 Because you have one friend that uses this product and has n't seen results that means it does n't work ? Try using your brain before posting another review . Your friend 's lack of progress is not an indication of this products ability to perform its purpose . Whey Protein is not a magic shake that is going to give you muscle . You need a good diet and equally good training in the gym in order to see results . The purpose of protein is to fuel the rebuiling of the muscle tissue you break down in the gym . Since most protein consumption takes time , and is inconvenient directly after a workout , whey protein is ideal . It mixes fast , requires no preparation , and whey is digested faster than any other type of protein.That being said , Optimum Nutrition produces the highest quality whey protein . It mixes well , and tastes great . 24g per scoop is a perfect amount as well . I take one in the morning and two postworkout ... among other things .
 I love this protein . compared to others it 's the best tasteing , mixes well with milk and water -LRB- trust me use milk -RRB- and I 've gotten better results than with any other brands It has 23grams of Whey per serving -LRB- if I remeber correctly -RRB- , and these are quality Whey Protein and amino acids . I 've been lifting and taking protein for well over a year and have tried many brands but got hooked on this one pretty quick . It 's got a decent price compared to most other high end proteins.I like the Choc , never tried the other flavors .
 24g of protein per scoop and thats not counting the milk . I had it for over 2 months and I have n't gotten tired of the taste ; in fact , its pretty damn good . There 's no need to add anything to it to make it taste tolerable , it really does taste great . I use vanilla soy milk and a couple of ice cubes and mix it with a blender . Perfect every time .
 What more could you ask for ? It tastes great -LRB- I got the double rich chocolate flavor -RRB- , mixes easily and is loaded in protein . Low sugar/calories/etc . The taste is n't so great mixed with water , so I usually mix it with 6oz . of 1 % milk . You can use a shaker or just a spoon.Protein is something a lot of people do n't think about while dieting and this is a tasty way to remember it . =-RRB- If you do n't want to lose your muscle mass along with that fat I 'd certainly recommend a protein supplement and this is hard to beat .
 The whey protein mixes easily in water . I earlier used to use a shaker but now mix with a spoon as its much more hassle free . The strawberry flavor tastes good . I take it regularly -LRB- 3 times a day -RRB- and along with regular workout , I am seeing positive results in terms of building muscle .
 This product tastes great and mixes well . Only problem I have with it is it 's lack of vitamins and minerals and it has too many artificial sweetners ... something I try to avoid .
 Dr. Opps ' Muscle Milk2 scoops vanilla ice cream flavor On Whey2 cups soy milk1 tablespoon peanut butter1 teaspoon honey1 tablespoon creatine powder1 bananabunch of ice cubes.this is the stuff to get jacked on after a workout .
 i think i 've found the winning formula , the double rich chocolate flavor blended into a shake with chocolate soy milk . there are some repulsive soy milks out there , but try it with 8th Continent brand chocolate soy milk ; extremely low fat and adds 7 extra grams of protein , bringing your grand total to 31 grams of protein per shake ! and did i mention that the powder makes it thicken up into a delicious chocolate concoction ? give it a try !
 The 10 # whey is a great value as well as great tasting and great blending . I have used other wheys that do not blend as well and leave some clumps of whey . I put this in a nalgene bottle half milk and half water , volume roughly per directions , and shake . No need for a blender or a shaker . The quality of protein is ok . I prefer the isolate but you ca n't beat the value
 I have tried everything and this is the product for me personally . I think it tastes better than any other one that I have tried . Perhaps taste is the biggest factor for me . Most of the ingredients and results are the same as other quality products but I have to drink it everyday . My best friend hates but I love it . Rich Chocolate please
 I will make my comments very short and crisp as there are very good reviews listed under this product category . I would say this product is somewhat in-between very expensive and very cheap , useless protein products . If you are a jogger , play tennis , spend time in Cardio and spend time in muscle toning then this is for you . If you want to get monster muscle then look for another product . `` Understand '' what you want from your body . This does a good job in keeping your energy level high and overall you have a feel good factor . Hope this helps .
 I bought this 10lb bag of chocolate whey because I 'm SERIOUS about some SERIOUS GAINZ ! A few gym sessions after I ordered , my doorbell rang and there was the UPS guy , struggling to hold up my massive bag of whey . I was all like &#34; DYEL , BRO ? &#34; . I opened the bag up , mixed 2 scoops with some whole milk , and I 've been a JACKED MUSCLE TAXI ever since !!!
 Whey vs. casein proteinby Jeff S. Volek , Ph.D. , R.D.Proteins provide the body critical amino acids that serve as building blocks for the formation of new muscle . But not all dietary proteins are equal . The major proteins in milk are casein and whey . These two milk proteins are both excellent sources of all the essential amino acids , but they differ in one important aspect -- whey is a fast-digesting protein and casein is a slow-digesting protein.Whey stimulates protein synthesisFast-digesting whey means it is emptied from the stomach quickly , resulting in a rapid and large increase in plasma amino acids . This translates into a quick but transient increase in protein synthesis , while protein breakdown is not affected . Whey also has higher levels of leucine , a potent amino acid that stimulates protein synthesis . Whey protein is superior at augmenting protein synthesis rapidly , but this positive effect is short-lived . Consuming repeated doses of whey allows for sustained high levels of blood amino acids and repeated bursts of protein synthesis that provide superior effects on muscle protein balance . -LSB- 1 -RSB- Casein offers a positive protein balanceCasein is the most abundant protein in milk . It is relatively insoluble and tends to form structures called micelles that increase solubility in water . During the processing of milk , which usually involves heat or acid , the casein peptides and micelle structure become disturbed or denatured to form simpler structures . As a result , a gelatinous material is formed . This is the basis for why casein has a slower rate of digestion , and results in a slow but steady release of amino acids into circulation.In one study , researchers gave healthy subjects 30 grams of either whey protein or casein protein and made several measures of the anabolic and catabolic effect for 7 hours after the meal . -LSB- 2 -RSB- Whey protein resulted in a rapid increase in blood amino acids and protein synthesis , but it was short-lived . Casein , on the other hand , resulted in a prolonged increase in blood amino acids that resulted in a 34 % reduction in protein breakdown . The net protein balance remained more positive after intake of casein protein over a 7-hour period . The superior long-lasting effect of casein was attributed to a delayed gastric emptying and slower absorption rate from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood.Whey and casein are better togetherSince whey rapidly increases protein synthesis and casein blocks protein breakdown , a combination of both would be ideal.A recent study compared the effects of supplementing with either a combination whey and casein protein versus carbohydrate on several markers of muscle anabolism during strength training .3 Untrained men participated in a 10-week resistance training program and either supplemented with 40 grams of carbohydrate or 40 grams of protein containing a mixture of whey and casein . Half of the supplements were consumed one hour before and then immediately after exercise on workout days . The results were overwhelmingly positive for the combination protein group . Despite similar background diets and identical training programs , supplementation with protein resulted in greater increases in several measures of muscle anabolism , including greater increases in lean muscle mass , thigh muscle mass , muscle strength , anabolic hormones and muscle specific proteins.In a similar study that lasted 14 weeks , untrained men performed resistance training and received either 25 grams of carbohydrate or 25 grams of a combination whey and casein protein one hour before and immediately after exercise . -LSB- 4 -RSB- The combination protein group had significantly greater increases in muscle fiber size compared to the carbohydrate group . These studies provide strong evidence that a combination protein consumed before and after workouts increases muscle size.Practical uses of whey and caseinThe science unequivocally shows that the digesting rate of protein is an important regulator of protein balance . Whey provides a quick burst of protein synthesis while casein makes an ideal protein supplement to sustain long periods of an anabolic environment for muscle growth . Based on these different characteristics , whey and casein can be used alone and in combination to exploit their unique biologic effects.For example , whey protein can be very effective before and after a workout and first thing in the morning . But since the benefits of whey after exercise are short-lived , you should consume a meal containing protein 20-60 minutes after drinking a post-workout whey protein shake . In one study , 30 grams of whey protein were provided in a sequence of 13 small meals given each 20 minutes . -LSB- 1 -RSB- This was found to be far superior for muscle anabolism compared to a single meal of whey or casein.Alternatively , a combination of whey and casein -LRB- 20 grams -RRB- could be consumed one hour before and immediately after exercise for a sustained benefit on protein balance . Casein is a perfect protein for a shake before bed because it promotes a sustained anti-catabolic environment while you sleep.SummaryBecause whey and casein have different but complementary effects , many people keep both types on hand and use them differently throughout the day -- whey in the morning and after workouts and casein before bed . Or you can mix whey protein into a large glass of milk -LRB- about 80 % casein -RRB- to combine the benefits of both . Research shows these proteins support greater increases in lean body mass and decreases in body fat as part of a resistance training program .
 I purchased 2lb Vanilla Ice Cream from Amazon and I have to say it is pretty good . I have been using it at post workout and seeing good results.I was running low this week and wanting to buy more so I purchased from local Vitamin Shoppe the Double Rick Chocolate that a lot of people here are saying is good -LRB- taste wise -RRB- . Now maybe I 'm use to another brands chocolate -LRB- MRM -RRB- from the past but there is nothing `` Double '' nor `` Rich '' about ON chocolate . And no I do n't think it 's spoiled or bad , just dose not taste that great . It tastes like Vanilla Ice Cream with a very light teaspoon of Nestle 's Quick powder thrown in . I was expecting a thick richer chocolate . I think for me I will stick wit Vanilla Ice Cream , I can always add whatever flavor I want when I mix it.One other note ... at the local Vitamin Shoppe no matter which flavor 2lb 's is $ 25.99 -LRB- $ 28 w/tax here -RRB- which is why I purchased the Double Rich Chocolate there . On amazon Double Rich Chocolate is $ 30 + and each flavor is a different price . I do n't agree with this practice .
 Obviously if you 're looking to get some lean muscle mass on ya ' you 're trying to get some good quality protein . From my experience Optimum Nutrition has always provided products that work very well and are reliable . I take a protein shake about a half hour before i work out to get the protein digested and ready for my muscles and then one immediately after working out to give them that quick shot of protein . Doing this , doing frequent cardio , and eating right and I saw visible results in about a month or two after i started taking working out seriously . Getting yourself motivated is half the battle . So if you can do that you 're golden . But to see results I , in addition to any other person who knows about nutrition and fitness , would probably tell you to go with Optimum Nutrition . I use their protein , their multivitamin , and their creatine . Seeing results is what will make anyone keep going ; using this has gotten me there . Great product . When in doubt go with ON .
 So I went from cardio to weight lifting because i got bored on the treadmilll and stairmaster . So i started doing heavy compound movements . And i thought this would help with recovery , but it really failed in that regard maybe i push my body far above 1 day recovery but i thought it would be better . But half ways through the bottle i started stacking it with creatine after my workouts oh man next day after heavy squats and deadlifts i feel great . Little soreness .
 Be prepared to receive a `` ginormous '' container ... `` I pick things up and put them down '' kind of container ! Taste is excellent great way to start the day .
 I had the tropical punch flavor
 I ordered the Cookies n Cream flavor . It doesnt really taste like cookies n cream , more like a coffee flavor still tastes great though . Mixes very easily in a shaker bottle or even in a cup with a spoon . Anyway I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a high quality whey that wont break your bank .
 Before buying this product , I have gone through multiple whey proteins . This one trumps them all.Nutritionally , it has the least amount of cholesterol of any whey protein on the market , as well as having less than 1 gram of saturated fats -LRB- .5 g -RRB- . Taste-wise , ON 100 % Whey Extreme Milk chocolate IS thee best tasting whey protein product on the market . Honestly , I thought it tasted just like a CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE ?!?! No desert for me anymore , just ON Milk Chocolate 100 % Whey.PS
 This is a great way to stock up on protein ... the cookies and cream flavor is very good . I would reccommend to anyone seriously attaining a fit body . This vendor was great to work with .
 Delivery was super fast only 2 days and also free . Product was sealed on the out site and in site . Mix ability is 100 % and you don t have to use to much shaking around . Taste is in the perfect line , not too sugary but not too plain . I like strawberry cause is less polluting than chocolate or banana that makes me sleepy . Strawberry is more energetic for me and my taste buds . Digestion is almost un noticed . If you will take too much you may get your lungs to work faster and you can start to fill restless -LRB- your respiratory system will try to help stomach to move excess protein that does n't fit anymore in your cells -RCB- . So is better to go with servings designed to use this product correctly . You do n't want to look like PIG . , !!!
 I swear by this protein and recommend it to everyone that is starting to work out or looking for protein . I have found that , for a reasonable price , this is one of the leanest protein powders that you can buy . It tastes amazing with milk and just takes a couple of days to get used to it with water.This fits a small niche for people that are looking strictly for protein . This does n't have a huge amount of calories and wo n't bulk you up fast because it 's NOT a gainer -LRB- though some may think all protein shakes are supposed to do that -RRB- . This is for strict protein intake.Serving sizes are about 30g and with 24g of protein , it fits well . 5lbs will last me about 1.5 / 2 months with 2 servings a day .
 I purchased the double chocolate flavor and find it to be much easier to drink than several other brands that I have tried . I usually just mix it with water and it tastes fine . It also dissolves very easily and with relatively small amounts of fluid -- I just shake it for a few seconds and let it sit . With other brands , I had to use twice as much liquid to have it come anywhere close to fully dissolved . This brand is also very affordable , so you ca n't lose .
 Out of all the Whey Protein shakes I have tried , this is the best tasting . It still leaves a chalky taste/feeling in your mouth , but if you rinse you mouth with a swig of water it goes away . Overall I am satisfied with the Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate , and will be buying it again when I run out .
 Excellent stuff . I am using On 's 100 % whey since about a year now and I highly recommend this product . Esp , the double rich chololate tastes like heaven , easily mixes with milk/water and leaves no stomach bloating etc. . This product on amazon is a bargain and you should not let go . Get the 10 pound box and save $ 30 . This is great stuff , if you want to grow , get this ASAP .
 Been using this brand of protein for a year now and it works well ! I personally think it 's the best brand out there in terms of taste and price -LRB- especially here on Amazon . -RRB- But please , get the chocolate , you 'll thank me .
 I 've been powerlifting for over 14 years & have literally tried it all . -LRB- well ... most that is -RRB- Remember when Designer Protein was `` In '' ? Anyway , I purchased this protein along with a handful of others @ a GNC -LRB- Yes , GNC ... Retail price w / no Gold Card -RRB- without first checking out the reviews . Basically a blind study using myself as the test subject . Out of all the proteins I tested , only ONE stood out from the rest . Being that I was n't influenced in any way by a salesman , reviews , etc. . . my observations were not the result of a placebo effect . With ON , I not only maintained my weight but gained weight as well w / consistent workouts . It did an excellent job of curbing my appetite as well as this has been my breakfast , every morning for close to a year . I recently decided to check out the reviews both online & on Amazon & low & behold , a 5 star average all the way . I 'm not the least bit surprised . This is by far the best protein I have ever used .
 I 'm an amateur body-builder on a budget . Most body-building experts suggest a minimum of 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day . That 's a lot . I used to eat several cans of albacore -LRB- tuna -RRB- to achieve the protein requirement but got concerened about Mercury levels in my body from eating all that tuna . Plus , you can only eat so much before you just get sick of it . This product makes getting all the protein one needs a breeze and at a cost signicantly less than that of tuna or any store bought food . In fact if there 's a better grams-of-protein-per-dollar value available , someone please let me know about it ! And from what I 've read , Whey is the way -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- to go as far as protein supplements . Lastly , I think it tastes pretty good -LRB- close to chocolate milk -RRB- too , and does n't have a lot -LRB- any ? -RRB- of sugar , although it 's hard to avoid clumps without a blender .
 Bought some of this to see if it mixes better than previous brands . I 'm happy to say it mixes very well in milk , a few stirs with a spoon mixes almost all of it completely . Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is very good , even my two year old grand daughter loves it . Safe bet .
 This is the greatest why protein you can buy . Not only does the the Cookies and Cream taste great , but it also has easily digestable protein , and plenty of the essential amino acids . I ca n't believe that this product is so cheap , it is the best out there , and the cheapest on the market . BUY IT .
 This is the best Protein powder you can get , no doubt and let me explain you why.If you want a good tasting thing and that is your first priority then get one of those Wendy 's or McDonalds 's shakes . I mean , is that simple . Do n't be so picky about the taste when you are consuming a Protein Shake . The industry has advanced a lot over the years and the powders get better and better with the time , so stop whining.Now , if you still are into that taste and everything else comes second , then look for another product that has more saturated fat , more sugar , more simple carbs , less protein per scoop -LRB- less than the impressive .79 oz of Protein per oz of powder , a whooping 79 % -RRB- and that is not 100 % whey.Don ' t get me wrong , I still think this powder tastes great , it 's just not THE best taste out there -LRB- but who knows , maybe for you it is -RRB- but the benefits beat that . I have tried the double rich chocolate , the vanilla flavor , the strawberry flavor and the cookies and cream . They all taste good to me , especially if you know how to prepare them.The amount of calories very slightly from flavor to flavor -LRB- no more than 10 calories per scoop -RRB- but let 's take for example , the double rich chocolate .1 scoop has 120 calories , 10 from fat , a minimum amount of carbs and 24 grams of Whey protein . In case you do n't know , Whey protein is the most respected type of protein there is -LRB- with the white egg protein -RRB- since your body uses it entirely , unlike other types of protein that may become body fat if there 's not enough physical activity.The price is incredible too . Whether you are a weight lifter , body builder , somebody that wants to grow muscles or maybe somebody on a diet to eliminate that belly , you know how expensive food can be during the month . A Shake after workout there , a bar over there , whole wheat bread , fruits , etc. . If spending extra money does n't affect that 's fine but if you sometimes have to take care of your personal budget then the price gives you another reason to choose 100 % Whey.I do n't think there 's a lot more to say here . This is the best selling powder and for good reasons.And if you really need a good taste , then here are some recipes.Prepare these in a blender , it 's the best way .1 -RRB- Cut a banana in pieces and put them at the bottom .2 -RRB- Ice cubes , like 8-12 depending on the size .3 -RRB- 2 scoops of double rich chocolate .4 -RRB- Milk . I prefer Soy Milk . It has some good fats and is better . 12 oz are more than ok.Shake it until its ok . I 'm not gon na confuse you saying `` 30 seconds '' because some blenders do in 5 seconds what others do in like almost a minute.Protein
 I first bought the Cookies N ' Cream version of the Optimum whey . It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time , and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it . However , the taste of Cookies n ' Cream is n't really that great and small cookie bits can be annoying . However , I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate , and is something you can really enjoy . But in the end I guess it 's all about personal taste , it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n ' cream but not the chocolate.On a side note ; Taking protien shakes does not develop your muscles , or give them an complexion or even make you bigger . It all depends on the type of workout you have . You grow outside of the gym not inside the gym , however , muscles need to be repaired after a good workoutm and that 's what protiens do . They repair damaged muscles and strengthen them , and at the same time make them bigger .
 The best whey protin I have had great taste and great Results . Will be staying with this for a long time .
 I take this every morning as my breakfast withThe Amazing Grass Green Superfood shake add I also put fruit in it
 Good source of protein and really feel the difference during and after workouts . This is the only supplement I use along with krill oil and lifting weights like its plastic . Get amazing pumps and no soreness at all no matter how hard the workout . I prefer double chocolate flavor though .
 it 's optimum nutrition 's 100 % whey protein . it 's a great basic protein shake . ca n't ask for more . .
 Taste
 tastes great and mixes well without clumping up as much as other proteins that I have tried . I have gained 5 lbs in a month using this and not an inch around my waist
 I 'm giving it 5 stars because it is one of the healthiest whey protein and has the most quality protein I could find in a product for this price . It is great protein and has the potential to give you the results you want if you use it right -LRB- Meaning its not a substitute for your meals . I drink almost 3 shakes a day , 2 scoops per , along with 4 meals before I could finally see result , though I have had an EXTREMELY hard time seeing results , I 'm FINALLY SEEING REAL BIG RESULTS , My other issue was not giving my muscles time to rest and heal . If you do any of these wrong you wont see results no matter what supplements you take -RRB- . The issue is , I got the `` Delicious Strawberry '' and it is not so delicious after half the bag is consumed . Yuck ... but it deserves 5 stars because its a good solid product and a great price and despite the taste , if your dedicated you will deal with it .
 Been using this product for the past 9 years . I 'm not trying to get huge - and i 'm not huge -LRB- 5 ' 11 '' ~ 160 6 % -RRB- , but as someone who works out hard 3-4x a week , i 'm looking to add protein to my diet where i 've been deficient -LRB- breakfast was my opportunity area -RRB- . This product met that need.I blend a scoop with 20oz of water , 0.5 oz of 100 % fruit juice , a frozen banana or two and ice cubes - yields about 50oz of smoothie - i drink it all and then pee like a horse . I always blend after workouts , but i blend on off days as well.Even though i 've been perfecting the formula over these past 9 years -LRB- initially starting with the protein stirred into skim milk - some meathead told me that i should n't do that - so i stopped -RRB- , this protein has always tasted great . I use vanilla ice cream . I have never been dissatisfied with the quality of this product .
 I 've tried strawberry banana , vanilla ice cream , and banana cream . They all taste like crap and artificial . I could n't stomach it alone with water.However , the double rich chocolate is very doable with water . It does n't have a strong chocolate taste but it does n't taste artificial either . I can add in 4-6 oz of water with a scope and be done with it in a few seconds.Overall , Double Rich Chocolate is recommended .
 for me tastes good with just water . . it dissolves easily without any lumps so it 's really easy to drink it straight - bottoms-up !
 This is one of the protein brands that I trust . There are many out there but who knows what they actually mix in their jars . The only thing to watch out is that if you mix this with water . . you 'll need to give the shaker a violent twirl for about a minute , otherwise you end up with lumps in your mouth . My favorite is Rocky Rad ... but I 'm trying out chocolate now . . not as good . Thumbs up for this product . However amazon took 15 days to get it to me . . !!!!! first time that happened .
 I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to : - Lose Weight - Gain Muscle - Eat more often , up their metabolism - Etc.All Star Health is a great company to deal with too . They ship quick and are very quick to answer any questions!Just remember to switch your Whey Proteins every once in a while , it helps ! = -RRB-
 Vanilla ice cream taste really good . I use a blender bottle with a ball whisk so it mixes things really easy . Before that blender bottle I was just using an aquafina water bottle with a wide mouth . That did the job as well . I get no clumps and I make no funny faces when drinking it like other protein powders have done .
 Great product double rich chocolate is the best $ 40 plus free shipping can not beat the price and it tastes amazing Best Product out there in the market with great taste .
 This item came in great condition and on time . The taste is a little funky , but as Protein Supplements go , you ca n't be the nutrition stats or the price .
 I bought this along with the chocolate one and both are great . The flavor is delicious . I do n't even have to use a blender to make it . All I do is measure out a scoup of the powder and slowly stir in my liquid Nothing could be easier than that . I mix mine primarily with water . The flavor is so good you really do n't need to mix with anything else unless you want to . I have though bought those strawberry/banana smoothie drinks you get in the produce section to vary up the vanilla . I use 1/2 cup of the smoothie and 1/2 cup water and it make for a yummy treat , great for a quick breakfast . I love getting that punch of protein without a lot of sugar . I think this product is high quality and have recommended it to my family and friends .
 This whey protein dissolved fairly well , as advertised by the `` instantized '' feature . Taste was good , but could use a bit more sucralose . Recommended .
 Very good whey . Good gains and keeping my muscle while I lose weight . Has low calories and taste great . Mixes well , any made by on is top notch buy with confidence .
 Purchased this product because it was relatively low on calories compared to other products and overall it had good ratings . After trying it , it actually tastes really good when mixed with milk -LRB- or almond milk -RRB- . I generally take it immediately after working out and before dinner . Seems to help with both weight loss and muscle gain . 5 pounds will easily last me two months having it once a day . For the price , I really ca n't complain . I plan on continuing to buy it .
 Right now , I am using the ` Optimum Nutrition Glutamine Powder ' + ` Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey ' -LRB- Taste is decent -RRB- + ` Prolab Creatine Monohydrate Powder ' + ` N-Large 2 Protein Powder ' -LRB- Best taste out there -RRB- . And I have added 34 pounds on 3 months with just few body fat . Sorry I can not review the product individually , I felt I would not be fair if I do so .
 The Tropical Punch flavor looks and smells like Pepto Bismol . No , really . It does . I like the chocolate flavors better . Still however the best damn protein on the market .
 This tastes very good . I describe it as a cold version of how hot chocolate tastes . It is not grainy at all when shaken or blended . I use this as a breakfast to go .
 I 've been using Optimum Nutrition products for years . A couple of years ago I found a couple of jugs of whey protein I purchased did n't mix the greatest . It would leave large clumps in the blender . I figured maybe the switched the recipe so I switched to another brand for awhile . About a month ago I decided to try ON again and was pleased when it mixed up smooth.The only reason I did n't give it a 5 star is the strawberry flavor left kind of a funky aftertaste and its gotten a little pricey . Just in the time since I purchased this product the price has went up $ 6 . I had heard the price of whey went up but the other brand I buy is $ 10 less for the same 5 lbs jug so its hard for me to justify spending the extra on the ON brand . If it comes down in price I would defiantly purchase again .
 The price is good -LRB- on some flavors -RRB- and they taste good . Great for a quick meal after the gym . Ive been buying this stuff for about a year now , would definitely recommend it .
 This product came highly recommended for value and quality . Recommendations did not disappoint . It has all the good stuff which other people have gone into detail about and best of all it does not taste terrible ! That is a big thing for me other products similar I have tried did n't taste very good but this was n't bad . If you have ever drank nutritional shakes before you know that none of them taste great but this one was n't too bad just had a bit of a chalky aftertaste .
 ON always makes a good quality product . I personally like the vanilla ice cream flavor because it is more dynamic of a flavor . You can get sugar free cocoa and mix it in to make it chocolate , adding good flavor and fiber . I recommend buying from `` Hamilton Shop '' . They have super fast shipping and great customer support , they even gave me a sample packet of another ON product which is awesome .
 taste was good `` chocolate '' and overall lasted me about 3 months . does what it says as long as you actually workout properly . B +
 I loved the taste , but there 's definitely more `` cream '' taste than cookies . Worth the money .
 This is awesome stuff . My son drinks most of it , but I 've had a taste and it 's good . We make shakes every day , we add it to our waffle batter , etc. . It 's good stuff . You 'll like the taste and it 's good for those of you doing body-building , etc. . My 24-year old daughter is `` not dating '' this guy that comes over to our house every day except for Sundays when he does laundry and who just happens to be a body builder . Trust me . This `` just a friend '' is well developed . He uses the same exact brand and flavor -LRB- this particular flavor is cookie dough -RRB- . My son and my daughter 's `` not-a-boyfriend-but-we 're - just-very-good-friends '' both love the stuff.Hence , I recommend it.Edit October 2012My daughter finally married this guy . I do n't know if this product had anything to do with their going from `` just friends '' to newlyweds , but you never know ?
 The only other protein powder I 've had was from Whole Foods and was pretty chalky & meh . This stuff is awesome . Plain and simple , it 's really good . Great deal with subscribe and save . My co-worker loves the cookies and cream one , the only other I 've tried is the vanilla , which was not that great . I bought the extreme milk chocolate and have made it with water -LRB- in Sundesa shaker cup -RRB- and milk/banana -LRB- in blender -RRB- . It 's actually pretty great with just water , but obviously better with milk and fruit . Highly recommended .
 Best tasting and mixing whey protein for the price . Most of my friends actually think it 's chocolate nesquick . I 've always had a hard time putting muscle on even with this stuff . I just burn to many calories and do n't eat enough . Anyways , I 've had a lot of success with keeping my muscle mass even with not weight lifting since I 've been busy with jiu jitsu and road biking . Thumbs up from me .
 Great ! extreme milk choc , no After taste ... the best one out of the whey I have tried .
 Tastes really good . This product mixes kinda chunky in whole milk stirring it with a spoon . But if i put the powder in a small container with water and shake it the product completely dissolves . Overall I think it is a great product at a reasonable price .
 I have an custom web search created to search many of the largest sites -LRB- ebay , amazon , google , bing shopping etc. . -RRB- and amazon had this at the best price including shipping . Shipping was fast .
 Mixes easily and has a good taste . I have two hard gainer sons and have seen a marked improvement with their muscle gains , and they like the taste also . I have already ordered a Cookies and Cream flavor and we like that too , not much different from Vanilla though .
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Choc Malt , 5-pound TubThis is my Honest Opinion on `` Optimum Nutrition whey Gold Choc Malt '' . First off i would like to say i have never had anything taste as great as this protein . Usually i am stuck with buying proteins that clam to taste great , -LRB- ex -RRB- `` Unbelievable taste '' is always written on the label ... Oh , it 's pretty unbelievable ... Unbelievably nasty ! Most protein shakes taste like straight donkey ! Mix this baby with some Milk and a some ice all up in a blender and ta da , you have a great tasting malt -LRB- without all that nasty sugar of course , and less calories ! -RRB- I have not tried any other ON 's products but will soon when i have more money .
 Pros : - Low carb-low sugar-low calorie-24g of protein-dissolves completely in very little water-cooks wellCons : - taste is n't that great -LRB- for an ON protein powder -RRB- . Definitely does n't taste bad , just not as fantastic as their other flavors.-thickens a little when it sets -LRB- only have had this happen with this flavor . Possibly from the artificial caramel bits -RRB- Overall awesome product , but I 'd just suggest the mocha or extreme chocolate milk flavors over this one .
 Put this in my coffee in the morning . Was getting tired of vanilla . I use a hand mixer to make sure it 's stirred well . Tends to settle out a bit toward the bottom but a gentle shake of the thermos before decanting a cup helps to minimize that . A small price to pay over the typical chalky taste many of these products have .
 ON does a great job and delivering the pure needs through their supplements . When I 'm not on a low-carb diet but still need good sources of protein , this is the stuff I take and can still enjoy it .
 This showed up on time and this waaay cheaper here then it is on Optimum Nutrition 's site . This kind does n't make my stomach hurt like other protein powders . Also it tastes & mixes better too , it does n't get in nasty clumpy chunks in the shaker cup . I 'm not in love with the price , but i really do n't know where you would get this any cheaper .
 Great product , great gains , easily mixed . The flavor is the best put of all of them and pretty good for a protein shake .
 Repeat buyer , this is my preferred protein supplement . I think it tastes quite well but apparently my friend can not stand it , so to be safe you might want to order a smaller size to start , but I found double chocolate to be just fine .
 This works for my needs . I 've been satisfied with my daily shake using my BlenderBottle . Perfect combination in the morning when I just need things to be simple .
 I chose to love ot cause it really worked on me like a charm ... maybe even too much for me
 Its a great product ! The company ships its products in a great time frame . Would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good supplement of protein .
 This is an excellent protein supplement . It was a good price , tastes good , and does n't give me gas like other powders !
 This item worked for me . I am seeing great results . I will not buy any other type of protein except for this !
 This is excellent whey protein at a great price . I 've spent a lot more money on products that are basically the same . This has a great taste and wo n't leave you bloated .
 Like the subject says , good taste at a great price . Obviously , a real milk shake tastes better , but this stuff actually tastes like chocolate ! I seem to be getting bigger and attribute it partly to getting extra protein from this product .
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % is the best in the business . The quality of the protein is very high , and the taste is satisfying . For such a fantastic price , there 's no reason to go anywhere else until another company manages to top it.If you 're looking for quality protein powder , here 's your stuff . Just make sure you pick a flavor you like and you 're ready to go .
 This is a very good product . It tastes good -LRB- for a protein shake -RRB- , and even though it 's a lil ' more prone to clumping than the Optimum Platinum HydroWhey , it 's still an excellent value .
 I 'm pleased with the overall quality of this product . Double Rich Chocolate tastes good with peanut butter , almond breeze , and heavy cream - tastes much better than just water , keeps the carbs low while delivering a good amount of protein .
 I bought this back in April and now again in November . This is a great product . You can use it for strength training to lose weight while gaining lean muscle . It has a great taste . Me personally , I mix it with Hood Calorie Countdown Fat Free milk . This whey protein mix is low carb and very low sugar -LRB- so this should be diabetic safe -RRB- . This is a great price for the product since health stores sell this for aprox $ 80 + . This could be used in conjunction with exercise to build lean muscle and burn fat or you can use it as a small meal supplement throughout the course of the day .
 ON Protein not only taste great but it mixes easy with water as well -LRB- for the portable shakers -RRB- . I 've tried many different protein powders and ON Whey is by far the best one . It 's a good protein supplement for those who are doing the P90x program , Crossfit or any other physically demanding training programs .
 I love the ON 100 % Whey Protein , but the Vanilla Ice Cream is n't my favorite flavor . If you like a very subtle taste , you may enjoy it , but it 's almost like drinking sweetened water to me .
 Mixes well even with just a spoon . Tastes much better than most I 've had . Slightly more expensive but definitely worth it .
 This is very recommendable so far . I am not sure how much this product improve my muscle growth , but it is been all right .
 Very good source of protein for post workout shake ! Great price and tastes pretty good .
 Some people do not like the taste of this one but I do and think it goes well with the soy milk that I mix it with .
 This is the best protein I have ever tried and probably will never change . Tastes good , mixes well . Excellent .
 It came in a couple of days , way faster than what I paid for . The packaging is good , spoon is included -LRB- you may have to dig a bit for it , but it 's there . -RRB- I gained 23 pounds in 3 months using this product together with their creatine . Highly recommended . The taste is , well , alright . It 's not tasty or anything , but hey , it 's protein powder.Buy the `` Ultimate Shaker Bottle '' if you 're looking for a good shaker , only 4 $ and will last you a long time .
 Item arrived much faster than expected . I was pleasantly surprised by how promptly these guys shipped the stuff . Will definitely do business with these guys again : - -RRB-
 I 've been using this protein for several months now and it seems to work well for me . It is low carb and does n't taste bad -LRB- better with skim milk though -RRB- . I 've only tried the double chocolate , so I do n't know if the other flavors are good or not . The price is very competitive compared to other brand and non-brand proteins , and the serving size of 24g per serving works well , because you can always double it if you want more , yet 1 scoop plus milk is usually good for a good 32-34g serving .
 This product is n't as bland as some reviews make it out to be . I mix it with 8-12 oz of non-fat milk and it dissolves in a shaker perfetly and has a smooth rich taste . Has worked great for me before and after workouts .
 This is a great deal . It tastes great and 10.5 pounds for $ 80 , that 's a heck of a deal . I got the dbl rich chocolate .
 It tastes great . According to different sources , it is one of the better protein sources . I do n't care about the absolute best protein in the world , but I do care about taste . Even in water , this stuff is still good . Use it with bananas and a water/milk mixture and you have a milkshake worthy of the Dairy Queen menu , yet you do n't have to feel guilty about it . Ten pounds is also killer so you do n't have to keep buying it every week . A little more expensive than some others , but worth it in my opinion since I do n't want to throw it up afterwards .
 Great mixed with Slender Soy -LRB- soy milk with splenda -RRB- and ice in the blender for breakfast . Does n't mix as well in a glass with a spoon , but what does ? Probably would mix well with one of those Blender bottles .
 I have tried many different proteins but I always seem to come back to this one . It 's not the fancies or top of the line since its not a iso but do you really need all that bulls *** with a clean diet and consistent workout schedule ??
 ... according to my boyfriend ! He buys all different brands of this and says this brand has the best flavor to it . Ordering more for Christmas !!
 Slightly more expensive than other proteins , but it does work better than most in my experience . It taste great , and that was a added bonus since I did n't care about taste . You can get cheaper , but I 'm happy with the results of this product . I combined it with Animal Cuts and you notice the difference in about two weeks .
 I have tried other products , but I have to say that this product really shows results . I recommend it to anyone who is looking for that extra protein supplement .
 My boyfriend takes his Whey every single day and was devastated when he was about to run out . So as a early Christmas gift I bought him some , and it arrived super fast ! My boyfriend makes his with water due to the fact milk hurts his stomach , but I like mine with milk . Either way it 's tasty and does the trick ! Would recommend the milk chocolate for sure if you like a better tasting Whey .
 Did n't give a five because of the bland/weak flavor and it does n't dissolve that easy . It is a good amount for a reasonable price . I would probably buy it again . It does come with a scoop .
 This whey is yummy ... it mixes easily with water or milk and the taste is better than any other protein I have had . I highly recommend it !
 This is the best why protein I have tried so far . I previously use the brand from GNC - ca n't remember the name from the top of my head , but it 's not as good a mixer as this protein . I highly recommend these 3 flavors
 I knew that I had a protein deficiency in my diet because I mostly eat vegetables . I work out about 5 days a week and muscle is important to me . Not so much bulking up , but I want to have a really toned body . I was toned to begin with , but my abs were never quite getting there for the amount of ab workouts I do . I started incorporating this into my diet . I have one scoop with 12 oz . of water every morning and I am already seeing results . I think I have been taking this for about a month . It 's done wonders for my abs . They feel so solid and definitely did not feel like that before ! I did n't switch up my workout routine or diet at all . I just drink this every morning and it 's really done the trick . It dissolves completely in water . I have the double chocolate and it does n't exactly taste like a milkshake , but since I do n't drink milkshakes , it 's close enough . I look forward to it every morning !
 It is easy absorption and flavor , and it last couple of months , easy to digest , Price is very reasonable compare to other proteins
 I mix a scoop with milk & ice in my mini blender for a quick breakfast . A banana thrown in is good , too .
 The flavor is good , I bought double rich chocolate . It 's a good price for a lot of protein powder . It tastes nice when you mix it with milk but with water , it does n't taste too well .
 Here 's what I want
 I got this after I tasting a few Gaspari products and like this a little more with just plain water . I would recommend this
 Same great product , new scooper plastic though : - pPhenominal as always.ON is the only product i use for my protein
 This tastes essentially like it 's described . I find that it mixes easily into my smoothies . I 'm not hungry for hours after adding some of this into my smoothies .
 I have used many ON products over the last five or six years , but I have to say that this is probably the best all around product that they have . I would recommend that you use milk , you will be much happier with the taste that way . I take a hit of this mixed with ON 's micronized creatine powder before and after a workout , and that has been doing the job for me . Overall it is a very good product .
 The banana flavor is amazing , and its working very well for me . I plan on looking into some casein by ON soon .
 Does n't taste as good as Syntha 6 , but it is way better in all other aspects.Tastes great , I 've gained a ton of muscle , gotten a lot more girls , and lost all my hair.Great product , I 'd recommend it to anyone who is already bald .
 The powder seamlessly vanishes in any liquid and leaves a silky smooth taste . The banana cream flavor meets my chimps expectations . 10/10 would drink again .
 I use this as a post-workout and sometimes between meal protein source . The taste is pretty good , not really like vanilla ice cream but definitely very vanilla . I like to mix it with bananas for a breakfast smoothie , the two work well together . The artificial sweeteners are n't great , and I would prefer something that did n't have so many artificial ingredients , but I have n't found a natural options that tastes better . It 's still very drinkable and also mixes very well in a blender bottle or a blender . The price for the 10 pound bag makes it a very competitively priced option for anyone who plans on incorporating this a whey protein source into their diets .
 Great product , great taste as always . Arrived on time and works as advertised . Very intense chocolate taste . No `` medicine taste '' like other brands . Will buy again .
 my husband use to shop gnc for chocolate caramel religiously but then they started to only have 1 tub when they had their buy 1 get 1 free . and they also raised their price . no longer a gnc customer . will keep buying thru Amazon . Good product and flavor .
 Great protein.I have seen some solid gains while using it , however , it is a few dollars more than the ` generic ' brands of protein you can get from say Walmart . If I had more money I would stick to this , however , I suppose I will just switch back and forth between the inexpensive stuff and this brand . The taste was probably a 10/10 and has a much better consistency than the cheapies.I enjoyed it.Recommended.Use it !
 I really like Optimum Nutrition products . They mix so easily and they taste great . I 'm not a big fan of toffee , but my wife picked it . It is great !
 May be I 'm writing this review too early . So far , I have n't really seen any change . I know it will take a while for my muscles to grow , so i 'll modify this review in a couple of months . For now , all I can say is that the product tastes great !
 Great tasting -LRB- chocolate -RRB- and all around quality whey isolate for the price . You ca n't go wrong with ON . I will continue to purchase this whey .
 Product was as promised and arrived the next day ! I even ordered this item on a Sunday . Very impressive ... I know where I 'm getting every supplement I buy from now one . Ca n't beat the pricing and the speedy delivery . Chocolate whey is a pretty good flavor as well , the best I 've tasted so far , and I 've tasted a lot of their flavors .
 Loved it . I use this every day and you will love the taste . I would 100 % recommend this product to my friends .
 The protein mix is very high quality and tastes pretty good . Its however a completely different taste than After Max . I use After Max with just some water but I have to use this protein with milk otherwise it tastes terrible.When used with milk however its awesome and is a very good tasting chocolate milk .
 Awesome product to use as meal replacement or after a hard work out . I 've tried a lot of of protein shakes in the past and I have to admit that this has to be on of the best tasting ones .
 ON Gold standard whey is at the top of my list . I try others and even different lines of ON but keep coming back for the results , flavor variety , and ease of mix . This time I ventured out and tried the Caramel Toffee Fudge even with very little reviews . As a hint . It is very hard to find reviews for certain flavors but I realized that on the right side of the reviews section there is a search bar for just reviews of the product . Type in the flavor and it will bring up all the reviews with that listed in them . I was very frustrated by reading all the chocolate reviews and not finding the ones I wanted and this helped me decide the ones that got good review . Flavor was pretty good and almost reminiscent of a Wearther 's candy piece . My wife used this with some greek yogurt and said it was delicious . If your looking for variety and like the general ingredients give this a go .
 I ca n't speak for the efficacy of this supplement in terms of muscle growth -LRB- yet -RRB- . However , it 's flavor is tasty and the powder dissolves easily in water and dairy . It 's pretty filling .
 This was an awesome product for anyone looking for a great protein powder and is a dedicated exercise enthusiast . It mizes perfectly and taste amazing especially if you use some milk -LRB- I used almond milk -RRB- . I would definately recommend and purchase again
 I drink this after my workouts and it tastes great . Mix this up with soy milk or milk , ice , banana and whatever else you like and its good to go . Would recommend 10/10 .
 Great Value for the money ! Our whole family will be using this product.I would recommend it to anyone .
 WOW is all I can say . It is unbelievably DELICIOUS ! Same taste as Starbucks Cappuccino but better ! Never had a protein shake that tasted better than this by far . Props to ON for making this flavor .
 Best flavor protein . I 'm not even a chocolate lover , but this protein mixed with water tastes like a tall glass of chocolate milk ! Love it !
 Banana cream is pretty good ! I used it with 1 % milk . Tastes like banana cream pudding ! This is the best protein drink that I have ever tried .
 I just got the rocky road flavor in the mail right now . I think it tastes better than the double rich chocolate . It mixes very well with milk . The rocky road seems to mix even better.Be warned however , the flavor is STRONG with rocky road . I actually wish it was n't so strong . I put about 1.5 scoops in about 3 measured cups of milk . It 's a strong splenda type flavor . I generally try to chug it as fast as I can without breathing so the flavor is n't as strong lol . But the powder itself seems to work pretty well.I feel like my results at the gym have been improved due to the protein powder .
 First and foremost ... Amazon.com I LOVE YOU !!! Shipping was super fast , amazon prime is not joking around when they say two day shipping ! The product itself is great , it tastes good , it does taste a lot better with milk , and it does the job ! This product has been around for awhile and it is simply great for amateurs or pros . It can be used to loose weight or pack some solid mass . I recommend it and if you do automatic shipping every three or six months you can save some good money !
 Great taste even when mixed w / water . I mix 3 scoops -LRB- 75g . protein -RRB- w / 1 scoop Carnation Instant breakfast -LRB- chocolate , dark -RRB- w / a bottle of water -LRB- 12 oz . -RRB- after a hard work out . Shake it in a big plastic bottle at the gym and it all blends well , chug it and Feel your Body get Replenished !
 In my opinion , the best protein in the market . Very cost effecive compared to other stores . I will buy again .
 I 've never had any other protein powder , but from what it tastes , it 's not bad . It will last me forever because it 's such a big container . I ca n't compare to any other brand , but I will def try other flavors . It has the right amount of protein and not many calories . That 's a thumbs up from me .
 I start off everyday with a this shake and an egg white sandwich . Boring ? Maybe , but I 'm fueled with 500 total calories -LRB- sandwich and shake -RRB- and 40 grams of protein to start the day . It mixes well in 30 seconds with a spoon -LRB- no shaker -RRB- , and it taste great ; especially , if you drink it every day .
 I have been using ON Whey from a long time . I find it easy to mix even with water . I am not fussy about the flavor although most people like the taste !
 I like the reputation and value of this protein powder , along with the low calorie count , and low contaminant level -LRB- as measured by consumer reports -RRB- . But I did want to point out this is n't the best tasting powder -LRB- Double Chocolate Flavor -RRB- , and it does n't mix thickly in water . I just came form a powder I bought locally , -LRB- 1st-phorm level 1 -RRB- , which mixed well with 4 oz . of water and tasted like a shake . It also cost $ 43 for 3 lbs . ! I previously mixed my shakes in milk because they did n't taste all that good with water . I have n't tasted many different current powders , but I can say this is n't the best tasting stuff out there . Due to price and reputation , I 'll stick with ON , and will just keep trying different flavors .
 I rarely care much about the taste of these things , but I switched brands after purchasing this product and immediately switched back . Its not super sweet and mixes well . It has a high percentage of actual protein in the powder . And , its not super expensive as far as these things go .
 This protein powder from Optimum Nutrition is one of the best I have used , the powder does n't have a bad taste when mixed with skim milk or water . I found that this is one of the higher protein levels out of the different powders .
 I bought this because of price and low carbs . I use it for an extra boost at the gym . I do n't care for the taste but it 's not horrible . But , that 's my problem as I am off sugar and all sweetners 100 % . The powder dissolves easily in water . I dump a scoop into a about 4 oz water and let it sit a few minutes so I can get any clumps that may form . Give it a stir and down it . My trainer at Gold 's suggested the dotFit brand . It is high carb and high price . Ca n't say I notice any difference other then the lightening of my wallet .
 I 've only tried this product with skim milk thus far , but its taste far exceeded my expectations -- it tastes exactly like chocolate milk to me . I was concerned I would n't like the taste due to the artificial sweetener -LRB- which sometimes has a strange aftertaste in foods -RRB- , but I honestly ca n't tell the difference between this and a product that uses pure sugar . An awesome way to take care of that protein deficiency in my diet .
 This seems to be the most popular whey protein powder on the market . It is cheaper than most other professional whey powders and comes in a vast variety of flavors . It mixes well in water or milk but tastes better with milk in my opinion.As for building muscle , I guess it works ... I have tried some other brands of whey protein powders and settled on this one mainly due to its price and availability . I am not a supplement junkie so I am not adding pounds of muscle every week but I am slowly working up towards my goal with nothing but this protein powder and a bottle of Centrum multivitamin for supplements .
 Great product . Very easy to mix it in water or Milk . Tastes great . No after taste . Very low sugar . I would strongly recommend it to vegetarians or athletes like me who could use some protein supplement .
 It 's a very good protein shake with a good balance of nutrients . Probably the best part is the high serving count -LRB- 149 -RRB- which means that 5 pounds lasts at the LEAST twice as long as competitors like CytoSport and Muscle Milk .
 I have been using Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard for about 11 years as a meal replacement first thing in the morning . I especially love the Double Rich Chocolate and add frozen blueberries or strawberries in the blender . It is like having a treat that is so good for you ! I have recommended it to all of my family and friends because it is good for them and the taste is wonderful . I love the fact that I am now on autoship and I do n't have to worry about re-orders .
 Best tasting powdered protien on the market . Amazon had the lowest price with free super saving shipping .
 Great taste , great value and excellent results.Ranked # 1 whey protein and very affordable with around 50 servings in the 5 pound jar .
 I have tried a number of the whey drinks . Some are better than others , and some are just plane hard to get down . This one is not to bad . If you use milk , it 's a little like the old `` Instant Breakfast '' drink .
 So I purchased this flavor because it was the cheapest out there and I can compromise flavor over price . I think we all know that optimum makes darn good protein powder . Probably the best for the price , in my opinion . SO yeah , i was surprised with the taste of Cookies n ' Cream . Tastes much better than I thought ... definitely you can pick out the cookies and cream -LRB- there are actual little black particles in there for the cookies ! -RRB- and I would venture to say there is even a hint of tootsie roll in there , haha .
 Great product fast shipping . You get exactly what is stated . It will build muscle mass IF YOU WORK OUT . Just with anything else , you still have to train to see results .
 After looking around for different products , I can definitely say this is great . It tastes great and dissolves really well if you mix it in water . It has been over a month and a half and I 've seen great results . Definitely recommend . Ive lost weight faster with the extra muscle gains , and will re-order again .
 Tried Double Rich Choclate . Had it post workouts . My muscles are so much better toned now
 I have used this protein powder for several years and I love all of the flavors . It makes great protein shakes . I also put some in my pancake batter when I make protein pancakes and I add it to my children 's batter as well to give them an extra protein boost .
 I like to add some protein powder to a lot of my foods -- this is a great one to try . Nice flavor and `` melts '' evenly and quickly . Plus , you do not have to gag this down ; great flavor ! Also great in baked items !
 This is the best whey protein I have tasted and seen results with . Buy it , you will not regret it ! It even tastes great with H2O ! I use 2 scoops and about 12-16oz H2O , and then use a hand blender and it is awesome ! I love it . I use it after every workout .
 Optimum Protien & Muscle Milk have been good supplements for me over the years . I 've felt that they both mix well , digest well , and are absorbed well . I 'd give ON the edge because it seems to mix a little better , and is easier to digest . Sometimes these powders can be gassy or cause ` back ups . ` If you are looking for a good lean protein supplement this is it ! I 'd reccomend it over Muslce Milk & CytoSport & BSN
 Just got this as of today . Ordered it last friday , said it will come in 3 days but it came a day earlier so tht was awesome . Like everyone says here easy to mix in a blender bottle . I mix with whole milk and it taste good . Cant wait to see results with creatine and my gain weight supplement -LRB- Serious Mass -RRB- .
 excellent flavor for the chocolate whey protein , and a good amount of protein without all of the extra junk and carbs . a banana , a scoop of the powder and some milk is an awesome post workout shake .
 This product was great tasting and helped my muscles repair much quicker after a rigorous workout !
 Let me start by saying that I bought a 5 lb tub of this suff -LRB- chocolate -RRB- for college without ever trying it . The reviews and ratings seemed good enough for me to try it , and it is amazing . It mixes very well and it tastes great -LRB- like chocolate milk , without the protein aftertaste -RRB- . Another thing that drew me to this product was the low fat levels . I had bought four different brands of protein powder before this , and ALL of them had more fat , and tasted worse . I am extremely pleased with this purchase , and i would recommend this to ANYONE .
 This is by far the best tasting whey on the market . I 'm not a big chocolate fan but this whey is absolutely the best tasting product I 've tasted ... : - -RRB-
 I have no reason to give this product anything less than 5 stars . It is a high quality protein , tastes great , is offered at a GREAT price and was delivered quickly . I used the shipping subscription service and I think ended up paying $ 36 . That 's pretty darn good for 5 lbs of high quality protein powder . I have no idea what other reviews are talking about when they state that it does not taste very good . I think it tastes great . I always want more when I 'm done with the shake . I mix it with skim milk . Even if it tasted mediocre I would give it 5 stars . It 's PROTEIN people ! It 's not supposed to be some gourmet treat you would find on a cruise ship . However , with that being said , it sure does n't taste like protein.I have ordered Syntha 6 before this and I do enjoy that product more due to the combination of different protein types , as well as the fact that it tastes like ice cream . I actually did gain strength on that -LRB- with nothing else changing -RRB- . However , it 's a bit more expensive and you only get around 52 servings -LRB- with Gold Standard you get 73 -RRB- . Seeing as I use 2-3 scoops a day you can burn through it pretty quickly . If I was n't an average person with average means -LRB- and 2 children in day care -RRB- I 'd probably stick with the Syntha 6 . However , this is reality ... and what you get with this Gold Standard is darn good.This is a fantastic product and I am going to stick with it for a long time as I can not find a better value anywhere .
 Hi , I bought this item after reading the reviews on amazon . Basically I was searching for a great tasting whey protein for my muscles after workout and this product -LRB- flavour -RRB- really is good . I am sure other flavours will also taste good . My Vanilla Ice Cream flavour mixes well in fat free or lactosefree/fat free milk and tastes delicious . Thanks!UPDATE
 Great taste - had the vanilla ice cream . Excellent value . Loved the product . Mixes better than other products . Not grainy .
 I needed protein that was a good value and wanted to try something different than muscle milk or any of the other countless brands I have tried in the past . This fits the bill well . I take two scoops to get 48 grams of protein ... I am a big guy at 6 ' 2 and 250lbs ... so 24 grams at one sitting is not going to cut it for me . I love the fact that it mixes very easily with a spoon or fork . The taste is neither good nor bad when mixed with water . Muscle milk tastes much MUCH better ... but also has double the calories . This is perfect for what I need .
 I always use Gold Standard . First time trying the Caramel Toffee Fudge and I thought it was good . I rated it high because it always comes on time , they way I ordered and is always a good product .
 This product had the best price , ingredient selection , and taste in its category . I used other brands and this was had the best taste .
 Great taste , especially if you mix it in with chocolate milk.Good value for money , hard to find another protein powder product as good as this out there for the price
 I love this product . It tastes amazing , and I know there wo n't be any clumps . 15-20 seconds worth of mixing in a shaker cup and I know I 'll be good to go . The best part about this protein is I do n't have to worry if I 'm out of milk , as it still tastes just as good when using water only .
 After trying EAS protein powder , I thought I would just pass by protein powder and go `` all natural '' . That stuff was nasty . This product was later recommended by a friend so I thought I would try it . Needless to say , this stuff is pretty good . When used with milk , the milk chocolate really does taste like a milkshake . The aftertaste is minimal , unlike the other brands I have tried . Hard to beat . This stuff cuts down my recovery time by about 1/2 after a heavy work out vs not using it .
 I never had a whey product taste this good . I look forward to drinking it instead of feeling like it 's a chore . Highly recommend this , oh yeah ... it works too !
 Gold Standard if you avidly work out and need that protein supplement to go with meals after hitting the gym this is the item for you . Highly suggest it .
 This product taste great and it dissolves fast . Good amount of servings and would highly recommend this product to anyone
 I have been looking for a good protein shake and have tried several different kinds -LRB- eas soy protein , warrior raw protein blend , vega nutrition , and spiru-tein -RRB- ALL of which had nasty textures -LRB- gritty , sandy -RRB- and horrible aftertastes - not only simply mixed with milk , but also with fruit as smoothies . This is the first mix I have tasted that is not only bang on consistency wise , but I almost get sad when I get to the end of the cup because it 's all gone . I love it because I get my chocolate/sweet fix , while giving my protein a boost . I also love the fact it 's not overly sweet . I would compare it to chocolate milk but with just a touch of sweetness . I 'm not great at writing reviews , but I must say I highly recommend this product .
 I was using some cheaper crap prior to this , and found that this product mixes much more easily . Not sure how nutrition and quality of ingredients compare to cheaper brands , but it tastes fine and you do n't have to shake it for 5 minutes just to get it to blend .
 I first bought the vanillia version , However , the taste of is n't really that great and small protein bits can be annoying . However , I later tried the double chocolate flavor and it really does taste like real chocolate , and is something you can really enjoy . But in the end I guess it 's all about personal taste , it seems that some of the other reviewers liked the cookies n ' cream but not the chocolate . I first bought the Cookies N ' Creavanilla version of the Optimum whey . It gave me great results by helping speed up my recovery time , and I truly did notice a difference in my muscle development after starting to use it .
 Optimum Nutrition 's Gold Standard line is one of the best-tasting and easily-dissolved protein powders I 've tried . It comes in a variety of flavors so there should be something for everyone - but I encourage sampling as not every flavor is right for every person . The nutrition label says it all for this powder ; High protein , low-carb and very little fat makes this a perfect supplementary protein source.Whether you 're an amateur lifter , pro body builder , or just an average Joe it is likely that your eating habits are heavily carb-centric . To a lifter or dieter , the addition of supplementary protein to your overall caloric load will help keep you satisfied as well as foster any lean-muscle adaptations -LRB- whether you 're after endurance , `` toning '' , or size gains -RRB- you may be after . Personally , I use this product as a staple in my diet to offset the cost -LRB- in both price and preparation time -RRB- of my food budget and it is integral to my weight loss and muscle building goals & progress to date.If you 're tired of clumpy tasteless powders , give ON 's whey a shot ! You 'll be glad you did.Some other consumption ideas : -LRB- note
 The taste was not bad when I mixed it with coffee . The quality of the protein seemed good and carried me through much as a light breakfast would .
 This is the first time I 've tried this product , and it is excellent . I especially like the solubility of the mix in milk , soymilk , and water .
 This product is very good for those that are on a budget . It cheap and is effective for someone who is either beginning a supplement program or for those who are trying to maintain gains or leanness . I do n't believe this product would help hardcore bodybuilders and those looking for major gains quickly . As for my personal experience with this product . I noticed that I got a bit leaner with taking this product and my strength increased a little from a month ago . Granted have been working out pretty hard to get ready for the summer season ... so that does also play in as a factor . But I would say the ON whey has help a bit in my quest for the `` beach body . '' I would also say that combined with ON Casein in a supplement program ON Whey has help me recover a bit quicker after a hard work out that I would otherwise . That is an important factor for a somewhat older guy -LRB- late 30 's . -RRB- I like to get out of bed in the morning and not feel like I just work out a hour ago . So high marks in aiding recovery.Mixing and taste . On Whey is easy to mix with all types of methods . Whether it with blender , shaker , even with a spoon , I had no problem with mixing it . As for taste and consistency . It 's very light when mixed with water and taste pretty good with it . Though it does leave a slightly funny after taste . But I prefer a heavier consistency . so I mix it with milk . And as far as I 'm concerned it tastes great with no after taste.So over all a good solid product . The only reason why I do n't give it 5 stars is that this product does not produce big gains in strength or in size .
 Great product . Tastes great -LRB- I 've tried the chocolate and vanilla and enjoy both -RRB- , dissolves quickly/easily by shaking , high protein value and good mix of amino acids . I recommend this highly . If I could change one thing , it would be to have the company reduce the cholesterol content . -LRB- Soy has no cholesterol , but I prefer the whey for overall nutrition -RRB- . All in all this is a great product , best whey product I 've found , used it daily for years and will continue ordering unless/until I find a lower cholesterol rival that tastes and mixes as well with the same high protein value . Recommended . -LRB- Works great as a blender smoothie with bananas , strawberries etc , and also works well mixed with just hot water ; tastes then like water-based hot cocoa -RRB- . Great for backpacking or travel ; get up , mix a shake , start your day .
 Tastes ok , not good . I would still recommend because it is the best protein that I have tried so far .
 I have n't used many protein powders , but this one tastes great and mixes easily . Seems to have good nutritional value and gets great reviews .
 This is my go to protein . You ca n't beat the quality at this price .
 I bought this stuff to help with long bike rides . It 's really worth it . The powder dissolves easily in skim milk and does n't have the chalky taste that some other `` powdered nutrition '' products have . I 'll definitely be trying the other flavors .
 When it says DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE it REALLY means DOUBLE RICH CHOCOLATE ... It tastes REALLY good ... you just got ta add suggar and its amazing ... And 10 pounds really gets your head away from worry about protein for a while ... I would buy 3 more of those and 2 o 3 miscellar casein supplements to forget about protein intake for a year or more!Just 3 or 4 foods -LRB- easy to take -RRB- and 2 or 3 `` supplement foods '' ...
 Started on Optimum Nutrition when I began to take protein supplements . Changed to a GNC-espoused brand when I could n't find ON at my local grocery store . When I found ON Whey on Amazon , I knew it was an easy decision because of Amazon 's great service , the quality difference between ON and the GNC-pimped brand , and the price . I 'm sticking with Amazon for my supplement needs .
 Optimum Nutrition is a reputable and well respected company . This product is very affordable compared to other protein supplements . It is high in quality , containing 24 grams of protein out of 29 grams -LRB- 5.5 g of which is BCAAs -RRB- , and will satisfy your protein needs . This product has an acceptional taste . Mixing this product is easy and conveniet . I recommend this product to anyone whose purpose is to add in additional protein content or for weight training . Overall this product is a great protein supplemnt for its price , quality , and quantity . Great buy !
 well ... is my second buy from vitamin shoppe and It was sucessfull . It was fast , too fast ... 3 days.I recomend this page to buy .
 Excellent product ! My son introduced me to this brand of whey and it tastes great as well .
 Take a high quality protein , give it a realistic flavor , offer it at a nice price , and you 've got one of the best protein supplements around . I 've tried many protein powders , and always end up coming back to ON
 I used the Vanilla flavor the last two times but ... Amazon did n't have it in the big tub this time , so I tried this - Chocolate Mint . Tastes good and no after taste . Minor complaint is that it does n't dissolve as totally as the vanilla did - no matter how much I shake .
 I have been using TrueProtein for awhile but their prices are really expensive . After trying ON Whey I think Im going to stay with it because the quality is comparable and the price is a lot cheaper specially if you do the suscribe and save plan . It also comes with aminogen , a scoop , flavor , and a container all included . The cookies and creme flavor is n't the best but its not bad . The ratio of isolate to concentrate to whey peptides is great for pre and post workout . Five pounds of high quality whey for 33 dollars shipped is a steal . Definitely give this a try .
 For me , this product is good , not necessarily because I saw myself bulk up tremedously in the month that I took it , although there were some visible differences , but because it helped me get the amount of protein I needed daily , and it tasted great . I think if I keep taking this I will have nothing but great results .
 Definitely the best tasting chocolate protein I 've ever purchased . It mixes unbelievably well . I 'm planning to buy some other flavors to use with cereal , etc. , but so far this is the only one I can speak for . I reviewed several competing products and this one was cheapest at the time ; it did n't disappoint !!
 Great combination of ingredients and total protein content per scoop . Was looking to substitute an expensive whey protein product and found it . Reasonably priced , very tasty and good overall .
 I have had gastric bypass and I have tried a lot of protein mixes and this one is the best every once I found this one I have n't had to try another one again . This one dissolves and is n't chalky . It tastes like choc milk . I use only non fat milk cause it does make your milk thicker and that 's ok for me . I used to have this 3 times a day but now I only need it for breakfast and it is feeling and satisfying until I have my first break at work . And now that I found it on Amazon it mails out to me and I do n't have to worry the store is going to be out any more and it was cheaper then in the store . Yea for me ! And it has very low sugar and high protein . Try it you might like it .
 I have tried many types and brands of whey protein supplements . Optimum Nutrition is definitely the best I have found . It 's all I buy anymore . I use the vanilla mainly for making smoothies or when mixing fruit or other flavors with the whey since it has a more `` neutral '' taste . Strawberry is the best tasting ON Whey flavor to just drink straight with water or milk . They have a great taste and mix up easier than any protein powder I have tried .

 Satisfied so far . Was careful this time to incorporate excessive water to avoid indigestion problems that were faced the last time.Looking forward to try the `` Natural '' Whey
 Tastes goood if you like choclate . It tasted like hot choclate . It tastes even better if you use some sugar .
 I love this brand and this product . What I think sets this product apart from most protein powders I 've tried , is that it actually tastes good ! It 's got everything you want and need in a protein powder whether you 're training or trying to lose weight . It 's great before and/or after a workout and as a meal replacement when you 're on the go and do n't have time to eat right . But the best part of this product is that because it tastes good , you will use it . Most protein powders I have tried just taste terrible . And I just wo n't use them if I can not stomach getting them down . This stuff is good . I like the tropical punch mixed with water so it tastes like fruit punch . It looks like Pepto Bismol , but do n't let that deter you ... it tastes great . The vanilla ice cream flavor makes a great smoothie with fresh fruit and skim milk . I can not say enough good things about this product , it 's quality and taste . If you 've tried protein powders before but just ca n't tolerate their nasty taste , I would highly recommend you try this product .
 I 've tried several proteins over the years but THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK !!! This is THE right way to add lean muscle . If you want to get big you need a quality powder - start here !
 I liked a lot , but the taste with water is n't the best . with fat free milk it gets better
 Neither ISO 100 or Syntha 6 compare to the yumminess of the cake batter Optimum . I also has a very high protein to calorie ratio , very low fat , and very low sugar . Get it ! I will definitely be trying out the other kinds too .
 My wife needed a new protein powder to go along with that new 2-year gym membership . Well , she 's been to the gym once and this still has n't been cracked open . I bet it 's good though , I enjoy their other flavors . I think that I 'll just consume it myself .
 I have never used supplements before and just got this a couple of weeks ago and I can tell a difference . I usually do n't like flavored things but this tastes good . +
 i was taking the one from walmart but then i read up on this one and it comes out a little more expensive then walmarts but the taste is really good i tried double chocolate and vanilla ice cream i was taking it with water but now i take it with one banana , ice , soy milk and a little creatine and wow its really good . Any way i am 35 years old i am 5 ' 8 200 pounds i been working out exactly 3 months to this day and been taking this protein for like 2 full months i am on my third 5 pounder . so one 5 pound last me a month . when i started lifting i was only benching the bar and a 25 on each side and today 8/01/2011 i maxed at 250
 I love to work out !!! and this is the best tasting protein ever ! The price is great too . No complaints here
 As far as protein powders go , this one wo n't let you down . It tastes good and dissolves quickly . Do n't put it in anything , hot though - I tried a scoop in a cup of coffee and it turned into styrofoam .
 This product arrived on the date it was promised , Kudo 's to Amazon ! It is one of the better tasting Whey products on tne market and time will tell if the results are as expected .
 pros
 The Double Rich Chocolate has a great test and it is less sweet than some of the others we have tried . It takes a little bit of effort to get it mixed thoroughly but that is similar to all products of this type . Tastes like a milkshake with low fat milk added .
 I tried the samplerpack before purchasing the 5 lbs tub . This was my favourite flavour it is almost passable for chocolate milk . The nutritional stats speak for themselves .
 tastes pretty good , clumps a lot , but otherwise not a bad choice at all for whey protein .
 delicious -LRB- i 'm very picky about flavor -RRB- and easily dissolving with a decent amino acid profile . however , a bit pricey even at the bulk sizes .
 great taste -LRB- preferred this over EAS chocolate -RRB- with 24 grams of protein . very satisfied with this product
 I 've tried about 2 other whey protein shakes besides this and this mixes the best . It also tastes good , I bought the double chocolate , have n't tried the other ones .
 Just like the title said , quick delivery ! I expected my item to come in about 7 days becaus I live in California , but i received it after 4 days . It also came in a good condition .
 This is the second protein shake I 've tried since I started working out . My first was GNC Pro Performance 100 % Whey Protein . ON Gold Standard is a lot better in my opinion because of the taste and it is absorbed faster . I used this for about 2 months and noticed more lean muscle . I recommend double rich chocolate . The next protein I 'm trying is Isopure Low Carb .
 I have been using this stuff regularly for about 10 months post workout & for meal replacement to keep up protein intake . I read alot about mixing whey with coconut water & that is how I have been taking it -LRB- blended with a couple ice cubes -RRB- . If you like strawberry shakes this will be really easy for you to take , I do & I actually look forward to the shake .
 About a month ago I was hanging out with a group of friends and they were talking about weight and such . I have a pretty high metabolism and it is really hard for me to gain weight . For the past 5 years I have faithfully worked out and have gotten myself very toned but because of my excessive workouts I ca n't gain that much weight . Several friends said that I should drink protein shakes to help gain weight and increase muscle . So I searched the internet and found this Whey Protein . I purchased it and within 2-3 weeks I already felt a difference in my energy , my muscles and my work outs.I purchased the double rich chocolate and I mix it with milk . Also I sometimes put hershey chocolate syrup in it for extra carbs because weight gain is a big factor for me . I think it tastes great . Great product overall . I plan to buy again.Added
 The main reason I bought this was because the reviews online were near-stellar for this protein . I ALWAYS do research before buying anything and protein was no exception . I like this stuff , it tastes dandy , and I 'm sure all the ladies notice the difference ! ;-RRB- * ZING * Here is my favorite recipe that I put this Whey in :1 avacado1/2 cup of soy milk -LRB- vanilla flavored will blow your mind -RRB- 1/4 cup of organic sugar -LRB- I use less normally , and if the avocado is wicked ripe I almost half the sugar -RRB- 1/4 tablespoon of vanilla extract -LRB- liquid vanilla flavoring basically -RRB- THEN ... I add about a 3/4 scoop of this Gold Standard Wheyand SOMETIMES add a half scoop of Juice + powder -LRB- if I do this , I cut back on the sugar even more -RRB- -LSB- I normally double everything as to only dirty my blender just once every 2 days -RSB- ... put all of this strait into a blender , blend -LRB- obviously -RRB- , and pour into something to set in the fridge for 30 minutes or so to get a nice chill on it . When you come back to your shake you 'll have a GORGEOUS yogurty-textured blend of delicious , and more importantly healthy , protein milk shake.Happy workouts and stay healthy . : -RRB-
 The taste is great . The low sodium content is a huge plus even though I do n't currently have high blood pressure . Low on carbs so add a banana after you work out but great if you just want to have straight up protein . The only reason it does n't receive 5 stars from me is because it has 10 % of the cholesterol you need dialy . This is not huge but I would n't have more than 1-2 shakes of it a day . If this product had 5 % or less I would pretty much have 3 shakes a day . But compared to other protein shakes 10 % is n't that much . . WORTH A TRY
 Amazon.com is the best place to buy Optimum Nutrition Gold . It saves you money in a BIG way . The only down side is the shipping wait but that is only a few days .

 Hey this is a real good source of protein with 24 grams of it you cant go wrongIt was recommended to me by a friend who 's really into the weight-lifting sceneand he swears by it plus the chocolate flavor is the best I 've tasted in a protein shake , but in order to get ripped I also had to shed the fat , I tried lots of thermogenics in thepast but found out that this supplement called Muscle-Max works the best when combined.ItHelped me to lose 38 pounds in 7 weeks time and got me shredded especially if your on a low carbdiet . Of course I 'm still kind of new to the fitness scene , but you can find a better explanationat their site at -LSB- ... -RSB- ThanksJameel Pugh
 I first tried it by simply blending a scoop full with just water . I could not bare the taste of it . However , during the second time , instead of using water , I used V8 juice . It definitely made it more bearable and easy to drink . I also tried blending it with a cup of milk and a frozen banana . It came out very thick with a consistency of a smoothie . It tasted good , but I think I still like blending it with V8 juice .
 Great product , high quantity of protein per scoop/container . The taste is n't there though , its very easy to stomach and not heavy at all , but it just doesnt taste like anything to me .
 I just started recently to weight lift , so I decided to give whey protein a shot . I did a bit of research and ended up with this . Overall its pretty good , does n't smell too bad , and tastes pretty good . I was actually surprised on how good it tasted , most things I read were about how whey protein tasted bad -LRB- well most of it -RRB- , but this is good .
 Great timing . Ordered on dec. 24th before christmas and it arrived quickly by the 29th . I was surprised as I do n't expect packages to come quickly during the holidays . Also - Came right before my last batch of whey was finished - Now I can continue to bulk during the new year = -RSB- Thanks herballoveshop .
 The container is like the size of a 55 gallon drum , hence the price . You get a lot of mix . Taste pretty good for a protein shake .
 Ships fast . Nothing to complain about . Just good.Enough qty for one person , 3 times per week work out for 2 month .
 outside of the fact that the mint flavor is a bit odd . -LRB- Vitamin shops is better tasting !!! -RRB- its a great supplement that mixes easily ... plus nothing beats shopping at Amazon !!!!!!
 Taste is really good . If you 're using water , keep it down to about a 1 1/3 cups for 2 scoops . If you 're using milk , 2 cups is good . As always , if you add fruit to it , less milk would be good , but water should always be 1 1/3 cups for 2 scoops . The taste is good , it can get old after awhile though . Regardless , it 's a good product . I 've seen some improvements , and i recommend it .
 I 'm a VERY picky eater ! Just ask my girlfriend , family and friends : - -RRB- Yet I must say that this is is a good drink ! That is if you like chocolate . Mix one cup of the powder -LRB- very fine -RRB- along with 8 oz of milk -LRB- skim , etc. -RRB- and it taste even better than chocolate milk ! The secret is to mix it up REAL good ! I mean for minute , or if you have a mixer or blender that 's even better . But I usually -LRB- for time reasons -RRB- mix it after breakfast with a spoon then drink it up.The price has gone up since a year ago . However I think that 's because it 's gone up everywhere else as well . However with having it shipped free to your house and no tax -LRB- through Amazon -RRB- , you do n't have to go wrong ! No lugging it home in a huge bag/box , just order and have it delivered to your door free !
 I bought this after trying GNC 's whey protein . This protein blows it out of the water . For starters , I know that lots of people say it , but the taste is phenomenal . I have the rocky road and I plan on trying the cookies and cream flavor next time . Also , I definitely feel as though it is helping with my weight lifting . Not like it 's a miracle supplement , but it helps me between one set of lifting and the next , giving me faster recovery times than I am used to , and helping to get my protein uptake up to what it should be . Anyway , it is good , and it is worth it .
 The product mixes well and tastes really good . I 'm very satisfied with the purchase and plan to try other flavors -LRB- I started with vanilla -RRB- For those who are lactose intolerant , it does contain the lactase enzyme , but it could probably use a little bit more . I think the product mixes better than the Designer Whey product .
 Im a new into the field of body building and im starting off with the 100 % whey double choco . Ive only had 2 or 3 shakes , because i just got the 10.37 lb bag yesterday . They taste GREAT . Literally tastes like a mc . donalds shake . -LRB- could be good or bad to somepeople , but definetely drinkable -RRB- The only problem i noticed , when coming back to this site is that it doesnt look like you can order 10 pounders of this anymore ? Did I get the last one or what ? Ill keep you updated every month or so on how its workin .
 It tastes good , and I do n't know how to evaluate anything else about protein stuff . I 'm a picky eater so trust me , it tastes just fine .
 On an otherwise pleasant day in the English countryside where I spent my childhood , I sat atop a tuffet to enjoy my 100 % Whey Protein Gold Standard in the fashion that I found most pleasing , which is to say , along with warm milk curds . But just as I had sat down to enjoy this lovely afternoon snack , I was startled most unexpectedly by a predatory arachnid , who was so bold as to sit directly alongside me ! I was so started , in fact , by this spider that I nearly forgot my curds and whey , which I had hastily lain on the tuffet in my surprise ! Suffice it to say that I had subsequently lost my appetite !
 One of the best protein money can buy . It works absolutely amazing . I have seen results within a couple drinks of this protein . Great product I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get lean or big . Vanilla ice cream is not as sweet as French vanilla , but it does the job after an intense workout session .
 i took this stuff and didnt workout superhardcore . i did see a bit of improvement with it . and any noticable change is better than none . i mix it with milk cause it just seems a little thin . also put it on my generic grape nuts from kroger . good stuff i could eat it all day . or mix it with that and yogurt and a scoop here and there . i 'm sure i would see more dramatic improvement if i worked out harder but it did what i wanted it to .
 It took me a while to find a protein supplement that I could stomach and ON Whey is the best . The price on Amazon is pretty comparable to many other sites I 've ordered from . If this is n't your flavor , order their sampler box . It comes with 12 different flavors and most of them are pretty good .
 Great taste ! great price ! works as well as any other whey protein powder , but dissolves a lot better than most I have used in the past .
 This is okay . . I guess . One thing that i do n't really like about this product which i actually got a day before expected -LRB- kudos -RRB- is that it does n't mix well with milk , other than that it tastes pretty good -LRB- i purchased the Double rich Chocolate -RRB- which tastes like Nesquick
 I 'm always afraid to buy a huge quantity of something to have it taste bad -LRB- hello , CostCo -RRB- . This Double Rich Chocolate tastes pretty good and is n't as chocolate-y as I would have expected , which is good for me . Like anything powder-based , you can add more water for less flavor and less water for more.The little spoon was kind of hard to find in the huge tub of powder , but I used chopsticks : -RSB-
 Using this product for years now , and to be honest , you really cant beat it for overall value . Optimum Nutrition is known for making quality products , and Its relatively cheap compared to other proteins out there , The Serving size is only 1 SCOOP compared to other products that require 2 scoops , which means your getting more value . It mixes very nicely with water or milk , and the taste is bearable with water , and pretty damn enjoyable with milk . As a college student its great to use when you have class and do n't have time to grab an in between snack ... just have a scoop of this ! You can use it in the morning , and mix it in with oatmeal for extra protein and vanilla flavor.The only bad thing i could possibly say , is that there is no hydro whey which gets into your system faster , and pro-complex , which contains all essential amino acids ... THAT BEING SAID , both of those products are considerably more expensive.Overall , after years of trying products , this is the best whey protein product for your money . Quality protein , for a good price .
 I have used Optimum Nutrition before and the quality is still very high ! Its the only protein that doesnt cause stomack problems . The price is the best I have found and with the auto re-order it is even a better deal !
 There are a lot of great reviews on this product already so read other ones . I 'm simply posting to say Rich chocolate -LRB- mixed with milk -RRB- simply tastes like CHOCOLATE MILK to me.I was a little nervous ordering 5 pounds after reading reviews saying it tastes bad but using the recommended amount of milk -LRB- 6-8oz -RRB- per scoop it tastes good .
 This is the best tasting whey around . It is also very cheap for the amount of whey you get . I 've listed the nutritional facts below for those of you are lazy to look.Nutrional facts : Serviing size :1 rounded scoop -LRB- 29.4 g -RRB- Calories :120 Calories from fat :10 Total Fat :1 gSaturated Fat 0.5 gTrans fat :0 gCholesterol
 I 've been using it for years ... tried the others and nothing compares . Full spectrum of nutrients you need ... does n't punish the GI tract like cheaper brands . Use the casein too .
 this is by far the best protein you can take when i started lifting i weighed 155 and got up to 195 in 4 months that is training hard every day of the week taking 1 day off . nothing but power lifting and a little cardio take about 220 grams a day and see what happens good luck to your transformation any trainging tips email me at spl1tn_h34ds101@yahoo.com
 I have been taking optimum nutritions whey protein for a couple of years now . I love this product and works miracles for the body . I have tried , double chocolate , rocky road and cookies and cream . I loved the dc and cc so i decided to try the rocky road . This flavor is not as good as the other two . I bought a 5 lb tub of it and am now regretting this flavor . stick to the flavors you like .
 I have been a user and a fan of ON 100 % Whey for a while but had never tried the Rocky Road . The Rocky Road is by far my favorite flavor now . The only way I could describe it is if you added almond to the milk chocolate . That is about what it tastes like . It is REALLY good .
 I have tried other protein powders and they taste terrible . There usually chalky and bland however this protein powder was quite the opposite . Taste especially good if you add a banana or some peanut butter too !
 Very good protein.Still being my favorite . Amazon still has a very competitive price.They can work on trying to make it dissolve faster .
 Taste great . It actually has more protein than other products that I bought . Great value for the money . I highly recommend this product .
 I 've started weight training lately and noticed I 've been lacking in protein intake . I do n't really like milk and I did n't want to quit eating my oats for breakfast so I decided to throw it in my oatmeal -LRB- and I also add crushed Shredded Wheat to help thicken up the texture and for extra fiber -RRB- ! I eat my oatmeal with water and I 've got ta say it taste awesome :-RRB- It also tastes like hot cocoa if you shake it up with hot water . Highly recommend this product -- it taste awesome and is worth every cent : -RRB-
 I know everyone has different tastes , but this stuff is fantastic in organic fat free milk . I have n't tried it with water and do n't think I will . Mixing the product with milk does add some additional calories , but it also kicks in 7-8 grams of protein bringing a single 8oz serving to over 30 grams . Hard to beat that . I mix mine in the Blender Bottle -LRB- sold on Amazon -RRB- and have been very happy with the results . By the way , I 'm not looking to gain a bunch of mass with this product , I 'm using it more as a meal replacement in the mornings and to get some extra protein in my diet . So far , so good . Once the warmer weather gets here , I 'll look at picking up another flavor , maybe the Tropical Punch .
 I bought this over a year ago and still have it . I have n't been going to the gym as much as I used to when I originally bought this . It still tastes good a year later though .
 I 've been using ON gold standard for over a year now . The price ca n't be beat . The taste is pretty good and it does mix well . I 'd say using a shaker cup -LRB- any cup or lid will do -RRB- mixes it the best . The price is really good too . Great for my post workout protein .
 PROSGreat FlavorMixes very easily -LRB- no lumps -RRB- CONSNoneI am a big fan of Optimum Nutrition Products . I have used many of their protein products over the years as a form of recovery . This is the best I have had as far as taste and mix-ability is concerned . The product is delicious and mixes very well . For the price , there is no better protein for me . I have used the Platinum before , which is very similar , but slightly sweeter .
 Have been using this for a few years now . It 's simple , digests fairly easily and top-quality whey.Top flavors are Caramel Toffee Fudge and Chocolate Mint when paired with Whole Milk.I strongly recommend a Blender Bottle -LRB- or something equivalent -RRB- . I used to just add a scoop to a cup of milk and stir with a spoon but blending it makes it so much better .
 If you just want some protein that is effective , choose this one . I love strawberry , it tastes great -LRB- i drink mine with low fat milk as opposed to water -RRB- and it definitely helps with your workout routine . I used it mainly for recovery not so much to help bulk .
 After doing the research , I chose this protein powder due to being one of the healthier powders out there . I like the taste however it does n't blend/dissolve as well as some of the other big brands with &#34; fillers &#34; , etc added . But I 'm willing to take the trade-off for the higher quality , more pure product .
 Absolutely perfect blend of isolates and concentrates . I got the chocolate malt and it 's delicious . Spot on with the malt flavor and mixes very well . Optimum is a very solid company . Very fast shipping . Thanks amazon
 I like this product a lot . It is very sweet but appears to have good ingredients . The price was right too .
 This stuff is so good I cant believe its a protein shake ! It is really low on carbs so its perfect . Tons of protein too !!
 It tasts great and it works good . It tasts beter than anything i have ever tried ! And it works . I am using it to gain muscle and i have seen big improvements .
 I personally really loved the protein powder , it tastes good in milk though . . It doesnt taste like i am drinking a protein shake , as tastes is awesome . . Recommend it
 I have used the vanilla & strawberry flavors . But this is by far the best tasting one of all . Its very rich with an awesome chocolatey taste . Best of all it is a great product it works very well . Does n't give me gas , keeps me very lean . What recommend this to anyone male-female hope this helps .
 Just as it says , it 's whey ... the muscle builders standby .5 lbs is quite a bit , so make sure you have some space set aside to store it when you order .
 The ON whey protein shakes are great . I just wanted to leave a review about the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor in particular since a lot of people have been praising it . Its really not that great . Not even good I would say . The strawberry and chocolate flavors are better . I 'm going to finish out this tub of Vanilla Ice Cream but I do n't think I will be buying this flavor again .
 I have bought two big 5lb bottles of this protein shake
 I tried this during weight loss , I was on minimal diet , working out three times a day . This is a tasty flavor , but as always it is not exactly cake batter so keep that in mind . Blends well , tastes great !
 Surprised at how great the flavor is . This is my first ON product , and definitely the best tasting protein drink I 've had . Yes , better tasting than muscle milk -LRB- but much better for you -RRB- !
 Good product and it also has a good taste . I can see the change in first two weeks by taking only on the days I workout .
 Great tasting product ! Mixes well too.Bought for my 17 year old son for after tennis practice , workouts , and matches .
 Great product . Tasted good , was n't chalky . Mixed well . It was a great product to supplement my cardio and weight lifting regiment . I highly recommend this product and this flavor . It does n't get sickening even by the bottom of the container .
 Tastes great with unsweetened almond milk ! Love it in the morning before work or after the gym . Great taste , dissolves completely - smooth malty flavor , not too chocolate , just right !
 This protein is great , I love it ... The Vanilla Ice Cream flavor is so good , its not too sweet or overpowering ... I do n't get tired of the flavor .
 Great productTaste 5/5 tastes great with water , even better with milkPrice 5/5 for the amount and quality of optimum nutrition products you can not go wrongOverall 5/5 I am a serious bodybuilder and this is a staole product in my regimen along with ON casein
 I have tried multiple flavors of the Optimum Nutrition protein and this is by far the best of the group . It does n't seem to cause any bloating it tastes great with both water and milk and seems to mix fairly well . The only reason it received 4/5 stars is because there is better tasting gourmet proteins out there . For the cost and for the blend of proteins you get this is a solid purchase .
 I have been using this whey for several years and the flavor is terrific ; not too sweet with a nice chocolate flavor . I have yet to find another which I like more .
 I have gotten Whey protein multiple times . Amazon always has it on sale , and so far its the best protein powder I 've found.The taste is great and I have gained 15 pounds of muscle in the last year while using this supplement in addition to a good diet.Great product , good deal = good buy.Would recommend this to anyone looking to get stronger and build muscle .
 Great price for a superior product . This is the industry standard of whey and the taste is great . i recommend using a mixer or blender to avoid those powder bombs in your shake . The product speaks for itself . Packaged well with no other product issues .
 I 've tried the french vanilla creme & double rich chocolate but my fav has to be chocolate mint ! I put it in a blender bottle with 7 oz of water only so the drink gets thick not too watery ! It will taste good if you like mint chocolate . As for the quality , you ca n't go wrong with Optimum nutrition products !
 Using this for a pre or postworkout shake has been great . Does n't give the bloated feeling that other protein powders do . I tried the Double Rich Chocolate and it tastes good as well . I will be ordering this again as soon as I run out . The price was unmatched when I purchased this product as well .
 I 've tried many protein powders and this one tastes about the best . According to consumer reports magazine many protein powders contain toxins such as arsenic , lead , and cadmium . This one does not . Another important factor in choosing it .
 This stuff is great ! It helped me lose weight . I drink 4 scoops of this everyday with diet and exercise and I managed to lose 20 pounds in 2 months . No way ? YES WHEY ... ha ... ha . . Anyway , I would suggest any of the chocolate flavors in terms of taste . I 've tried strawberry and never finished the thing .
 S *** tastes like Strawberry cake . F 'n Delicious ! Do n't know why others are complaining , must 've gotten a bad batch . Thank You !
 I tried other products from different companies , but is not good as Whey Gold Standard , Delicious Strawberry . I have been using this product for the past three years and I love it . I used after working out to help my body recover . I recommend this product to my friends and to those who works out extensively .
 the Optimum Nutrition series is the best whey I 've had , and now I use it exclusively . My favorite flavor is the double chocolate . Some days I work out just so that I can justify drinking a shake !
 I 've been using this for a long time . Like the taste , like what it does , and like the economical large package .
 I have to say , Optimum makes a pretty good protein . The taste is fairly good , and from what I can tell it is fairly competitive with protein per serving . The only thing that put me off about it is that it always gave me a mild stomachache when I took it . I kept taking it anyway because I did n't want it to go to waste . Recently , I had a friend who is pretty much a supplement guru tell inform me that they use coffee creamer as one of their ingredients ! I immediately know what was giving me the upset stomach . I do n't know if they are trying to cut corners or what , but a least for me this was a deal breaker .
 ON Gold Whey is known for high quality protein and was part of the protein absorption testing and was shown to be high quality , but there are lots of high quality protein powders . I think the main factors for picking a protein powder are
 Mixes well , tastes fine , and is a good value for being a quality product . I 've been taking ON Whey for years now .
 I really enjoy the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard . I get the vanilla creme and add some strawberries and blueberries to make a smoothie . I do n't think there is a lot of flavor in the vanilla so the Whey taste is mild to me . I have n't tried any of the other flavors but I really like the ratio of protein to carbs and sugars so that is what is most important . It mixes nicely and makes a creamy milkshake with some ice and a base of EAS Carb Control drink -LRB- instead of water -RRB- . I also use the Apex 100 % whey Protein and would recommend either one .
 In my opinion , the Strawberry flavor tastes like cough syrup -- not very good . Not going to stop me from using it , of course , but just thought I would give a heads up to any future buyers so they could think about going with another flavor .
 I have used this for several years now and I 'm very happy with the results as well as the flavor -LRB- Vanilla Ice Cream -RRB- . Within 30 minutes of waking , I shake it with some water , 2 oz raw egg whites -LRB- in a carton -RRB- and 1 raw egg . It ends up reminding me of eggnog only better and not as thick . This is one of the things I do that I feel helps keep me muscular and lean . Great product .
 Seriously the best protein you can buy . There is nothing more I can say about it that needs to be said .
 Good value for as large of a tub as it comes in . Protein is pretty standard , does n't mix terribly but , as with most other protein powders , does n't mix completely either .
 Moccha Cappucino is mediocre . There 's no way around it . The taste best compares to a packet of Swiss Miss hot chocolate with a hint of coffee . It mixes reasonably well , however it does clump somewhat , even when mixed with milk in a shaker bottle . It tastes fine in water , and also in Oatmeal.If you 're interested in trying out new flavors , give it a whirl . It really is n't bad , and you will definitely finish the whole five pounds . It 's not one of their more stellar flavors . It 's not bad . It is simply a very mediocre from a brand that strives for excellence .
 I have been using this for 4 mos . now . I really enjoy the double chocolate flavor . The sugar to protein ratio was one of the things that attracted me to this mix . I usually have a shake a breakfast and one after workouts . Using subscribe and save is great , 2 pounds last me right at 1mo .
 I 've used this brand for over 3 years and would n't buy anything else for the price . Great chocolate taste , especially when mixed with soy milk . Not sure how it is with water . I recommend getting the BlenderBottle shaker cup as well .
 24 grams of protein per serving ! Taste good . Does not quite mix as well with a spoon as they claim but is still everything i wanted in a protein powder .
 I 'm on my second vat of this protein powder . The first flavor I bought was Extreme Milk Chocolate . It was delicious . It tastes just like a powdered chocolate milk . I finished it and if that was the only flavor I ever tried I would give this product 5 stars , but recently I bought the Double Rich Chocolate and it is terrible . It 's hard to even drink it . I have to chug it down so that I taste it as little as possible . I recommend getting this powder , but just do n't get the Double Rich Chocolate . It is disgusting .
 Great tasting , fine ingretients , mixes well , bargain price!I use frozen banannas , mix with ice cubes , flax seed oil , and Bananna flavored whey.Taste great !!! I 've tried many other whey products over the years , ON is by far the best .
 Bad pun aside , my family has used this whey for a long time and I recommend it as one of the best you can get if you can afford the price premium .
 I 've have n't been using it for very long , so I ca n't say much about results . But this stuff is absolutely delicious . My friend has it in chocolate and he 's gotten pretty big . So I decided to buy it . I recommend it to anyone .
 I like this brand and flavor -LRB- although I have n't tried another flavor yet -RRB- for these reasons :1 -RRB- It tastes pretty good in milk-no overpowering `` protein taste '' and only a subtle flavoring .2 -RRB- According to ConsumerReports research -LRB- google `` Consumer Reports protein drinks '' and it should be the first link -RRB- , Optimum Nutrition is very good about keeping down the amounts of dangerous heavy metals in their products .3 -RRB- It 's high in protein , including most of the essential amino acids , but it does n't have a lot of carbs . Carbs are necessary for post-workout recovery , but this allows me to control my carb intake much more easily.What 's not to love . I ca n't guarantee that you 'll like the flavor , but you wo n't know until you try .
 I have to say that I bought this protein due to so many good reviews on this site and others . I was taking Cytosport Complete Whey when I began reading the reviews . I had not worked out or taken a protein powder in years and was trying to get back into working out . Many people who liked Cytosport also like this protein and some were switching saying that it was more cost effective , etc. . It does have a good amount of protein , and it does n't have some of the cholesterol and other undesirables that Cytosport 's Whey has . It is cost-effective and relies more on isolate than concentrate as opposed to Cytosport 's whey . I got the vanilla bean when I bought the Cytosport and naturally gravitated toward the vanilla ice cream flavor of this one . I do n't really care for chocolate protein shakes . I will say that the Cytosport Whey tastes better especially when mixed with water . This one is hard to handle for me in just water . They both are great when mixed with milk -LRB- e.g. skim milk -RRB- . Having said that , Optimum Nutrition 's whey protein is probably the best for you ; however , I do not look forward to drinking it the way I did when I was on the Cytosport Complete Whey . I know now that they have another vanilla flavor and maybe I will try that one instead . But that 's just my opinion . In most of the reviews I have read , people have really liked the taste . Ultimately its your decision .
 This stuff has been a great help to working out . I 'm a skinny guy who has a hard time getting enough calories and protein in a day and this stuff has helped immensely .
 This stuff is delicious even with just water ! Have n't tried it in milk yet but I cant imagine it tasting better :D !!
 Taste amazingLots of itDamn scoop was in the middle of the can .
 Wo n't mention all the info others did . purchased for bulking . Was easy and quick to stir in or used in quick smoothies -LRB- or alone in water -- hey sometimes ya just hafta ! when in a hurry -RRB- . Did n't add a lot of increased bulk but my strength gains did increase quickly .
 I am very pleased with this product . As a vegetarian it is hard to get all the protein I need to body build . After about a month of using this , I have seen results that I like.I recommend it .
 I have lactose intolerance and many protein powders give me bloating but this protein powder works like a charm for me . No gas , no bloating , no real issues . Has a nice amino acid profile
 Extreme milk chocolate - Stronger taste , slightly clumpy , tastes amazing ! tastes very similar to ovaltine cold malt chocolate . By far favorite flavor mixed with milk.Double Rick Chocolate - dull taste , goes down easy . tastes pretty good .
 I have a very strong gag reflex and this is the one and only protein shake that I can drink and enjoy . The taste is really , really good . Not chalky , not funky sweet . I mix it up in those blender / shaker things with the wire ball . It blends SO well . A few vigorous shakes and it 's totally dissolved . I mix it with rice milk and love the taste . Thank you to all the other great reviews that attracted me to buy this product .
 Optimum Nutrition is one of the best product to use and affordable . I always stick to the Whey Gold Standard instead of Hydro Whey and Hydro Builder . I 'm not saying to buy those even though it 's expensive but if you know how to use the `` Standard '' then you will get great results.My routine use on this product is simple and make sure you remember because you forget after your workout . Here it is for me as a weight lifter :1 . I take two scoops of protein powder and 16oz of SILM milk -LRB- makes it two cup by measurement -RRB- ... yes slim milk if you want to tone up without the fat in the milk . Make sure you have a Blender bottle to mix perfectly .2 . When finishing workout make sure you drink the protein within a 30-minute window.So again ... buy this product today from Amazon today with a prime account because it 's better than the other store prices like `` GNC '' and `` Vitamin Shoppe '' . Stay Healthy
 For the past 4 years , I have purchased the Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard protein powered . Why ? Because it is an excellent deal -- approximately 85-90 $ -- it lasts for months and taste excellent when mixed with fruits and honey . I mainly use this product for morning meals and after-workout shakes and find that it is very filling and great for replacing a meal at night or a quick breakfast on the go . I highly recommend this product .
 Very good flavor and mixes well in theSundesa BB28-MC01 BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall , Blue . For my taste this is much better than theOptimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Double Rich Chocolate , 5 Poundwhen used with just water for mixing . TheOptimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Vanilla Ice Cream , 5 Poundalso tastes very good , very similar toOptimum Nutrition Platinum Hydro Whey , Velocity Vanilla , 3.5 Poundat about 1/2 the price .
 Hands down , the Optimum Nutrition Coffee flavor is the best tasting protein I have ever had . I do n't want to ramble about the positive points of ON Whey protein - if your drinking it , I 'm sure you 've done the research or read the thousands of other reviews.But , this was the first time I 've ordered this flavor . I mixed about two scoops with Vanilla flavored almond milk . Have you ever had one of those Mocha Starbucks frappuccino drinks in the glass bottles ? It tastes almost EXACTLY like it ! It is so delicious!HIGHLY recommended and I will definitely be reordering . Plus , Amazon 2-day shipping and price was better than almost every other site .
 Great taste !! I use this stuff mainly as a post-workout supplement , and sometimes in a morning protein shake . If I 'm watching calories , I mix it with good ole H2O , and it still has a good taste . If I 'm not watching calories , I mix it with nonfat milk , peanut butter , and bananas , and it 's absolutely incredible ! Try it !
 There are a few reasons this product stands out among whey protein powders . The main reason is because it 's actually whey protein . Other protein powders such as Gaspari Myofusion are n't actually protein , rather a protein blend . This is 100 % whey , which definitely makes it authentic and pure . Another reason is the amount of servings you get for the price . For every flavor there are at least 70 servings for the 5 lbs . Other top protein powders such as Syntha 6 and Gaspari Myofusion have less than 60 for 5lbs . 10 + servings is a huge difference when it comes to protein powders . Add in the fact that the price is the same or less than the others gives this a huge advantage . The best protein powder if you are trying to lose weight without losing muscle or gain weight and muscle . It does n't contain a lot of carbs or fat either .
 EVERYTHING IS JUST 100 % PERFECT BUT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE HARD TO FIGURE A WAY OUT TO OPEN THE `` BAG `` ANY WAYS THAT 'S NOT A PROBLEM LOL AND YEA LOVE THE FLAVOR
 I bought the Rocky Road and it really tastes good ! I am super picky about taste , but I enjoy this . I just mix with milk , but would probably enjoy more if I blended it with ice .
 great product if you are into workouts and building muscle or even losing weight . 24g of protein , 5.5 g BCAA all in one small serving is valuable for the $ 46 price tag found in amazon.com and free shipping beats GNC and other supplement shops . So far i have only tried the vanilla ice cream and strawberry flavor -LRB- strawberry is banging ! -RRB- and i must say they both taste great , i bet the other flavors are just as tasty , so many to choose from . Blends well with water and can be used to mix with other food like oats , fruits etc. . I take 2 scoops a day -LRB- 1 scoop while at work and another with creatine after working out -RRB- remember that this is a `` supplement '' do not replace your regular high protein meals with shakes , use it with 4 or 5 daily meals and you will get gains !
 I have tried many whey protein products , and this is the best combination of nutritional content -LRB- not many carbs -RRB- , great taste , and a reasonable price . I use a heaping scoop on top of yogurt every morning , but it is also easy to shake into a beverage . Chocolate Malt is my favorite flavor , but Double Rich Chocolate and Vanilla Ice cream are not bad either . -LRB- Stay away from the banana !! -RRB-
 It is extremely hard for me to put on weight I have an extremely fast metabolism , I eat in my lunch at work and about 20 minutes after I have to go . TMI , but thats how extreme It is . Anyway this stuff helps me a lot and its delicious I take two scoops at night before bed with cold milk , its the best shake ever . At first it was kinda hard getting used to the taste , but after a hard working out session this is what your muscles are starving for . Highly recommend this stuff . And it is cheaper than at GNc . It is not magic though , I work out 4 or 5 times a week and do heavy lifting and I am starting to see results , if you are a hard gainer like me this will greatly help along with a good diet and lifting sessions .
 el producto es muy bueno , un suplemento para subir de masa muscular y aumentar la energia en el entrenamiento . hay que usarlo despues del ejercicio
 If you 're going to use a protein powder this is the one to buy . The container is ridiculously large but the value & flavor are there .
 Pros : Delicious -LRB- I 've only tried extreme milk chocolate -RRB- Easy to mixDoes n't cause stomach crampsOver the past couple of years I have tried many types of protein powders from EAS , Muscle Milk , and other ones that I do n't even remember the name that were on sale . This by far is the best tasting , less filling , and easiest to mix out of every other protein I 've tried . I hate when other proteins give me stomach cramps because it feels like I just ate 5 plate at a super buffet and they do n't even have nearly as many grams of protein in them . Other proteins are hard to mix and get chunky and lumpy at the bottom but this powder is so fine that it is as smooth as milk.As I said I 've tried many protein brands in the past couple of years and usually I am open to try something new and I get bored with my current protein . I used to not stay with the same protein for more than a few months but I 've been on this protein for about 6 months and I do n't plan on changing for a long time . I did recently switch to the natural version of this protein because it is only a couple of dollars more . I am going to start using other proteins in my diet like casein and hydrobuilder ; I am not going with any other brand than ON !
 gooooooooood a + fast shipping.purchased for my neighbor with a blender bottle and it came quickly , dissolved well , and is very healthy .
 Ive had tons of those pre made protein shakes etc and they always taste like S *** !! So I was so of skeptical to spend the money on this and it taste disgusting . I ordered the double chocolate one . And Right when you open it it smells like chocolate so I was like ok Ill try it . I make mine in a shaker bottle . Put in 1 scoop and fill the shaker cup up half way and shake and drink . It tastes like cold hot chocolate . I was so surprised . It makes drinking 2-3 protein shakes a day a nice treat . Cant wait to try the other flavors .
 Chocolate Mint
 Optimum Nutrition Whey Gold Standard is always my go to for protein however I wanted to switch it up with the flavor and I could n't resist trying Cake Batter . This protein flavor does cost more than others but it 's very tasty ! I do mix other things with my drink so sometimes I completely block out the flavor . Next time I will purchase the normal go to and cheaper option , French Vanilla . Cake Batter is good for a switch up .
 I figured most of you probably know the benefits ON 's whey protein , and probably have done the research and read reviews on body building sites , so I wo n't talk about the protein itself . I 'll review the flavors I have tried.Vanilla - 4/5
 Great taste , mixes great with everything . Taste amazing with water . I mix it with cherios with yogurt with pretty much anything and it taste amazing . grind it with some ice and water and u got urself a cold coffee lol .
 This is an easy to mix protein powder . I mix it in skim milk and it does not clump up like other protein products , it blends into the milk . It taste good in skim milk but taste great in whole milk . it comes with a spoon inside the container . Also the sodium level is 130 not 60 as listed in the description .
 This is a really good product , particularly for the price you get it at from Amazon . 24grams of protein in only 120 calories is a about as good as you can get and the taste is better than most other protein powders . Which is n't to say that it tastes great , but it does taste better .
 I used to buy the bargain brand whey for 30 bucks a 5 pound bag . It tasted bad , did n't mix well , and had shady ratings on review sites . Here , ON continues to impress with their high standards , great taste , and excellent nutritional content . This flavor beats out all of their other vanilla flavors . This , along with their double chocolate , will likely be the new staple protein powder in my diet as a college club athlete .
 does n't even taste like you 're drinking protein ... . so delicious ! esp with fat free milk ! yummy!totally worth every penny . do n't ever stop making this flavor cuz i wo n't know what to drink next .
 Mixing incredibly easy , tastes fine and is very high quality protien . I will be buying again soon . Best I 've found for the cost/quality ratio .
 powder mixes well , especially with a shaker . I like it as a smoothie base for lunch or breakfast . Good value for your money . No diet excuses when it 's delivered right to your door!Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Double Rich Chocolate , 5 Pound
 Third time I 've ordered this ten pound bag , protein is great but this time the bag came to me with a hole . The hole is n't huge but just big enough for powder to leak out if you 're not careful .
 This tastes really good , but I like it when it is made with milk better than water . This doesnt mix as well as I 'd like so I use a mixer cup .
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard Cake Batter is a pretty good product . I prefer Optimum Nutrition 's Hydro Whey . But I thought I 'd give this version a try . I mix my proteins with water and this product dissolves very well , even in cold water . I have n't had any gassy after-effects or bad aftertastes either . As for the flavor , I do n't quite think it tastes like a cake batter -LRB- maybe it does with milk ??? -RRB- . I think it actually tastes like watered-down condensed milk ... or kinda like those chewy Japanese Milky candies , if you 've ever had one of those . I 'd recommend it if asked .
 I 've tried a few protein powders over the course of 10 years , slowly loosing weight , always had the same problem after the workout . I 'd had enough of the ` the runs ' and threw in with Optimum . The difference was night and day , not only dose it fend off ` the shakes ' , but the next day I was far less sore , plus one other perk , it actually tastes good.I 'll never go back to the cheap Wal-mart crap again , my friends ... this is it !
 By far the BEST protein out there ! It dissolves completely ! I have had my range of protein products and this one takes the cake ! It tastes delicious without over powering you , there are no protein chunks , and you can definitely see the results ! I take 1-2 scoops a day after a work-out and I love it ! I just bought a 5lb bottle because I go through it like crazy ! I have never had a protein shake like this one ! After my college suite-mates tried 100 % Whey Gold Standard , they all decided to switch from theirs to mine ! . A + and a definitely recommendation !
 it was a great deal and a great product give it a try not the best taste but people do say `` if it does not taste good its good for you '' and i feel like im geting good results with this product fast recovery after my workout
 Optimum nutrition is # 1 for a reason . I 've tried all their flavors , all of them are great , but this is by far my favorite
 I couldnt be happier and I will buy again . The whey settles well and doesnt clump . also , for the price ill have enough whey for an entire quarter at school and thats wonderful
 They used to have the single one time buy for under 40 but now you can only get that price if you subscribe to a monthly mailing of it . I do n't like that because I do n't necessarily go through that much of this powder . Not sure if you can subscribe , get the subscription price mailed once , then cancel before your next arrival.Otherwise , it 's a great protein powder . Taste is good and not too sweet . Double chocolate is the best .
 I repeatedly buy this product for my grandparents who ca n't take solid foods consistently and need something that is filling and energizing . This Whey is the best we 've bought out of the many we 've tried . It stirs in easy , no clumping ; it tastes really good and consistent ; and it 's not overly sweet . I recommend this if you need a solid meal replacement for old people in your family .
 I have tried a lot of different types of protein on the market and I always get disappointed and come back to this stuff . You know why ? Because it taste great , has what I need to throw around the iron , and is one of the best proteins out there . It mixes very easily . I tend to mix a little water in it . Does n't have a nasty after taste like many products out there . Very smooth . When I first tried this flavor way back , I thought it was simply a spin off of the Vanilla flavor but it really is more like cake batter when you get a few sips into it . Throw some milk in it for a truly amazing taste . I 'm on the run and just use water . If a protein tastes great just mixing it with water , has the best ingredients , and is produced by one of the best companies out there , then you know it is worth buying . Do n't get fooled by XYZ 's new ad for the newest protein on the market . Just go with this . You will love it .
 I 've been using whey protein for a few months and have noticed some positive gains in muscle mass . I originally used another brand but with so many people giving positive reviews here and on youtube , I decided to buy Optimum Nutrition 's Whey Protein Gold Standard and I really like it . The flavor I chose was Extreme Milk Chocolate thanks in large part to another reviewer who said it was the best of the chocolate flavors and he 's so right . It tastes a lot like Nestle 's Quik and I really like that . I use 1 scoop for breakfast and blend it with milk , 1 banana and some low fat plain yogurt for a nutritious smoothie . Then I go jogging 1 hour after breakfast and in the afternoon I work out and lift weights and for my post workout meal I make the exact same shake once again . I really prefer ON 's Gold Standard Whey Protein because it 's a trusted brand I trust , the shipping is free on Amazon -LRB- and no tax , woohoo ! -RRB- and because it plain and simply works.I purchased the 5 lb tub and will definitely buy another one after it finishes . Tastes good and works . ` Nuff said .
 I really like this brand of whey powder . The extreme milk choc . flavor is great , and there 's very little dust when scooping it .
 I found this product to be excellent . With a mixture of chipped ice and Almond milk it is a refreshing nutrional frostie for an afternoon snack .
 I love this stuff ! I originally bought the Strawberry , which is good but gets quite old fast . I personally added Truvia to mine because I liked it a bit sweeter . But this time I ordered the milk chocolate to try something new and IT 'S DELICIOUS ! I do n't even have to add any sweetener!Also , you are n't going to find a better deal for 5 lbs of whey , especially with the subscribe and save option . Even on bodybuilding.com .
 purchased this on the recommendation of a friend , word of mouth . very happy overall.tastes fine . as others have said , it 's better in milk , but i 've also sprinkled half portions into a fruit smoothie from time to time and that 's delicious too . it is n't always easy to mix in with a spoon , unless you do it a 1/2 portion at a time.very filling - i use as a meal replacement -LRB- often breakfast or dinner right after a run and workout -RRB- , and am rarely hungry for 3-6 hours afterwards.oh , you might have to dig a little into the mixture to find the serving cup the first time you open this.i 'll be getting this again when i run out .
 I 've been using Optimum Nutrition -LRB- ON -RRB- whey protein for years and I was really excited to find it on Amazon.com & for subscription . I 've tried many different types of whey over the years and found nothing even remotely comparable to ON 's whey.Pro 's : Taste - I love almost all of the different flavors I 've tried -LRB- bunch of different chocolates , vanillas , strawberry , etc -RRB- with Extreme Milk Chocolate being my favorite . Whether mixed with milk or water it tastes like you 're drinking a milkshake . You have to choke down some of the other proteins but ON is a joy to drink . The only flavor I 've tried and did n't like is the Rocky Road but that was still better other brands I 've tried.Mixability - an actual word and not something I just made up . ON mixes flawlessly with milk or water in just a simple shaker bottle . You can use a glass and a spoon but it takes longer and it does n't mix quite as well as shaker . Some other brands I 've used basically require a blender unless you like drinking solid chunks of protein paste.Nutrition - They can advertise this stuff better than I can but they have a high amount of protein per serving and loads of BCAA . When I researched whey protein supplements I looked at grams of protein per dollar spent and ON topped the list.Con 's : Price - You get what you pay for and ON is more expensive than some of the other brands . It 's well worth the money in my opinion or I would n't be writing this review . Also , with Amazon.com 's normally low prices and the subscription cutting another 15 % off it 's hard to even consider price a problem .
 I have had AMAZING results with this product . I 've always had trouble gaining muscle , but this stuff made it easy . The best flavor I tried was plain vanilla , as it tasted the least artificial . Highly recommended !!
 I 've used this same product for about a year now and am really happy with the quality . I felt sick at first drinking this because I guess my body was n't used to it , now it 's part of my daily diet . It helps especially when I 'm strength training particularly hard . I have n't compared it to many other products but the ones I have also claim to be the best which do n't come close to this . I think I really like the fact that I get everything I need in quanity while maintaining quality and ontop of that I get my chocolate fix ! mmm chocolate
 It might be little expensive on Amazon as most things are . However , I am completely satisfied with the product as it was pretty consistent and better than the previous whey product I had bought from GNC or one of the stores .
 this product arrived in good time at it is the same as the product i ususally bought it arrived sooner than i expected .
 Mixes well , tastes great and is great for you . Casein protein from animal products are harmful for you body . 100 % whey protein is very beneficial and this deal was a steal . $ 98 for 10 pounds of this . Ca n't ask for a better deal .
 the protein is great but when i got this the bag had a hole in it and some of the powder spilled out into the box . luckily i had some empty protein jugs laying around so i just filled them up . amazon really needs to be more careful with the way they package stuff
 This has been the best protein I 've tried by far . The flavors are -LRB- mostly -RRB- fantastic , the profile is spot on , and it 's one of the few that does n't taste bad when mixed with plain water . My only complaint would be consistency , about 10 % of the time I get tubs that are `` clumpier '' and have some trouble mixing in a blender bottle although a quick hit with a wand blender takes care of those rare orders . It 's also one of the few proteins I 've found I can drink during training without getting a heavy or bloated feeling . Mix in a little peanut butter or maybe some berries and banana and you also get a good meal replacement shake .
 This protein is the best I have ever tried . It mixes well with water and a few shakes . The Double Rich Chocolate has a great taste -LRB- and I hate chocolate -RRB- . I 've seen some impressive gains using this . I 'm sure there might be other proteins that are great but my search is over as I have founds my favorite .
 I bought this just recently and used it only once or twice , but the effects were significantly noticeable right off the bat . I usually forgo eating dinner then jog , followed by a light workout -LRB- pushup , pullups , situps , etc -RRB- , and it kept me going even after I usually stop . So much so that even though my muscles were exhausted , my energy was still going strong and I wanted to keep going only after a short break . What was really amazing was that , I was not sore the following day ! The flavor is not too bad . It almost takes like watered down Yoohoo , but not as sweet . There are tons of smoothie recipes online so taste wo n't be too much of a problem.But enough about the product , I want to commend Amazon for their great service in this review and feedback . . I wo n't get into the specifics but Amazon went above and beyond with their customer service and gained my loyalty for life . If every company had such outstanding service as Amazon displayed with me , then Consumer Affairs would be out of business .
 I have searched for this on other sites and find that you can get a lower price , but then the shipping fees are rediculous . This is the best price including the shipping.As for the product , great flavor , disolves well . Just what I want .
 I just wan na clarify some points : I received the new presentation style , which is great.Shipping was fast.Product came in New condition -LRB- you know , great shape -RRB- I am really happy with this transaction . I knew the product beforehand and I have to say is great , the taste of the product is awesome . I believe that a better tasting protein keeps me motivated to tear myself at any workout , so it helps somewhat.Just my 2 cents .
 The taste is much better than any protein powder I 've tried so far . I totally recommend this!The only reason I give it a 4 is because it remains clumpy after stirring like 10 million times . I should try a shaker ...
 This is the best protein on the market ! Also , if you buy the 10 lb bags online you can save a ton of money rather than going to GNC and paying outrageous prices for half as much .
 For those who are complaining about the taste , crush up some midol , and take with that , it will taste better . Come on , it 's a protein powder , it taste better than most on the market right now.As when to take it
 I would agree with other posts that this does n't taste good , I also agree with other posts that this tastes good . Here is the thing , it is by far the best tasting protein powder I have ever tasted , but compared to a real milk shake it sucks , but what do you expect ?? I would describe the taste as a cold/watered down instant cocoa mix . Not something I crave , but nothing like the other think chocky mixes on the market .
 I 've been lifting weights for 19 years now and have tried almost every protein powder out there , and ON 's 100 % Whey Protein is the best , hands down ! I 've been a customer for 10 years now . Best in taste , best in protein content , and best in mixing ! I do n't think it 's the cheapest protein powder out there , but I know it 's not the most expensive either . Still a great deal for what you get ! Buy it , you wo n't regret it .
 First off ON gold standard protein is the best on the market . Hands down . You wo n't find another brand out there offering its protein packed with BCAAs and almost 5g of glutamine . Sure it costs a bit more , but when you consider quality , the cost/benefit ratio of ON gold standard FAR outweighs competitors . Plus they 're low cal , low sugar , low fat . Just amazing.Taste
 At 34 $ shipped -LRB- subscription -RRB- , this is the cheapest source of a good protein ! Taste is good , Price is good , protein is good = life is good .
 This is the best protein I have ever had . I dont eat meat and this is the best thing to boost my body as i do all kinds of sports and i also lift . It doesnt taste bad at all , you can definitely drink it without a chaser if you shake it long enough .
 I bought this for my brother and he stated that it tasted delicious when stirred in water or milk . Previously we bought the strawberry flavor and there was nothing wrong with that but this by far exceeds that in taste . Highly Recommended .
 It took me a while but I finally found a protein shake that is not only bearable to drink but delicious ! I take a scoop after every workout & can definitely see & feel the results . Highly recommended !
 I love this product ! I have a shake after every workout to replenish and fuel my metabolism . Also have a shake at night to help rebuild muscle . This shake mix tastes great and blends with everything . Havnt had a bad flavor yet .
 I bought this product because I wanted to increase my daily protein intake not because I wanted huge muscles . lol . I mix this with water and I find that it mixes very well with just a spoon and it 's DELICIOUS ! I always look forward to drinking this and I ca n't wait to try other flavors .
 This protein has good flavor and is supposedly all natural . I wish it was still on the subscribe and save . I guess so many bodybuilders subscribe and optimum nutrition is losing out on the bottom line . Oh well switched to twinlab , which is only $ 29 for 5lb after subscribe and save .
 Been using this brand for years and so far this is the best flavor i 've tried . Not sure if it 's worth the preium price though .
 It is big enought for one month and two kids -LRB- one junior and the other senior -RRB- . Excellent investment and excellent size .
 Here 's the best combination drink to consume during P90X strength exercises . I found and tried this formula today , and there is nothing tastier and better to support your muscles strength :1 . - 2 measurement caps ofOptimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Double Rich Chocolate , 5 Pound - 1 measurement cap of Perpetuem Sports Drink Mix by Hammer Nutrition2 . Mix it into 12-16 fl . oz water bottle -LSB- ... -RSB- 3 . Drink and enjoy .
 I 've been using ON Gold Standard Whey Protein for about 3 years now , and I love it , it always helps to speed up recovery time which is very useful . The Rocky Road flavor was pretty good mixed with milk and bland with Water . I also recently ordered the French Vanilla flavor which is a standout , definitely my favorite so far . All in all I will continue to use this as I 've been using it for years with no side effects except great gains , growth and increased recovery time .
 Although this is the first whey protein powder I have tried , it seems to be of fairly high quality , from the description and the very helpful reviews of the other customers who bought this product . I do n't think anybody would be buying this product with the intention of buying the best chocolate mix ; they would be getting it for its protein offering which is very good . It is `` instantized '' powder , so should dissolve easily in skim water or milk + water combination . I will say that it is better you have a shake cup which makes mixing far more easier and faster than trying to stir with a spoon .
 Dissolves well in water . Seems to be giving me the mass I need -LRB- using it to get a total of 1.5 grams protein/per gram of body weight -RRB- . I got 5 lbs for about $ 50 , great value .
 this protien powder tastes good and can last a long time . if you use the cup they give you and take a cup a day it lasts about 4 months . i do n't know how effective it is in building muscle / gaining weight . i consumed 2 tubs over a 8 month period combined with lifting weights and did not see any significant changes . i stopped taking this because i did not feel it was worth the money . if you eat a balanced diet you should already be getting enough protien and should not need supplements . if you can afford it it would not hurt to try it but keep in mind it might just be an expensive chocolate drink .
 I have been using ON Whey for about 2 years now - and my opinion on this is remains the same throughout that time
 This protein is very high-quality . It tastes great - like Muscle Milk , but with much less fat and few carbs . Also , it is packed with BCAA 's and glutamine . I highly recommend this product .
 this is a pretty good thing if u are trying to get big or muscular . it doesnt have too many calories and it is easily digestable .
 In bodybuilding you need to keep nutrition in your system constantly . I put three tablespoons into a mini 20oz Blender Bottle and fill with non-fat milk to go with breakfast , lunch , dinner , and sometimes when I just feel hungry . The stuff actually taste great , too !
 This product is delicious and nutritious ; I got the double chocolate flavor . I give it 16/16 boners .
 This product arrived fast and was a great price . It dissolves fast and actually tastes good too .
 Been a longtime user of this item ... . probably about 6 + years.I 've tasted/tested/sampled every Chocolate whey protein powder product out there and this -LRB- Optimum Nutrition 's Double Rich Chocolate -RRB- is by far the best tasting and mixes well with oatmeal or water . There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste like other protein powders . I have n't tried the other flavors as I 'm a Chocolateholic .
 This is good protein for the money . The taste is a little bland -LRB- I 've had better -RRB- , but it gets the job done .
 After i started taking this protein I feel much better after workouts . This is because after i bought this i am taking twice the amount of protein I was taking before.I am giving this one 5 stars because i do feel the difference when I start taking the whey protein from ultimate nutrition , which i understand is supposed to be very good too . I still have some left but I will stick to ON 's whey protein because it has a good price and I definitely see results when i taking it .
 The taste is a little funny , but it 's fine if you doctor it up with some cinnamon and frozen blueberries or whatever you like . Not great with plain water . It does mix really well , even in a shaker ; this makes it great for travel . I noticed an increase an muscle mass almost right away after switching to this brand . It 's also very digestible . I 'm still on my first jar , but am very happy with this product so far !
 I HAD HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PRODUCT THAT I JUST WANTED TO BUY IT , SEE THAT IT TASTED LIKE CRAP LIKE THE OTHER `` HYPED '' PROTEIN PRODUCTS , AND WRITE A BAD REVIEW , BOY , WAS I SURPRISED , NOT ONLY WAS THE TASTE BEARABLE BUT IT WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD , I COULD REALLY DRINK THIS STUFF EVERY DAY , -LRB- I HAVE FOR THE LAST 30 DAYS AND STILL LOVE THE TASTE -RRB- , THIS COMPANY HAS FINALLY DEVELOPED A PROTEIN PRODUCT THAT YOU CAN DRINK WITHOUT GAGGING . I MAKE A GALLON OF IT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK AND DRINK IT AS A IN BETWEEN SNACK AS WELL AS BEFORE AND AFTER WORKOUTS , I LOVE TO PUT IT IN MY CEREAL . I ONLY DRINK SOY MILK ANYWAY WHICH HAS 6 GRAMS OF PROTEIN ANYWAY SO ALONG WITH GOLD STANDARD I AM DRINKING ABOUT 35 TO 40 GRAMS OF PROTEIN AT A TIME , CANT SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THIS STUFF , WILL BE BUYING MORE ...
 I just started recently to weight lift , so I decided to give whey protein a shot . I did a bit of research and ended up with this . Overall its pretty good , does n't smell too bad , and tastes pretty good . I was actually surprised on how good it tasted , most things I read were about how whey protein tasted bad -LRB- well most of it -RRB- , but this is good .
 Great timing . Ordered on dec. 24th before christmas and it arrived quickly by the 29th . I was surprised as I do n't expect packages to come quickly during the holidays . Also - Came right before my last batch of whey was finished - Now I can continue to bulk during the new year = -RSB- Thanks herballoveshop .
 The container is like the size of a 55 gallon drum , hence the price . You get a lot of mix . Taste pretty good for a protein shake .
 Ships fast . Nothing to complain about . Just good.Enough qty for one person , 3 times per week work out for 2 month .
 outside of the fact that the mint flavor is a bit odd . -LRB- Vitamin shops is better tasting !!! -RRB- its a great supplement that mixes easily ... plus nothing beats shopping at Amazon !!!!!!
 I bought the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100 % Whey , Double Rich Chocolate , 5.15-Pound Tub and found the value of this product very good compared to many other retailers . I used this product for about a month -LRB- 3x daily -RRB- , using it to supplement my regular diet and workouts throughout the week . I have gained 3-4 Ibs . in that time period . I was expecting better results with this product . Here is my disclaimer however , I weight trained -LRB- 6x/week -RRB- during the entire course of taking this product but did not incorporate any cardio workouts to supplement my weight training . This may have had an impact on weight gained -LRB- cardio work is an important aspect of weight training due to the loss of fat that occurs from it -RRB- . I was hoping to add more healthy weight than just 3-4 Ibs . But please take into consideration your body type , everyone is unique and each person must evaluate his/her make-up when it comes to weight training , cardio work , and weight gain/loss .
 I put like 1 and a half scoops in a glass of milk and it tastes good . This product is very helpful for my protein needs . I 'm just a little worried about all that aspartame and artificial sweeteners . I 'd gladly drink it without that stuff even if it tasted bad because if you have the discipline to work hard you should have it for eating healthy .
 Love it ! It mixes well , tastes great , and is an easy way to add more protein into your diet . Even my kids love the taste of this stuff !
 This product has a wonderful soft creamy texture and flavor . I like it so much better than similiar products I have purchased from local health food and retail stores .
 I have tried lots of protein powders . I get online the low-carb , low-calorie protein powders as I am just trying to put on muscle and it is hard to find one that you can stomach . I was stuck on Champions Whey -LRB- Chocolate -RRB- for the past year as the best but I just got my shipment of the Gold Standard - Cookies & Cream and it is AMAZING ! I love this stuff . I tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was tremendous . I am going to have this before and after my daily workout , but best yet , rather than binging on any ice cream desires late at night , I am going to get a scoop of fat free frozen vanilla yogurt , put a scoop of this in with some fat free milk and I have my fat free protein shake !
 Optimum Nutrition 's 100 % whey protein is hands down the best I have tried , and I have tried a lot of different shake products in the past 10 years . I used to be committed to EAS and Labrada , but I found that the shakes are too hard for me to digest compared to ON Whey Protein.I mix it with water , and sometimes soy milk . It mixes easy , does n't taste gritty , and is pure protein . It goes down very easy and I have no trouble digesting it , plus it builds muscle when combined with a solid workout plan . Plus , the price is reasonable .
 I am a former General Nutrition Center employee and there are hundreds of `` powdered '' protein products that `` hype '' about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out . if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick , bloated or passing gas , then you need to trust in Optimum Nutritions 100 % Whey Protein . It truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes.I strongly recommend 2 % milk over water for even better taste , but water will still do the trick . If you buy Vanilla , i suggest mixing it with berries , bananas , strawberries , or bananas for added taste.this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is worth more for your money !
 This stuff tastes alright , but unless you work out constantly , you 'll gain weight too . Be sure to use fat free milk to really gain the benifit , i suggest Sunmilk to mix with . Aside from that , a weight lifter will really gain the benifit , and enjoy the great flavor . I also hear its good for nursing mothers ... . check with your doctor .
 My husband and I have been using this brand for three years - primarily by adding it to our morning shakes . It is a little on the sweet side but it makes a nice additive to plain yogurt . Also , since I 've been pregnant I 've been adding to my non-fat milk and cereal to help regulate those hormone-related blood sugar spikes .
 The first thing I want to say is that if you 're mixing the product with just water and you expect it to taste great , then you are a fool . It 's not hot coco , its a protien shake . BE REALISTIC!Personally I mix mine with a scoop of frozen yogurt -LRB- usually plain chocolate -RRB- and a cup of fat-free milk . I use a blender for about 30-40 seconds and it mixes and tastes great . YES , this does add a little sugar , a little fat and a few calories ... get over yourself , its not that big of a deal . If you are really working out enough to be using this product to begin with then the few extra calories are not going to hurt you.My only other comment is that from what I understand the `` Double Rich Chocolate '' flavor is the only one that does not use splenda or one of the other major artificial sweeteners . I think that 's a plus , unless there is something else they are using that I missed.Overall , I think it 's a good product and I will continue to use it .
 I have toyed with a number protein shake flavors over the span of ten years , and have finally found one that I actually enjoy . Vanilla Ice Cream actually tastes like ... vanilla ice cream . No bad after taste . Tastes fine with water , even better with milk .
 Some reviews out there about this product contain some pretty inaccurate information ... The study done on its carcinogenicity was a dose depended study on multiple rodents , all of which received dosages which would FAR exceed ANY human intake from using this protein or any artificial sweetener ... and no increased rate of tumor incidence was detected even at these astronomical dosages -LRB- up to 3 % of the rats diet was based on Acesulfame potassium . In addition , while the studies done did prove in rodents increased insulin production -LRB- minute levels , again dose dependent -RRB- , no hypoglycemia was recorded.Are you planning on consuming 2 pounds of this product a day ? Is that the reason for your concern ? IMO great product ... My two sources -LRB- or just search on PubMed ... -RRB-
 I 'm not a body builder or even a habitual exerciser . I actually bought this product after reading an article about how whey protein can help you lose weight . I 've been dieting for about two months now in an attempt to lose 20 pounds , and only managed to lose 5 . But things have gotten a lot better since I 've started using this product . It 's definitely been helping me control my appetite . I mix it into my oatmeal in the morning and have a small snack before lunch , and find myself only eating a portion of my lunch and leaving the rest behind . I also drink a shake about an hour before dinner and , again , I 'm leaving most of my dinner on the plate . This is a huge improvement for me . Normally , I 'm hungry all the time and never feel full . But now , I hardly ever feel the hunger that I used to . I 'm simply eating to fuel my body now . And I 've lost 12 pounds in 2 weeks ! Nice!Oh , and I bought the vanilla flavor so that I could mix it into a lot of different things . The flavor is ok when mixed with skim milk as a shake , but horrible if it 's just mixed with water . Decent in oatmeal . Have n't tried mixing it with anything else yet . I 'm going to buy another flavor now just so that I can create a little variety .
 This is no Burger King chocolate shake , but it tastes good , probably better than most proteins out there . It has worked for me so far . There are some cheaper ones out there but not by much . I 'd rather pay the extra couple of bucks and stick to this one . It goes down easy on my stomach and I have seen the difference in my body .
 The is a great protein . However , their costs have gone up substantially over the last couple years , as with many other whey protein brands . After purchasing it , I actually found a site that sells it for $ 8 cheaper and lets you choose from all of their flavors .
 Looking for a great deal on a great protein powder ? Found it ! This is easy to drink after a workout , tastes great , and provides a good amount of protein for the taste and the price . I 'm not a chocolate lover , but this is smooth and easy to drink .
 I like the taste . I mix a half gallon of water at a time up with it . I use aGreen Birdseed Funnelto fill a one gallon milk bottle . Shake and serve .
 It was a little expensive at the time of purchase and needs to be mixed well in milk to prevent clumps . Otherwise , its a good product .
 I really liked the strawberry taste . Would recommend it to others as well . Something diff from Usual Chocolate flavors
 no , it is not . but , great when you do n't feel like eating a full meal or when you are in a hurry . good snack . quick . goes down easy . provides nutrition for your muscles .
 This is exactly what I was looking for and tastes great.I usually mix 1 scoop of this and 1 scoop of ON Pro Complex Vanilla after a workout and tastes great .
 My husband is using this and he really enjoys it ! It came on time and with no problems ! Thanks ~ !
 I just got my whey protein by ON , the delivery was really fast ; I ordered on Sunday afternoon and I received package on Tuesday.I ordered the strawberry flavor , not bad at all , tastes pretty good especially when combined with milk . I have also tried the double rich chocolate from my cousin ; taste is good as well . I guess what I am trying to say is that the taste is not horrible at all as many of the other people had stated.Since this is my first time trying this product , I really can not comment in the effects it has on building muscle . I really wish people had focused on that rather than the flavor , so if you recently bought this product and know its benefits , please tells us , but only if you have seen a change in your body.A month from now , if things work -LRB- i.e. I see results -RRB- , I will be buying another tube and writing another review
 ON 's Extreme Chocolate protein has been a nice change to my protein protocol . Though ON is not the best quality and best tasting protein I have ever had it is definitely a good supplement to take and the price can not be beat . The Extreme Chocolate by itself -LRB- with milk or water -RRB- is definitely very chalky . If I add a fruit and some natural peanut butter , the taste is superb.Overall , I am happy with this product .
 I used to plug `` 5 lb . whey '' into google and just buy whatever came up as cheapest . But after stumbling upon this one recently , it 's definitely my go-to from now on .1 . Ease of mixing . You truly do n't need a shaker ; this mixes extremely well with a spoon and a glass of water/milk . No leftover globs like most proteins that wo n't mix up no matter how hard you stir .2 . Easy on your digestive system . I usually drink about 4 shakes a day , and I do n't have ANY digestive problems . The last protein I tried literally gave me constant gas . No gastrointestinal problems here whatsoever . big plus .3 . Taste . I like to drink mine with water and the taste is fine . Often I 'll get sick of one brand and have to switch to another , but so far so good with Optimum .4 . Value . There are 77 servings in the 5-lb tub . No tricks like making it take 2-3 huge scoops of the power to make 1 serving . One scoop = 1 serving = 24 grams of protein.Hope this is helpful - I do n't usually bother with reviews but really liked this product . The only negative I 've seen is the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners , but that does n't bother me . Only 1g of fat and 1g of sugar per serving ... that 's basically negligible , and an acceptable trade-off for the taste .
 100 % whey protein gold standard is a very good tasting protein . It does have artificial sweeteners in it so beware . It mixes well with milk . I use a small hand held mixer and it leaves no clumps . The taste is pretty good . I usually stay away from artificial sweeteners so I am able to taste them in these . They need to make more natural product like 100 % natural whey by optimum nutrition . It is disappointing that Amazon no longer has the subscribe and save for the natural whey so I had to settle for this product .
 Bought this through Amazon some couple of weeks back . It 's a big tub -- bigger than I thought it would be . There 's a scooper cup inside the tub but it 's buried underneath all the whey . You 'll have to use a spoon to dig it out.Since I have never tried any other brand of whey protein , I ca n't speak for the quality relative to those other brands but I can say that when I first bought it , I thought it was going to taste like crap . Reading various horror stories of whey protein powders that ranged from tasteless and bland to downright nasty from various health forums scared me a bit but some people claimed that this brand was n't bad relative to others . So I took a dive in and hoped for the best . I was pleasantly surprised . It was n't that bad . In fact , it 's pretty good for what it is.I bought the double rich chocolate because I like chocolate and well , this powder comes pretty damn close to eating a Hershey 's chocolate bar except in a liquid form.I do suggest buying a shaker cup as this does n't mix very well with just a spoon . It 'll clump up using a spoon . It 's not a bad thing , if you do n't mind melted clumps of whey protein . Frankly , I do n't care one way or the other but if you 're trying to down this in under 10 seconds , you 're going to have a bit of difficulty . It 's still drinkable , do n't get me wrong , and the taste is still the same but if you prefer to chug it like water , shaking it in a shaker cup will make it a lot easier to drink if you 're in a hurry.It does contain sucralose and cocoa powder , so if you 're concerned about that , I 'd suggesting looking elsewhere but personally , I 'm not terribly concerned about that and I do n't think you should be too concerned about that either unless you 're just one of those health nuts.All in all , I recommend this brand for its taste to price and value . I think it 's worth it .
 It tastes good with sugar and I have n't had any side effects . At least not that I know of . The only problem is that over time the powder gets harder to mix completely with hot water . They 'll be a few chunks of undissolved powder floating around your cup of whey . A blender or some sort of mixer can be used obviously to overcome this . Also check the cholesterol levels on this one , it 's comparatively high .
 does what its suppose to do ... supply you with protein.taste is nowhere near the quality of syntha 6 or even dymatize , but it will do.fewer calories than most as well .
 I like ON whey protein . It 's low on carbs , fat , sugars and high on Protein . I do n't recommend strawberry flavor , it tastes like medicine . The mixer or bottle stinks after a while if you leave it to get dried without washing .
 Best whey protein in the market in this price segment . Tastes great , easily digestible , I can see the results in just 2 weeks . Do n't forget to exercise properly when you take this product .
 Many other protein products wreak all sorts of havoc on my digestive system , but this product is largely `` invisible '' to me in those terms . However , it is very effective in enabling lean muscle health and increasing mass , assuming you put in the work . I hightly recommend this product .
 I was surprised that protein powder is delicious.I think Coffee flavor is the best one.Try this one . you will like it .
 This is a really good source of protein . I did not like cookies and cream flavor though . It did n't taste like cookies and cream at all but it could have been worse .
 Only way to get it mixed well is in a blender . I use a shaker with a bleding ball and still get chunks . Only ON product this happens with
 This protein powder is actually quite delicious ! I have tried a few other brands and they were just so hard to even swallow , but not this one . Tastes great even just mixed with water . I am pleased and definitely would reccommend & buy again !
 This protein actually tastes good , and does n't make you get that extra full/bloated feeling . Bought the Banana and Chocolate , and both taste good !
 This protein is probably the best out there . There is n't anything bad in here , not too much sugar and it 's a great way to supplement the diet to get extra protein in and fast after a workout . I find I 'm a lot less sore taking it right away after the same workout than without taking it . After trying a dozen other proteins , this one can easily be called my favorite .
 I always use Gold Standard . First time trying the Caramel Toffee Fudge and I thought it was good . I rated it high because it always comes on time , they way I ordered and is always a good product .
 This product had the best price , ingredient selection , and taste in its category . I used other brands and this was had the best taste .
 Great taste , especially if you mix it in with chocolate milk.Good value for money , hard to find another protein powder product as good as this out there for the price
 I love this product . It tastes amazing , and I know there wo n't be any clumps . 15-20 seconds worth of mixing in a shaker cup and I know I 'll be good to go . The best part about this protein is I do n't have to worry if I 'm out of milk , as it still tastes just as good when using water only .
 I am a first time user of Whey and I have nothing to compare it against . I compared contents and price online and Amazon 's was comparable . The delivery was less time than scheduled .
 Vanilla does n't taste all that bad . When you first open it up you 'll have to dig for the scooper . Mine was all the way at the bottom lol .
 I 've only had experience with a couple of different protein powder brands , so my review can be taken with a grain of salt . However , I have to admit that this brand is good quality and this specific flavor , Cookies and Cream , is really delicious . When mixed with non-fat milk , it almost tastes like a milk shake . It gives it a creamy texture , and it even has tiny little cookies bits -LRB- kind of like Oreos -RRB- . Even with just plain water , the taste is above average . You 're not going to crave the water + powder combo , but it 's most definitely drinkable and does n't taste unnatural like some other powders.I mentioned that it 's good quality because it mixes so damn well ! I use a shaker that has one of those metal ball blenders , but honestly I could just leave it out and the shaking alone can mix the liquid and powder . Even with cold liquids , like milk , there are no chunks at all.I highly recommend this protein powder . It tastes great and mixes well , what more can you ask for ?
 I have some of this with almond milk , after every work out . It tastes great and a good source of protein .
 i wont see the effect till i get really ripped . but i would say french vanilla taste better than chocolate . it 's soooooooooo creamy
 Gold Standard whey protein is IMO some of the best . But I would advise to stay away from the TROPICAL PUNCH flavor ! I tried it with water , then tried it with berries and bananas . Gross either way . No recipe has saved my shake from this overpowering , chemical-tasting fruity flavor . I will update this review , when I try another flavor .
 Optimum Nutrition Gpld 100 % Whey is the best tasting power protein drink mix that I have found . 60mg . of protein in one glass . The product mixes easily with water , but I prefer non-fat milk and some ice in a mixer . The taste is great . Many flavors - I like to mix Milk Choc . . or Double Choc . with the Vanilla Ice cream mix . Yum ! Great for Gastric ByPass patients to get your protein fast . Online price is good too !
 This is my third time buying a 5 lb container of Chocolate flavored ON Gold Standard Whey . The flavor is just ok , which is the best you can expect in a whey supplement . If you 've ever had Trader Joe 's vanilla soy protein , this product will taste like sweet ambrosia.It is super easy to mix , which is very important . I usually dump a dry scoop of it into a used disposable water bottle and mix it with water at the gym . It mixes so well , there is no need to have a special shaker bottle , unlike some other products.The flavor is ok . I made the mistake of buying the vanilla flavor last time - it 's sickeningly sweet . Do not buy vanilla ! Stick to chocolate or double chocolate.I noticed that after a while , the unused product starts to thicken a little and stick to my plastic funnel ; I assume that the powder starts to absorb moisture . My solution was to tie a cheesecloth sack full of uncooked rice to absorb the moisture , and it is working pretty well .
 This product is awesome and tastes GREAT ! This is a perfect addition for a boost of protein in your diet .
 This is the best protein powder that I have consumed compared to other similar products . I did some research on the type of protein that is good for muscle building and everyday consumption and found a lot of information about whey protein . I researched different brands and found Optimum Nutrition very popular . I feel good after drinking protein shakes . I got the best deal on Amazon for a 5 lbs protein powder tub . I am so happy with the product that I have signed up for frequent automatic shipments .
 I did not get a chance to take this substance yet , however , the bottle was huge and it smell good when I opened the bottle . will start to take it next month .
 Short and sweet , this is my routine :1 . 1 serving with almond milk first thing in the morning2 . 1 serving with water -LRB- room temperature -RRB- after breaking hell loose in the gym .3 . 1 serving of syntha 6 with almond milk before bedtime.I take double rich chocolate which is decent tasting , sometimes add torani sugar-free raspberry syrup . If you 're going through the amount of pain I go through at the gym , you could n't care less for the taste . If not , why are you reading this ?
 Would recommend this to anyone . Taste , ingredients , price and quality are top notch . Great with water or 0 % milk . Mixes well with a spoon or shaker cup .
 Probably THE best tasting of protein I have had . The mint flavoring kills any of the `` different '' taste protein powders normally have . Mixes great too .
 I 've used this protein powder for years now , so there were no surprises . Tastes great , mixes well and great results .
 On 100 % whey protein is one of the best supplements out there . delicious and inexpensive , take this throughout the day to fit in more protein without tons of carbs or fat
 This product is not grainy or gritty . It mixes well even without a blender ! It tastes just like chocolate milk ! I highly recommend !
 the reason why im giving it 4 stars is because of the taste . i later on realized i liked the vanilla a lot more than the chocolate .
 I have been using ON 's protein powder for years
 it came on time , the only thing is that the protein came in a box with styrofoam why do you need this ? you do n't ! The other annoying thing is the company started sending me all this junk mail , I hate junk mail advertising their vitamins . Please do n't send me stuff I do n't want . Overall good .
 Lots of choices and have come to this late as in very late . Wish I had known and understand the benefits from such a fine product much sooner . Had used carb solutions on occasion but how clumpy it is and has only half the protein let alone the full benefits of this product.A subscription to this product via Amazon at 10lbs is going to produce a great bang for the buck . I 've used the product for just over a month with a weight training program that was restarted after the local gym had closed down . -LRB- Replaced by Ironmaster Superbench & Powerblocks ! -RRB- Very , very impressive results in just a short 5 week time . Aid in recovery to allow you to rebuild your training with minimal soreness or next to none was a shock to me . Being over 40 I did n't even know this was possible . I had not worked out all winter . This product helped me to not only get back on my program it allowed me to see results in strength and body that I 've never had so fast in my life . I 'm an overall athlete who has had several knee operations so I am a swimmer who also bikes and this product allows you to reach goals that took so much longer previous.Wish I had known and understood this years back but there you have it . As someone who also bikes and swims for health , this product is going to be just as useful for cardio as for strength training . If I grow old and live good like Jack Lalane , I 'll owe a big debt to Optimum Nutrition no doubt.I 've read about other products that are very good , provide excellent taste and that is no doubt probably true . But for overall use , -LRB- it dissovles easily -RRB- and benefit with cost in mind , I do n't think there is anything that will do better for more people than this product .
 This a very good stuff ... It seems that the Gold protein is better absorbed by our bodies ...
 if you 're looking for a great tasting protein powder drink , then this is THE ONE ! Best tasting for me so far is CHOCOLATE MALT & EXTREME CHOCOLATE . Both has a similar taste to it . AVOID Chocolate Mint , they tastes awful !
 This protein powder mixes well and has a tolerable taste . Taste may be personal preference , but I found Muscle Milk and Body Fortress tasted better in a comparison of chocolate flavors .
 I love this whey protein . It is the only flavor and brand I buy . You can mix anything with it and it is amazing .
 Optimum is the best tasting , most water soluble protein ive found ; best overall protein i can find and at $ 75 for 10lbs you ca n't beat it
 It tastes pretty good for a protein powder . It 's as promised and I 'm quite satisfied with it . would recommend it .
 This whey protein is the best I 've tried . It tastes good , actually works , and it 's cheap . I 've only tried delicious strawberry but I 've heard great things about all the other flavors . I 've also tried GNC 's Wheybolic Extreme 60 . I hated the flavors so I ca n't say if they really work or not . The Gold Standard is my new go to protein . You can pick up 2 pounds for around $ 27 or 3 pounds of Wheybolic for $ 70 at a GNC . The Gold Standard is just as good if not better and it 's much , much cheaper . I recommend this protein 100 % . Do n't just take my word for it , there are hundreds of other happy customers out there . Do n't even think twice about buying this one . It 's awesome .
 Everyone loves Optimum Nutrition . They 've always been a solid supplier of all things sport nutrition . This protein powder is a staple that anyone should have . It tastes great , mixes well , and does its job . What more do you need to know ?
 Protein powder supplements are a blind item from a nutritional standpoint . Optimum Nutrition is among the most respected names in the industry which is why I decided to give their 100 % Whey protein supplements a try after the GNC brand I had been using changed their formulation including a flavor I did n't like.While I have to trust in the Optimum Nutrition name that the supplement is what it says it is , I can attest to the fact -LRB- as a chocolate lover -RRB- that the taste is quite good and the powder dissolves easily in a shaker . Whether supplementing my breakfast or after the most grueling workout , the flavor and texture are quite compatible .
 This powder works great and tastes great . Not much bad to say about it , except it can actually be too sweet at times for me when in milk . Tastes decent in water too , which is also great for when I forget my milk .
 I love this product , one of the best tasting products available . Has a good amount of high quality whey , great for building muscle . One of the only proteins I will use.Also checkoutBeachbody 's Hardcore Base Shake for Body Beast - 30-Day Supply
 I am an avid runner & gym rat , I wanted something which can fulfill my protein demand and this is one where I landed , its easy to blend , taste great -LRB- Strawberry banana -RRB- and so far no stomach upset . I have been using this since last 7 months and pretty happy with it .
 At 2 scoops a day this does the trick recovering my muscles for my next workout . I purchased the Mocha Cappuccino flavor and it was the most delicious whey protein I 've had .
 I love optimum nutrition Im not a very serious bodybuilder but I do workout and use this after every workout . Dissolves easily into water and taste ok . I do n't really care for taste though .
 Good taste , not as good as the chocolate , but still good . I mix it with chocolate soy milk and low fat yogurt for breakfast . This helped me to drop 22 pounds in 5 weeks .
 The ON Gold Protein is pretty good . Its not horrible sweet and doesnt smell bad , I like it mixed with soy milk . It is a little clumpy to mix and have to stir or blend good . So far I will stay with the ON Gold Whey Protein for the taste , cost , flavors . just got the strawberry banana and it really good to
 Great stuff ! Easy on my stomach and holds me over until the meal after my workout . Everything else out there is bull . Isolate is the way to go .
 A LIFE INVESTMENT.The chocolate whey is quite delicious . As a body builder who eats very little animal protein aside from egg whites and fish , I rely heavily on whey as a source of protein and nourishment . For those of you who do n't have an appetite in the morning , you can mix this powder into a glass of milk or even water to start the day . You can even add it to things like whole wheat cereal and plain oatmeal to give a great taste in addition to protein . I consume about 1 gram of protein for every lb of body weight per day , which in my case is about 160 lbs . It was very important that I invested in a protein supplement that contained all natural ingredients . The FDA recently conducted a study that found no toxins or potentially harmful ingredients in Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100 % Whey . In the past I have used BioChem EAS whey . Gold Standard not only lasts longer , it also has a much better taste in my opinion.Definitely one of the best decisions I have ever made for my body .
 Protein is protein . This product is easy to mix , taste good , and its protein . What else do you need ? Quality wise I would say it is a bang for the buck . Affordable with quality . Not many other company can have this .
 You can do your own research into quality of ingredients , nutrition values , etc. . But just for taste , this whey protein is undoubtedly the best tasting whey I 've ever used . It mixes great , and tastes straight-up like a glass of chocolate milk . This is my favorite brand of protein . It 's good stuff , too .
 this is a delicious chocolate tasting sports drink . i take one every morning . it is tough to believe that something this healthy can taste like a rich chocolate milkshake . but its true , and its very good .
 I 've been using this protein all summer and it has worked great . Two of my friends were on other protein brands and ended up switching over to Gold Standard after seeing what a value it is for what you get . Double Rich chocolate tastes great , and it contains everything you need in a good post-workout protein . Just add water or milk and you are good to go . Add some yogurt , peanut butter , and fruit and you have a suitable meal supplement as well !
 The only other whey protein powder I 'd tried in the past was EAS Myoplex , specifically a flavor they tried to make palatable by calling it Cookies and Cream . Imagine gagging down a tumbler of pus from a large abscess.What a relief to find Optimum Nutrition 's 100 % Whey Gold Standard . I got a couple 5 lb containers each of the French Vanilla Cream and the Extreme Milk Chocolate . I mix either with non-fat milk , a heaping tbsp of PB2 powdered peanut butter and some whole ground flax seed meal , and the result is killer . Awesome for breakfast , before a workout and after.I 'm sold on this stuff .
 Love this protein powder ! Has everything I need in the way of protein and health benefits , plus it tastes great ! I 'm very picky about taste and this is by far the best tasting protein powder that 's also actually healthy ! I started with Muscle Milk but learned it 's really not good for you . $ 30 is very reasonable . I 've only ever been able to find this at the Vitamin Shoppe or on Amazon.com . At the Vitamin Shoppe it 's $ 25 , but there is n't one near me , so I order it on here .
 Great protein with a great taste . The only piece of advice I would give is that heavy coffee drinkers should n't purchase this because the flavor of coffee without caffeine can actually cause you to become sleepy -LRB- studies have shown this -RRB- - which is obviously bad for your workout and day . Other than that it was a smooth protein and I would definitely recommend getting some casein to mix with it .
 I am satisfied so far with the product . I find that unless I use a blender or blender bottle it is very difficult to create a shake that is not clumpy . That being said , my blender bottle makes it dissolve fully , as does mixing it into my morning smoothies -LRB- Banana , frozen blueberries , almond milk & spinach -RRB- . It tastes great mixed into the smoothies and adds lots of protein !
 I have used other proteins before ... the flavor was ... bland at best , the efeects where not that fast , the glass keepeda lot of residues of the protein once I mixed it , so I gave up on protein till I bought this piece.Not only the flavor -LRB- Choco Mint yumm -RRB- is strog enough and actually tasty , but I am already seeing the resultsanother thing is that wheneaver i mix , shake , blend it with milk or whatever just rinsing the container removes the fewresidual wastes it leaves behind , I ca n't help but see the superior quality of the protein . As soon as mine is below 1/4 I am buying another , perhaps a different flavor!I give 10/10
 Ca n't go wrong with ON and their ingredients . This was a great flavor -LRB- they offer a wide variety -RRB- . A bit more expensive than some options , but you know you 're getting a good product .
 This stuff is n't as sweet at other protein supplements I 've had , but it mixes very well.In water alone , the flavor and sweetness is very light , which I really like , but in milk -LRB- I use non-fat lactaid -RRB- it is absolutely incredible . Like having an actually milkshake almost . Its awesome in Lactaid .
 I drink a shake with milk for breakfast every morning . I have been losing weight and eat 30 % protein in order to lose faster and keep lean body mass . I have lost 51lbs since July and I know it 's because I 'm eating more protein . This flavor is delicious . Feels like I 'm drinking chocolate milk .
 ON is one of the few brands that I am not afraid to buy from and I am very picky when it comes to buying supplements . The taste ranks higher on terms of &#34; drinkability &#34; however it can be bland time to time but nevertheless it tastes decent . You get a good percentage of whey which is always a good thing . Decent taste , cheaper than most brands , reliable .
 This protein is awesome and taste great . Amazon delivered this almost the next day . If you are looking for a good protein powder no need to look any further .
 This stuff tastes great and I 've actually noticed It has helped me bulk up over the past 6 months of use .
 I bought the coffee flavored version and this along with some milk taste great . Very high quality protein that disssolves easily with no clumps .
 Taste great , dissolves well , quick and easy protein power . Would recommend for those who like to drink protein powder . Filling too for after workout drink .
 Liked this product , but prefer the all natural . Has a little different taste than I am use to . Like the double chocolate flavor .
 I think this is very good . There is no flavor at all but it does n't have the sugar and other additives like Muscle Milk and some of the other main brands . I 'd buy this again for sure .
 This was my first time using this product and I 'm surprised how good it tastes . A material improvement from other protein drinks I 've tried .
 Optimum Nutrition 's products may often be overlooked by many due to its plain labeling , and a lack of crazy adjectives describing all the benefits you will get . But those who research supplements know that Optimum Nutrition makes only the highest quality products , and their whey protein really is the standard by which to judge all others . It is about as pure as you can get , and will easily and quickly be digested by your body post-workout . It tastes great to boot . This is NOT the protein I would recommend for overnight muscle building , as it is a quick digesting protein . For when resting it is recommended that you take a slow-digesting protein which will probably be a mix of soy , egg , and whey proteins . But for post-workout pure protein , without a lot cholesterol or extra unneeded calories , this is the BEST .
 arrived in time and in great condition except that it came with someone else 's receipt but no problem with me
 We have used Optimum Nutrition Whey for some time and have enjoyed the extreme milk chocolate . We decided to try the white chocolate and have been very happy with the flavor . We plan to order it again .
 Decided to try Optimum Nutrition after spending a bit of time researching options online . This came highly recommended . Tastes great , not full of sweeteners , mixes very well .
 After sticking with EAS , Monster Milk or Gaspari Nutrition for the last few years I decided to give Optimum Nutrition a try . I was impressed with the quality , nutritional content and value I received with Gold Standard Whey . It 's amino acid profile is excellent , comes in at only 120 calories and has 24 grams of protein per serving . It helped me more effectively build lean mass while losing fat.While arguably the worst of the chocolate protein supplements I have tried , it 's quality and performance have made me a repeat customer . It can be pricey but is worth the money . Since finishing this product , I 've ordered two more - one for home and one for work . Amazon 's free shipping and low price saved me at least 25-30 % on each purchase over my local vitamin store.Quality
 Product works excellently . And you ca n't beat the price for the huge amount of product you receive . Very pleased with purchase !
 Perhaps this is the best protein supplement I have ever taken , period . Solubility , taste , and price are top notch . Scoop size is `` ideal , '' compared to other massive weight gainers . I 'm currently taking ON 's Serious Mass , and when I finish Serious Mass , I 'll definitely go back to 100 % Gold Whey Protein , and will stay with it as long as I lift weight .
 I have tried several other proteins and although they were not bad , I soon started to notice the expense they were becoming . I then started doing some research through some trusted websites and came upon this brand , and I must admit that I will never try another brand again . This brand makes all the supplements you need for anything that you 're into , and this protein in particular gives you the most for your dollar . - Servings - With 75 servings in one of these , with a subscription through amazon you will be paying less than .50 cents for each serving . Each serving giving you 24 grams of protein , among other things as well that are included -LRB- see label -RRB- . - Price - As stated earlier , you can not go wrong with this brand of protein . You simply can not ignore the quality of the protein and the relatively cheap price for which it sells . - Taste - Delicious ! Do not be fooled by the natural look , this brand has done its homework and they give you quality . You do n't see any shinny containers , huge muscle guys on the label of the container , or anything that screams buy me ! They rely on their quality to speak for itself . The taste of this protein is pretty good , specially with a low sugar content and it is super easy to mix.Overall , I can not be more satisfied with this protein and I will not be praising it anytime soon . I highly recommend it to everyone I come in contact with , I hope this helps you as well .
 Rocky Road is the first one I have tried but it is one of the best tasting protein supplements I have had . Seems to be a good product .
 4th time I bought this product . . taste very good and mixes very easily . .24 gr per serving . . The best is the taste . . you have to like the taste . . some taste like cardboard -LRB- not this product -RRB-
 Not much to say except it does exactly what it 's suppose to do . The biggest thing about protein powder is the taste . Despite this flavor being called Caramel Toffee , it taste like Coffee with little to no aftertaste , and I drink it with water . So that 's really the big thing . The protein powder that I use to get had more protein per serving but was becoming too expensive . But one thing I like about Optimum Nutrition is the variety of flavors and they are highly rated among protein powder . Plan to continue buying .
 For how cost effective this protein is , you can not find a better one online . I recently went into GNC and Vitamin Shoppee and realized that they sell there items for a third more in their stores compared to online . I use this after i workout and have noticed a great difference in how i feel the next day . Buy this stuff and you will not be upset
 First the only other ON Protein that I have tried is the double chocolate which is very good . I had really high hopes for the chocolate mint and ordered a 2 pounder . The smell of chocolate mint is absolutely amazing and got me really pumped up for the taste . Once mixed up the taste was n't all that great . There is no real mint taste and the chocolate was toned down as well . I wish it tasted like it smells . I will be sticking with the Double Chocolate .
 This is the best tasting whey around . It is also very cheap for the amount of whey you get . I 've listed the nutritional facts below for those of you are lazy to look.Nutrional facts : Serviing size :1 rounded scoop -LRB- 29.4 g -RRB- Calories :120 Calories from fat :10 Total Fat :1 gSaturated Fat 0.5 gTrans fat :0 gCholesterol
 I 've been using it for years ... tried the others and nothing compares . Full spectrum of nutrients you need ... does n't punish the GI tract like cheaper brands . Use the casein too .
 this is by far the best protein you can take when i started lifting i weighed 155 and got up to 195 in 4 months that is training hard every day of the week taking 1 day off . nothing but power lifting and a little cardio take about 220 grams a day and see what happens good luck to your transformation any trainging tips email me at spl1tn_h34ds101@yahoo.com
 I have been taking optimum nutritions whey protein for a couple of years now . I love this product and works miracles for the body . I have tried , double chocolate , rocky road and cookies and cream . I loved the dc and cc so i decided to try the rocky road . This flavor is not as good as the other two . I bought a 5 lb tub of it and am now regretting this flavor . stick to the flavors you like .
 I have been a user and a fan of ON 100 % Whey for a while but had never tried the Rocky Road . The Rocky Road is by far my favorite flavor now . The only way I could describe it is if you added almond to the milk chocolate . That is about what it tastes like . It is REALLY good .
 Very good overall product.Tastes pretty good with milk/oj/water . Sometimes it will clump which can get annoying . It is not too troublesome with a good stirring technique .
 This is a great price for a good product . It works fine and does n't taste terrible . Even though its instantized , you really have to wisk it otherwise it 'll come out a bit chunky . Other than that good product : -RRB-
 good , solid whey protein . mixes well . good profile . pretty good taste - compared to others I have tried
 1 . Taste.Other than some of the choc powder from Gaspari Nutrition , this is probably the tastiest brand of powder i have sampled .2 . Digestibility . This particular brand i can consume ALOT of it -LRB- 5lbs a week at least -RRB- and it gives me very little gastrointestinal problems or other wierd symptoms . Very ` clean ' .3 . Cost . $ 10 per pound or lower is ` benchmark ' price.Winning combination.rocky road > extreme milk choc > double rich choc
 This tasted better than most , but still had a `` mediciny '' taste . Mixes better with skim milk than with water . Will try the other flavors to see , but will come back to this again .
 I recently started a new medicine that has made me lose my appetite . My brother who is a personal trainer suggested that I drink this to keep up my nutrition during my workouts . It dissolves quickly and is delicious with milk or with an added scoop of peanut butter !
 # 1 protein on the market . Love it.Pro 's
 this is my first protein shake . i havent tried others . but im happy with this one.tastes great , dissolves easy , and im seeing results
 Fresh , quality whey protein is hard to find at bargain prices . This fits the bill for both quality , freshness , and at an excellent below-market price !! Could n't ask for more !
 I am on a restricted calorie diet and recently added power 90 workout videos . I started drinking one of these after my workout and it really lessens my soreness and recovery time . Also I am building a considerable amount of muscle despite my very low calorie intake . At 230 calories per 8 oz glass -LRB- if taken with 1 % -RRB- it had to replace my mini ice cream treat I ate each night , but the double chocolate tastes almost as good ! I also have tried vanilla ice cream and I can get it down after a workout if I use an immersion blender , but it does n't taste very good . The double chocolate tastes very similar to a malted milk shake .
 The container was in one piece and not leaking when it arrived ... That 's all that really matters . The product works well and tastes great .
 I have been using this the ON Gold Standard Whey protein for a few years now . It 's the best tasting one I 've used . I have tried the double chocolate , Cappuccino , Mint Chocolate and now the Coffee flavors . I like them all , and until I got the Coffee flavor , chocolate mint had been my favorite . The Coffee flavor is the best one I 've had so far . Its really really good . Taste like coffee ice cream . Very smooth and creamy . I highly recommend the mint chocolate and coffee flavors .
 I have been trying Hydro Platinum for the past 2 + months , 1 tub per month .5 approx for 2 people . This deal surpassed the Hydro by almost about double the products weight -LRB- Hydro = 3.5 lbs , Gold Standard = 5 lbs -RRB- and pound for pound in the supplemental specs , Gold stardard comes out equal to Hydro . The reason why the hydro has a slightly higher amino acid per serving ratio is because of it having a slightly bigger scoop . -LRB- Ex . Hydro = Scoop 77cc
 I had used this product some number of years ago and started a regimented workout routine after a few years absent from the game ... The new formula looks , mixes , tastes and works exactly like the former . It mixes well with just a spoon , and tastes about as good as products like this come . I use it to supplement a protein laden diet , typically first thing in the morning , pre-workout and later in the evening . It is quickly soluble , so I am likely changing to a casien protein mix or cottage cheese or lean meat before bed because of longer protein provisioning while asleep , but for those who are n't particluar it can be used whenever you need that quick protein ingested . If you can find an equivalent product for a better price let me know !!!
 I grew tired of using Wal-Mart stocked whey protein powders because of the high level of cholesterol and fat in each scoop . So , I decided to give Optimum Nutrition a try a couple of months back based on its reviews and its low cholesterol . I have noticed an improved muscle gain with Optimum over the other brands I had tried , though this could be because I used it more frequently throughout the day since I am not concerned about the cholesterol content . Whether or not I plan on working out that day , I will use a scoop in my bran flakes to get me going with most of my nutrients for the day . With half of my recommended daily protein intake for the day in each scoop , it is actually a very cost effective way to maintain a proper protein intake . So , whether you are a body builder or just conscious of proper nutrition , I highly recommend this product because it is one of the healthiest , pure sources of protein available , and it is very reasonably priced.Thus far , I have purchased the French Vanilla Creme and the Coffee flavors , and I have been very pleased with how much I actually enjoy the flavor of the powder . Let me begin by saying the powder dissolves very easily when mixed with a liquid , so it can be versatile in its use . The French Vanilla Creme is very appealing as a generic flavor that works well with most foods or liquids you would normally add it to . However , the Coffee flavor is more distinct , and does not work with everything the French Vanilla Creme will . I am a coffee lover , so it is n't a problem for me , and I really enjoy the Coffee flavored powder . When ordering it , I had my doubts about its `` coffee '' flavor , suspecting it may be just a powdery and light flavor . But , because it actually has very finely ground coffee in it , the coffee flavor is really strong ! I suggest mixing it with a low-fat milk for something resembling a cappuccino . If you like coffee , get the coffee flavor .
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard is without a doubt the best product on the market for anyone looking for a protein drink that has solid nutrients , is low in sugar/fats/calories , and concentrates on giving the consumer a product that uses the best most expensive whey protein . Optimum Nutrition creates high-end products that prove great results all while managing to provide their products at affordable prices in comparison to the ingredients they use . The 100 % Whey Gold Standard comes in a myriad of delicious flavors ; I highly recommend the chocolate flavors if you plan to simply drink the protein straight . If you are like me and you love to spruce up your protein drink by adding fruit , oatmeal , milk , yogurt , etc. then I recommend the vanilla and fruit flavors . Studies show that whey protein is an extremely important nutrient for muscle recovery and Optimum Nutrition provides a top-notch whey protein drink that is sure to keep you feeling sustained and energized all while doing what whey protein does best , helping the body recover from any workout and building long-lasting lean muscle !
 I have been using this protein powder for more than a year now.This is by far the best of all i have had . It easily dissolves in water and tastes very good . You can mix it with milk or some fruit and blend it to make a complete protein meal . Worth the price ... Go for it ...
 I 've tried various chocolate flavored protein powders , including BSN Syntha-6 , Body Fortress , and Designer Whey ... this one -LRB- Double Rich Chocolate -RRB- is by FAR the best when added to milk . I also like that it has a low amount of fat , low amounts of heavy metals , and a high proportion of protein . I 've never found a protein powder that successfully dissolves in water/milk through stirring -LRB- I always have to shake it in a bottle -RRB- , but I do notice that this one tends to dissolve faster than others.All in all , a great tasting protein powder that does n't make me feel nauseous .
 Great service - got this 2 days earlier than promised . Great price compared to others that I reviewed . Overall I am satisfied .
 I 've been through one canister now and I like the results . I originally started this workout plan to lose some weight . I lift two days a week and do hard cardio two days a week , every week . I have been at it for 5 months now , and I have n't lost a pound , in fact , I 've gained about 8 pounds . But thanks to ON I know it 's all muscle . I weigh more but my waist is smaller - I can tell by the way my pants fit . My arms , shoulders , and even my legs look lean and muscular , but my little belly is still there . Part of it is body type I guess . I 'll keep at it as long as I can . I have one shake with milk in the morning for breakfast and one immediately after my workout , which usually ends up being around noon . Once I started using ON I noticed I was less sore after lifting days . I also feel good about myself because I know I 'm only putting the best stuff in my body . Overall I 'm very pleased , but I wish it would help me get rid of my little belly.And oh yeah , it tastes great blah blah blah . Mixes well yada yada yada . Frankly , I do n't care about this stuff , as long as I get results .
 I thought I give this flavor a try since I usually only get chocolate malt flavor . It definitely tasted a lot better than I expected . I would definitely get it again .
 At first I was using the cheap 5 lb bags of EAS protein from Sam 's club . When Sam 's stopped carrying it and replaced it with MuscleTech brand , I switched as well . I found the MuscleTech to be absolutely awful and when looking for a replacement found that the Optimum Nutrition NATURAL Whey was on sale , so I picked up a tub of that in the Chocolate flavor . It was leaps and bounds better than both of the brands I had tried previously . It tasted much better , but the biggest difference was that it mixed much , MUCH better . I usually use 2 scoops in 12 oz of milk -LRB- sometimes 3 scoops in 16 oz milk -RRB- mixed in a blender bottle , and it mixes really well with maybe 10-15 seconds of shaking . No clumps at all . I ran out of the ON NATURAL and bought this tub of ON Whey in the Double Rich Chocolate flavor because it was cheaper than the NATURAL this time around . It is every bit as good as the NATURAL in all aspects . In fact , I can barely tell the difference between the two . I actually mixed the rest -LRB- a dozen scoops or so -RRB- of the NATURAL Chocolate in with the Double Rich Chocolate to avoid having two giant tubs of this stuff lying around.This stuff is considerably more expensive than most other proteins out there , but as a pretty big part of my diet - it 's worth it to spend a little more to get something that tastes and mixes so much better .
 So many reviewers discussed the ingredients and benefits in detail , so I wo n't rehash that.Bottom line
 Purchased 5 lb of Cookies and Cream flavor from Amazon . Before this , I 've only had the Double Chocolate so I was a little weary of trying something new . Thankfully , it tastes pretty delicious . I usually just mix it with a bit of water and stir with a fork , and it always dissolves easily . The little cookie bits at the end are a nice touch , too . It does have a strong mocha-like smell which can be nauseating .
 Optimum has always sold only the highest of quality stuff . You really cant go wrong . 100 % whey is the best protein you can buy period .
 The product arrived in a timely manner . I drink the double chocolate variety . The price is great compared to buying the 2 pound tubs at Walmart or Jewel . The taste is decent . It does n't taste like chocolate milk but it 's not intolerable . I always use milk with this product and have never tried it in water . As an experienced lifter I 'd say not to fret too much about your protein powder , it should be a minor detail in your plan , but , if you are going to buy some , this is probably the best quality for such a cheap price .
 In my opinion after years of constant use , Optimum Nutrition is the best protein for the price . Its super high-quality Whey protein , the taste is about the best it can be -LRB- for having under 3g of sugar -RRB- , and the price is fair for its value . Whether your goals are to burn fat & gain some muscle or your goals are to pack on pounds of muscle -LRB- and you do n't want a bloating , weight gainer -RRB- THIS is the protein for you .
 For adding muscle to your body this stuff rocks . I 've tried other Whey Protien , but none tastes better , nor do other brands include Glutamine -LRB- a key nutrient for muscle recovery -RRB- .
 I ordered this and received in less than 30 hours . I ordered from Amazon directly and will say that I was quite impressed I was just aiming to get it the day after the holiday . The shakes are good too . Ive had the mint chocolate as well . I use these to help substitute the shakes at Metabolic Research Center to offset the high cost of there stuff and this is only 30 calories more for a higher amount of protein . Very satisfied customer .
 Overall this has been a wonderful purchase . I 'm running out of Protein so I 've recently decided to switch to theirOptimum Nutrition 100 % Natural Oats and Whey Vanilla Bean , 3 Poundwhich will hopefully help me get some more fiber in my diet . I 've really enjoyed Optimum Whey . The nice thing is that it does n't have all the additives and extras that some of the other brands provide . I 'm sure that they have their benefit , but I just want the protein not some magical ingredients or fillers that make it cost more.It mixes Well.It Taste Great -LRB- better in milk , but not horrible in water -RRB- It last a long time.I highly recommend it .
 ON Whey Gold Standard has been recommended by everybody I 've read . I 've been buying it from Amazon for about a year now . Rocky Road > Double Chocolate > Cookies n ' CreamThe only complaint is the scoop usually comes buried somewhere in the middle , but it 's a problem with all the other brands . I just reuse the one from previous batch .
 The strawberry protein shake from Optimum tastes great and makes my routine more complete as a post-workout drink . Highly recommended
 So I just finished my first 2 lb container of whey gold standard , double rich chocolate . I have to say it tastes GREAT , especially if you mix it with a banana and some peanut butter . Ordered my second one last night.I use a blender to mix my protein with milk , so I never have any problems with the mixing -LRB- although I have n't tried mixing it in a blender bottle where you shake it around , but I ca n't imagine it being much different -RRB- . Whey protein is absorbed very quickly in the body , so this is the best protein for a post-workout shake . If you 're having problems with the taste -LRB- which is n't bad at all in my opinion -RRB- , just throw in a banana and two tablespoons of peanut butter .
 I was comparing this Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor to other chocolate flavors by Optimum Nutrition , and after reading a review that gave this 5/5 compared to other flavors , I was sold . This tastes fantastic even by just mixing it with water or milk .
 Good Quality Protein , arrived on time , shipped securely with plenty of `` airbags '' , the product I purchased was the product that arrived . Thanks !!
 This is some of the best protein you can buy . It can be expensive , but when it does go on sale try to snatch up as much as you can . Good sales on this do n't come around too often , maybe twice a year . The mixability is perfect in a shaker cup , and the taste is good . I find you need to use less water than it says to . I only use 4 ounces and it mixes and tastes fine . The quality is higher than most and has less contaminants than most other brands . You can never go wrong with Optimum Nutrition .
 Ok , so I never write reviews about things but in this instance I am because of how pleased and impressed I am with this product . I 'm not sure where I heard about this but now that I tried it I would never go back to any other protein product . I started lifting about a year ago and was trying very hard to gain weight and get enough protein . I found that by using this product after each lift and 1 to 2 other times during the day I was able to accomplish alot rather quickly . I gained weight and my lifts rose and the BCAAs in this helped make me less sore.Taste
 best whey protein out in the market , gives you fast results , great for recovery and it also digests pretty good
 I was getting sick of chocolate , so I thought I would try this . I was a little hesitant , thinking it might not taste very good , but I was pleasantly surprised . I like to mix it into a fruit smoothie for a post-workout drink , but it also is not bad just mixed with water.I would definitely get this flavor again .
 I 've tried so many different protein powders , different brands , different flavors and each time I had to force myself to drink it . It was ok if I had a blender around but a lot of time I had to use a shaker at the gym and most powders dont taste good or mix well in a shaker . When I read the reviews about this protein , I saw things like mixes easily , no blender needed , tastes good ... so I decided to give it a try . WOW ! The double chocolate tastes just like chocolate milk , its not as sweet as muscle milk or as thick . It mixes really easily in a shaker which is perfect for me when I have to mix it at the Gym . I 'm so impressed I ordered the bananna cream so i can add it to some of my fruit smoothies in the morning ! I highly recommend this product .
 Optimum Nutrition 's 100 % Whey Gold Standard is the only protein powder I use . There are a few better protein powders on the market , unfortunately they 're a lot more expensive . This is the best one you can get for your money . I 'm a huge fan of the Banana Cream .
 This stuff is great for post workout or a healthy bridge in between meals . Tastes pretty good . The Double Chocolate is a good balance - not too sweet like the Extreme Chocolate . It mixes great in water and even better in milk . Goes down good and my stomach agrees with it . I have definitely added some lean mass since I began using this product 4 months ago . The 5 pound tub lasts me right at a month . I have no reservations when it comes time to pony up the $ 53 for another one . Best whey protein I 've used.-Legend
 I remember first seeing a tub of this on my RA 's desk in college . I started working out and taking protein my freshman year and never looked back since . I 've tried a couple of other protein powders -LRB- weight gainers , different isolates , etc. -RRB- but I always came back to this one because it just works and it tastes great . I always get the Double Rich Chocolate.Random note : I love cereal . Mix this with milk -LRB- almond milk works really well -RRB- and you have chocolate milk for cereal .
 I really like the ON double chocolate . Very lean with high % of protein per scoop . ON leaves out the higher fat content without much sacrifice on taste . It mixes VERY easily . I even put a scoop on a bowl of cereal . Chocoolate Rice Krispies and Shredded Wheat with a scoop of this stuff makes a great tasting snack !!!
 All that it was suppose to be . Packaged nice and neat and arrived sooner than the date I was given . Thanks
 Flavor wise this is a vanilla that goes down very nicely . Content wise I can only go off of what I have read , which is that this brand is known for using good quality/purity ingredients as opposed to some others , but I will leave that for the scientists and just stick with what I know - for the dollar/size/flavor , this one delivers .
 I have been using ON protein for years now . If you are on a budget this is about the best tasting and protein per dollar brand you can get . It has been slowly going up in price and I was truly disappointed to see Amazon get rid of subscribe and save on this but its still a great price . It mixes well and is very light unlike other powders that can be thick and heavy . My favorite flavor is the Coffee . I also love the chocolate coconut and chocolate mint is great as well . Also you can never go wrong with the regular chocolate if you are unsure about the funky flavors .
 I bought this protein so that I wo n't get sore after a hard workout . It works , though I have to up the servings pending how hard I hit the gym . Both Vanilla and Chocolate tastes great !
 This is about as good of a product as you will find for the price ! I switched to this protein powder a couple of years ago , and for me it 's a perfect supplement for increasing lean muscle mass with proper exercise and diet . I was blessed pretty good genetics and a high metabolism -LRB- I gradually lose weight when I quit working out for an extended period of time -RRB- , so this helps me rebuild more quickly after taking long breaks . For those trying to shed the pounds , this is still a superb supplement because it 's low calorie and is n't filled with a bunch of junk that your body does n't need .
 I 'd give this product 5 stars but today only 4 because the price just continues to rise . I guess you get what you pay for and overall this is a great product . Limited additives , clean protein , easy to mix and build into your workout regimen . If I had more time to cook MASS amounts of foods and just eat that after working out I would ... but I do n't , and this makes it easy to get some quality protein after a workout -LRB- very important -RRB- .
 My review is based solely on the taste of the ON Cookies and Cream Whey.Mixing
 I have tried a few different protein powders , and I like this one the best . First of all , it is very nutrient-dense , unlike some other powders . 1 scoop delivers 24g of protein , while in some other powders , you need to take twice that amount . It also has fewer carbs -LRB- only 3g per scoop -RRB- . I also find it to be much more cost effective . One of these 5 pound jars contains 149 scoops and costs $ 43 -- that 's 29 cents per meal !! And , most importantly -- it tastes good . There is no sense buying something if you wo n't eat it , no matter how healthy it might be , but taste is not a problem with this product . So , it 's healthy , it 's cost effective , and it tastes good -- ca n't really go wrong.No doubt there are plenty of ways to consume it , but these are my top two
 As far as protein powders go , ON 's Gold Standard line ca n't be beat . Using a special blend of Whey Protein Isolates and Peptides , it delivers protein to your muscles faster and more effectively than a lot of other products out there.I wo n't pretend to be any kind of scientist or nutritionist , just a regular guy who lifts weights and depends on ON Gold Standard to help me recover from my workouts and help add muscle to my body.Personally , I think the Double Rich Chocolate has the best taste , especially when mixed with milk . It mixes just fine with water , too , but with milk it ends up tasting almost like a nice , rich chocolate milk!And as far as the price and delivery schedule from Amazon , it really is head and shoulders above everything else . I have done a LOT of research online for the best price points for this protein powder , and amazon blows them all out of the water!This product is offered cheaper other places online , but then they hit you with insane shipping prices , and it ends up being a lot more expensive . If you get this product as a `` subscribe and save '' option , it 's less than $ 19 for a 2lb tub , and the shipping is free ! That is insane ! If you do n't believe me , spend a good half hour or hour looking on the web for a better deal , when you 're done looking , you 'll come right back here and order through amazon.For people who demand a great tasting , effective product that they know will give them results , this is it . Especially if you 're getting in the gym regularly and want something that you can use daily , the `` subscribe and save '' is the way to go . Shipments show up on time and with no hassle , and you always know amazon will have your protein for you ! I ca n't recommend this enough .
 I 've been taking Optimum 100 % Whey since high school -LRB- and I 'm now a few years out of college -RRB- . Like my review title says , it 's reliable , it 's consistent , and it 's a quality product . I 've tried all kinds of brands , and even gone so far as to order custom protein blends -LRB- which is still valuable if you have very esoteric needs -RRB- . When it comes to straightforward , uncomplicated results , however , Optimum is virtually impossible to beat.-Cost effective , especially if you 're an Amazon Prime member.-Highly mixable ; whether it be a manual shaker or a blender.-Several flavor options.-Contains protease and lactase enzymes to aid digestion , and avoid stomach problems.I 'm a professional athlete , and have to travel all over the world to compete . Quality protein sources can be hard to come by when you 're in an unfamiliar environment , and Optimum 100 % Whey is one of the most important things I travel with .
 I have been using the protein powder from Provida Labs , but switched to optimum since this was a lot cheaper . This has a lot of protein , but very low in sodium , fat and sugar and I very much like it . The only reason I cant give a 5 is because of the taste . But do n't get me wrong , this tastes good and sweet but not as good as the protein powder i am used to from Provida Labs . This is my opinion on the Vanilla flavor and I 'll try chocolate the next time .
 I tried the Chocolate flavor stuff and I have to plug my nose to even get it down . It tasted so bad . But I read that a lot of people were liking the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor so I gave that a try.Best Protein powder -LRB- That 's not extremely fatty -RRB- that I have ever had . I can easily drink it will water , milk , or whatever.My only complaint -LRB- about most powders -RRB- is they need to package the scoop on the outside . I hate spending 10 mins to dig through the powder to find that thing .
 I absolutely swear by Optimum Nutrition protein . No other brand compares in terms of quality and taste . I have tried pretty much every flavor and they all taste great but strawberry is still my favorite . It mixes better and tastes better than any other brand I have tried . This is by far the best whey I have found .
 I am a 24 yr old girl . I like to work out . My boyfriend asked me to buy it for him so I did . Then I researched if women are allowed to drink protein and they are so I tried it . Tastes good & good quality . I recommend a special shaker cup though because it stays in chunks . We bought the double chocolate .
 I have used this protein for over 3 years and it has been a key component to my success in the gym ! By far it is the best tasting protein powder I have used besides Muscle Milk and the price is great . If you work hard in the gym and give it all you have each time then you owe it to yourself to use this protein .
 After trying this i loved it . Taste great mix well and has good stuff in it . With 77 servings the price is good too . Buying lot more of this stuff .
 Great for right after workout in milk . Also great in cereal in the morning . It provides a scooper for you so you know how much is one serving -LRB- you might have to dig a bit first to find it -RRB- .
 EVERYTHING IS JUST 100 % PERFECT BUT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE HARD TO FIGURE A WAY OUT TO OPEN THE `` BAG `` ANY WAYS THAT 'S NOT A PROBLEM LOL AND YEA LOVE THE FLAVOR
 I bought the Rocky Road and it really tastes good ! I am super picky about taste , but I enjoy this . I just mix with milk , but would probably enjoy more if I blended it with ice .
 great product if you are into workouts and building muscle or even losing weight . 24g of protein , 5.5 g BCAA all in one small serving is valuable for the $ 46 price tag found in amazon.com and free shipping beats GNC and other supplement shops . So far i have only tried the vanilla ice cream and strawberry flavor -LRB- strawberry is banging ! -RRB- and i must say they both taste great , i bet the other flavors are just as tasty , so many to choose from . Blends well with water and can be used to mix with other food like oats , fruits etc. . I take 2 scoops a day -LRB- 1 scoop while at work and another with creatine after working out -RRB- remember that this is a `` supplement '' do not replace your regular high protein meals with shakes , use it with 4 or 5 daily meals and you will get gains !
 I have tried many whey protein products , and this is the best combination of nutritional content -LRB- not many carbs -RRB- , great taste , and a reasonable price . I use a heaping scoop on top of yogurt every morning , but it is also easy to shake into a beverage . Chocolate Malt is my favorite flavor , but Double Rich Chocolate and Vanilla Ice cream are not bad either . -LRB- Stay away from the banana !! -RRB-
 It is extremely hard for me to put on weight I have an extremely fast metabolism , I eat in my lunch at work and about 20 minutes after I have to go . TMI , but thats how extreme It is . Anyway this stuff helps me a lot and its delicious I take two scoops at night before bed with cold milk , its the best shake ever . At first it was kinda hard getting used to the taste , but after a hard working out session this is what your muscles are starving for . Highly recommend this stuff . And it is cheaper than at GNc . It is not magic though , I work out 4 or 5 times a week and do heavy lifting and I am starting to see results , if you are a hard gainer like me this will greatly help along with a good diet and lifting sessions .
 I have got to say , this protein is great in taste , value and overall quality . I used to be taking a GNC generic brand of whey , but this blows that by a thousand miles!Tried the French Vanilla Cream , must say it was awesome . I 'm personally a vanilla lover and although at first it tasted different it was because the GNC one I was using was n't as great ! already ordered my second tub , this time Cookies and cream : -RRB- Cons
 This whey protein powder makes milk taste like chocolate milk , which is more than I expected.If you want a solid jug of protein powder from a respected company , you ca n't go wrong with Optimum Nutrition 's product here .
 This product is good in taste . As after taking it for about one to two months I did notice muscle increase . Great product to take after work out . I felt a difference once I took it right after my work outs .
 I have ordered Gold Standard Whey in the past & have never been disappointed . I use it for breakfast after an early morning workout . Taste is great & it mixes well with water . If you are adding fruit , I always order the vanilla & create my own protein smoothies . I will continue to order this product , I have found it to be one of the highest sources of Whey Protein Isolate . I love the tast & the results . Thanks for the great products.Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey , Natural Vanilla , 2 Pound
 I 'm 3/4 of the way through my second 2lb container of the mocha cappucino flavor but decided to try the coffee in the 5 lb size -LRB- because it was such a great deal -RRB- in the hopes of getting my scrawny 13.5 yo son to try it . But after mixing the coffee flavored powder with skim milk and discovering that it tastes like a coffee shake I 'm no longer willing to share it with him ! I happen to love coffee in general so it 's not surprising that I prefer this flavor to the m.c. It 's also not as sweet as the m.c.
 I 've tried a few others from department stores . None of which mix as well as this whey . Their vanilla flavored mix is dessert-like . I will pass on the strawberry as it tastes like amoxicylin in liquid form , yet it is tolerable . I ca n't wait to try the other flavors . You ca n't beat the price of this stuff . THANK YOU OPTIMUM NUTRITION FOR NOT SUCKING AND BEING TOTALLY AWESOME ! YO GABBA GABBA !
 Product was received with no issues . For the price and quality this is one of the best protein supplements . Note to lactose intolerant people , this is NOT for you.cheers
 Optimum has continued to make the best proteins on the market today . I have never been dissatisfied with their proteins ever . This particular product is great , been using it for a good while now . The taste is great not bad at all . I have defineatly seen gains using whey protein along with hard work in the gym . Also helps with the recovery process tremendously as well . Optimum totally gets two thumbs up from me , hands down by far the best out there .
 I 've tried a lot of whey powders , and Optimum Nutrition 100 % Gold Standard ranks among the top in it 's price range . When considering how many flavors they offer , I think it 's fair to say they might possibly be the best for this price range . It 's hard to say , since I have n't tried every whey out there.I typically mix my whey in water . The flavors that taste like bakery goods , or chocolate are n't the best in water , however , the fruity flavors are excellent . Banana Cream is my favorite , however , Tropical Punch and Delicious Strawberry were excellent as well . These also go great in coffee . I like them more than Coffee Mate-like products.The chocolaty or bakery-good type wheys I 've tried have all been great in milk . I have n't had a chance to try many of them though . Of the once I 've tried , Chocolate Malt was the one I enjoyed the most.If Optimum Nutrition sold sample packs of all their flavors , I would rate them all , however , as it is now , I can only review what I can afford . But from what I have tried , I do n't think you can go wrong with Optimum Nutrition 100 % gold standard . I 've been a repeat customer for about a year , and do n't foresee that changing .
 Check your local GNC - they usually have great prices on this stuff ! The product itself is very efficient - I use it after weight-training workouts .
 I had gastric bypass almost 2 years ago now . As part of the protocol , I 'm supposed to drink a protein shake once per day . As you can imagine , this can get to be pretty boring flavor wise so I 'm always trying new brands and flavors . The simple fact is , I keep coming back to ON Gold Standard Extreme Milk Chocolate -LRB- or double rich chocolate -RRB- over and over again . It 's simply the best . The flavor is excellent . It does n't taste like it has &#34; diet flavored &#34; sweetner in it . It 's just simple and delicious.I do n't have to worry too much about calories so this may not help a lot of you out there . But if you just need to get some protein in you every day for whatever reason , try my shake recipe out :1.5 -LRB- 12 oz -RRB- water2 scoops of ON Gold Standard - Extreme Milk Chocolate/Double Rich Chocolate3 Tablespoons of Peanut Butter1 Banana1 Tablespoon of Flax Seed Oil -LRB- if you 're into that sort of thing , I think it actually enhances the flavor a bit and it 's good for you -RRB- 1-2 Cups of Ice -LRB- depending on how &#34; shakey &#34; you want it to be -RRB- Blend until smooth
 Tropical Punch is a great flavor , a must needed change from the usual chocolate and vanilla . Mixes very well and tastes very good as well .
 Great product ! Tastes great as described . Many other flavors available . Better than other supplements I have used in the past !
 Had been using for over 3 months . Love the result , the taste and the consistency of the product . Highly recommended
 I have always been a big fan of Optimum Nutrition as a brand for a long time and I 've always found there protein products to be superb . I 've seen great results by taking this product and will probably never buy a different brand . On the downside , the chocolate malt flavor was a little disappointing . I have found that the flavor is fairly bland and not tasting a sweet as i thought it would . Two of my favorite flavors ON offers are Caramel toffee and chocolate mint . Overall , i would buy this brand of protein , but not this particular flavor .
 I had tried many flavors before . To give you an idea about my taste , for me vanilla was the worst , chocolate was ok , strawberry , banana -LRB- or their mixture -RRB- was good . However , none of these flavors were good with water and I had to mix with milk even though I am trying to avoid milk . This time I tried white chocolate flavor . It is very good even with water ! And when you mix it with milk , it turns to something like a milk shake , super delicios , the only problem -LRB- ? -RRB- being lots of bubbles it makes.Regarding the seller , everything was great and I received it super fast , even though I did n't pay for any shipping -LRB- it was standard shipping but got it in 3 days -RRB- .
 Since there are already hundreds of reviews for this product , let me just compare it to the product that I used just before : BSN Syntha-6 Protein Powder , Vanilla Ice Cream , 5.04 Poundvs Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100 % Whey Strawberry Banana -- 2 lbsTaste : Syntha-6 is by far the best tasting protien shake I have ever had . I only mixed it with filtered water and it was always creamy and delicious . Optimum is more normal in that it is watery taste that would only be close to Syntha-6 if it was mixed with milk.Fillingness -LRB- I think I made that word up -RRB- : Syntha-6 was a great breakfast and post workout drink because it kept me satiated until lunch . I 'm a morning workout type , who is usually in to much of a rush to make more than a shake and grab an apple . So far I would have to say I do n't get quite the same satisfaction from Optimum . I suspect it has to do with the next catagory.Nutrition : Both products have about the same amount of Protein , but where Optimum excels is that it only has 3 grams of Carbs and 120 Cals vs Syntha-6 has 13 grams of Carbs vs 200 Cals . I believe the carb and calorie count is why it is also more filling.I have tried many different Protein shakes and have never had one taste as good as Syntha-6 , but for my nutritional needs right now , I 'll stick with Optimum . When I 'm ready to bulk up again I 'll switch back to Syntha-6 .
 I ordered the `` Delicious Strawberry '' flavor . It tastes better than their `` Tropical Punch '' flavor , in my opinion . My younger brother says this flavor tastes like medicine .
 This actually is a very good product . I 'm just a simple guy who goes to the gym 3 times a week to be healthy and of course to try to build a good looking body -LRB- without steroids and stuff like that -RRB- so honestly i can not say this really help you build body mass fast . But is has decent `` good '' taste and medically speeking , you do need protein if you are lifting weight , just do n't spect magic .
 This is a very good protein supplement . In the beginning I di n't like the banana flavor but I got used to it and now I like it . On training days I drink it in the morning with low fat milk and one serving before and after training . I like to prepare on a blender because it gets a creamy flavor .
 I started lifting about 3 months ago and i decided to get this mix on a friends recommendation . I bought the Double Dark Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream . I wanted to share my favorite shake recipes . The chocolate can stand on its own with just some skim milk . I will usually do one of these recipesChocolate Banana1 . One Scoop of chocolate powder2 . Banana3 . 2 table spoons of plain non-fat yogurt4 . Skim Milk5 . IceMocha ! 1 . One Scoop chocolate Powder2 . One spoonfull of instant espresso3 . 2 tablespoons of plain non-fat yogurt4 . Skim Milk5 . IceTropical1 . One Scoop Vanilla powder2 . 4 or 5 froze strawberries4 . small handful of frozen mango5 . Skim Milk6 . 2 tablespoons of plain non-fat yogurt7 . Optional Banana or mix and match the strawberries and mangoI will have one of theee for breakfast -LRB- 7:15 am -RRB- and it 's enough calories and energy to get me until 1pm for lunch !
 The product is great in terms of taste and effect ... I have tried double chocolate , vanilla ice cream , and cookies n cream ... DO NOT GET COOKIES AND CREAM !! it tastes extremely horrible !
 I have the Rich Double Chocolate flavored powder . I 'm probably not doing this right , but I mix one scoop with 8 oz . of 2 % milk -LRB- I know , not skim , shame on me ! -RRB- , and it tastes like chocolate milk . If I enjoy the taste of something , I 'm more likely to continue doing it . I 've been drinking two `` shakes '' a day in addition to 4 smaller meals , and I look forward to it each time.As far as results , I do n't know if it has made a difference , because when I just began serious weight training about 3 weeks ago , and have had the powder since the beginning of the third week . I have been gaining weight , and my workouts are constantly improving , so something must be going right.If you like chocolate milk , and you would like an extra boost of 24g protein -LRB- plus what is in the milk -RRB- , this product/flavor may be for you . I have n't tried it in water , and I really do n't plan to . Chocolate flavored water does not appeal to me . I 'll put up with the extra fat if it means that I 'll actually stay with the program .
 I mix this with 6 oz of milk , and take it two servings at a time -LRB- total of 12 oz of milk -RRB- . I would n't go as far as to say it tastes like , say , a Nestle chocolate milk or anything , but it 's solid . I still have to take big gulps , but I do n't have to chase it with anything after drinking , which is nice . It tastes solid , and I 'd venture to say it 's probably as good as chocolate protein gets . This is my second type of protein , the first being the strawberry flavor from Vitamin World . I say it 's on par with that .
 A few years ago I tried every vanilla protein powder out there . I was about to undergo bariatric surgery , and knew I would have to supplement with protein the rest of my life , so I wanted something that tasted great and was easy to use - or I might not keep up with it . Well ON Vanilla Ice Cream flavored whey protein fit the bill then and I 'm STILL drinking it . I drink it in cold two percent milk . It melts quickly without the need for a blender . It 's creamy without being thick . It tastes as good as melted Hagen Das vanilla ice cream . And unlike products that contain soy , I 've had no digestion problems with it .
 High quality protein with the right mixture of BCAAs , includes enzymes to make for easier absorption . Mixes very easily with just a shaker -LRB- hate having to use a mixer -RRB- . Best tasting whey protein I 've tried -LRB- out of ten or so -RRB- , especially the double-rich chocolate flavor . Highly recommended .
 I 've been a WHEY consumer for years now , and the `` Optimal Nutrition '' brand of WHEY products in my opinion has the best taste and disolves in milk/water the best .
 I 've been lifting for approximately 20 years and have tried numerous supplements and protein powders . This is by far the best protein powder I have ever used and I have been using it for the past 4 years . These are the main reasons why I like this protien over the numerous others I have tried in the past :1 -RRB- High protein vs. carb/fat ratio
 Not writing an in-depth product analysis , just posting to say I love this protein . It is decent in water , but I enjoy it the most in some light vanilla soy milk . Delicious in regular milk as well . Ca n't go wrong here . I do recommend a shaker for mixing , though ! Pretty impossible to fully dissolve with a spoon , same with any other brand of protein powder , however , so definitely not a con .
 One of the best tasting and working proteins I have tried . Would definitely recommend to everyone . Good rich proteins . Good taste . Cant get better : -RRB-
 This product mixes very well . It tastes good . I use it with either water of milk along with a banana or other fruit and some crushed ice .
 There really is n't anything bad to say about the quality of ON protein . They are ranked one of the best for a reason . As for the 10lber , I must admit , Double Rich Chocolate does get boring after a while . But then again , I 'm not into chocolate all that much . It was the only one I could get a good deal on . But if you like chocolate , this is good.As for Amazon , I must commend them for their super fast ridiculous shipping . I ordered this on 9/14 late afternoon PST and it arrived early in the morning on 9/16 . This is with the free super saver shipping . I was expecting it to come the very next week but it came so fast ! Keep it up Amazon !
 Easy to mix , tastes fantastic in anything ! Add diet orange soda and it 's like drinking a cream-cicle ! Best tasting powder I have ever had !
 Tastes good enough and dissolves easily . NitroCore24 is also a good choice , though much more expensive , it also tastes even better . I 'd recommend having this 100 % Whey before/after workout and the NitroCore24 before bed and/or in the morning .
 Have tried several different brands of protein powder and did n't like any of them . Read the reviews on this and deceided to try . It is very good . I mix with 1 cup of milk and a couple of ice cubes in a blender . If you like chocolate you will like this .
 Tastes and mixes much better than Jillian Michaels protein powder . Also , about 2/3 of a serving is equivalent to 1 Jillian Michaels serving .
 good price and good taste . Excellent taste , with water , milk or almond milk . Also a good price for high quality protein . I highly recommend it , and it 's the only brand and flavor I buy now
 One of the best when proteins out there . Most whey proteins if you look at the ingredients labels will have whey protein concentrate or some other less form of whey as their first ingredient . Not this on first one is When Isolate !!!
 Could n't be happier with this protein ! Defintaly works well . 24g of protein is a great ammout . And the added BCAAS and other stuff is a great addition to the protein , best of all it dosent taste like cardboard like most proteins ! The taste is actually really good , Esp with some added Peanut butter ! I defintaly highly recommend this product .
 If I had to review ON Whey with one word it would be `` Awesome `` Best Whey I have ever used by far . Me being into MMA and Crossfit , I look for a quality protein/meal supplement , and ON is by far the best . I 'm not going to say `` oh this stuff will get you jacked or that you will get massive gains '' because as a fighter I 'm not looking for that in any way , But I will say if you are looking for a quality protein supplement ON sets the bar for me and my training . But that 's just one mans opinion.Using Coffee flavor right now and man its SoOoOoOooo Good
 It is a good protein . Works well for me . I do not feel tried the following day after a workout . Taste is good . Does the job .
 This protein has helped me so much on my journey of fitness . Tastes amazing . High quality ingredients . But most importantly there are no fillers and dyes . Healthy all the way around and I will not change off of Optimum . All of their products are top notch .
 Been taking this for 3 years now and its the best protein supplement out of my experience . You do n't need me lecturing about the benefits of protein sups so I 'll only speak of why I prefer this over others . Double chocolate tastes great without being too sweet or filling . Mixes super easy in a cup with a spoon or a bottle , almost little to no lumps every time . Great price for the amounts of protein each serving contains . Available in big 10 pound bag , not all brands carries 10lbs . Definitely recommends this to all protein supplement users , beginners or experts , you will taste and feel the difference .
 Great protein supplement . In the past I have gotten the chocolate flavor , which also tastes good , but cookies and cream tastes great too . There are a lot of other people who can tell you why this is good protein so I wo n't bother with repeating anything . I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is looking for protein , especially for use with work outs .
 My wife prefers a higher protein breakfast and your typical cereal does n't have enough unless you want to eat oatmeal or shredded wheat all the time or Kashi which tends to go on sale less and were not really sold on the added soy protein that they add to their cereal so the ON Vanilla Ice Cream goes great with any cereal in the morning . She mixes it with fruit and whatever cereal she is into that day and even oatmeal from time to time . Mixes well with milk ... tastes great and goes along with pretty much anything since it 's vanilla . I just wich it was on sale more often .
 Delicious ! I would recommend this product . It tastes great and mixes well with milk . No lumps or anything like that .
 Best Whey . Excellent flavor . I have tried every type of Whey from numerous companies . Mixes well . Consumer Reports rates it the lowest in all the toxic heavy metals . Use to drink Muscle Milk but Consumer Reports reported that Muscle Milk is the highest in Lead , Mercury , Arsenic , cadmium and extremely toxic if taken three times a day . I do n't work for any company or Consumer Reports . My three muscular sons all drink this before and after their daily workouts . Have been using this product for over 5 years . Ca n't beat this price . I also buy the Optimum Nutrition Casein vanilla protein which tastes wonderful and better than vanilla whey .
 Pros1 -RRB- The product has everything I need in it , at the ratios I need them at . -LRB- Calorie v Protein count , BCAA 's , essential aminos -RRB- 2 -RRB- This whey blends great with everything , and leaves little to no clumping even when spoon mixed.Cons1 -RRB- Acesulfame potassium is used as a sweetener .2 -RRB- The cookies and creme flavor does n't quite taste OR smell right . Try a different flavor .
 Good product from Optimum , but caused a little too much bloating in me . First of all , I do n't think double rich chocolate is the best flavor when mixing with water . But when taken with milk , the flavor was a lot better , even enjoyable.I have now switched to Cookies and Cream . And though I 've heard many complain that it 's much too sweet , it tends to agree more with my stomach . The flavor is great , even when taken with water and bloating for me is greatly reduced . I do n't know why this is the case . But I think it might have to do with the differences in flavoring ingredients.My recommendation is do n't do what I did . 10lbs is too much to commit to without really knowing how this product will play with your body . Buy the smaller container and try different flavors to find out what works best for you .
 I bought the vanilla Ice cream and it is very tasty , the best tasting whey I have ever bought . I will definitely buy it again from now on .
 I 'm a huge fan of the Cake Batter flavor . Vanilla Ice-cream was alright , just not something I was eager to drink like the cake batter was . Chocolate is excellent , and I have n't tried many of the other flavors yet . Cake batter though ... so good .
 Despite what anyone else says , this is the best and most consistent Whey Protein powder on the market ... i 've had a lot of bad ones . It tastes awesome , no artificial-tastes ... have n't tried all of the flavors , I always alternate b/w the vanilla and either of the chocolate flavors - they are spot on delicious.A quick word about mixing/preparing these - Some reviewers make this so much more complicated than it has to be ... it 's this simple
 For the money this is the best protein out their . Taste wise it is above average for its low calorie standard . Do not expect a rich Muscle Milk type protein because this is not that . There is a reason MM is 200 calories more per serving . This does the job though , and has a decent taste .
 First off , the seller is great . Got the product in perfect condition in a timely manner . -LRB- Two days for me w / PRIME . -RRB- The protein tastes as good as any other whey I 've ever had . It mixes very well and I just use a small shaker cup and water and/or milk . No clumps or anything with one scoop whey . So everything is as to be expected.My only issue is the bag . The seal is like that of a cheap plastic ziplock bag . For me , opening this once or twice a day , the seal just does n't seem to last . Once the seal does n't close tightly , the protein takes on a bad taste -LRB- probably it going bad huh ? haha -RRB- , but I usually just stomach through it . I have left over 5 lb tubs , so what I do know is just dump in straight into the 5lb tubs and store it with those . A friend of mine just uses one 5 lb tub , and then wraps and seals the 10 lb bag , until done with the other.Either way I recommend you look into a new way to store it , but really I think Optimum Nutrition is the best protein I 've had . So far all the flavors have been decent . Just take into consideration what you may be mixing it with . Like do n't buy coffee flavor to make fruit smoothies , : -RRB-
 I have only been using the stuff for about two weeks , i have seen some muscle build . Which is good for this fast , my advise is to eat many protein filled meals such as tuna or red meat along with a protein shake to see better results . It definitely helps the building process and maybe some amino acid supplements to make sure your body is usng all the protein you take in . A major plus is that the extreme milk chocolate tastes pretty good . I like it .
 For the people who have gotten Whey Protein before , this flavor -LRB- Cookies and Cream -RRB- is pretty good . Two friends of mine got Vanilla and Strawberry and they both taste pretty bad but they both said they 'd rather have my flavor.Optimum Nutrition 's Whey Protein does the job - I take some with milk a few hours before my workout , a proportioned amount with water afterwards , and a little more before I sleep every night -LRB- to prevent long-term catabolism -RRB- and I 've been steadily gaining weight/muscle mass.This is a great buy and investment . Just be sure to get a good flavor or you 'll hate drinking this .
 like that it has glutamine & that it is all natural for the most part but ... the rocky road is ok as far as flavor . nothing special , i will definitely try other flavors .
 Great quality product . Tastes Great as well . Recommend it highly . Great quality for the price . Will continue to by this brand once this is finished .
 The whey protein by Optimum Nutrition works great for me as I have compared it to other whey protein shakes that I have purchased before . I seem to have adequate energy for work outs and recover fairly well when drinking this ON shake . It may not be for everyone especially if you prefer more tastier variations , but I can attest that this product is of fine quality and you surely will not regret purchasing it .
 I 've only tried the Vanilla , will be getting chocolate next time . Mixes up easy , tastes just fine mixing with water . Take 30 minutes after working out and keeps the boiler running till lunch .
 I had heard that Optimum Nutrition was an excellent product and now I can add my vote to its excellence . Good flavor , excellent for quick and lasting pick-me-up .
 I 'm on my second container of 5lb double rich chocolate this month . It tastes really good . I mix my protein powder with water because I 'm lactose intolerant . Sometimes it get my bloated , but It usually is n't a problem . I am seeing great results with ON . I 'm on a high protein low calorie diet . I 'm gaining strength aswell as shedding the fat at a good rate !
 tastes great , exactly what i expected ; mixes very well with anything and washes tremendously out of bottles . I bought the chocolate malt one and i am looking forward to trying new flavors .
 Recommended this Whey Protein for those who require a substanstial amount of protein in their diet . I bought 5 lbs of this product when i began my weightlifting journey back in December and so far it haas really helped my progress , I take it especially after working out to aid in recovery . IMO Optimum Nutrition has made the best protein Good taste , Good consistency , Good price ftom amazon , makes a Great Product .
 I 've had other flavors from Optimum Nutrition but this one by far tastes the best . I still want to try the Mocha one . Also does exactly what it is supposed to do . I use right before and right after a workout . Helps to keep me going .
 I always go with chocolate flavors when it comes to protein shakes . I just did n't think any other flavors could taste good enough to be actually tasty.But if you like bananas , this could be a perfect flavor for you . It tastes really good and it provides my body with protein in needs at night and after workout.I also added this protein powder to pancakes and the results were fantastic !! Yummy protein banana pancakes , for a banana lover like me , were like a miracle !
 I use this product after workouts and it seems to improve muscle mass and reduce soreness . It tasts great .
 I LOVE this stuff for 3 reasons :1 . Taste -- blend it with ice and you 've got a slushie that tastes great ! It goes down easy and keeps you full . Low in fat and carbs , too ! 2 . Quality -- tried lots of big name companies and this one is hands down the best . This truly gave me GREAT results . I 'm in the best physical shape of my life . I put on more than 5 pounds of muscle in the past 1 1/2 months ! And helped me get shredded at the same time .3 . Price -- hard to beat the price for what you 're getting . This company does n't blow its dollars on lots of advertising and instead uses it more wisely on R&D. ; I was drinking the strawberry flavored one but recently tried vanilla ice cream and wow ! ... things just got better ! I love the taste and found me something new . As expected the results have n't changed -LRB- which works for me -RRB- . I recommend this to all my friends . If you gave it a try you wo n't be disappointed .
 This is really a great protein . It gives you exactly what you need whether you 're trying to pack on some mass or jsut keep a healthy source of protein without any other junk.Pros-absolutely delicious -LRB- powder smells like a box of thin mints -RRB- - easily digestible for fast absorption rates-cheap -LRB- I got 2lbs of it here for $ 15 after I saved 15 % for the subscribe and save-mixes easily into milk or water-most reliable brand for proteinCons-Not as high quality as the Platinum HydroWhey -LRB- for the price its worth it -RRB- I recommend it
 I 've always trusted Optimum Nutrition when it comes to whey protein . It is one of the few brands that actually mixes well and I can stand to drink . I could n't find it any cheaper than here on Amazon .
 I have gained my weight by 10 pounds so far within a month . And still more than half of the supplement yet I have to finish . Simply , this 5 pound tub is worth 20-25 pounds .
 i 'm satisfied with this product . the strawberry falvour tasts good . i mix it with skim milk or make fresh fruit & yogurt smoothys with it .
 Rocky road is a great flavor , thanks to all the reviews below for recommending it ... I just had my first serving for breakfast , and it tastes just like cold Ovaltine . I had Strawberry flavored whey of a different brand with my last batch , and that was almost enough to make me swear off whey protein entirely . It tasted terrible.I would prefer ON without sucralose -LRB- Splenda -RRB- or acesulfame potassium , both of which are artificial sweeteners , but I 'm not overly concerned as I do n't take this product more than twice per day.Mixability was good , not great . It took me thirty seconds of stirring in a cup and I still had some clumps , which eventually went away . Probably will work better with shaker bottle .
 I first tried ON 100 % gold standard whey when I first hit the gym . It was good . Then I tried other cheaper brand due to financial constraints , and realized that it is n't the way to go . Results were inferior , had lots of bloating with other brands . This is the best brand of whey protein for the price . Indeed , it 's the gold standard when it comes to mixability , texture , taste .
 Choc Malt tastes good . Extreme Milk choc taste good too . Mixes beter than other protien powders that I have tried . Still wish it mixed up better.Extreme Milk Chocolate is the King of all protein
 This is the best whey protein you can get . Do n't take it from me though , just look at any fitness website and you 'll see it in the # 1 spot . AND amazon has the best price on it with free shipping ! Amazon is the greatest !!
 this i by far the best protein powder I 've ever tried . i have gone through countless tubs of powder to help my `` lean mass '' look , but no other protein powder has made as much of a difference as gold standard . it only has 24g which is perfect ! do n't be fooled by other protein powders claiming 50g because anymore then 25 and you will just shit it out . Like most protein you wo n't see an immediate change , but it will bring consistent results and make you feel great ! tastes amazing too !!
 I buy Optimum Gold Standard for my whey protein all the time . There are n't very many whey proteins that are better . A good place to check for ratings is bodybuilding.com they constantly have tests , ratings and reviews from serious body builders and people who train hard . Price is the selling point on this though . Just four years ago you could ge the ten pound bag for under $ 75 on Bodybuilding.com . It is at or above $ 100 on all sites now . The positive of getting it on Amazon though is the free shipping which will cost you at least $ 15 on BB.com . So I buy it through Amazon now as well .
 I have tried all kinds of protein powders and this is hands down the best tasting . It is reasonably priced , comes in a wide variety of flavors and mixes well . From what I have read Optimum Nutrition is considered to be one of the better proteins.All the flavors I have tried , except Vanilla Ice Cream , are full of flavor .
 ON is always the brand to beat in whey protein . It has the best performance , tasting , and amount of protein in each serving.Since ON has introduced 2 more options in this category , I 'll add in my comparisons . The cheaper alternative being Performance Whey , the standard being 100 % Whey Gold Standard , and Platinum Hydro Whey.Performance Whey does it 's job . It does deliver a good amount of protein per serving . However I notice that it does perform differently . It feels like I 'm absorbing weak ingredients and much more slowly . It definitely tastes sweeter than the other two . If you want cheap powder , I would still recommend this over any other brand . Also by far it is much better than any generic GNC or Vitamin Shoppe Whey . However , for that money I would invest in 2 boxes of protein bars .100 % Whey Gold Standard is the most reliable for me . If you can afford to buy performance whey , I suggest paying a little more for this . Compared to the others , Gold Standard Whey is more versatile . Since it is somewhat fast absorbing , but not too fast , I can drink it anytime during the day . This one I 've used it to get `` cut '' and also to gain mass -LRB- with added ingredients of course.I must say the Platinum Hydro Whey is my favorite . It is much finer and absorbs much quicker than the rest . It is the best IMO for post workout only . I see most results for 2 months of Hydro Whey .
 I drink one of these blended with some peanut butter and a banana after workouts . Tastes good , does n't cost too much , and lasts a long time .
 The taste is great , and the results too . Excellent protein to take it every day . It 's my second tube , and I will keep buying more .
 This was a great value for a quality protein powder . The taste was n't quite as good as the previous product I had used , but good enough to make it worth purchasing again . For price per serving and flavor , this product is definitely worth it .
 This stuff goes down smoothly and breaks up nicely with just a few shakes in my blender bottle . It tastes great as well even with just water . I 'll blend this with some frozen blueberries and blackberries and fat free milk and it goes down easy . Even the kids enjoy the taste so I 'll make them a small batch every once in a blue moon .
 I got the vanilla ice cream flavor and it 's definitely one of the best tasting whey protein I 've had . It does n't dissolve as well as I 'd like in milk but it digests very well and I 've had no gastro-intestinal complaints .
 The Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100 % Whey , Double Rich Chocolate is the best tasting and performing protein shake I have ever used .
 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PM9EE6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgSince I had weight loss surgery in February , almost anything I try to eat I barf . I 'm living on nuts , salad , and `` frozen milkshakes '' made of powdered whey , powdered milk , Torani sugar-free Syrup , and occasionally lemon juice and sugar-free Tang . Optimum Nutrition 100 % whey protein , in double rich chocolate flavor and vanilla flavor , is the whey I use . Without it I fear I would starve . Fortunately it is delicious .
 For those of you that dont like thick shakes , this one is for you . It is a very thin shake when mixed . Like drinking chocolate milk .
 I have been overweight -LRB- 150 lbs . overweight -RRB- most time of my life , and as a 24 yrs young woman , was hard to develop long lean muscles , but this product -LRB- plus my diet and exercises -RRB- , is really helping me to make it through my goal.It does n't taste like Nesquick , but is really great for smoothies , I prepare it with water to minimize the calorie intake , and it taste good .
 This is my favorite ON protein so far . I 've tried soy , egg , casein natural , aftermax and I like this one best so far.Good service from the shipper too .
 Been using Optimum whey protein for years . Priced right , tastes good and mixes well with milk or water .
 Whether it 's any better in terms of results compared to other protein is something I would never be able to discern . The stuff tastes absolutely delicious and to be frank , it 's almost a bit too rich , but it mixes nicely and whether it 's with water or milk it 's a darn good drink . I 've decided to try another ON flavor for my newest protein -LRB- double rich chocolate -RRB- which is a bit more subdued but still pretty good . I dig the products though and will buy it again when I 'm low on protein .
 I bought the double chocolate cause it 's on sale and I 've read a lot of good things about ON . To me the taste is nothing to write home about , pretty much the same as other brands . It sits real well in my stomach after drinking it ... I 'm lactose intolerant and some other brands upset my stomach a bit , no problem whatsoever is Gold Standard . I 'll probably stick to this brand .
 Arrived quickly and without incident . Tastes decent with water , and quite a bit better with milk . Very good `` bang-for-your-buck '' powder .
 I actually served up a serving of the banana cream with a real banana and half a mango , and some crushed ice . It tasted great ! The only thing that could have been better was adding in some ice cream ... I like the results of the ON Whey because of the Aminos they add in their recipe . I feel recovered faster of good workouts and getting great results .
 Really impressed with this protein shake . I mix it with 6 oz of skim milk , and it is so easy to drink . I will keep ordering this product . I love the double rich chocolate flavor .
 You simply can not beat this price and quality . The whey protein tastes delicious -LRB- double chocolate -RRB- and the price is very good . This is my second time ordering this product and now i 'm ordering double the amount because u get a nice price break and it will last me a lot longer . Highly recommended
 Powder dissolves easily , tastes great , and has the right proportion of protein per scoop . Have been consistently using this product with my workouts . Has helped me to obtain great results .
 OK first let me start off by saying I 've been messing with these flavors for years . chocolate , double rich chocolate , Vanilla , cookies and cream ... . UGGGGHHHHHHH they make me sick just thinking about them now . So I read some reviews online and found that people were saying the banana cream mixes better and masks the whey taste you get with some of the others.I jumped in and ordered it ... . WOW it mixes easily and taste sooo good if you like bananas like me this is a no brainier .
 There are over 1000 reviews so not much more to say . Purchased the vanilla ice cream flavor . Its very mild and almost tasteless when mixed with water . I 'm ok with that and would rather my protein have less additives . I got it at a great price here on Amazon but not from Amazon . Amazon would not let me publish my first review when I mentioned the seller , I do n't now why but that is . Its the only other seller with same price and free super saver shipping . Put two in your cart and proceed to checkout you 'll see a nice surprise .
 I prefer the natural gold std whey , but I was bored with the lack of flavors so I bought this . It 's actually really tasty with milk -LRB- I use vanilla soy milk -RRB- . Its not that bad with water either . I think buying the 5lbs was an over kill . I will probably try something different if I can actaully get thru all this . I still use the gold std whey natural vanilla as my go to post work out drink .
 this protein is very delicious !! but it should equal 2 5LB containers but it does n't . maybe because it goes down when its still shipping . but i would recommend
 I 've been using ON whey for a couple years now . Through heavy lifting and high protein intake , I have had immense strength gains . The ON protein seems to work well , it mixes well , and tastes relatively good . -LRB- Not many protein powders taste good , but that 's not the point . You are n't eating it for taste . You are eating it to PWN ALL NOOBS . Grow up and chug . -RRB- Toodles , B
 This is one of the best protein supplement I have had in the last 5 years that I have been using them .
 The delievery was fast and arrived promptly . The product is expensive , but is one of the best out there .
 This is the most delicious , clean protein you can get for the price ! I have used it for the past 4 years and absolutely love it !
 Optimum Nutriton 's Gold Standard is the best protein you can buy for the money . It 's great post work out and tastes good . You ca n't go wrong with this stuff .
 10 lbs of protein might be a bit of overkill , but if you are planning on working out , especially weight lifting , this stuff can go quick . The rocky road flavor is good , not too much different than a chocolate , and the powder blends very well , even with just water , which is the way I use it most of the time . All in all it is a great product .
 I have used this brand for several years , in different flavors . I have also tried different brands with various formulations of types of protein included -LRB- some cheaper , many not -RRB- . I always come back to Optimum Nutrition , it mixes instantly and the Vanilla Ice Cream mixes well with anything . I especially like it in smoothies with orange juice ... tastes just like a Creamcicle ice cream -LRB- Dixie cups -RRB- . It only requires one scoop where other require 2 , and it mixes quickly with only a spoon -- no shaker bottle or blending involved & no lumps left .
 Choclate taste to satiate your craving & tastes great ! Yumm - best product on the market .
 This tastes very good . I describe it as a cold version of how hot chocolate tastes . It is not grainy at all when shaken or blended . I use this as a breakfast to go .
 I 've been using Optimum Nutrition products for years . A couple of years ago I found a couple of jugs of whey protein I purchased did n't mix the greatest . It would leave large clumps in the blender . I figured maybe the switched the recipe so I switched to another brand for awhile . About a month ago I decided to try ON again and was pleased when it mixed up smooth.The only reason I did n't give it a 5 star is the strawberry flavor left kind of a funky aftertaste and its gotten a little pricey . Just in the time since I purchased this product the price has went up $ 6 . I had heard the price of whey went up but the other brand I buy is $ 10 less for the same 5 lbs jug so its hard for me to justify spending the extra on the ON brand . If it comes down in price I would defiantly purchase again .
 The price is good -LRB- on some flavors -RRB- and they taste good . Great for a quick meal after the gym . Ive been buying this stuff for about a year now , would definitely recommend it .
 This product came highly recommended for value and quality . Recommendations did not disappoint . It has all the good stuff which other people have gone into detail about and best of all it does not taste terrible ! That is a big thing for me other products similar I have tried did n't taste very good but this was n't bad . If you have ever drank nutritional shakes before you know that none of them taste great but this one was n't too bad just had a bit of a chalky aftertaste .
 ON always makes a good quality product . I personally like the vanilla ice cream flavor because it is more dynamic of a flavor . You can get sugar free cocoa and mix it in to make it chocolate , adding good flavor and fiber . I recommend buying from `` Hamilton Shop '' . They have super fast shipping and great customer support , they even gave me a sample packet of another ON product which is awesome .
 This is the besst protein out there . Great for post workouts and also as a meal replacemmet . I wish amazon would n't have stopped the subscribe and save for this item . The price is a little high but well worth it for an excellent protein that gets obsorbed into the body quickly .
 This protein powder is GREAT ! -LRB- vanilla & cookies and cream -RRB- taste great . It mixes quite easily in a cup or shaker and blends well with a bannana and strawberrys . Its packed with protein ... just read the label and thats all you need to know !
 I love this protein . This was my first protein powder and I recommend it to others . It 's cheap , does what it has to do and tastes good.Arrived on time and the tub is not damaged .
 I do Protein Sparing Modified Fasts , which are pretty restrictive , so the things you can eat , you want to taste good.I 've been through at least 10 different protein powders , and they all have their own explanation of why they beat all the others . They also all claim to taste THE BESTEST !!! 11 ! 1 . They do n't . Some of them are downright disgusting.Granted , I am not a weight trainer or an athlete , just someone with whom sugar does not really agree and who wants to lose weight . PSMFs are fast , effective , and nixing the sugar makes me feel a thousand times better . Because I 'm not looking for any specific nutritional punch , just something for a meal supplement , my main concerns are carb count , protein quantity and taste.The carb count is low . Just a couple of grams per serving.The protein count is higher than a lot of others , which range from 16 to 20 on average . This one has 25 . The taste is great ! Do n't get me wrong , I much prefer the taste of a rich , thick , sinful vanilla or chocolate shake , but for what it is , this stuff is really good . There is no grainy texture , no lumps , no aftertaste , and even in water -LRB- with just a tablespoon of cream for richness ... yes , I know that 's cheating on the PSMF , but I do it anyway and it still works -RRB- it rivals a pretty good glass of chocolate milk . This was for the chocolate malt flavor . I have the vanilla but I have n't gotten into that one yet.GNC had it on sale for 25.99 and knowing what it tastes like now , I 'll likely go grab a couple more tubs of it .
 love this . it is a much more cost effective way to purchase protein than going with the bottles plus the bag looks way more badass
 taste has been improved.mixing is wonderful.effectiveness is super only if you work out regularly.i have been using this protein for almost 4 years already.i tried many protein supplements and i think this is the best one.i recommend !
 This is my second shipment of ON Whey protein . It is the best bang for the buck . I did my research and ON met my needs the best , at the lowest price as well . It mixes easily , but on occasion does clump up . I usually make some smoothies with it , or take it mix with 2 % milk or some soy milk . I wouldnt recommend it with pure water , tried it once and could hardly stomach it . Tasted too too horrible with pure water . This of course is my personal taste , so stick with milk or smoothies . Overall great product , great tasting and cheap as well .
 In my admittedly limited experience with protein powder , I 've found many brands to be poor tasting and extremely difficult to blend . While I will leave the more technical analysis of this product to people with more experience with protein powder , I definitely recommend it for its ease in mixing and great taste . Plus it costs about the same amount per pound as other brands I 've found .
 I found that this product mixes very well with water . It dissolves very easily and it is quite tasty . Mint - Chocolate was a nice rich flavor.As for the actual quality of protein etc. , I am a novice , but the results were as good as could be expected for a novice lifter . I will be purchasing this product again once I run out .
 Great protein powder that is not too sweet and taste like chocolate milk when missed with milk . It is sweetened with acesulfame potassium -LRB- Ace K -RRB- and is the only disappointment.It would be perfect if it was made with Truvia -LRB- Stevia -RRB- .
 I like this product a lot.the price is right , youre not paying extra just for the name on it * cough * * cough * * muscletech * * cough * its filtered many times so its almost pure protein . 24g per serving which is really good considering everything else is so low , i.e. fat.i got double chocolate and i think it taste pretty good , especially with milk.i havent notice any digestion problems , and no upset stomach.overall i think this is one of the best products for the price you can get , i definitely recommend this , im buying my second bag as i type this review .
 I 've read some negative reveiws of this product mainly because of the taste . The Milk Chocolate , however , must be an exception . I thought is was very tasty , even with just water and it dissolves nicely . I did n't get the bloated feeling I got from other whey brands .
 This is one of the best tasting whey protein powder I ever had in my 20 + years of taking supplements . However , since it was my first time using it , I have yet to feel the effect of it as compared to a similar product I purchase from Samn 's club . I 'll have to order it again and provide better results , if any , at a later date . To date , it has been only a month since I started using this brand of whey protein .
 I have been using this for close to a year now . No other brand can beat this product . Period . Absolutely awesome whey . Mixes instantly . Complete pack of amino .
 I buy the double rich chocolate , the taste its very good mixed whit water its like a cocoa or ovaltine drink.The product mixed very well i dont need a blender , i use only a shaker cup.I drink this after my workouts -LRB- best moment for drink -RRB- , and helps me to give some protein for my body 24 grams per scoop -LRB- its like eat a piece of chiken or meat -RRB- . Use a combination of high protein foods and suplements for building muscle.I play basketball and go to the gym and this product its the best whey protein i drink.After 3 months of hard training i gained 5 lbs of muscle -LRB- specialy shoulders and biceps -RRB- OVERALL : TASTE : very good -LRB- go to the basics Chocolate , Vainailla , Strawberry -RRB- MIXING : dont need a blender if you shake whit waterPRICE : I buy 2 lbs . for $ 15 bucks its a giftDIGESTION : GoodPD : Trainig hard , eat good , drink whey -LRB- after your workouts -RRB- and sleep 8 hours , is the best way you bulding muscles.For 15 bucks you have a good dose of protein , sometimes the people spend this money in beer in weekends .
 I have never tried protein shakes before , so I did my research before I bought this product . I am glad I ended up buying it . I enjoy the taste and I can feel the difference after a good workout at the gym . I feel recouperated very shortly after I drink my shake . I recommend making a shake using a blender and experiment with different fruits and other ingredients to make your shake taste even better and for added benefits . Hope you enjoy it as much as I do .
 Product just as expected , not my favorite flavor . . a little bland , but hey that 's my preference , can always try something different next time . . Would recommend it though
 This flavor is much better than any flavor I have tried from this brand , among others . I would stay away from the vanilla , but thats just me I guess .
 Love this purchase ! Could n't be a better protein . tastes good . dissolves quickly . and it is good for anyone to use .
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard , Double Rich Chocolate , 5 PoundIt is simply the best whey protein in the market .
 This is by far the only good tasting protein shake i have had yet , i will defiantly recommend it to someone that has n't tried it yet .
 This is one of the best products , but I did not like the banana cream flavor , I will be trying another flavor .
 I was taking Pro Complex by ON , but the price of that was just too much . I decided to try these instead and love it . Not only is it affordable , but it tastes really good . I usually mix it with fat free milk and it pretty much tastes like a chocolate shake with a hint of the protein taste . Although this has less protein per serving compared to Pro Complex , it will benefit most people who use it in their diet and workout routine .
 i love this brand of protein . I have tried all brands and this is the only brand i will ever use from now on . Only reason i didnt give this one a 5 star is the taste . I did n't care for this one as much as I likes the chocolate mint . but it is still pretty damn good
 Great taste , high in everything good and low and everything bad at a great price . I have been using it for years and with amazon you do not have to pay for shipping .
 I 've been using this whey protein for a couple of years , and I 'm definitely a big fan of the product . This is n't the cheapest protein that you 'll be able to find , but it 's also not the most expensive . Optimum Nutrition 's Gold Standard is solid protein powder for the price that tastes great and mixes well.Most of the time I have this powder -LRB- double rich chocolate -RRB- mixed with a spoon in a glass of skim milk . In the past I 've tried plenty of protein powders that essentially turn into cement at the bottom of the glass , but I do n't have that problem with this product - it dissolves/mixes in well and goes down smooth . Occasionally I get fancy and get out the blender , adding a banana , strawberries , almonds , etc. and this protein works great there too . I 've tried plenty of protein powder in the past that leave a nasty aftertaste in your mouth , but this Gold Standard does n't have this problem and does taste fantastic - I actually look forward to drinking these shakes . Highly recommended!UPDATE
 Chose this as my first whey after reading a ton of different reviews . The Double Rich Chocolate flavor is weak with water and slightly better in milk . Clean nutritional profile , though . 1g fat , 1g carbs , and 24g protein a scoop . At a rate of two scoops per day , the 2lb jug will last half a month . Plan accordingly.Summary
 I 've tried several different brands , kinds , and flavors of protein , and Optimum Nutrition 's whey is without doubt one of the highest quality . Mixes great in a shaker , tastes good , and offers a great price per serving . Everything I could ask for .
 Since im not a person that goes to the gym as much as he would like , nor someone that will spend 3 hours there every time he goes i needed a supplement to help me recover after those days that i manage to workout , this has been working greatly for me , i normally use it on the afternoons immediately after the workout , the flavor is actually good if you mix it with milk , not so much if you do it with water , but the benefits are apparent , maybe not physically but I do not feel so tired and out of energy as i did before taking this , hopefully it will help me increase muscular mass but as far as helping me recover energy it does great !
 This is a good tasting , quality protein . I have definitely had better , but am not complaining at all . It performs as expected , not better or worse .
 It is been good for my health , I am a 75 years old and for the first time I feel strong . Alfonso
 It does seem like a very good and quick protein source , though . It was said in a review that this tastes better than smoothie king 's gladiator . Just wanted to add that it does n't , in my opinion . This one has a considerable chemical -LRB- maybe sweetener -RRB- taste to it that SKs does n't have . SK is like 45 bucks , though .
 Good flavors , I 've tried both the double chocolate and french vanilla and I liked them more than other brands . Recommended .
 This protein is very high-quality . It tastes great - like Muscle Milk , but with much less fat and few carbs . Also , it is packed with BCAA 's and glutamine . I highly recommend this product .
 this is a pretty good thing if u are trying to get big or muscular . it doesnt have too many calories and it is easily digestable .
 In bodybuilding you need to keep nutrition in your system constantly . I put three tablespoons into a mini 20oz Blender Bottle and fill with non-fat milk to go with breakfast , lunch , dinner , and sometimes when I just feel hungry . The stuff actually taste great , too !
 Optimum nutrition products exceed my expectations every time . This is yet another wonderful protein product . Mixes extremely well , tastes GREAT !!! Very chocolatey , no gritty taste and best of all no after taste . Truly some of the best made products on the market .
 this stuff is great . Im an actor/model in Chicago and working out and looking great is my life . Working out 2 hours a day , i need the best protein out there and this stuff is not only that , it tastes better than all the rest . I sprinkle some on my cereal in the morning it tastes so good .
 I have tried several protein supplements , and ON has been the best by far that i have tried . Worth the money . I recommend all of ON 's supplements .
 My number one product was Designer whey protein and this is the first time I use the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100 % Whey . The tast is ok if you drink it with water or milk only . I choosed the dark choclate flavor so it 's not sweet at all . I used to enjoy the designer taste better . As far as the results , I do n't see it yet because I 'm not consuming it on a regular basis but my friends got big and cut using it . The level of protein is higher in it than other protein shakes and the price is reasonable . I would recommend it for others .
 I was very pleased w/this particular protein drink . I can not have lactose products and have difficulty finding a protein drink that does n't upset the stomach . This one does n't . The taste is good & it mixes better than many brands -LRB- We use a fork instead of spoon to mix ! -RRB- I carefully scrutinized the ingredients , the nutritional value etc. and found this particular brand/type to be the best overall and the most tolerable on the stomach . The price was competitive , too . Good purchase ...
 this is the best protein for quality/taste/price you can not go wrong ordering this ... I suggest the rich chocolate thats the best .
 Not much to say , its a tried and true product that alot of people stand behind . Tastes good , low cals and carbs , and a good does of protein . What more could you want ?
 Taste great and mixes well . Ive been using it for over a year ! Great as a breakfast shake or a booster right before a workout .
 I ordered the Extreme Milk Chocolate flavor . I mix it with 8 ounces of whole milk and it tastes like chocolate milk with a little malt to it . Definitely the best tasting whey I have ever had . I actually look forward to taking it as my treat several times a day .
 This is my favorite flavor from ON . It tastes so good , and it is the perfect reward after a hard workout .
 I 'm already a Gold Standard fan . After trying many other products , I believe this one is absolutely top tier . It arrived quickly and well packed . No issues .
 Tasted great for about halfway through the container . After that the strawberry novelty wore off and I had the force it down . Went back to good ol' chocolate .
 This is just white noise as it falls in line with hundreds of other positive reviews , if you are using a different whey -LRB- that is n't made by ON -RRB- you are wasting money .
 Mixes easily with little or no clumping , tastes great , high nutritional content for the price . This is a great &#34; post &#34; drink for workouts when you just ca n't get to a real meal soon enough or even in the morning before a race . The only drawback is it does n't really fill you up if you 're hungry in my opinion . The price seems steep for the 5 lb . jar , but it lasts a long time and it 's nice to have around .
 Have tried all kinds and and all flavors of whey proteins that are out there . The gold standard whey works great for my digestive system -LRB- I am trying to gain and go thru like 13-15 scoops a day -RRB- . Have seen great results , love the taste , the price and the results . Banana is my fav and I think least ` powdery ' of all the other flavors when you are mixing it with water . Be sure to use an electrical blender though .
 Not bad for the money and taste good with milk.Mix with water not so great . I give it a B + . thank you
 This is a very good product for the price . It delivers a big protein bang for the buck and keeps fat and sugar to a minimum . The flavor is good when mixed with water and great with milk . Hard to go wrong with this stuff .
 Giving this one 5 stars because it 's one of the few whey powders I have tried that when mixed with the correct portion of milk , taste good enough to look forward to a tasty treat . Flavor is mild strawberries and cream , fairly light and has a fair amount of sweetness to it.The taste combined with better-than-most protein content makes this a strong recommendation for anyone who wants a strong departure from the standard chocolate/vanilla flavors .
 USE IT EVERYDAY . . Love this , got it on a subscription to save even more money . Taste is n't the greatest at first , but one gets used to it . I 'm at a point where I feel that it tastes like chocolate . . Its packed with protein , and good for you . What else is needed to say . . Big tub , I thought it was way smaller . Works well .
 This powder is great for what I use it for , which is post-workout recovery drinks in a shaker bottle and smoothies in a blender . It mixes easily in the shaker bottle , tastes great , and wo n't break the bank .
 Optimum Nutrition is the only whey I will buy . I have tried other brands , but none of them offer the taste , high protein content and quality that ON does for the price . I have tried TONS of their flavors , but my favorites are
 Exactly what you need if you 're looking for protein powder . Tastes better than regular chocolate shakes if you make a shake out of it ; peanut butter , a scoop of this , milk and bananas and it tastes 100x than a high sugar milkshake . I have n't tried any other flavor other than the double chocolate so I do n't have much to compare to , but it does taste just fine in regular water too . Dissolved just fine in water as well . 70 servings for 40 dollars , ca n't go wrong with that ! I 've been buying them every month now , have two shakes a day . Works out fantastic !
 I dont know if there is much more to say . ON is already known as one of the best brands out there for whey protein . Chocolate mint does n't disappoint . I picked it up because it was on sale and i figured I could get through the box even if it was n't that bad . But it turns out the mint is not very strong and believe it or not this goes great with bananas and milk in a protein shake . It 's been about 4 weeks and I 'm still enjoying it .
 I 've been using this product for more than one year and it 's done great things . The quality of the protein is really good and the taste is great . If you want it to work for you , just make sure to know how many grams of protein you need each day , substract those you get from meals , and have the rest with whey protein . I take 5 servings a day and I do n't gain any fat , just pure muscle .
 GREAT PRODUCT GREAT GLASS GREAT BEER GREAT GREAT GREAT A + ALMOST AT THE WORD MINIMUM SO i CAN SUBMIT THIS REVIEW , GOT IT .
 one of the best tasting whey proteins i 've ever tried . definitely tolerable . it makes taking protein shakes after workouts more enjoyable than it should be .
 Do n't be fooled by the size of this container . When I opened this whey drink , the container was only half full . I paid for shipping empty plastic and that ticks me off . Yeah , I know the `` contents may settle in transport '' cop out . But if it had not been fluffed before it was shipped ; this container would be smaller and more convenient to use.The whey drink has a slightly bitter over taste , which is strange as I 've never known whey protein to be bitter . It is the usually cloyingly sweet . I doubt there 's much to be done about that though.If you come from a dairy farm as I do , then you are prepared for whey protein to smell like the milk replacer used when calves are weaned . This does n't have that taste and odor and I was happily surprised at that . I have had bariatric surgery and I need to drink at least 20 grams of protein a day without raising my blood glucose too high . So far this product looks like it will meet that requirement .
 I really like the protein powder , The product taste great and I look forward to taking it every day . As a nutritional consultant I can highly recommend this product to my clients . I really like adding in someChia Seeds 2 Pounds All Natural Black Chia Seedsand mixing them in my shake for a added nutritious punch .
 You can decrease the size of container for the protein powder . It 's not fit the volume of powder in it .
 double rich chocolate taste great . It mixes well so , blender is not necessary . Great protien content per serving and one of the best values .
 I am working on my second bag of this . I think it tastes great and its an excuse to drink chocolate milk 3 times a day . I use it because I started lifting weights several months ago and I want to make sure that I am taking in enough protein . Seems inexpensive to me as well . I will continue to buy this product ... especially if the price goes down further . wink wink .
 This product works well for me and is resonably priced . The flavor is ok , but is not awful . I mix it in a shaker with either a cup of milk or a cup of light soy milk , and makes for a smooth drink . I 'm on the go a lot , and this helps me boost my protein when I may not be eating enough .
 Great for berry shakes , but does have Splenda/sucrolose in it . If I can remember correctly , some people are saying sucrolose causes memory loss :--RRB- Buy Designer Whey All Natural for a product sweetened with Stevia -LRB- a natural sweetener from the leave of the Stevia plant -RRB-
 tastes great and can be blended easy with a spoon . Works best if you take immediately before and right after workout for the energy . Great product overall and it is cheap .
 With milk it has a tendency to clump but does n't clump in water . It does taste good in water but even better with milk . The taste for double chocolate is heavenly with no bad after taste . I highly recommend giving this Whey a try .
 This product dissolves quickly and cleanly , I use a small immersion blender to drop into the glass of milk and 10 seconds later , I 'm good to drink . No clumps . Tastes great and 2 of these pups per day with my regimen have equaled 3 lbs of lean muscle . Not a bad trade-off . 5lbs of protein ~ 3lbs of muscle .
 It 's sometimes hard to find what I am looking for in a small town , and driving to the city can get expensive with gas priced and all . I found the protein that I use , in the flavor that I like at an outstanding price . Shipping was fast , my whole experience was great .
 We bought this for a recipe but wound up using it mostly to make shakes . It tastes great and has the benefit of having only 5 grams of carbs per serving , which is great if you 're on Atkins or South Beach .
 This is the best nutritional shake of any kind that I 've had . Mixed with 2 % milk the Double Rich Chocolate tastes great -LRB- I wish I could drink it all day -RRB- and it mixes really well with just a spoon , not clumping up like other brands . I first got this at GNC and was turned off by the price but it 's half as much here on Amazon so it 's perfect . I ca n't speak for the other flavors but I can highly recommend the Double Rich Chocolate .
 I like it . I like the Chocolate and the Vanilla . The strawberry SMELLED like strawberry but did n't TASTE like strawberry .
 I 've been drinking the double-rich chocolate regularly for about a year now . It is outstanding and not difficult to drink at all . I work out in the morning before I eat , and my after-exercise protein shake holds me over for about 2.5 - 4 hours.I blend a scoop of powder , 8 oz skim milk , and a half cup of berries until smooth . Then I start adding ice -LRB- maybe a cup or so -RRB- to the blender . This makes two huge glasses of great protein shake - I drink them both while keeping in mind that it 's just a cup of milk , a half cup of berries and the powder . What fills two very large glasses is mostly ice and air.I 've used all kinds of berries/cherries , and my favorites in order are
 I 've been using ON Gold Standard Whey for awhile . I 'd previously used numerous brands including , EAS , Body Fortress , & Muscle Milk -LRB- ick -RRB- . This is the best tasting and best quality of the proteins I 've used . I usually go with Double Rich Chocolate or Vanilla . However , I decided to try a different route this order , and purchased the special edition Coffee flavor . Now , I thought ON double rich chocolate was the best whey I 've ever tasted until I got the Coffee . The coffee is flat out delicious . It tastes just as good mixed with water as it does with milk . It has a slight coffee ice cream or frappacino like taste . The only issue I have with it is it does contain real coffee , so that means there 's 40mg of caffeine per serving . I quit drinking caffeine a couple of years ago and really should have checked closer before buying it . That said it 's still delicious , but I have to be careful with it in my post workout shakes if I work out at night .
 I thought any flavor of whey could taste barely tolerable at best -LRB- Optimum 's Chocolate was the least unpleasant , but still -RRB- . Well , I just received Optimum 's Coffee flavor , and it is killer ! Even with water , it 's so good , I actually feel like having another for no protein-related reason . It was a bit more expensive than the more available flavors of the same brand , but to me the difference is well worth the extra few bucks.For the record , I purchased the flavor listed as `` Coffee '' , and the bottle I received says `` Coffee - Limited Edition Flavor '' on the label , while the product image on the Coffee listing reads `` Mocha Cappuccino '' . There 's also another flavor listed as `` Mocha Cappuccino '' , with the same product image . They might be different products , though the one I have tastes just like those Starbucks Mocha Cappuccino bottles , so one of them is probably a newer bottle label .
 I received the chocolate on time and I have to say that it works beautifully . My recovery of muscles were good to the point to where I felt no soreness the next day and allowed my muscles to get stronger . This did the job that it promised to do for not a bad price either . Good product .
 Before buying this product , I have gone through multiple whey proteins . This one trumps them all.Nutritionally , it has the least amount of cholesterol of any whey protein on the market , as well as having less than 1 gram of saturated fats -LRB- .5 g -RRB- . Taste-wise , ON 100 % Whey Extreme Milk chocolate IS thee best tasting whey protein product on the market . Honestly , I thought it tasted just like a CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE ?!?! No desert for me anymore , just ON Milk Chocolate 100 % Whey.PS
 This is a great way to stock up on protein ... the cookies and cream flavor is very good . I would reccommend to anyone seriously attaining a fit body . This vendor was great to work with .
 Delivery was super fast only 2 days and also free . Product was sealed on the out site and in site . Mix ability is 100 % and you don t have to use to much shaking around . Taste is in the perfect line , not too sugary but not too plain . I like strawberry cause is less polluting than chocolate or banana that makes me sleepy . Strawberry is more energetic for me and my taste buds . Digestion is almost un noticed . If you will take too much you may get your lungs to work faster and you can start to fill restless -LRB- your respiratory system will try to help stomach to move excess protein that does n't fit anymore in your cells -RCB- . So is better to go with servings designed to use this product correctly . You do n't want to look like PIG . , !!!
 I swear by this protein and recommend it to everyone that is starting to work out or looking for protein . I have found that , for a reasonable price , this is one of the leanest protein powders that you can buy . It tastes amazing with milk and just takes a couple of days to get used to it with water.This fits a small niche for people that are looking strictly for protein . This does n't have a huge amount of calories and wo n't bulk you up fast because it 's NOT a gainer -LRB- though some may think all protein shakes are supposed to do that -RRB- . This is for strict protein intake.Serving sizes are about 30g and with 24g of protein , it fits well . 5lbs will last me about 1.5 / 2 months with 2 servings a day .
 I recently switched from the ON over to the Twin Labs . I consider it a mistake . The ON is definitely the better tasting product , and it mixes much better . I would recommend it over the Twin Labs to anyone.I have only tried the chocolate in both brands though .
 Good stuff and , from everything I 've read , the best on the market . I 'm working on 2 lbs of the French Vanilla Creme
 Great price for a tub of this size . Warning , tastes horrible in water , but tastes JUST like regular chocolate milk when mixed with milk . It says to only mix one scoop , but that 's only 25g of protein . Mix two scoops every time you drink it . You can mix the two massive scoops in as little as 8 ounces of milk and it will taste just fine without any undisolved chunks .
 I bought this after several positive feedbacks from other users well reputable bodybuilding and health & fitness boards and it 's a quality product . It 's a great post workout ingredient and I will try other flavors as I run out of this one .
 Out of all the Whey Protein shakes I have tried , this is the best tasting . It still leaves a chalky taste/feeling in your mouth , but if you rinse you mouth with a swig of water it goes away . Overall I am satisfied with the Gold Standard Double Rich Chocolate , and will be buying it again when I run out .
 Hands down , this is the best Protein powder a person can invest in.The Good : - Minimal calories -LRB- 120 calories per scoop -RRB- - Very low carbs and sugars-High quality protein.-High amount of protein person serving -LRB- 24 grams -RRB- Compare to others that only give you 20-22 grams per serving.-Best tasting protein powder i 've used . Tastes just like chocolate milk when using skim milk . Not grainy , chunky , and no bad aftertaste.-Mixes easily and well.-Great price for the quantity you get.The Bad-NOTHING ! This protein is recommended for people who do moderate workouts . For intense bodybuilding or mass gains , go with a different powder since this is low in calories .
 I have been a user of Optimum Nutrition 's protein powders for many years . They usually have a good flavor , and mix well . I used to really like the dutch chocolate flavor of their `` pro complex '' formulation , since the early 90 's or so.Well , lately have been trying some new flavors to see how it goes , you get tired of just chocolate and vanilla . Well , just tried this Chocolate Malt , it is good ! It tastes like the Whoppers candy does . Good taste , and not aftertaste.Also very good is the extreme milk chocolate . I like these 2 chocolates better than the `` double rich '' chocolate , maybe am just getting tired of that one after several years.Cookies and cream sounds good but is not . Good at first , but odd aftertaste . Same thing with Rocky Road , I just did n't like the taste.Vanilla ice cream is very good . I like to add protein to some milk and take it with me in my lunch . Also good is the `` Cake Batter '' - funny name , but tastes good.My wife says the Caramel Toffee is a good choice too , it smells very good at least.The strawberry I 've tried in the past , that was a good flavor too . Have not tried banana , coconut , etc.So in summary there are some good flavors Optimum makes , and it is cheaper to order online vs. the retail store . Oh yes - and get a good shaker or too . My favorite is the smaller sized -LRB- 16 oz ? -RRB- `` Blenderbottle '' - it is sturdy , mixes things smoothly , and is easy to wash out . And here on Amazon it is around $ 6 . Order a couple so you have a backup . Also great to take when you travel . Also like the Tupperware shaker bottle , that is around $ 10 . So I hope this is helpful info to the reader . My newer policy is to try a new flavor in as small a container as you can order . Then if it is crap , you can try to give it away , or throw it away , and you are not out so much $ $ . : -RRB-
 I 'm an average-skinny build 22 year old . I was looking to gain some muscle mass and build more all around body definition . Purchased the Double Rich Chocolate flavor about 6 months ago . I started to commit myself and seriously work out about 45 mins . every Other day . within 3 weeks I noticed more definition in my arms and in a little over a month and a half my stomach was getting more toned . Now after about 6 months , I 'm starting to form what looks like a six pack . I 'm amazed at how well this stuff works for me . I mix two scoops with 16 oz . of skim milk every morning and on workout days I have 1 serving with milk before my workout , and one after . My first 5lb . Tub lasted me about 3-4 months.How can I complain.The pros : Taste
 I 've used Optimum Nutrition 's Whey Protein for many years and always loved it . Occasionally I have tried other brands and always come back . The price is right and the flavors are usually great . Double Rich Chocolate tastes alright . I 'm not going to lie , it does n't have the best taste . It used to taste quite a bit better but over the years the flavor has changed . Not as good as it used to be but the ingredient list has been improved . With 24 grams of protein and 5 BCAA 's , yet only 3 carbs , you ca n't go wrong!The powder mixes easily in any shaker bottle . I usually mix it with water , but it tastes better if you mix it with milk and/or some fruit . Goes down easy with a few ice cubes.Again ! This is the best protein on the market for the price ! Sure Optimum Nutrition Hydrowhey is a more refined product that can be digested a little better , but for the price you ca n't beat this Gold Standard.I have also tried a couple other flavors . Double Rich Chocolate was what I used all the time . But the flavor is n't as good as it used to be so I 've experimented with some others lately . I still drink it but I like to mix it up and swap flavors now . If you do n't like Double Rich Chocolate , try another flavor . You 'll eventually find one you will like.Here is a list of the flavors I have tried and how I rank them -LRB- strictly on flavor alone -- 10 = Perfect ... 1 = Bad -RRB- Banana Cream - 9Strawberry Banana - 5Delicious Strawberry - 6Double Rich Chocolate - 7Extreme Milk Chocolate - 5Tropical Punch - 6Protein is not meant to taste perfect . It 's meant to be a workout supplement and the taste is just a bonus . Take them for the nutritional benefits and the ability to use them as a meal replacement . ON Gold Standard is simply the best . You ca n't go wrong !
 Switch any bodybuilder 's Whey Protein drink with some Optimum 100 % Whey Protein and watch as he wants to put a barbell through your head for giving him a McDonald 's shake . Once you have convinced him that it is indeed a Whey Protein supplement he will want to see the list of ingredients with the important protein to carbohydrates to fat ratios that will prove its fatty content ... only to discover that Optimum 100 % Whey Protein just beats all other Whey Protein into submission with its astonishing lack of fats and higher protein content . So automatically the bodybuilder assumes that the stuff is probably twice the price of other Whey Protein supplements with half the amount until you whip out the bottle that is twice the size of other Whey Protein supplements for the same price . The end result is simply - every single bodybuilder is switching to Optimum 100 % Whey Protein . The only downside is finding out that it is not available and having to pay up for a Whey Protein supplement that gives you less and does not taste as good . Once you are supplementing with Optimum 100 % Whey Protein it is difficult to swallow another brand . This stuff has revolutionized bodybuilding supplementation.Calories
 I 've read a few reviews of this product around here but none have actually managed to define this product . So here I am , explaining my first hand experience with this dietary supplement . Please note - this tastes great but if you 're looking for taste , I suggest you go and eat a couple of Twix bars , not whey protein . Also , I will not be talking about proteins , isolates or any other technical term.I avoided taking supplements for a long time because I thought I did n't need them . Then upon being recommended this particular product by my gym instructor , I purchased it . It came at a steep price but now I have a permanent source so it 'll be easier for me to obtain it.So I took this for forty five days during which I used to gym for about 5 days a week and took rests during the weekends.Pros - There was no immediate power surge . In fact , I felt more of an upside in my gym ` ing temperament . I became more regular and serious about my workouts . When you pay extra , you consciously or unconsciously tend to focus more . I take this as an upside . - Towards the second week , it started working . My left arm bicep which lacked precise definition started to shape up . Also , now there is no noticeable difference between the size of my right and left bicep . The left seems to be well shaped and the egg is just placed at the right zone . - No side effects . None whatsoever . In fact , there are a few sexual upsides which you 'll know about once you take it . - The taste is just right and there are no dirty burps after you finish taking . I take my whey with water because I have heard that milk has calcium which softens the body muscle . I use a fork to mix it in a glass containing an odd 400 ML of water . I mix for around 40 seconds . You can also use your mixer and freeze it as per your convenience but then , that 's a bit too fancy for my liking , so choose wisely because you have to do this everyday . - You do n't have to take it on Saturdays -LRB- or the day you do n't work out on that day -RRB- Take this after your workout . The effect is maximized if you 're regular at the gym . - Great Packaging . Difficult to duplicate . - I did n't lose weight but I gained some exceptional muscle in the 45 odd days I did take this supplement . They say one serving contains 24 grams of proteins . That 's mighty and I realized that after using my first 2Lb box.However , I 'm not one of those guys who workout to get a wrestler 's physique . Maybe not even half of it . I 'm an average height gym enthusiast who would like to be very ripped one day . I weight just about right but this particular whey tends to make you look pretty darn good without your tshirt . - I did notice an eventual increase in my stamina but then , I 'm hardly ever `` tired '' before I 'm working out . I workout in the evenings.To sum the pros up , it has great taste , seemed to work within a week and eventually managed to shape me up in a very short time . I was n't badly built before but this toned my muscles up to an extent more universally acceptable.Whey Protein can also give you size besides toning you up . Increase the weight involved . It should be a gradual increase and you will see the result . However , I avoid doing this since I 'd look extremely stocky if I try to grow my arms . For people looking to tone their arms , try working with lighter weights & more reps.THIS ALSO SMELLS GOOD , TASTES MIGHTY IF MIXED WITH MILK -LRB- once in a way unless you intend to do that permanently -RRB- . Cons - Lack of instruction manual . No information as to where this is made.Overall , read the above twice and make your mind up . You can post any questions in form of comments . And no , I have n't used any other whey protein and I doubt I will . Just be regular and START with only a 2Lb box to see if it works for you , like it does for me.P.S - For you taste lovers , this is better than your cough inducing McDonalds shake . Avoid Vanilla . Strawberry , supposedly , tastes way better .
 We like this powder , it tastes better than other protein powders we 've tried , and also mixes well . The flavor combines well with other foods in smoothies or whatever we choose . We are completely happy with it !
 I got choclate malt it tastes pretty good . This is my first time trying optimum nutrition protein and the shiping was superfast ordered it on friday and it came on monday ! Over all loved everything
 It 's amazing and delicious . It mixes quite well and has a smooth creamy flavor . I would buy it again anytime .
 drink has a good taste and it feels good . we do n't go to gym frequently but this helps us feel better .
 I use this whey daily . I prefer the double chocolate flavor . I think The 1 gram of sugar gives it just the right amount of sweetness . I add this to my morning smoothies with some almond milk and water and it dissolves fairly well . If you have problems with it not dissolving to your preference , adding it to something with citrus will help.I buy the 10 pound bag when I can and it 's a great value . Though compared to the container , it can be a little difficult to open and close at times.I guess my only complaint is that it has acesulfame . I 'm not sure how necessary it is to the flavor , but it would be nice if they could find something healthier to use . Other than that I think this is a good product .
 I 've been using their whey protein product for years . Does the trick . Decent flavor too , and easy to mix -LRB- I use water -RRB- .
 I have tried some other whey proteins . This has a great flavor and mixes very well with water . This is just what I was looking for .
 I 've had really good luck with ON whey . It mixes easy and has lots of protein and low calories per serving . My favorite flavor so far is the Extreme Chocolate ; double rich is n't quite as good . I just mix it with water though ; milk would probably taste better .
 This was my first time using a protein supplement and I have to say I was very pleased . I noticed a difference in just a couple of weeks . I ran out sooner than I anticipated so I purchased another protein powder and that is when I learned how much I enjoyed the ON Gold Standard Whey . This other protein powder did not mix well , taste good and it gave me some real bad diarrhea -LRB- TMI -RRB- . It gave me a real appreciation for the quality and results of the Gold Standard Whey .
 As a vegetarian -LRB- not vegan -RRB- , supplementing my protein intake is essential . After trying various makers , I have found ON to suit me the best .
 Received as expected and now I can stay away from local supplement stores for awhile . a long while . Happy with purchase .
 Tastes great with cold milk . Only use the 4-6oz of milk per the directions and a heaping scoop of the product . Blend and drink . Very chocolaty and rich . None of that `` protein shake '' aftertaste . I actually consider it a treat . The low sugar and low fat per serving with the high protein count gives you the bang for your buck .
 There are three important things to me when it comes to which whey protein to buy
 I 've tried plenty of protein shake powders in the last 15 years and this is the first that I 've found that truly tastes good . While I ca n't necessarily attribute my recent weight/muscle gain to this product -LRB- since I 've recently started lifting regularly after an inconsistent period -RRB- , I have definitely seen improvement . Recently finished my first 5 lb . container -LRB- Double Rich Chocolate -RRB- and on to my next -LRB- Extreme Milk Chocolate -RRB- . Both taste good , but the Double is the better of the two .
 Good value . Dissolves well enough as long as you pour the powder into the liquid . Put the liquid into the cup first , then add the powder and stir well . I like using disposable plastic cups because this stuff is hard to clean off of regular plastic cups . Real glasses are fine if you soak them after use , then wash them later .
 Chocolate flavor is delicious . Mixes fairly well . A couple of scoops in the morning on my cereal keeps me strong all day .
 Optimum Nutrition has great products in my opinion , not just taste but quality . Having had access to trainers from around the world , many different regimes ect this product is one of the best proteins I 've used . Only a couple of things with this product for me are , if you mix it with water it seems pretty thin . Not saying that 's bad , and it still has good taste with water . Just do n't expect it to blunt hunger for any amount of time . If you 're eating right , it wo n't matter anyway . Mixes well with creatine , cost is great comparably and I will buy it again . My opinion is that some of the other proteins add fillers , and say it has a lot of other ingredients to make it more appealing and ON does n't do that . If you want straight up protein that taste great , low fat , low carbs , then you will be happy with this purchase . If you 're chasing more of the all in one product , this is n't your bag then .
 If you 're looking for a protein supplement to add to your workout/muscle building routine , I highly recommend this on multiple levels . 1 -RRB- Price - I think I bought the 5 lb jar for about $ 45 on Amazon . At other health retailers , that price is easily in the $ 60-75 range . 2 -RRB- Taste - This is my second 5 lb jar . The first was milk chocolate , which I generally liked . The cookies and cream that I 'm on now is OK , and is the only reason this is n't a 5-star review . I had heard good things about this flavor , and figured I 'd try it , but it 's very vanilla-y for me . Finally , 3 -RRB- Results - I 've only been doing weight lifting/resistance training to bulk up for about 4 months now . The mornings on my workout days I drink a serving of the protein powder and then another serving after the workout -LRB- usually within 30 minutes of my cool-down -RRB- ; and in those 4 months , I 've gained 15 pounds of muscle . I had seen other products boasting `` 16 pounds of muscle in 4 weeks , '' but I wanted gradual change . The combination of a consistent workout schedule and this protein powder are definitely helping me achieve that .
 I like this protein , it was good . Taste like chocolate milk when mixed with milk awesome stuff . Optimu . Nutrition is good . It also mixes good
 I 've tried a few other protein powders out there and Optimum Nutrition is my favorite . I 've been lifting weights/working out for almost a year now . When I started , I was n't taking anything and was getting adequate gains , but I soon hit a wall.Adding this protein allowed me to get the amount of protein I needed to feed my muscles . My gains shot up dramatically and now I will not work out without this product.The taste is great too because I went through a 5 lb container and still loved it . I highly recommend this .
 I love this product - it makes as close to a real milkshake as you 'll find in a protein shake and it 's so easy.This protein powder provides 48 % of your daily protein needs in one serving . The 5 lb container has 77 servings . I also purchased a single serve blender to have at my office to make these during the work day . For best results , use frozen fruit such as strawberries or blueberries and a banana and lactose free milk . I use fat-free , lactose-free , calcium added . Occasionally I add a package of Trivia for a sweeter taste .
 I have been drinking this for about a week so not long.I like the fact that it 's whey protein which is supposedly the most easily assimilated and that it has 24 grams of protein per scoop.I got it in Strawberry which I find completely disgusting.I 'm definitely getting chocolate or vanilla next time .
 I go through this stuff so quickly because :1 . It is delicious2 . Great nutritional value3 . Leaves me feeling completely recovered the day after a tough workout4 . My housemates all prefer it to their shakes -- I have to hide it in my roomBuy it , try it . Kicks the crap out of muscle milk .
 Regarding the taste , I find it much better to use milk or a combination of milk and water . Water-only mixing is n't the smoothest drink , and I 've found it tough to dissolve all the particles . If you can manage to find some milk or wait till you get home , you 'll be treated to a much better shake.Regarding nutritional aspects , I really ca n't say . So far so good .
 Very Fast Delivery and this Whey tastes really like chocolate more than the one 's I 've tried earlier which tasts slightly fake ! This tastes good and the seller shipped this item very fast!Thanks !
 This product not only tastes amazing but is of extremely high quality . Lots of protein per scoop and a great part of my protein intake daily .
 I 've used Gold Standard Whey Protein for a few years to help build muscle . I 've been doing the Stronglifts 5x5 program and the results are amazing !! This protein is the best there is from the research I 've done . The extreme milk chocolate is my favorite flavor so far .
 This is my first protein shake . I ordered the Strawberry Banana , with soy milk it tastes like real Strawberry Banana shake . I would recommend this product to any one looking for a great tasting Whey protein .
 I did n't like the taste at first when I was doing 1 scoop per cup of milk , but I found that more is better . I like the mixture 2 scoops per 1.25 cups of milk , blended . Any more and it stops dissolving completely .
 This is my first trip down the whey protein line , am working on bulking by the way . After reading a lot of reviews here and knowing I am not the chocolate type , I gave the French vanilla creme a shot and went for the 5pound pack . Very nice taste and blends very well with my blender bottle -LRB- which I also bought via amazon -RRB- . You do n't need to add any sweeteners as it 's already sweet , just some cold water and you are good .
 Decent taste , high protein content and dissolves easily when stirred into water . Not much more to ask for from protein powder .
 I was surprised how big this 5lb tub was . It is a much better deal than buying protein at retail.Taste was good . Not great but gets the job done . I really like how well it mixes , it does not leave a lot of clumps when you shake it
 Tastes good and good for you . I love it and highly recommend it . I drink protein shakes to ensure I 'm getting adequate protein .
 Best protein I 've tried so far . It works good and dissolves great . It does n't stay chunky even just using a spoon in a glass cup . It also tastes great .
 This stuff is delicious . When I want the protein , and I 'm in a hurry , I 'll just throw some in a blender bottle with some milk . If I want a meal replacement , I 'll mix it in with milk , banana , and peanut butter and blend it with the stick blender , which is totally amazing .
 You ca n't go wrong with any product from Optimum . This is a great middle class protein powder if you do n't want to splurge on Isopure or Hydrowhey . This is also pretty good tasting . I just wish there was n't any artificial sweetener -LRB- sucralose -RRB- . That is the main reason why alternate this protein with NOW whey isolate and Dymatize all natural whey .
 I loved drinking this protein after my workout very good taste . I would recommend it to anyone that wants to try it .
 Awesome . I 've been using Optimum Nutrition Whey protein for years . This stuff is the best nutrition , taste , and priced protein powder there is .
 I do n't care how disciplined you are , if you do n't like the TASTE of your whey product , you 're probably not going to stick with it . This stuff I can stick with . It 's obviously a good product too , but the taste is what really makes me look forward to the next shake . Have n't found one better yet ! Oh , and it 's also cheaper than many others . So guess what ... 5 stars . Duh .
 Really good supplement after your work out ... definitely recommended ... after just 4 weeks I could see the results in my body already .
 Wanted to try a protein powder that was n't as rich as say , chocolate or vanilla . This powder still has somewhat of a rich texture and taste -LRB- so do n't think you buying kool-aid if you get this -RRB- but overall it was a nice changeup from the usual protein powder .
 This is a great product , great price , great flavor . Anyone who likes chocolate will love this flavor . Will buy again .
 This whey tastes real good and it has been effective for me . Though it does not mix well with cold water , I think it 's a great product and the best whey that I have ever gotten .
 The flavor is just excellent . I mix 1 scoop with about 8 ounces of milk , then dump in a couple teaspoons of coffee grounds , then shake it up really well in my blender bottle . Starbux esque with plenty of great protein to boot .
 ... here is yet one more review for this product . It 's actually less of a review and more of an endorsement . This item has already been reviewed to death by people more knowledgeable than me . I think it tastes great and it mixes well . That 's all I was looking for in a protein supplement .
 Great recovery drink or meal supplement . Has one of the best protein/carb/fat ratios I 've found . I like it with milk or water , the taste is rich and mixes well with strawberries or bananas if you want to make a smoothie with it .
 The great quality of Optimum Nutrition combined with the best flavor I 've tasted -LRB- Vanilla Ice Cream -RRB- . Only con is the price , but it 's worth it .
 This one tastes great especially with milk . You do n't even need to spend your money on milk because it tastes that good with water . All I drink is 100 % whey by this brand . It helps me recover faster so I want be so sore after workouts .
 I am Tayeezy . Brooklyn born and I approve this message . Ya diiiiggggg ! Will purchase again and to all you haters keep drinking that other back stuff .
 I have never used protein shakes before so I was n't sure what to expect . I mixed a full scoop -LRB- double rich chocolate -RRB- with a 8oz glass of skim milk and stirred it for about 30 seconds . It dissolved in the milk well enough so then I drank the concoction . It reminded me of drinking chocolate milk made from the chocolate powder from when I was a kid ! It was sweet but not too sweet -LRB- just right -RRB- . This is going to be very easy to drink everyday .
 Be warned , friends . I received casein protein instead of whey when ordering this . I was extremely upset because casein does n't fit into my regimen . I 'm not even sure who to contact to report it !!
 I like it because it is not the standard Chocolate or Vanilla . 20 years of lifting and I ca n't stomach any form of those flavors . This Tropical Punch flavor has a bit of a metallic aftertaste like a lot of creatine drinks . If you add a squirt of black cherry Mio , it kills the metallic after taste and makes it mighty tasty while adding a bit of caffeine to it .
 I mix the double rich chocolate with milk and it tastes amazing ! You can add even more milk and it tastes like a milkshake . Definitely my favorite flavor .
 This stuff is really good.I generally take it in the morning with fat free milk as I have read that one should start the day with protein rich food.I sometimes put a banana in it and it tastes really good.If you do n't get enough protein in your diet i will strongly suggest to take this .

 Optimum Nutrition is a trustworthy brand for protein . They tend to be more expensive than other brands , but you know you 're getting what you pay for . I found Extreme Milk Chocolate to be a bit too sweet . Double Rich Chocolate is my favorite as it 's not quite as sweet . Cookies and Cream is very sweet so I mix it with unflavored whey from another brand . Definitely recommend using a shaker cup to get a good blend . Blending with water tastes a bit like -LRB- cold -RRB- hot chocolate mix , but I prefer milk .
 I bought the ON Whey because of the good reviews it received . I can not objectively judge the effect of whey in general , but it seems to work for me . I trained every day of the last month and drank one shake before and after the training . I usually prepare the shake with water , or 1/2 water and 1/2 milk and the taste of `` Extreme Milk chocolate '' is very good in both cases . The powder dissolves fast and the shake does n't foam like some other products . I will be buying this again .
 i 've been using this product for 4 years now and im very satisfied with it . i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a protein powder that is low in sugar and has a higher protein concentration per scoop than most other products
 I bought this product on the recommendations of people I trust . I am more than happy that I did so . This product works fine for me .
 I am a weirdo who thinks artificial banana flavor tastes good . Beyond that , this is a really good high quality protein powder that tastes great when mixed with milk or water . I look forward to my post-workout shake instead of dreading choking it down ! HIghly recommend .
 i choice this procudt because it is the best protein in the market today . i have been taking why gold standard for years and i like it . i would 100 % recommand this protein to anyone .
 I rotate between a lot of different protein powders and meal replacement shakes , just because i get sick of the same choices and flavors ... all except for this one . This is the best tasting one of all by far to me . . when made with milk this tastes like dessert . . no weird flavors or chalky taste . Highly recommend !
 I will like the taste of this product compared to others , especially when mixed with milk . It 's like the taste of nice chocolate milk .
 This flavor is really interesting for making banana split smoothies and banana pancakes - if you are cutting down on sugars/carbs .
 I have tried different flavors of the same brand before , but this one is my favorite . It mixes up nicely in my blender or my shaker cup . Good product
 I 've tried a few other brands , and the day I had my first scoop of Gold standard , I just knew that this is the best . Even before tasting it , just the texture of the whey is wayy better than a few other brands and is almost certainly the best I 've known . It tastes good too . I started off with 2 lb strawberry , loved it . Got a 5 lb strawberry and then this 10 lb double rich chocolate , which is great too .
 Thanks to this product , I 'm finally gaining weight . After weighing the same for , oh , 10 years , this product has helped me achieve some gains . I 've noticed muscle improvements as well , though other reviewers will do a much better and much more informed job of educating you on the specifics of that.It tastes fine , too .
 My boyfriend loves this stuff ! He makes protein shakes with it after the gym and it keeps him full until dinner !
 One of the better flavors . I was bored of the usual chocolates and not too impressed with the taste . The slight hint of coconut has n't forced me to alter any recipe and in my opinion tastes better when mixed with water or milk compared to the standard chocolates . Will buy again .
 I got mine on clearance at Target for about twenty five bucks , but mainly use it as a trimmer . The foil shaver is good but still not as easy and close as using a plain old razor blade , and does irritate my skin unless I use some sort of aftershave toning cream afterwards . So instead I now use the trimmer to shave ... this leaves me with a five o'clock shadow look but it 's much faster and does n't require the lather-up-and-rinse process of using a blade and shaving cream.Really appreciate the ergonomics of this thing , it fits perfectly in my hand . The battery holds a decent charge , I recharge it maybe twice a month tops . It 's not too loud either , which is a plus.If I had to do it all over again I 'd probably buy one of those Norelco Beard Trimmers and use it for shaving because they have a vaccuum which means that your hairs are tidily sucked up so there 's no mess you have to clean up afterwards ... but for the time being am pretty happy with this thing . I also like that it 's water resistant , so I can use it in the shower if I want to .
 The trimmer works really well for a combo shaver . The close shaver works as well as any electric razor I have ever used .
 After many years of searching , I finally have found a razor that meets most of my criteria for a great razor . It is reasonably priced -LRB- around $ 60 -RRB- , it is cordless , it fits the hand nicely , it is light , it is easy to clean , it has a single curved screen , it gives a pretty good shave if you are in a hurry and will give a blade close shave without irritation if you are willing to spend a litle more time , it has a well fitted protective cover with slots to allow the head to dry after cleaning , and the replacement cutter and screen that are good for over a year of shaving will cost you around $ 20 bucks . This is an extremely well designed razor .
 I thought this would be a good Shaver . It is better than I expected . I do recommend this shaver as a very good combo tool for beard and close shave.Bill
 I have owned this since 2005 and it works like new even today , after 6 years . I use it 5 days a week , every week . I tried a few other shavers in the last 5 years but nothing came close to the comfort and smoothness as this one . This is simply the best razor for less than 100 dollars out there in the market .
 I purchased this shaver mainly for travel because of the ability to clean under running water , secondly for the need to trim sideburns and beards . Have n't washed it under water yet but it works great on trimming , fine tuning edges and general shaving . Cleaning with the supplied brush is easy enough and does a good job.It 's a Braun what do you expect !
 This is a good mid-price shaver but I still have to do some touchups with a safety or disposable razor for my medium thick beard .
 I used a Remington for quite some time , but then started traveling a great deal . The Remington could not withstand the shock and broke quite often . A razor repairman suggested that I try a Braun.The Braun cruzer Z-50 is an excellent razor . It 's very sturdy , has a long lasting battery , many features and provides a consistent and close shave . I recommend it highly .
 I 've worn a three-day beard for almost eight years , and this combo shaver has performed extremely well as shaver and trimmer . The design allows for neat beard lines , and the shaver -- with multiple passes in heavy beard areas or neck curves -- performs solidly . Considering the price , it 's nearly a steal.The reason I rated it at four rather than five stars is because I 've gone through three of these in eight years -- the first one just stopped working after about four years , and the trimmer on the second one broke very recently . Just bought the third -LRB- great service again Amazon , BTW -RRB- . But for roughly 40 bucks , maybe a four-year life in a shaver/trimmer is good these days .
 This shaver will produce a close shave if you 're willing to spend some time going over the same areas many times . However , a quick pass usually produces a shave that 's close enough to suit me . The thing I really like about this shaver is the dual trimmer and the snap-on guard for beard trimming . It 's very convenient .
 I bought this for my husband , since his old shaver no longer held a charge . He needed a combo shaver and trimmer , since he has a mustache . He says it gives him a smooth shave and trims his mustache great . I definitely agree .
 Ordered this for my product , who just utterly hates shaving with regular blades . According to him , this braun shaver gives him an excellent close shave in a quickly and painless manner . `` No more blades ... ever '' is what he said.I even tried it myself and I must admit it is a lot better and potent than my Norelco shaver . Next time I have to replace my Norelco , I 'll definitely be moving to Braun .
 I bought this with some concern as the Braun Series 1 150 I previously purchased was of poor quality . But this one performed up to the Braun name - a good shave , convenient and reliable .
 This is my first electrical shaver so i might be bias as there is nothing i can compare it with.I got this device last week but get to test it just now ! It looks good , the construction is solid , and it is really waterproof . After i unwrapped it , i immediately turned it on , to my surprise it worked , i started shaving , in a few seconds the device turned off , i thought that something was wrong but after plugging it into the currency it turned on ! At first i thought that it is as good as wet shaving when i realized that it is not giving me smooth and deep shave . The problem became bigger when i got to my neck , as my chicks and goat part was ok . I could not shave my neck completely , the shaver left a lot of hair there . I even managed to cut myself little bit , previously because of the lack of experience with the electrical shavers i thought that you can not get cuts with electrical shavers . At the end i had to finish shaving with my wet shaver.I gave 4 stars as i can not compare this devise with other ones as i have never used one and i like the trimmer part which you do not get with your wet shavers . The price is quite affordable , and you are getting 3-in-one package.I still can not decide whether to keep it or not!Your skin gets irritated , you can get cuts , and the time you spend is comparable with the wet shaving !
 I have a full beard , and the trimmer that I bought last year just does n't get the job done . I also hated my rotary electric shaver and wanted something for the days when I needed a quick shave in the morning . So far I am quite happy with this product , especially as a trimmer . No major complaints yet .
 I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it . He has a gotee and he really likes how well it shaves around his facial hair .
 This is a really good razor ! This is the third electric shaver I have had , and this one is the best ! The shaving portion works well , especially for those with facial hair that grows in different directions . Also , the trimmer works very well to keep sideburns clean and neat . Easy to clean , and can be rinsed under faucet . While there are three attachments , they are not small so they can be lost and not too large as to be bulky . Overall a wonderful deal !
 IS A GREAT ELECTRIC SHAVER VERY EASY TO USE AND LEAVE A CLEAN SHAVED SKIN I 'LL RECOMEND IT
 My husband 's last razor was a Braun also and it lasted for over 10 years , so we decided to go with another Braun . It works great !
 i have been most pleased with this product . along with the cruzer 3 i have a braun 8585 . i bought the cruzer for the trimmer . i have a very large thick stache . this unit is not an 8585 . with that said . it is a damn good trimmer . and for a quick clean up shave is quite good . do n't expect a 50 dollar unit to shave like a 150 dollar unit . but for a trimmer . which it is why it is designed . it is as good as it gets without your barber doing the work . they provide a length guide or you can go it free hand . i will replace with the same if the battery ever dies . good luck stache guys .
 I love this thing . It 's just right for me.This is definitely a compromise . It 's not as good a shaver as , say , a Braun Syncro , and the trimmer is not as good as a dedicated Wahl trimmer . For example , you ca n't set the trimmer for longer hair . Short beards only , please.Still , the trimmer has a small end that 's good enough for ear and nose hair . You can use it in the shower and you can clean it with water . For me , though , the biggest advantage is that I can replace a bathroom drawer full of gizmos , their cases , chargers and accessories with this one unit.Much nicer .

 My favorite feature in the cruZer is the adjustable beard trimmer . Just set it to one of 4 preset lengths and trim away - no need to worry about an uneven beard or trimming off more than you wanted . The cruZer also does a great job with basic shaving , and the fact that you can rinse it off under the faucet is a real time-saver . The only downside is that you 're supposed to drain the battery completely before each recharge -LRB- to maximize battery life -RRB- , so you sometimes have to plug in the shaver mid-shave .
 Been using it for 3 + years . No problem . Works well . Easy to clean .
 I have a goatee and I have been looking for a single shaving device that would trim and define my beard and also give me a decent shave for those times when I do n't want to use a razor . The cruzer3 was the only device I could find that claimed to do all three tasks . I took a chance and ordered it through Amazon - and I 'm very happy with the purchase . The shaver works well ; not as good as a razor of course , but it 's great for touching up spots I missed or a full shave when I 'm in a hurry . The trimming blades are well-shaped and work much better than I thought they would . A blade that extends 90 degrees from the handle works best for trimming and defining , but the cruzer3 's blades work well -LRB- you just have to tilt the shaver 90 degrees from your face -RRB- . The beard trimmer attachment also works well . I have a hair trimmer that I use for buzz cuts and was using it for beard trimming , but the cruzer3 works just as well . And it 's one less device I have to keep track of . Finally , I appreciate the fact that I can rinse off the unit with water when I 'm done . I am completely satisified with the cruzer3 ; it meets all of my requirements for an all-purpose shaver/trimmer .
 I got this because it has the styling attachment that you usually only get with a separate trimmer . So it 's one gadget for shaving instead of two . For me it replaces a similar , but less futuristic looking model , that I had for a few years and did the job pretty well.This one is made in China instead of Germany , and looks like a ray gun . I 'm not impressed by the appearance
 Ok so i saw this shaver in a magazine ad and it caught my eye , I needed a new shaver to replace my old Norelco , so i thought i 'll give this one a shot since it had alot of things to offer . I do n't have a beard or goatee so i ca n't tell you about shaping up using the features provided on this shaver but i 'm really satisfied with it so far just after the first day of use . After one quick shave , my skin felt alot smoother i like the fact that you can rinse it in water and you can go wireless . Well i must warn you though , those of you looking for a perfect shave look elsewhere and expect to pay more , because this if for more of a quick shave on the go person . For the price i recommend it to everyone and amazon.com got it to my house in 3 days with free shipping !
 This was my first electric razor though I have tried many others in the past . I have a thick beard and am usually clean shaven . This model caught my eye because of the wide and small angle pop up trimmers as well as the trimmer attachment . Overall , it is very good . A shave as close as a mach3 is achieved on the face , though the neck and jawline are not as good , but adequate . The razor is best if you shave everyday or relatively often , otherwise you might want to look at a rotary . However , the brauns and other foil razors are usually best in terms of closeness . The trimmers work well to an extent , if you are doing heavy trimming , get a dedicated trimmer . The wide and narrow pop ups are great.The razor is sturdy and looks a little flashy but is washable which makes cleanup easy . I just rinse it off with hot water or use compressed air to blow off the hair . Once a week , I will soak the cutting head in alcohol and oil the trimmers and foil . Unfortunately it is made in China not Germany . It holds a charge for over a week , more like 2 . Also the quick charge option lets you charge it for a single shave quite quickly , though if it does run out it will suddenly stop grabbing the hairs on your face.Cliffs
 I have no idea what is wrong with some of these people . One actually said in the trimmer mode the hairs do n't reach the screen . That 's because they are n't supposed to , the trimmer does the cutting . I guess that 's why they call it a trimmer . Read the directions and you should n't have a problem . Some people apparently expect this thing to act like a ladies electric . This is a razor for a man so like all mens razors it has power and is n't delicate . If you want that buy a ladies version.With electrics you have to go in different directions more than once a lot of the time . This is no exception but it does a great job on my neck which was ALWAYS a problem with the Remington 's I 've had.I 've had a couple of Remington 's that did n't last but a couple years then broke down or the battery died . I had an old Braun that worked well for several years with little sharpening . Now that I 'm back to Braun I 'll never switch back . HUGE difference.This thing does a great job of keeping my facial hair trimmed and once you get used to the trimmers you can easily create anything you want . Just be extra careful when you start using it and you should n't have problems .
 Strengths
 First electric I 've had in a while . I was surprised by how close it shaves , but as another reviewer pointed out , if you go a few days between shaves the longer whiskers do n't get in the foil . it 's also necessary to go over the same area from different directions a few times , this shaver is not faster than a blade . I like the beard trimmer , I usually keep my beard trimmed pretty short and the trimmer attachment will get it down to three-day-growth short if you want . I have not gotten used to using the trimmer without the attachment , there 's two sides to it ; one rounded and one straight . The straight side is an inch long which is a bit too long and unwieldy , I usually end up using a separate mustache trimmer . Cleaning is a breeze , just run under hot water . Seems to keep a charge for a about a week for me , but I do n't use it everyday . As far as maintenance , I 'll know more in a couple months .
 The new Braun Cuzer I just purchased is perfect and amazon got it to me in under a week , great deal and great shaver .
 El producto muy bueno , me llego a Colombia incluso antes de la fecha , tardo 15 d&iacute;as en llegar.Hasta ahora lo que he probado muy bien .
 this shaver looks good and works good , but seem the motor of this model not as strong as my old one , but maybe my r defective or something else , I really like it if the motor got more powerful , just feel not sharp enough .
 I had a big bulky Braun that quit on me after about 6 years . I trusted the brand and was not disappointed . Shaver is easy to clean and a snap to use . I would recommend it
 I 've used Braun 's cruZer shaver before . It has several helpful modes . It fits my hand nicely and is a good traveler .
 I bought norelco one 2 years ago , very expensive it did not shape pretty well , It was very expensive , then I tried a previous model of this braun ones . I work much better now I got the cruzer 3 one , It is works wonderful from the first time , no irritation , shave well . I strongly recommend it . do not waste your money on the very expensive ones as norelco ones that promised improvements that in fact do not work , this one will do the job perfectly
 I 've had a full beard for some time and this is the first product that I 've found that facilitates full maintenance of that beard with minimal time and trouble . It 's a fantastic product .
 First the good
 I used the first Braun Cruzer 2000 which is a four year old product and have loved it every use . The Razor begun to turn blunt so I bought this instead and I am very happy . The trimmer works perfect and the small trimmer head is very versatile , more then I thought it would be.Great purchase , will recommend it for everyone !
 I 've owned a few Braun shavers before , and have always thought them very good . The Cruzer is no exception - it 's a good shaver . It 's so-so as a trimmer . It 's rated 100 ~ 240V , so it will be good in several countries . I 'd give it a 5 as a shaver and a 3 as a trimmer , so it gets a 4 overall .
 This is a great product . For the price this is a multi-tasking must for those with beards , goatees , etc. .
 This electric razor works better than I had expected . I was looking for a combined razor and beard trimmer and not thinking to spend a ton of money . Overall it works fine and surpassed my expectations .
 I have no complaints with this razor . I have been very happy with it . This is my second razor from Braun and I feel they make a good quality razor . I like that you can use it in water .
 This is a great shaver and beard trimmer . My husband can trim his beard and moustach and keep the rest of his face kissing clean . He loves it !
 this shave is not the best . if you dont have a beard or whatever , then go away now , please , but other wise this thing is amazing ! and no it wont work as well as a normal razor . duhh
 It works great for me both as a shaver and a trimmer !
 I got the Braun 3-in-1 shaver on the 18th of April as promised , it is very easy to use and works pretty good so far -LRB- as may 14 , 07 -RRB- . the power plug connects to wall power source is too big and heavy , will not stay , should be redesigned to a lighter or smaller size , or having a 90 degree angle . This is my personal opinion.robert , Santa Ana , CA .
 This shaver provides an excellent shave . Very easy to use and the shape contours to the hand very well . The trimmers work well . I like the fact that it works with or without a cord and a charge lasts a long time . All-in-all an excellent buy .
 This is a very well made product . The parts fit well , the trimmer does a good job and it feels nice in the hands . Overall , a Braun .
 Not a replacement for a traditional razor , but great for quick clean ups , trims , etc. . Holds its charge well and fits in the hand easily . Very easy to clean , too .
 In a word ... Excellent ! Great shaver and trimmer . I have tried many different brands , Braun wins again !
 This is an excellent razor with a wide variety of attachments , including a beard trimmer .
 Iv been using this shaver for about a month now , I just would like to say WOW this shaver is almost perfect and the trimmer is amazing , the styler does an excellent job , battery life gr8 -LRB- almost a week of shaving per charge -RRB- ... been using electric shavers for years now I can honestly say that this is the best -LRB- shaver + trimmer + styler -RRB- all in oneI have one thing to say to the people who did n't like this shaver , read the manual ! Ur supposed to shave against the way Ur hair grows , and it takes a couple of times till Ur face get used to itThe only bad thing I can say about the cruzer 3 is it does n't do too well on the neck but hey iv always faced this problem with all electric shavers at least here u can get the suckers by using the trimmer .
 I have battled with blades , razors and beard trimmer for years . Finally , here 's a machine that does it all . This not only will cut through your mangled , knotty beard to a nice stubble , it will also take that stubble down to nothing . The single foil edge makes shaving a breeze . My entire chin gets cleaned up without a problem . I highly recommend it .
 Excellent product - german engineering , what can I say ? Especially if you have a short beard/goatee , this is the only shaver/beard trimmer you 'll ever need . Close , smooth shave . Very good trim . I did a lot of research , and Braun makes the ONLY rechargeable shaver/beard trimmer with truly universal power charger -LRB- switches automatically to any input power you may encounter on trips abroad -RRB- . Battery life is great , too - much better than e.g. Philips/Norelco . Blows competitors ' products out of the water .
 Have been using the Cruzer for about a month , and could n't be happier with it . I 've been making do for years with a beard trimmer , and using a razor for close shaving . But , with this device , it 's all at your fingertips in one device , and so far I have n't a single complaint . Hard to understand those here who have berated this shaver -- works for me exactly as advertised . I get a close shave AND convenient , consistent , no-hassle beard trimming . It 's great . Easy clean-up . Holds a charge for a decent length of time . Overall , a clever and efficient device that does the job amazingly well .
 It does everything as advertised . It came in perfect condition and all the attachments work wonderfully . I would highly recommend this product .
 This is a fine razor and my hubby is still using it over 3 years later , so we would really recommend it . As I am a great Amazon shopper and was doing some -LRB- neglected -RRB- reviewing , I thought I would let those considering purchasing this razor know that it has lasted a good while and that he has been pleased for years with it . Braun is a high quality manufacturer and this razor is easy to clean , not too noisy and gives a decent shave . It is a bit pricey but well worth it now as it has lasted him for a long , long time . We recommend it highly !
 The Braun CruZer 3 is many tools in one , let 's take a look at them one by one :1 - Shaver
 I bought a cruzer3 last year before I left on a 4 month trip . I was traveling light and did n't want to bring both a shaver and a trimmer , plus a separate recharger for both.As a combo device it does very well . This is the first foil shaver I 've used , so I ca n't really compare it to any others ; although I found that I preferred it to the rotary shaver I had been using . The trimmer worked fine , but it 's width made it somewhat awkward & uncomfortable at times . Plus , there are only 4 cutting level adjustments . Once I returned home , I immediately switched back to a dedicated trimmer ; it was simply more effective and comfortable.The only real complaint I have is with the battery life . After a year of use , I now only get 4 shaves out of a charge . If I were using it as a trimmer as well , that might only be 2 . When new , I was getting 5 or 6 days -LRB- trim & shave -RRB- from a charge , so it 's lost approximately half it 's battery life in a year.For traveling , I definitely recommend the cruzer3 . The shaver & charger are reasonably small & lightweight , although including some sort of case would have been nice of Braun . And the charger is dual-voltage , so you only need a plug adapter , not a voltage converter , in most places around the world.But for daily use , I think a separate trimmer works much better .
 I liked the great price , and great crisp look of it . And on Braun website , the ads were fantastic , so these all made me to buy it . Also I was tired of regular razor shaving and i wanted electric shaver to do the work for me.I must say that the razor is an Ok shaver ; Ok , because it did n't match my facial hair structure . In order electric shaver to cut hair , the hair has to be standing on the face . But my facial hair lies on the face , so it 's hard for razor to cut them . Also face must be shaved at least every other day ; otherwise it wo n't be able to cut the long hair.Hair length adjustment accesory is nice tool as well . Not only facial hair can be shaved with it , but also body hair can be trimmed.Rotating styler is a nice tool , as well . You can easily correct the sideburns , and neck can be cleaned with it from ugly hair.In the end , i must say , that electric shavers are n't for everyone . Unfortunately facial hair structure has to be compatible with electric shaver too .
 I 've had a full beard for some time and this is the first product that I 've found that facilitates full maintenance of that beard with minimal time and trouble . It 's a fantastic product .
 great shaver , works great , holds a charge a long time , easy to clean . the razor works great on a daily basis , but a little slow if you 've not shaved for a wknd , just have to go over your beard a few times . the trimmers are awesome , work great , just be careful in the `` sensitive '' areas down below , but really good on chest hair and trimming those bushy places . definitely worth the money .
 Yeah , the image looks like a pack of 5 batteries , but if you read the title and description , you can see that you only get one battery . I do have to say that a picture is worth a thousand words . Thanks to the other review , I knew ahead of time that I was ordering and gettting ONE battery !
 They only sent one battery at first . When I contacted them they said they would send the other four -LRB- which they did -RRB- .
 Not too many years ago , these batteries were expensive . Like so many things , that has changed dramatically . And more and more bits of technology use them , so , buying larger numbers makes sense .
 I have used this product for some time.I retain water easily and end up with swollen ankles and fingers.This product helps me lose that liquid in a safe way , without tiredness or any disgusting side effects .
 Great product ... . Great service ! Refreshing hot drink and good alternative to coffee and traditional tea .
 Although at $ 12.00 can . It is a nice refreshing drink and provides an option when you do n't want to have a caffeinated drink .
 This tea is no longer sold in the USA grocery stores I contacted the Ricola factory trust me I know . I originally tried this tea in Norway when my dad got really sick on our trip over there . I combine echinacea and hyssop into the tea according to the directions on the bottles -LRB- in liquid form -RRB- and my friends have dubbed this the miracle tea . I have made it and brought it to them when they were sick and I feel like I get better so much faster when I drink this . It is tiny granulars inside the can you add to hot water and it dissolves to tea . It really opens your sinuses up and is soothing . Great tea worth the price .
 I 've been drinking this Ricola tea for years . I ` ts very soothing if you have a cold , but it also tastes great so you can drink it anytime .
 I drank so much of this , it resolved my chronic dryness issues . I love the stuff and wish it was widely available .
 I bought it at the Christmas Tree Shops for $ 2.99 and enjoyed it a lot , but I would never pay $ 10.95 . That price is outrageous .
 As an herbal tea to soothe cough and sore throat , this is superb . It has a strong flavor and sometimes I even just breathe in the steam.The main use I have for it is to dissolve a very large gel capsule . I have a daily medicine that comes in a capsule that 's too large for me to swallow without gagging . I make a half cup of this tea and dissolve the capsule . The strength of the Ricola flavor masks the terrible taste of the dissolved capsule 's contents -LRB- I tried heavily sweetened hot water or even regular , but sweet , mint tea but neither was sufficient to mask the taste -RRB- . This stuff does it.The only negative is , as someone else here mentioned , the price . It is about a third higher here than elsewhere online and more than double the price in the big-box pharmacies -LRB- but less than the natural foods stores . -RRB- They also make a caffeine free version , although this Amazon vendor does n't seem to carry it .
 First had a cup of this herbal tea almost 20 years ago in the Rocky Mountains . It was given to me as a `` cure '' for dizziness , nausea and slight altitude sickness by a Native American shop keeper . I instantly felt better and have looked for this tea for years . I am a big fan of the original Ricola throat drops and the tea is just like it in liquid form . I use the tea for slight colds , upset tummies and queaziness . I also like it on `` regular '' days , too .
 Good for traveling though buttons to operate alarm are small and unlit . Tough to tell if alarm is on without having to look really close -LRB- and turn on a light -RRB- .
 I do n't know what I can review about small , electronic batteries ; I needed a certain type and I found them on Amazon-yea Amazon .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 You and your pet will bond . I bought several for friends who love their dogs . They make a great hostess gift . My dog actually becomes mellow and looks at me saying `` do n't stop . '' For the price ca n't go wrong . Cristie and Mom
 I have owned a Nuzzle for about 10 years . Dogs LOVE it and do n't want you to stop the massage ; when you do , they give you adoring , pleading looks until you start again . I 've used it on three different breeds all to rave doggie reviews . Of course one ca n't leave it where a dog can get it and naturally chew it up.Also can be used on humans and cats . Everyone should have this item and be massaging their pets . Also makes a nice gift !
 These are smaller and less dense than the usual stress balls . It does hold up very well and has yet to tear despite much use . The ergobeads provides much less back-pressure while you squeeze it . Overall it is different from normal stress balls but works quite well . You may also describe it as a mix between a hacky sack and stress ball .

 Inexpensive and of quality make . Have had my crossaction more than a year and is still going strong . The bristles move in a circular and back and forth motiopn giving the teet a really good cleaning . Works just as good as other electric tootbrushes double and triple its cost , however it is not as good as some of the more elite toothbrushes ranging 35 and up . But for less than 10 bucks I went ahead and but them as stocking stuffers last christmas for the family to enjoy . Great durable toothbrush .
 I 've used this toothbrush for a few months and its amazing . I brushed my teeth with the standard manual toothbrush for 24 years , and after using this brush I wish my parents would have started me out on it . You just ca n't get the cleaning from regular brushes you get from this brush with the rapidly rotating brush head . Plus , it prevents gum damage and overbrushing , and allows you to use less pressure . The battery is still going strong , and for the $ 6 or so it is so worth it . I thought I was good brushing manually , but now I feel my teeth are twice as clean .
 This toothbrush is the best I have ever used.First , it provides a more thorough cleaning than any other toothbrush I have tried . The closest competitor is probably Sonicare.Second , the battery life is awesome . The original AA that came with the brush lasted the entire first quarter of my Freshman year.Third , the batteries are easily replaceable by unscrewing the bottom half of the handle .
 I 've been using a professional model Roto-Dent brush for a few years , but lately have been using mostly manual brushes . Went to the store to replace my old Oral-B manual brush , and saw this Power model for only about two dollars more . Wow ! The difference is amazing . Crisp and clean . I bought another for my wife , and she loves it too .
 Seldom do you encounter a product that so thoroughly exceeds your expectations and costs so little . This is an amazing little engineering marvel . And what a joy this power toothbrush is to use ! Leaves your teeth feeling slippery and nice and is slim and maneuverable enough to get far back to the molars . Easy to use , does n't spatter , and does n't nanny you to death with beeps and stops . If you use NiMH rechargeable batteries , you can also be green and life-on-earth friendly .
 For the price of a good manual toothbrush , you can have this terrific electric . I have a couple of plugin rechargeables , but this is the one I use . The battery lasts forever , so recharging just does n't make sense . I keep a spare on hand for guests , and keep one at my mom 's and my daughter 's place for visits . If you eat out a lot , you can even keep one in your bag . The brush combines back and forth with circular action . It cleans your teeth and stimulates your gums . I do n't know why anybody would use anything else .
 you 'd think this was an electric fancy toothbrush , tons of power for a battery operated item , just as good as the expensive ones in my opinion . highly recommended !
 While shopping for a manual toothbrush this one was on the rack for 4 bucks and change , not even a dollar more than most of the manual brushes . Since it was Oral B it seemed worth a try . I used a $ 20 electric tooth brush for a while but went back to manual , could n't pay $ 80 - $ 100 for a toothbrush -LRB- think about it ... -RRB- This really cleans my teeth VERY well . Maybe a $ 100 one works better , but I doubt that it 's two times better , and certainly it 's not 20 times better .
 After brushing with the Oral B Crossaction for the first time , I immediately noticed how well it cleaned compared to a manual brush . I would say that 30 % more plaque was easily removed . And I 'm no newbie to electric toothbrushes . . I used the Oral B Sonic Complete for about a year and I can confidently say that this does the same job at a fraction of the price . Also , the fact that it works off 1 AA battery is incredibly convenient . I also like the form factor of the toothbrush itself . It 's similar to a manual toothbrush in size and weight and works just like the higher end electric toothbrushes . It really is a bargain at $ 6.99 -LRB- or $ 6.69 at Wal-Mart -RRB- ! One of the best features about this toothbrush is the fact that it has a replaceable head . Meaning that you do n't need to throw away the whole unit just to get a better cleaning experience . I do have one complaint though . . this little guy makes quite a bit of noise . So brushing late at night when others around are sleeping is a big no no . Other than that this is a pretty awesome toothbrush . I 've purchased 3 extra to give to friends as gifts . : DEdit -LRB- 4/1/2012 -RRB- : I ca n't believe how long this toothbrush has lasted ! I 've been using it for 4 years now -LRB- changing the brush head regularly of course -RRB- and it still works as well as it did on day one . I had previously rated this product at 4/5 stars . However , I now feel obligated to give it a full 5/5 . Of course , when operating the toothbrush 's volume is louder than I 'd like . However , that 's a small price to pay in exchange for the exceptional cleaning and build quality that comes with it . Needless to day , I 'm impressed !
 I have been using the Crest spin brush for several years . I really like the Oral B much better and it only uses 1 AA battery instead of 2 .
 I bought one of these after the dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush because flossing was n't doing the job . This is terrific . You can change the head when the bristles begin wearing out . It 's easy to do . My dentist also noticed my gums were firmer from the massaging action of the bristles . Now when I go for a checkup I spend less time in the chair getting the plaque taken off . I still need to floss but it just routine .
 Battery toothbrush bought for travel because it is small and packable . Item looks fine and will be taken on a trip in a couple of weeks . I am satisfied with the purchase , but the packing/shipping charges are disproportionately high .
 This battry-powered toothbrush works better than anticipated . It is easy to use , and it leaves your teeth feeling like you just had them cleaned by a dentist . It definitely does a better job of brushing than a plain toothbrush . I highly recommend it .
 I have waited a few months to write this review so that I would have real experience to base my review on , and I have been pleased with this product . I formerly used a Sonicare electronic toothbrush which was much more expensive , vibrates the entire head instead of just the teeth , and has a less appealing design in terms of its curvature and ability to reach into the back areas . I found this toothbrush gives a sufficient amount of power and my teeth feel clean . The first few times I used it it reminded me of a cleaning at the dentist 's office.If you get this product from a store , keep in mind that it is possible to try out the toothbrush while it is sealed , so you might not have a full charge . I first thought that I had to use more force while brushing but it turned out to be the battery which after I changed worked perfectly . It uses one AA battery.Cleaning the inside of the toothbrush is easy , when you buy the replacement brushheads there is a device included that allows you to open your toothbrush so that you can clean the inside parts as well as replace the head.I recommend this toothbrush over a traditional or electronic toothbrush .
 The Oral-B CrossAction Power Battery toothbrush uses a single replaceable AA battery to make the bristles of the toothbrush pivot back and forth to stimulate gums and get off food residue before it can turn into plaque or tartar . The toothbrush also lets you choose between replaceable soft and medium brushheads -- something I 've never seen before . The bristles fade halfway when you need to replace the head of the toothbrush.Oral-B claims that this toothbrush will remove as much plaque as regular brushing and flossing combined . They do make a great toothbrush ; but I still use floss or a gum stimulant with a rubber tip to remove food particles after brushing with the toothbrush.If your dentist recommends this , good for you ! This very good toothbrush by Oral B cleans my teeth and stimulates my gums better than a regular toothbrush . It 's no illusion this time -- this is one terrific toothbrush , especially considering the reasonable price for all that you get .
 This toothbrush does the job and at this price you ca n't go wrong .
 My wife and I have been using the Oral-B CrossAction Battery-Powered Toothbrush , powered by one Alkaline AA battery , for a few years . We both prefer it over the manual toothbrush because we feel that the final results are cleaner teeth in less time , and at a price considerably lower than that of several of the other name brand powered toothbrushes . The original design of the brush was changed in order to prevent the brush from accidently coming loose while in use , but the new brush design has definitely corrected that problem .
 This is a really good product ; however , if you 're serious about clean teeth , you should get the one that plugs in.Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargeable Electric ToothbrushBut again , this one is really excellent , especially for travel .
 I have been using this toothbrush for over a week now . In the beginning the bristles felt very stiff and uncomfortable , but after about a week they softened up due to regular brushing . The cleansing power is great and there is n't much effort that is needed to thoroughly clean your teeth . I have a partially erupted wisdom tooth and while in waiting to get it extracted I have used this toothbrush to brush around that tooth and it has worked wonderfully in vibrating those little food particles out -LRB- ewww I know -RRB- . It is loud , but not significantly so . Amazing toothbrush for the $ 13 price-tag . Very happy with this toothbrush . Also , very sleek handle and light build =-RRB- . Yippeee !
 Purchased this recently with a $ 1 off coupon from the Sunday paper . I have never used an electric before , but this works really good . I could never get that feeling from a cleaning at the dentist with manual brushing -LRB- never expected to -RRB- . But this brush comes pretty close . Most studies I 've read on the manual vs. electric say manual brushing is all you need if done right with the right brush . Probably accurate , but I think I 'll stick with this product for awhile .
 I bought this toothbrush a month ago , and have been very satistfied with it . The battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you ca n't get from a manual toothbrush . The price is good , the battery life is good , and the battery door is very easy to open ! I would buy it again !
 I got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it 's great . I know I should probably replace the head by now , but it still seems to work fine , so I do n't . I 've only changed the battery once . If you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type , this is it . Then again , if you 're not lazy or weak , you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries !
 These oral b brushes are fantastic . in some cases they are cheaper than crest battery powered brushes , and certainly use less battery power , so batteries last much longer in oral b brushes than crest.plus ! even small hands can hold the brush , as the handle is narrower diameter than crest brushes !
 Great product because it does exactly as described . It is a bit bulky but I dont mind . It is great on battery life and replacement heads are reasonable .
 my gums started to bleed after I started to use Pulsonic . So I got this instead . Much cheaper , even with an AA duracell battery included . soft head . cleans well . The battery lasts a long time . wonderful product . do n't be fooled by the prices ! those more expensive ones are not necessarily better -LRB- yes , I 've used them -RRB- .
 A very good toothbrush with a great cleaning action and long battery life . Who cares that you ca n't change the head on it . It 's a pity it is not on sale in Europe .
 Works as advertised and I am happy with it 's function . Much nicer than other battery powered toothbrushes . One issue is that supposed `` quick change '' tool to remove the brush head either I ca n't figure out or it is defective , but once you put it on the brush head a pin is supposed to press into a slot to release the brush head . It never releases . Is there a trick to do this ? Also the instructions say put on the tool press in and then pull off the brush head . The problem with this is once the tool is on and you press in , there is no way to pull off the brush head as the tool is still attached . Once you take the tool off the brush head will not slide out . Anyone figured this out yet ?
 I have used this twice a day and love it . Best buy at this price .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 Got this product after I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia . I was miserable with aches and pains and muscle soreness . My aches and pains have significantly reducedafter taking this product . Felt better in 2 days . Have been taking this for 10 days now . First day , with 4 tablets - I felt my muscles twitching . I reduced the dose to 2 tabs for a couple of days , increased to 3 and then to 4 tablets again.If you feel queasy or have diarrhea try reducing # of tablets and increase gradually.Additionally I am also taking 2-4 turmeric tablets -LRB- for reducing inflammation -RRB- , B-12 + CoQ10 everyday.Hope my review helps all the others who are suffering with Fibro or CFS .
 I no longer can get this product at our health food store . It is the best thing for FIBRO-MYALGIA !! Recommended by my Chiropractor , I would n't miss a day of taking this supplement . Thank you , Kal !
 I bought this product to help dissolve liver stones prior to completing a liver flush . My gall Bladder was removed 13 years ago and I have had trouble with liver stones ever since . A month prior to using this product I started taking bile salts to help with digestion problems , which it did . I also noticed the bile salts were starting to break up stones in my liver after about a week . I bought this product to help speed up the process . I started with 4 a day as the instructions stated and that turned out to be too much . I woke up with intense heat and burning in my liver and several stones moved into my common bile duct . One was large and very sharp . It was painful and difficult to pass . I took several doses of Epsom salt throughout the day to relax my bile duct to allow it pass . If it had not passed after taking the Epsom salt , I knew it would require an ERCP procedure to remove the stone . I had no idea that I had so many large stones . I cut back to 1 a day after that episode and after a week started taking two a day . I have been taking the malic acid for about three weeks now and I am still passing stones and/or pieces of stones . I will continue taking this product until I have no more symptoms of stones . Ongoing , I will continue to take the bile salts for digestion and to prevent more stones from forming . I have completed several liver flushes over the years , but they have not been very effective . At best they stopped the congested feeling and I passed some small stones . Taking the bile salts and this product effectively dissolved the stones . Please be careful . Real liver stones are not soft . They are hard as their name suggests , and they can be very sharp and painful to pass . They can also get stuck in your common bile duct which can become an emergency procedure to remove . If you have liver stones proceed slowly in the process of dissolving them . It is highly unlikely that you can pass a golf ball size stone as some have stated when completing a liver flush without it becoming an emergency situation . The average diameter of the common bile duct is 4 to 6 mm and it can only stretch so far . Also , be careful with the amount of Epsom salts you ingest when completing a liver flush . You can become dehydrated and have other other serious adverse effects . I prefer natural remedies when possible , but I know natural remedies need to be used with caution . The bile salts I am taking were purchased from Dr. Sandra Cabot 's website . Hope this helps those who have similar problem .
 My doctor recommended I start taking this for my Fibromyalgia , along with a few other vitamins . I must say I feel better ... not sure if it 's the vitamins or the physical therapy she ordered but ... anyway , I 'm just glad something is helping !
 This was recommended to help detox my blood and body from excess toxins . . I am sort of neutral -- because I am better but not sure if this was the product that helped -- Large pill to take

Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I 've used an electric toothbrush for years now but with an increased travel schedule , it 's been a pain in the neck to pack . This little toothbrush is good enough for the road and takes up so little space , I 've actually put my electric toothbrush away at home too !
 I really like this toothbrush . If I find a better one , I 'll change , but for now this is cool .
 We had previously used a Sonicare that cost over $ 100.00 with replacement heads that cost more than this toothbrush . We like this Oral B better and since we run it on rechargeable batteries , the cost of using this toothbrush is insignificant . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !
 I HAVE CARPAL TUNNEL AND I AM 68 YEARS OLD . THE POWER TOOTHBRUSH IS A GREAT AID IN REDUCING WRIST MOTION AND PAIN . I AM ALSO VERY HAPPY WITH THE ENHANCED CLEANING POWER OF THE BRUSH . THE PRICE OF THE BRUSH AND THE REFILLS IS QUITE NICE , AND THE BRUSH HEADS LAST A LONG TIME.HERB WELDON
 One of the issues of buying gadgets like power brushes is the technology changes and supplies for your old model are not always in stock at the local drug store or supermarket . I was very pleased to find these at a reasonable price !
 First of all the battery is included and installed , that 's nice . Refreshing experience . Much like the treatment you get when you go in for professional cleaning .
 Amazon sells these refills cheaper than at Target . This is a nice item to buy if you need to reach the $ 25 free shipping mark by buying something cheap but useful .
 maybe because I ordered a `` medium '' . It works fine otherwise . I recommend it .
 We had a little trouble finding these in the stores and felt fortunate to find them at Amazon . They were very easy to install especially with the tool provided . Good price , good product , and fast shipping.Jim
 This is an excellent brand for oral hygiene products and this particular brush is a must , good product .
 I discovered the oral b brush that uses this particular head over a year ago and consider it a very good alternative to the electric toothbrush systems that are available . Certainly much less expensive , I will continue to buy it and use it daily .
 I think `` ORAL B CroassAction Power Refills , Soft '' is great product for me!cheap price . . good quality . . I satisfied ~ ! : b
 I 've had the brush for about 5 years . I no longer see them in stores . I really like it and will be sorry if I can not replace it when it dies .
 You can not buy these replacement brush heads in stores . Thought I was going to have to buy new units -LRB- I have 5 -RRB- . Was elated to find these online . Bought several replacements in case they were n't offered again .
 I bought my toothbrush over 4 yrs now but could n't continue use due to no heads being available locally . Nice it still works great with the new replacements ... worthwhile purchase .
 I really got my moneys worth with this stuff . It also smells good . It even stands up to the 05 degree heat . 1Just be warned that when it says 24 hour protection it means it . So do n't wait on taking a shower .
 I ordered these for my husband , he uses a commuter mug . Nice length and they bend as well ! He is very happy , price is great for quantity you recieve
 I am not able to drink without using a strawand these r perfect length and size .
 Oh I love the extra long flexable straws . When I go to a drive through to get a large drink they always give you a short straw . I would always get wet from tilting the cup the liquid would leak through the top rim . Now I no longer have to tilt the cup to drink . I carry them in my car at all times and wash them to reuse them !
 I searched far and wide for a tall straw to fit my recyclable drink containers . Love this one ! -LRB- and the colors are fun too ! -RRB-
 Can anyone tell me how long and what the diameter of these straws are ? I would like to use this type of straw for a project but they must not be any more than 1/14 '' in diameter .
 The straws are exactly what I needed . This particular brand of straws , at times , are hard to find . The length of these straws are perfect for the'Bubba ' Kegs our family uses for travel mugs .
 I have been looking for extra long straws for awhile to use in my 32 ounce mug . Most of the straws I found were too short and would fall in my mug . These straws are the perfect length so , they do n't fall in my mug . I was the most concerned about the length of the straw when I purchased them but , it is fun to have a variety of colors too . I also like that they are flexible . I received my purchase quickly . The product was packaged well and came undamaged .
 I use an oversized mug to drink from everyday . Regular straws are not long enough , and my stores do not stock any longer straws . These are the perfect length and the flexible portion is also longer than most flexible straws . This allows me to have my mug on the tub 's edge and bend the straw to my mouth . Talk about lazy days ! The straws are cute colors too.The straws are boxed in 24 straw packages which is great . It allows me to store the surplus in my garage without fearing them getting dirty .
 super fun bendy straws ... great for my pool parties ... ca n't find them anywhere so I resorted to online purchase ... and for a box containing 960 for $ 20 ? definitely worth the price
 These Nice Extra Long Flexible straws were great for me.I 'm disabled and needed longer straws to use in my drinking bottles and the regular sized drinking straws were to short , great product .
 THESE STRAWS ARE LONGER THAN MOST IN STORES AND JUST FIT THE BIG STYROFOAM CUPS I USE FOR SODA AND , IN THE WINTER , WARM COCOA.THEY ARE EXTRA STRONG AND HAVE A PERFETLY BENDY TOP PART.Extra Long Flexible Straw 24 PackEven though it says '24 pack ' , there are 24 packages of 40-43 . THIS IS A VERY GOOD BUY IN MY PART OF THE COUNTRY .
 They are by far the best straws ever ! So much better than anything you can buy in the grocery store . My teenager use them constantly , as do I.
 I decided to try these straws because my 2-1/2 year old son loves to drink soda and water out of the bottle but tended to spill a lot . These straws are great for that purpose ! They come in several colors and he likes to choose the color each time , which makes him think he is a Big Boy . They also work great in taller mugs . They are a good length even without stretching out the bendy part , but the kids really like the extra bendy length to make loops or corkscrews . Being able to buy so many in a case is really nice too since they are very hard to find in our area . We wo n't be scrambling around trying to find straws and having to wait for shipping every couple of weeks .
 After heart surgery , the hospital gave me one of those reallylarge containers to hold cold water and it had a flexiblefat straw in it . Eventually it was hard to keep the strawfrom showing mold , so I found the straws on amazon.com - always my first stop.Sure enough and even though these came from CA , I could notbelieve how quickly they arrived . Straws work great and nowI have umpteen kinds of colors to chose from and I do n't haveto worry about mold - just throw them away .
 WONDERFUL !!! These straws are the best ever . We have looked all over for long drinking straws , for ice tea , lemonade , etc. . No one carried anything but the standard 7 '' . When we found these on Amazon , we ordered a whole case !! The price is right . The straws are quality . We are happy campers .
 I am disabled , a C-5 quadriplegic . I need extra long and flexible straws to make drinking things easier . These do a good job and I recommend them . We had to order a case of 24 packs of 40 = 960 . Lots of straws , lol . The 1st pack we opened the straws were all bad-small holes made them unuseable . The 2nd pack was fine .
 I was looking for extra long straws that bend for my Big Gulp -LRB- 64 oz . -RRB- I found just what I needed -- & they come in bright colors -- includung purple -LRB- my favorite . -RRB- They came quickly & easily . Thanks . bigpurple
 These were the most economical of the -LRB- few -RRB- long straws available . They are great -- the only way to reuse smoothie cups with the dome top , and useful for many other kid-related drinks .
 I had bought the plastic straws & lids that come with the tall insulated drink glasses . Those straws did not hold up very well so I went on line to find some disposable drinking straws for tall plastic cups and I found these . I love them . They are perfect for the tall plastic insulated glasses with the plastic tops . You can even extend the flexible part into different shapes which my children love . These straws were exactly what I was looking for .
 If you like tall drinks and despair of finding adequate straws , these attractively colored straws make it easy to remember whose glass is whose , and are very functional for tropical or other tall drinks.I do wash them -LRB- since they 're from China and we know how that 's been lately -RRB- before I use them by running hot water through them.I would have to say that if I had my way , I would buy a large box of the long straws from Jack-in-the-Box , as they are a little larger in diameter and sturdier.Cheers
 This is a good quality product . . colors make them fun to use also . . I have a handi-capped child that uses this product and they are just great for her needs . .
 We first saw these straws at a restaurant and had a lot of fun with them . I found them on Amazon and they are great . You can wiggle them into lots of shapes . They are long and the flex point is extra long.They come in a case , so your supply will last a long time , or you can throw a lot of parties ! They also make great thank-you gifts for kids ' birthday parties . -LRB- we give a pack , not a single straw -RRB- They are unique , no one is allergic to them , they are n't noisy and everyone can use them .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love .

 I bought this magnifier for my mother , who is legally blind . She has used one before and needed a new one . It is small enough to fit in her purse and strong enough to work for her .
 Make sure you really want a 10x magnification . You need to hold this very close to the item you are magnifying .
 I bought this along with a 5 power Magna Lite unit . For my needs the 5 power one is superior with less distortion and a flatter field . If your specific needs are for the greater power then this unit may work for you , but you are definitely sacrificing optical quality for greater power . By the way , I bought both units from Maxi-Aids . They are terrific . I ordered them on 7/5 at 7:00 pm and received them on 7/8 .
 This is a STIMULANT laxative . Of course it is going to cause you pain !!! This is the same drug prescribed by surgeons when they want an empty bowel . Yes it will give you cramps because it is stimulating and literally squeezing everything out!Pure dulcolax laxative is very strong and always has been . If you really really need to make sure you can evacuate , this IS the drug for you . Gentle is really misleading however.If you want less suffering , try a laxative that says stool softener . But do n't blame the drug itself , it is only doing what it is intended to do.If there were reviews for chemotherapy people would give only one star . Of course it will make your hair fall out and make you nauseated and sick as never before . But that is what it does . Do your research before buying something.Yes , this will cause a bowel movement and you will feel like someone is punching you in the stomach .
 I was recommended this product by a doctor . I then stupidly decided to read the reviews on it and was scared to death to take it . After my second visit , he reassured me that it was safe and that many members of his family use it also . Actually , everyone that I had asked personally about Dulcolax said that they did n't experience discomfort as it is described in so many reviews . I decided to take it , and when I did , I was so afraid that I would n't let myself sleep for the next 9 hours . I noticed a trend in the negative reviews . Everyone that had taken it had woken up in pain . They fell asleep after taking it . So I decided to do it a little differently and stay awake during the entire process . Well , to my surprise , I only felt pain in the upper part of my stomach for a short while , and then no more discomfort until 12 hours later . It just felt like the normal cramps you get with diarrhea . And then relief . My advice to anyone taking this would be to start off with 1 to see how your body reacts to it . Do n't let a few frightening reviews stop you from getting some pretty decent constipation relief it you need it .
 The Dulcolax tablets work fairly well if I take a tablespoon of Lactulose and 3 Dulcolax tablets in the morning and in the afternoon , then sometimes 2 Dulcolax before going to bed . One needs to drink a lot of water to keep the kidneys flushed if taking this much Dulcolax .
 The product is already proven.What concerned me is the packaging seemed used , like it was opened and resealed .
 Dulcolax is an excellent product and this seller has it for a great price . The delivery was fast and the product as promised . Great Seller !!
 This part of the review is redundant and unnecessary . I do not have time for this . -- PJ xuoxuo xyuxoxuo xuoxuoxo xuououo . xuxuo xuoxuo xyuio .
 First of all , I love Ecover products , but this is one of my favorites ! I discovered this awhile back when I was transitioning my home to all-natural -LRB- and still affordable -RRB- products . Here 's how I use this
 I am so happy I purchased ECOVER ALL PURPOSE CLEANER ! My kitchen and bathroom tiles , as well as my floors , are squeaky clean ; and , the wonderful natural lemon fragrance does not affect my sinuses or cause me to have a migraine like the other non eco-friendly cleaners do . It is THE BEST !!!
 I recently purchased this fragrance as I am huge fan of the Creed Fragrance line.This is the 1st time I have tried Royal Water by Creed and really like it a lot . It has a clean , crisp smell with hints of citrus under notes . I also love the fact that this fragrance is n't overpowering to the olfactory senses and unlike many fragrances today , Royal Water , does n't have a sickly sweet or overpowering floral scent.The only draw back that I have found with this fragrance is that the fragrance does n't last throughout the day . I am a huge fan of Creed 's Himalaya scent and its scent lasts a long time .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

 It 's a classic Zippo . Good quality , Nice color and when i made fire with my zippo my around friends usually looking my lovelly zippo because sounds very nice.By the way Amazon sent extra 6 flints -LRB- gift -RRB- with that orange color zippo.That was really good .
 Its a Zippo , you cant go wrong . I picked this lighter because of its color and its a zippo . It performs perfectly , as any Zippo should .
 Just what I wanted . Built to last and it is hunter orange so you ca n't lose it in the woods .
 Its a plain ol' zippo lighter . Works as you would expect and the quality is great . Does n't really differ than other zippos other than the color.The Orange is a nice bright hunters orange , but not florescent or pastel as some reviewer has said . I think the matte finish may have contributed to some thinking it looks somewhat pastel but it is very vibrant and I do n't feel like it was painted with a 1992 orange . . PROS : - Quality zippo-Color is greatCONS : - None
 Just as advertised ! And it showed up a day early ! -LRB- lighter fluid not included -RRB- -LRB- 1 flint , 5 rayon balls , one wick included -RRB-
 I wanted this Zippo for its color and matte finish . I was not dissapointed . The color and the matte finish are like a Miami sunset . For the price and its beauty , buy it . You will be glad you did . My sadness is that I will not use it because I do n't have a life . I collect Zippos to fill my day . I 'm glad that Amazon did n't wrap tape around the box .
 It 's just the usual common zippo lighter did n't expect more or less got what I wanted . It shipped fast and got to my house sooner than expected awesome job love it .
 I ordered this Zippo as kind of a joke for my dad . He quit smoking -LRB- thank goodness -RRB- , but collects Zippos . He has two display cases , and is working on filling them . We have bought just about everyone out there that looks good ! I ordered the orange because it is my son 's favorite color , so I thought it 'd be cute for his 5 year old grandson to give it to him at Christmas . More sentimental than anything . Product arrived quickly , in great condition , and was purchased at a price that ca n't be beat .
 I love throwing this together into my shaker in the morning for my post workout lunch break . I like that it mixes really nicely with just water so I do n't have to bring milk to work -LRB- I only drink almond milk and i also do n't drink a lot of milk in the first place -RRB- . It tastes great , no artificial sweetener aftertaste , and ingredients that rival even the super-expensive shakes sold in our local specialty pro-shops . Proteins , amino acids , great price , and easy to consume ... Definitely will be a regular buy from now on !

 Machine is accurate and is still going strong . My grandmother has went through 3 models of a different brand since I have owned this one .
 I bought two of this monistor and both gave me the same reading which is very close to my blood pressure . Also it is a good buy for the price .
 I really enjoy this product . I use it at least 2 or 3 times a day , every day to monitor my blood pressure . I have hypertension , and I needed a portable product that was convenient and a no-brainer to use . I recommend it to anyone who wants to monitor his or her blood pressure , even if they do n't have hypertension .
 I am 75 years old and This is a perfect machine for me . it is so easy to use and the price was very reasonable .
 Wife and I have been using this Monitor for 3 months . It is easy to use and fairly accurate when compared with other more expensive upper arm monitors . The enclosed chart should be kept to see the trend in BP . It 's a great buy !
 Easy to use , allows me to monitor my blood pressure at anytime and place.Very convinient when traveling .
 El equipo es de muy facil uso y lectura , la identificacion de arritmias es fantastica y muy util .
 This BP Monitor is accurate and it 's compact , very easy to use unlike my old cuff unit . It let 's you store the results in memory and also will give you your average BP . I 'm very pleased with it .
 I have been monitoring my pressure three and some times four times daily because of the ease in operating the Mark of Fitness monitor . Previously , I would skip the monitoring altogether because of the difficulty of manipulating the other devices I used . My wife even checks her pressure regularly now . Now I can provide my physician the history of my readings because of the memory features of the wristwatch style monitor . I think this monitor can make a difference to many who need to monitor their pressure regularly . The time and ease of use are outstanding !
 I bought two of these items and I was so pleased that I bought another three for my childen . Very easy to use , and very affordable . Great Item!Yousef Salem
 My husband and I use the monitor as we travel over the road in a semi truck . It is so easy to use and small in size so is easy to store . We like it a lot better than the pump up arm monitors .
 Easy to use . Accurate upon testing . Have to be careful about arm position or error message comes up . Will never go back to arm style . Pulse reader easy to see . We are very happy we have this item .
 Compre este medidor de presion y pulso y realmente lo encontre muy eficiente .
 Cool little wrist blood pressure monitor is accurate and is convenient way for me to determine my blood pressure . Naturally a 2-3mmHg difference between left to right arm is normal , the right being higher . I found out that a difference of more than 11 mm Hg in the systolic from the left to right can indicate a blocked artery forming , and 20-40 mmHg as a blocked artery in the heart . So I got this to help me determine on a daily basis what my BP is . The irregular heartbeat detector goes off now and then for my female , I suppose she has some heart issue but at the same time I wonder if its a false alarm . The manual says that consistent irregular detection is what is needed to determine if a person has an irregular heart beat , which I figure means that its sensitive and by doing it over a course of a week or so would help eliminate human error.This device gave me the same numbers as when I go to the drug store and use the blood pressure monitor there.Another nice little bonus is that it has a memory function that shows up to 30 readings for a person and the average BP , which is what I needed to know to accurately know my BP . It has a memory 2 -LRB- M2 -RRB- which means it stores 2 people 's readings .
 This product does its job for finding an average pulse and blood pressure so I know if I need to take my medicine or not . But from what I have heard since I work in a hospital it is not as reliable as a normal blood pressure cuff .
 I happened to get my BP checked at the Doctor 's office the day my monitor arrived . It is pretty accurate and very easy to use . I 'm so glad I bought it . My husband loves it as well because it is so easy to use .
 This is the easiest way to check your pulse and blood pressure I have ever found , and it is fast and accurate and allows you to keep a clear record of any changes . I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an easy to use way to check your or a loved ones vital signs at home .
 Like all non-professional devices , it does have a slight variance in measurement , but it is within 2-3mg so as not to affect the readings significantly . For the price , it is a very good product .
 Purchased one for myself was so pleased with it , bought a second one for Mother-in-law ... easy to use small with nice small travel case .
 Easy to use and accurate . What else can you say that 's positive concerning a BP meter ? If anyone has any kind of irregular heart beat , than this machine is for you . It 's compact , quick , and let 's you store your results in memory -LRB- up to 60 readings -RRB- .
 I own this item more than a month now , and I can say that this Blood Pressure Monitor is great!It will measure your blood pressure in few seconds and give your heartbeat rate.It works on the wrist , so there is no need to roll-up sleeves in order to measure your blood pressure.Display is large , so my parents can see the results without putting their reading glasses on.Whole family is using it daily .
 I bought 2 of these on a Friday sale for my children -LRB- 5 and 7 -RRB- I loved the idea of washable and we are going to be traveling quite a bit soon and wanted to try them . My kids LOVED them and for the first time since she was 3 , my daughter fell asleep in the car while using it . It fit them perfectly and the sachet was not overpowering , just enough fragrance that even my older boy liked it . The only concern is that the fabric is kind of fuzzy so for cooler weather it will be great , but a bit warm around the neck during warmer months . I 'm so glad I bought them !!
 Good traveling pillow for the price . My wife likes to use it when we come back from work . Recommended .
 The pillow is a little hard due to the stuffing material . It is more like pebbles . Has a little unusual smell , but this will probably go away with use .
 I used this pillow on a flight to and from Australia and it saved me from having a stiff neck and I got lots of sleep . It 's true , it 's a bit bulky and less convenient than the inflatable pillows , but it 's a lot softer and smells nice -LRB- it has aroma beads in a little pocket -RRB- . I really liked it and found it to be firmer than some of the cheap pillows they sell at the airports .
 Very nice pillow , comfortable for the kids on a long road trip . They were quite happy with them . Much better than the air-filled things , and the price was great .
 Just what I was looking for . This pillow has a buckwheat-like filling -LRB- it sounds and feels like -RRB- . The fragance packet - I was skeptical of . I hate synthetic fragrances , but I believe this is a natural scent with herbs . It 's really nice and it is removable . It 's just a satchel slipped into a little pocket . What 's good about the filling is that you can kind of move it around to get it where you need it to be comfortable . Great product , great price , free shipping . I definitely would recommend buying this product !
 When I worked at a local Aeronautical firm they used these cleaners . I loved them so much I purchased some . They will remove anything . They never fail to take off anything you might get on your hands . Highly recommend .
 The soft foam padded the splint well while the elastic panel made it easy to apply the brace . The splint does a good job of supporting the wrist . I would recommend it .
 This wonderful kit has just what you need to set your lover 's passion on overdrive ! It contains a red g-string , a red pocket rocket massage -LRB- needs an AA battery -RRB- , and a one ounce tube of Flames of Passion - strawberry gel . Red is the color of passion , and this kit is your red passport to passion . I highly recommend this kit ! -LRB- Review of Doc Johnson Red Hot Lover Secret Rendezvous Set -RRB-
 I expected these to at least have somewhat of a tarter flavor and to last longer , but they are instead very sweet and do n't last long at all . I usually put 3 or 4 mints in my mouth at once and they 're gone within a minute or twoThey 're still quite delicious , I was just hoping for a more pervasive flavor that lasted a little while longer .
 Ricochet Mints are fantastic . Xylitol is great . I keep hearing about how terrible other artificial sweeteners are for you . These are great and are even good for your teeth!Beware
 These are great natural mints that do n't have the saccharin , Nutrasweet , Aspartame or Sugar that is found in so many other brands.My dentist recommended a natural mint such as this to give to my kids to correct the Ph balance in their mouth after having a sugar treat - since it 's impossible to get them to brush each time they snack . My kids love these mints as do I . After years of not being able to have a mint due to the tooth decaying sugars they either contained or Nutrasweet , to which I am allergic - I am pleased to find these fantastic mints !
 I first tried these Ricochet Mints at work . The person in the cubicle next to me suggested I try them and I 'm really glad I did . That fact that these mints are sugar free , have all natural ingredients in them , and that they taste great makes them a joy to eat every time I use them . The flavor is not so strong that you will hate it . I originally ordered these because Amazon.com was out of the licorice flavor which is my favorite . I 'd highly recommend them to anyone who wants a decent breath mint and who likes the taste of fruit punch . They are definitely tasty .

 I love this vibrator . Even better though is that it 's so cheap compared to similar ones and it comes with all the extra toys . The glow in the dark lotion does n't really smell like vanilla but that does n't make it any less fun to paint on each other with .
 THis vibrator is one of the best i 've purchased.I works great.I really like this one .
 can not find these in stores any more so when i saw them on amazon i had to buy them . Use them in my car has double sided tape car smells like clean laundrymat
 I am an Air Wick fan . I use these in my garbage pail . It works well to keep the odor to a minimum .
 Love this product . I used them years ago when my boys were young in their closets and room . You know boys ! Also put in my trash cans . Now use them in my trash compactor and auto . Company quit making them and I do n't know why because you can stick them anywhere .
 This product is great . I used it all the time and was so glad to see I could still getit , I got it for my daughter to use in her diaper pail . She uses cloth diapers andwashes them every other day and as you can guess they get a little stinky this worksfantastic ! It sticks to the lid and viola the smell is gone ! They also had reallyfast shipping and great prices !
 Pretty powerful stuff . I keep barely have it open and it does the trick . Stuck it to the lid of my garbage can . When I had it open a little more then needed it was overwhelming every time I opened the lid .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 This is a handy little tool ! I am a medical student and was looking for an all-in-one that I could use while in school . It is extremely handy and I was surprised at how quickly it shipped . Great service and product , would definitely by from again : -RRB-
 Could n't be happier ! Have everything you need for a neuro exam in one instrument ! Should have been a little less bulky - otherwise a great buy !
 excellent product . For those of you whos white coat is weighted down with needless instruments , this is definitely for you . Combine 5 instruments in one .
 I searched for this product because I wanted to have all my equipment for Clinical Skills classes , but without having to bring a huge bag to the hospital . This product proved to be very efficient and handy . I know that I will use it for years to come and I totally recommend it .
 good , every thing very good.Es lo que esperaba , tambien fue enviado en el lapso prometido.Considero que es una buena opcioon para comprar
 Pros
 In general , this combo served me well on neuro rotation . I gave it 4 starts short of 5 because the rubber percussion piece is a nightmare on the white coat , it constantly left black marks on my coat . Also , if it could have been designed to be a tad shorter , it would have been a perfect fit in my white coat pocket .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

 Good way to drink loose tea . The bombilla is a very sturdy metal and appealing to look at . It is , as others have mentioned , a bit shorter than it looks from my photo . Mine measures about 6.7 '' inches long . Maybe that is normal if using a gourd , but it 's shorter than I expected.Minor detail there , I 'm otherwise very happy with the product .
 I drink a lot of mate and have multiple bombillas . This is a sturdy straw that works well but the only downside is that the filter does n't separate , making it harder to clean . I would recommend a bombilla that screws apart at the bottom for easier access to the little leaves that may get stuck in there .
 The first bombilla straw that I got from a friend let a lot of leaves through but this one works quite well . You may get a little if you move it around too much or stir with it but it definitely works as intended for normal use . I really like the way it looks , too !
 I am new to Mate . I have wanted to start drinking it for a long time . Just bought the tea -LRB- would recommend getting brand other than Guayaki , maybe their San Mateo is better ! -RRB- But ... for the Bombilla , it is great ! I would recommend . It does n't come apart so there may be times when it is hard to clean . But it is very sturdy and genuine looking . I like it a lot ! thumbs up :--RRB- !
 High quality bombilla - this straw seems very well built and not flimsy like some others I own . It 's my go to bombilla for my yate drinking .
 This is a very good straw , probably the best I have ever owned . it is also pretty as it comes with a little artsy detail . It 's not too big and the holes are small enough to prevent leaves from going in . I also like that it has a slightly curved shape that helps with staying still in my cup .
 This is my first bombilla so I ca n't compare to any others ; but this is what I have experienced : * It never clogs and it is always easy to sip from . This is a good thing as this bombilla does not allow for internal cleaning . * It gets extremely hot in newly prepared brews . The plus is that it forces you to wait for the tea to cool . There have been reports of mouth cancer from drinking very hot liquids through a straw . Nevertheless , my next bombilla purchase will definitely be wood unless there are metal bombillas that offer some insulating properties * It is exactly one inch too short for the vessels that we drink our tea from so we have to ` fish ' the bombilla out before drinking . If you use a tall glass you might want to measure the height before ordering .
 The straw is curved on top and bottom , which is not realy visible in the picture . It is very pretty and the holes on the bottom are small enough to keep tea leaves from getting into your mouth . I happily gave one as a gift and got one for myself .
 Love this bombilla . As other users have said , it 's easy to clean and filters well . It also has a better feel on the mouth than a stock bombilla I have that came with a gourd .
 I got mine in the package advertised and I LOVE it ! it 's exactly what I wanted to drink my herbal teas .
 unlike some other bombilla 's , this one has a clean draw , a clear taste and no bitter metallic aftertaste . this is the second bombilla I 've ever used , and I have to say that this is the better of the two .
 I like to drink leaf tea and this allows you to sip it without using a teaball because it strains the tea as you drink it . I do have one warning though
 This is my first yerba mate tea straw ... I hope to use it for other loose teas as well !! I 'm so very thankful for other reviewers to help me make the right choice !!! God bless you guys !!
 This loose tea straw brings a welcome lift to my everyday life . I did n't know I wanted it until I saw it advertised in a magazine .
 It 's perfect . It keeps out the dried tea leaves and it 's quite easy to clean . = o -RRB-
 This is a wonderful bombilla , works great with my Mate.What was not clear to me is that the picture shows only the straight part of the straw when in fact , the whole length starts with brass curved lip piece then what you see in the picture followed by and opposite curve -LRB- S curve -RRB- to where the spoon shape filter is . All is silver with the exception of the mouth piece.This is much prettier than the picture shows .
 I have several Bombilla Straws for loose tea and so far this is the best !! Definitely keeps out tea leaves - easy to clean ! Melody
 This bombilla is great . It does n't clog because of the flat curved base . I 've used other bombilla 's and this one works the best .
 Hey , why filter the pot ? Just filter what you 're sipping ! This is a very nicely constructed bombilla -LRB- admittedly , my first -RRB- . The expressed purpose is for drinking yerba mate , but I actually used it on some loose-leaf tea I had on hand , and it works great for that , too ! A fun purchase !
 I love this straw and use it for all my hot teas whether its loose tea or bagged tea . Its made of brass -LRB- and then plated with stainless -RRB- and has held up with everyday use for the past two months . I accidentally put it in the dishwasher which I do not recommend doing because that clouded the red faux stones . I will be purchasing another one . UPDATE
 I chose this bombilla after reading the reviews of several different brands . Everyone seemed to like this one best , and many reviewers were able to compare it to others . I had used one other brand years ago , it was okay , but not as nice as this one.It is truly a joy to use , and although I have yerba mat&eacute; that is extremely fine ground , it truly does strain it all out . It has a nice heft to it . Goodbye to tea strainers and french presses , this is my new favorite way to drink mat&eacute; !! PS , The shipping was the same for two as for one , so I bought two .
 I have received this product as a gift from my friend . She knows I love to drink tea ! I have had those little tea ball brewers , but by far this is really neat . Put the amount of tea into your cup and brew away . I also like how I can use the Bombilla to mix any natural sweetener like a spoon . The neat part of this product is you can even get every last drop from the bottom of the cup with just a slight tilt . In agreement with other customers the Bombilla is easy to clean . The quality is nice , and product is heavier then it looks this is a good thing because it is nice and sturdy . The red ruby studs add a nice `` royal '' touch .
 This straw makes it so easy to prepare and drink loose leaf tea . I 've always wanted to drink more tea this way , but I guess I was too lazy to go through the process of straining or using one of those little ball-filters . Now all I have to do is dump my tea in the cup , stick the straw in and enjoy !
 This works great for my yerba mate . Some smaller particles still got through , but I looked up different ways of preparing my mate . You need to shake the larger parts around the straw to act as a secondary filter . As others have said , very easy to clean .
 I suffer from angina prinzmetal and every day I had chest pain . This product is my miracle in a pill . Since I started using it my chest pain stoped completly . Maybe it is not a cure , but for me works wonderfully .
 This really helps with naturally controlling blood pressure . I have permanently added it to my supplements . My doctor said to me ... what ever I 'm doing , keep it up . I would recommend giving this a try . It is inexpensive , and you got nothing to lose . No side effects for me -LRB- or any that I am aware of -RRB- . Give it try for 30-60 days .
 I 'm following the Vaso Guard therapy from `` What your doctor wo n't tell you About Hypertension '' . The author has a list of vitamins , etc to take and lists specific forms of the vitamins.The author -LRB- also a doctor -RRB- really emphasized the benefits of celery . He suggested either several stalks of celery a day or a celery extract .
 I have been using the celery seed extract for about a year now ... at my last blood work the doc congratulated me on my good health and keeping my blood sugar under control and almost in the normal range now . My good cholesteral had escalated and my bad cholesteral had decreased . The doc told me to keep doing what I was doing . The only thing that I had done different this past year , was to add the Celery Seed Extract to my diet ... so I am still taking it and will do so on a daily bases .
 I have used it twice daily for the past year and it keeps me from having any flareups of gout .
 I also tried another cheaper brand but it does not have the concentrated formula -LRB- 85 % 3-n-butylphthalide , or 3nB for short -RRB- this one does , this brand `` Celery Seed Extract by Natural Factors 60 Capsules '' definitely feels like a diuretic , with this brand I definitely had to go to the restroom more often , the other brand I just went back to normal , ca n't say what it 's doing for my blood pressure yet , I just reordered more of this one so I only took one months worth but will not be trying any of those other brands . With this brand I actually started loosing belly fat with the diuretic flushing , yes you need to drink extra water as with any diuretic .
 I had tried a cheaper product , but it just did n't work as well as Natural Factors . I need a diuretic to help me with my blood pressure and pain and swelling in my foot and ankle , and this works great . I can see and feel the difference with this product . I wo n't be trying any others . I 'll stick with this because it works !
 Celery seed extract helped lower my blood pressure.I did n't want to go on blood pressure medicine , so I decided to use this product first . I also heard that this product is great for lowering uric acid levels .
 Natual Factors Celery Seed along with othter natural products from this company is helping my husband control his high blood pressure .
 Ordered for my son who was diagnosed with gout . After one month the pain was gone . The alternative RX had adverse side effects so this was a good solution
 It is amazing how great these used with other blood pressure supplements work -- if only I could remember to take them -- I now am overweight and need to remember to take them , but to no avail ... but they do work .
 The order went through very smooth and was delivered on time . I was only disappointed that the extract is not the celery oil , but I guess this is my fault as I should read the description more carefully .
 I purchased the Excel Dri-Sleeper for my son who is almost 8 years old . The bed wetting was so severe , that I had to put him in two pull-ups at night . This was becoming very costly , so I decided to take a leap of faith and try the alarm . Within 3 weeks of using this product , my son sleeps through the night without wetting the bed , and does not require a pull-up OR the use of the alarm anymore . We were consistant and followed the instructions , and were amazed with the results . My son is very proud to go to sleep in underwear at night , and to wake up dry in the morning . I highly recommend this product , it is worth every cent !!! When I think of the money I will be saving on pull-ups , and the relief of not having to wash blankets every day - I do not regret for a moment buying the Dri-Sleeper alarm , and wish I had known about this solution years ago .
 I bought this product for my 8 year old daughter who was still having wet nights , although quite infrequently by now , it was becoming a worry to her.We learnt of this technique from a friend who has a daughter the same age and who had not had a dry ever . She was using one of these type of devices provided by the doctor and was getting good results from it . It seemed a good technique to try and much more preferable than chemicals that prevent urine being produced at night.On arrival I was impressed by the manufacturing of the product . It is small , well made , easy for a child to use and the sensor -LRB- the really clever bit -RRB- is sealed and easy to clean . On first use of the Sleeper Excel was not as sensitive as described and did n't always go off when she wet the bed.After a couple of weeks , I tested the device by wetting the sensor and found that it was not working . I contacted the supplier -LRB- not Amazon -RRB- and was given what proved to be bogus advise , saying that the sensor needs to be changed every 4-6 weeks as it looses sensitivity . I though this was strange , so decided to contact the manufacture in New Zealand directly.Dr Anthony Page could not have been more helpful . He corrected the advise I had been given , the sensor does not ` wear out ' as such , but can be broken by a very active child at night stressing the wires . This was not what had happened to me , and Dr Page sent me two additional sensors free of charge all the way from NZ to the UK.My daughter is now really happy . The alarm has gone off in the night , but catches her in time to prevent the bed being wet and she gets up and goes to the loo.The technique seems to work , certainly in our case , as my daughter is now so much more relaxed when she goes to bed and does not worry about wetting , that she is getting a better nights sleep and consequently the wetting has all but stopped.I can recommend the method , the Sleeper Excel certainly does the job and the makers are really concerned with having happy customers and giving good advice to them .
 Our daughter was seven when we bought the product , dri sleeper . She had been wearing pull-ups for years and was getting very frustrated with them . We told her about the alarm system and she was very excited to try it out . Within three weeks she was pull-up free and has been ever since . We would recommend this product to anyone with an older child trying to overcome bed-wetting .
 Our 8 year old son had a problem with bedwetting , and we had tried many techniques to no avail . We got the Dri Sleeper Excel and the first night that he wore it to bed , he got up at night to use the bathroom before the alarm even sounded . He knew the alarm would sound if he was wet and so he just made sure the alarm did n't go off . Ever since then he has always been dry in the morning . His bedwetting problem was literally cured overnight .
 This stuff works better than anything else I 've tried on my dog . She has arthritis in her hips and stifle , and has had surgery on her stifle -LRB- the kind where they use fishing line to hold the joint together -RRB- .
 Not only does this work for dogs but their one for humans is just as good !!
 I use the Ascorbyl Palmitate Powder in my pre and post workout drinks . I also use it smoothies . I like it because it mixes easily in liquids without any unpleasant taste .
 I live by this total food . I mix it half and half with organic spirulina powder from Hawaii and fill # 00 capsules with it . It has really helped my body 's Fibromyalgia pain reduction . It also lifts my spirits , I suppose from the body 's cells drinking it up and my brain cells drinking it up . It absorbs very easy into the cell walls .
 I add this powder to smoothies and homemade face creams . It 's easy to work with and I have no problem with it .
 This product is wonderful ! It is helpful with sleeping , general relaxation , anxiety . The products were received in excellent condition , brand new , factory sealed . Will order this again from the same vendor .
 This stuff really works well with me when I cycle it . I cycle this with other herbal test boosters and this is one of the best .
 I take it at bedtime once in a while and it seems to work pretty good . It 's one of those products like Fenugreek , Tribulus , etc. . It does a decent job but for a powerful product see my review of DAA .
 Look no further , take two of these and put me on your Christmas card list . Give your partner two of these , and put me in your will.If you have blood pressure problems , are sensitive to prescription medications , or cant take Stamina RX this is what you need . The best $ 14 -LRB- or less -RRB- you 'll ever spend . BTW , this is the most effective and highest quality catuaba I 've ever found . If you buy another brand and it does n't work do n't blame me .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 It is almost impossible to purchase regular strength acetaminophen at the local stores . This is for my elderly mother-in-law who is too petite to take the extra strength pills . It is wonderful to be able to get this product delivered to her door .
 I got this for my mother-in-law , who has trouble swallowing larger pills . It was getting expensive to get her the small bottles available in the drugstore as she goes through it pretty quickly . This product allowed us to get the smaller pills in the more economical size .

 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I use these regularly and find them to do a good job . But , you need to pay attention as they do not have # 1 super absorbing gels or # 2 a waterproof backing once they are full they will leak through . I mostly use them at home and as a second layer when needed inside of a disposable .
 I love these ! They 're very comfortable and soft , and they work great ! I have n't had one embarrassing leaking accident ! LOVE them !
 These are SO much better than the disposable . They may seem like a big investment to begin with , but they more than pay for themselves . And they do n't get heavy like the disposable pads . They 're so soft you do n't feel like you 're wearing anything in your bra . I bought three packs and now I only have to wash once a week or so . Wonderful !!!
 I am currently breastfeeding my 4th baby and have breastfed my first three children each for over a year . These Avent washable pads are the BEST I 've found . They are very absorbent and waterproof . They stay in place due to the lace cover . They do not show with the nursing bra I use - they just need to be placed high enough in the bra . Other washables I 've tried either have no outer waterproof barrier or do n't have enough absorbancy and therefore leak . I 've just bought more Avent pads because they work so well for me !
 A little spendy , but no middle seams . Very absorbant . I really like reusing the cotton pads instead of throwing away disposables and adding to landfills .
 After having leaking problems with other brand pads , I bought these and love them . They are twice as thick as the other department store brands . No more leaking problems now ! The mesh bag is great too !
 I found the Avent pads to be quite comfortable . They do n't slip around in my bra , and they are very absorbant . However , I have found that for overnight protection I need to use disposable pads . Overnight leakage was just too heavy -LRB- and for a longer period of time -RRB- for the reusable pads to keep up with . But for daytime use , I love the Advent pads ; they 're soft , comfy , and indiscreet , even under t-shirts .
 I really like Avent pads . After the wash they keep their shape -LRB- love the free mesh bag too ! -RRB- , there is no lint attached to the nipple like in some different brands and they stay in place due to the lace cover on the bra side . Also they absorb leakage well and the milk does n't go through , unless pretty heavy one . I wear them with my bras and nursing tops and no one can tell I wear the pads.Only at night I have to adjust them due to laying on the side , but not a biggie . I wear them more often than disposable ones -LRB- I use Lansinoh and like them too , but they tend to roll when I fold my bra to breastfeed and adjusting is annoying because of the glue side -RRB- .
 I had gotten a huge box of disposables prior to giving birth because I started leaking colostrum well before my daughter was here ... both before AND after having her , the disposables did nothing but irritate me . I bought these right after giving birth and used them the entire time I breastfed ! They were awesome ! I love the lace ... it does help them keep from slipping ! I do n't understand why so many people say they look lumpy or noticeable under their clothing ... I could never tell , but I always wore a nursing bra so maybe that is the difference , but IDK . I m buying a few boxes of these this time around -LRB- about to have my second daughter -RRB- and am really excited about it . Also to the reviews that said they did n't ` fit ' for larger breasts ... I wear a size 40 D and they ` fit just fine for me . I do n't see why they would need to be bigger than your nipple . I do always keep an extra set in my purse though ... I tended to leak when a kid would cry even if it was n't my daughter ! So weird when grocery shopping or something ! LOL !
 Disposable pads seem like such a waste to me ! These pads work well , wash well and are comfortable for someone who does n't leak a lot -LRB- there is no waterproof lining in these -RRB- . You want a thicker bra though to hide the shape of the pad , as it is n't as thin as the disposable pads .
 I purchased these but embarrassingly enough , I am pregnant and my nipples have started to leak frequently . I got these pads to help . They are extremely soft on the cotton side and I can hardly feel them when they are on . On the plus , it makes my chest look a tad bit bigger . : -RRB- Have yet to wash these , but I 'm sure everything should work out ok as it comes with a bag specifically for them . Thanks for saving me from embarrassing wet stains on my shirt . !!
 I love the look and feel of these . Very soft against the skin . They have great absorbency . -LRB- Note , I 've not worn them overnight -RRB- I do have a hard time getting them to stay put in my sports bra . They would probably be ok in a regular bra though .
 I love how soft and thick this nursing pad is compared to the other cloth ones available ! I also like that it does n't show the typical `` line '' a lot of pads often show through your shirt . The only down side is , the pad does n't always stay exactly put . In the month that I 've owned them , one has gravitated out of my nursing bra , and up my shirt 3 times .
 Love these pads . Was sceptical at first because of the lace on one side , but they are less visible through a shirt than ones without lace on the outside . They ar small , yet absorbant . I have had them leak but only when they got really wet . I like that there are 3 pair , but if you order them you might want to order 2 sets . Do n't forget to use the included back when you wash them , they tend to get lost in pants legs and in the washing machine abys .
 I have other AVENT products so I thought I would try this one as well . I was not really expecting this would be great pads , but for this affordable price , this is just good enough for me .
 I purchased a couple different kinds of reusable nursing pads because I just could n't bring myself to constantly line my bras with disposables which , to me , seem like jamming pantyliners into your bra . I like these the best because :1 . They maintain their shape after washing . No strange edges/shapes after being in the dryer .2 . Thickness - I found that the thin pads did nothing to contain my leaking . These pads absorbed well - even when I was soaking through everything else!As others have mentioned , you may see these through your shirt . But , I think that 's the case with most pads if you REALLY need them . I have a heavy milk supply , and these have worked best for me .
 These are everything I could ask for in a nursing pad -- they do n't leak , they 're comfortable , they 're REUSABLE -LRB- why does n't Walmart or Target sell reusables anymore ? -RRB- , and they 're even pretty and feminine , with lacey backs . Perfect . Why spend more ?
 These breast pads work great . The size and thickness was exactly what I needed . I would recommend these pads . I would definitely purchase them again .
 I love these pads . I like the fact that they come with a mesh bag and can be tossed in with the rest of the whites versus handwashed liked the others . I will always recommend to new moms this brand .
 My only complaint is that after 2 or 3 washes the fabric may start to `` pill '' . I use lanolin so i make sure to pretreat these with some dish soap and allow it to sit overnight . Be sure to use the included mesh bag as these can become trapped under your upright washing machine agitator .
 I 'm one of those heavy leakers and thought there was nothing out there that would be reusable . These work well and are very comfortable . The lace on the one side keeps the pad in place . A little trick that may help you leak a little less is to flip your nipple up against the pad . In other words , put a kink in the fire hose line . -LRB- Not everyone 's anatomy is apt for this , but it works for me . -RRB- After nursing two of my boys , these have been the best to not show through clothing . For those complaining about them showing through -- Nursing pads work best with nursing bra 's ; I just find the normal bra 's are to thin to cover up any pad.My favorite nursing bra for support and now showing through clothing :[ ... -RSB- If your looking for convenience then I suggest disposable , otherwise you 're going to have to carry a ziplock baggie with you everywhere for the pads . They need changing as often as you would a disposable . Just like any other pad .
 I 've tried others and this product leaks less , I wish it was a little bigger . I would recomend to a friend ! I also like the mesh laundry bag that 's included .
 So i was skeptical thinking that these things would n't work !! was i wrong ! I put these in the washer -LRB- and it comes with its own washing bag too -RRB- and they come out looking perfect !! I do not dry them however -LRB- so i can not vouche for this part of the cleansing process -RRB- i leave them in the bag and let them air dry which takes a hour at the most !! I am a size 38B with full milk in breast so fairly small boob size and these do not show up under my clothing . A great price for awesome quality !!
 These are great . No leaks . the Only thing that kinda stinks about the product is the garment bag that is included . When using in the washing machine , the bag opens thus negating the purpose of the bag itself . Other then that product is great would buy again .
 Loved these . they stood up to numerous washings -LRB- free in a regular wash cycle -RRB- and stayed put during wear better than any other brands . And they look almost brand new and ready for next time
 These are very nice . Thick and soft . I like them better than the Gerber washable pads . And it comes with a small laundry bag which is added plus .
 I bought these inserts because washable ones seemed more environmentally friendly and were recommended to me by a friend . They work as expected , no embarrassing wet spots on my shirts . I only wish that I cold wear them at night for longer than 3-4 hours without having them soaking wet and needing a new pair . During the daytime , this is not a problem .
 I started trying different brands/types of breast pads and out of the four I have tried so far these are my favorite . I hated the disposables and several of the washables that I tried stated they were waterproof but have leaked through onto my clothes . These are rather thick but very absorbent and are so soft when they come out of the wash . I stopped buying other brands and now own 18 -LRB- 3 sets -RRB- of them and they are holding up nicely with the frequent washing .
 These are really good . I like that they come in a pouch to wash them and dry them in . They could be a little larger around , but all in all they work well . You ca n't go wrong for them to be a dollar a piece and come w/a bag !
 I have both the Philips Avent nursing pads and the Bravado and they each have their plusses and minuses . The Avent seems more absorbent and also dries faster when I wash them , but they are about 1/2 inch smaller in diameter than the Bravado and when the pads slide around at night , sometimes they end up not covering the nipple . What I found works for me is to double them up with one Avent and one Bravado for both coverage and absorbancy .
 I used to use lily pads , but found out when I tried these that there are cloth ones just as good ! I now dont buy the expensive throw away pads and now use these . They are VERY thick and easy to wash !
 These are great . Instead of having to buy disposables all the time , I use these at night , hand wash them while in the shower the next morning , hang them up to dry to reuse for the next night .
 Well I have tried 4 brands of washable nursing pads in the first two months of motherhood and they are : Gerber - one star - pros
 I have to agree with some other online reviews regarding sticking . They do stick a bit after some leakage . Let 's face it , in the beginning , disposables are the only thing that make sense . I used disposables for the first 2 months and then switched to the washables . I tried Medela pads and they did n't absorb ANYTHING ! The Avent pads absorb well and I did n't have leakage problems that other reviewers have had . My pads would get soaked and I would n't have wet spots on my shirt . They do move around within my bra , though . I have had times that the pad was n't properly posiitoned and I had a let down and got wet . Let 's face it , it 's the `` hazard '' of the job ! : -RRB-
 Yes , these may show a little more than disposable pads , but most of the time you 're not wearing skin-tight tops while you 're breastfeeding . These did not slip around me unlike disposables and were much softer to wear . I never planned that the pads should last all day/night , I tended to change pads at every feeding so I never ended up leaking through these . For `` sticking '' , I had the same problem with some disposables ; it happens when you leak and do n't change the pad -LRB- and it dries , thus the sticking -RRB- . I preferred buying 2 sets of the washables instead of continually buying disposables and adding to the landfill problem .
 I bought one package of these and one package of the Medela washables so I could see which one I liked better . I 've been happy with the Avent , happy enough that I bought another package . The feature that I was most pleased with is that they barely show , especially compared to the Medela , which look very lumpy.I 've also used the Avent disposables -LRB- free sample -RRB- and liked them fine , but as someone who is using cloth diapers and wipes , there was no way I was going to use disposable pads on a regular basis .
 I bought these after 6 months of using disposable nursing pads . I just hated wasting the money every 2 months for pads , and wanted to explore the washable options available.This was my first try , and I LOVE them ! I just bought a second set , so I have 6 pairs , and will almost always have one set clean.I 've washed them in the laundry bag they came in and they came out great . Super comfy and absorbant . My daughter is 6 months old and we have started weaning her night feedings , and extending the time between regular daytime feedings as well due to the introductions of solids , so I find I am leaking more than I was . I also have a pretty heavy letdown , and while they do n't shift too much , they will shift some - but so do the disposables.Overall , they are great , and I have already suggested them to several of my friends who are nursing moms !
 The breast pads are soft and they absorb well . I still leak through the pads when my breasts are VERY engorged -LRB- but I think that would occur with any similar product -RRB- .
 Bought these by chance to try and ended up loving them . They do n't lay the nicest in your bra , but save some serious dough by not having to use the disposable ones . Would recommend washing before first use though :-RRB- Highly recommended .
 LOVe that these have the one side that does n't leak through . I produce a LOT of milk and during the day these are perfect ! At night I have to change them once or else I would be soaked but if I do that it never gets all over my clothes and leaks straight out front . My mom have ones almost exactly like this and she loved them , then we found these and I love them and my sister loves them .
 These are great you can just throw them in the wash , however if you leak heavily you might want to add a disposable behind them when you are out and about and ca n't change the pad because they are not leak proof always .
 A must have when breast feeding . These are however a little on the thick side . You need to be wearing a heavier shirt or sweater / sweat shirt to conceal pads in place . Comes with nice small nylon bag to wash them in .
 Why spend all that money on disposable nursing pads ? I absolutly loved these because they were comfortable . They stayed in place and did not leak . The only thing that I feel women should be made aware of is that my gyno informed me that it is not good to put these in the dryer . -LRB- The washer is ok but not the dryer -RRB- This never mattered to me because I washed all mine by hand and air dried them . It was easy enough to wet them , rub them real good on a bar of soap , rinse them , and let them dry .
 I use these all the time -- I only wish I had more for when they are in the wash . The netted bag they come with is perfect for washing so they do n't get lost in the laundry .
 With baby # 1 I had some washable nursing pads that ALWAYS leaked . So I decided to buy some with higher ratings to try it out this time as I 'd prefer washable over disposable and since I 'm now a stay at home mom it does n't matter so much if I leak through . So I bought these . Baby # 2 is n't even a week old and I 'm impressed enough that I 'm back to buy more . There are only three sets in each package which I figured would n't last me a whole day . But as long as my nipple is behind the pad -LRB- and not slipped out -RRB- I have n't had a bit of leaking on my shirts . None . And that 's with over full -LRB- engorged -RRB- breasts and LOTS of leaking . Even at NIGHT time I have n't had a problem . And I 've been changing them because it 's been a lot of time and not because they ca n't hold more.These keep my nipples dry . They keep my shirts dry . And they certainly are n't dry themselves.I 'm back to buy more . And some for a friend too .
 I have a collection of three very different washable nursing pads along with some disposable ones . The Avent nursing pads are my favorite they are so soft and I know which side goes inward -LRB- a mystery with Nuk -RRB- . I also use Nuk - horrible - stiff and thin and some 100 % organic cotton pads thick and soft but they fold up in the wash and do n't dry well . I love my Avent pads and go through them first and want to wash laundry right then .
 My wife loves this product !! They are soft , even after numerous washings ! She loves them so much she ordered another box .
 I have tried a few types of nursing pads , and these are the ones I personally prefer . they are thick , absorbent , and heavy duty . They last a lot longer than others that I have tried , and hold their shape in the wash unlike others that bunch and wrinkle up . Also , the washing bag that comes with the breast pads are great to use for baby 's socks , hand mitts , etc. . I do n't use the bag for the breast pads , I just throw them in the wash by themselves and have n't lost any yet . I highly recommend these !
 Love that it came with a bag to wash the pads in . Also shopped this product online and in stores , best deal was on Amazon .
 I wear these every day . They 're thick and absorbent , and soft on my skin . I much prefer them over theNUK Reusable Nursing Pads , 6 Packwhich I bought at a local store to get me through until these came in . The NUK pads were too thin to be useful.If you care if they show and you wear form-fitting shirts these might show.Apparently I 'm a `` heavy leaker . '' At night these pads are too small to stay in place as I toss and turn , though they are the standard size -LRB- a little over 3 inches in diameter -RRB- . I ended up making myself some 5-inch x 5-inch square nursing pads to use at night.Nursing Pads Ekstra Style , Smalllook like they might be large enough , and LANAcare also has larger sizes . I ca n't use wool though.I ended up buying 3 sets of these , so I can wear a clean set partway through the day if necessary , a clean set at night , and not end up doing the wash every single day .
 so i had heard that these were very small but im a dd and these are great !! the side that goes on your nipple is unbelievably soft too !! the bag is an extra which i think was a great idea
 These are great ! They are absorbent and thick . They do n't bunch up when you wash them . I was pleasantly surprised and will be purchasing another pack .
 I just bought my second set of these they are great mine have never stuck to and I have never had a problem with them leaking
 These work great , absorb well , and wash beautifully . No trouble at all with strange puckering after washing and they tend to mold themselves to the breast . They are not 100 % leakproof , but they generally do the job well . And the bag is great !
 I had a lot of soreness with disposable nursing pads , and a lactation specialist recommended these to me . They work great ! Are much more comfortable than disposables , and stop leaking . I do n't put them in the dryer , just let them airdry after washing and they have maintained their shape fine -LRB- no bulkiness -RRB- . This is the first brand of washable nursing brands I 've tried , but they 've worked so well I 'll keep using this product .
 They feel great , better than the paper/disposable ones and I love the washing bag it gives you as well . The only con is that they look kinda lumpy at first in your bra , but I noticed once I have a shirt on it seems to form to it just fine . Very comfortable !
 These do a good job keeping me dry during the day , but constantly move around at night , which is when I really need them .
 My wife and I just had our second baby and wanted to try and save come money by using washable nursing pads . The firs kind we tried were simply 5 layers of organic cotton , they soaked through and just were not very absorbent . We got these to try an found them to be satisfactory . Granted we are comparing them against disposables which are very absorbent , but these work well enough for daily use . The are more absorbent than the 5 layer cotton &#34; TL care &#34; , my wife says she would recommend them , and i am getting ready to order a couple more packs of them myself .
 Producto de calidad , es excelente y el uso ha permitido validar la durabilidad del mismo . 100 % recomendable . es lo m&aacute;ximo
 They are comfortable , moderately thick , and the padding does n't bunch up over multiple washings . I like not having to use disposables which seems wasteful since I 'd have to go though a lot of them over all the months that I 'm nursing . These nursing pads do have a bit to be desired . In the past , they have leaked to the point where I 'd wake up in the middle of the night with milk soaked both through these nursing pads and my shirt . However , those were rare incidents and for the most part these have been reliable .
 I have tried Gerber disposables , lansinoh disposables & avent disposables , as well as avent reusables & tommy tippee reusables . Avent is thicker and more absorbent for their disposables and their reusables , although i found that none of the disposables stay in place as well as any of the reusables .
 I 've tried the Medela washable nursing pads , and found them to be really bulky . When they come out of the wash , they 're all distorted too , so I have to reshape them before using . The AVENT nursing pads are great because they have a slimmer profile , and the lace covering on one side does provide some traction so it does n't become displaced . I love that they come out of the wash in perfect shape ! These are best for mild leakage , just enough to keep from staining your bra . Also , for those interested in disposable nursing pads , I highly recommend Babies R Us 's own brand of nursing pads . The Medela disposable nursing pads says they offer better shape , but if you wear any bra with even the thinnest padding , you ca n't tell anyway . The BRU brand pads absorb better than the Medela brand , provide better coverage , and are the least expensive I 've found , even cheaper than on Amazon or stores with coupons . BRU will have them on sale sometimes for BOGO half off , so even better .
 Very absorbent and comfortable . I love the bag that comes with it so I do n't have to search the washer anymore . They are on the thick side though ...
 i read a lot of reviews on here ... i did n't want to waste my money on a product that would n't work . I started with disposables -LRB- got the linsonah on sale for $ 1 - so i thought i would try them -RRB- but did n't like the regular cost or the wastefulness.Got these from babies r us for the same price as amazon . and overall , i 'm happy with them . the diameter is a little smaller than that of the disposable , and sometimes they shift around in my bra and do n't cover the nipple - but the same thing would happen with the disposable.i feel they absorb just as well , or better , than the disposable . Either that or i 'm producing less milk than in the beginning -LRB- my baby is currently three weeks old -RRB- , but i 'm not leaking through to my shirt nearly as often - maybe once every other day.I do change them frequently to avoid leakage . I just use some soap in the bathroom sink , press between towel layers to soak up excess moisture and lay out to dry . I have not `` run out '' with this method.For $ 7 , i 'm happy with my purchase .
 I first purchased this product in 2002 and I have to say it is a great product . If you want to get a moderate amount of omega-3 fatty acids into your diet through salmon oil , try this brand . The oil is tested for contaminants such as mercury and PCBs . Finding salmon oil that is from WILD and ALASKAN salmon is somewhat tough . Any fish oil from wild fish is better than fish oil from farmed fish , because wild fish usually have a higher amount of omega-3 fatty acids . The omega-3 fatty acid content per capsule is 80 mg . EPA , 70 mg . DHA . Each capsule also contains 10 IU of vitamin E. Try this product .
 MY WIFE AND I HAVE TAKEN THIS SUPPLEMENT FOR YEARS . IT 'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND WILD ALASKAN SALMON OIL VS JUST WILD SALMON OIL . I BELIEVE THERE WILL BE ALOT LESS MERCURY IN THOSE SALMON IN ALASKA , THAN THOSE FOUND IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY .
 Its an excellent supplement , will boost energy level within days and provides the necessary fatty acids , has countless health benefits which you can find on the internet . The only better alternative is eating wild-caught alaskan salmon .
 I 'm young and in good health -LRB- possibly from all the wild Alaskan salmon I already eat ! -RRB- so it is difficult for me to see a personal gain to taking this supplement . However , I am convinced of this particular brand 's benefit after seeing how it helped my mom . I 've read articles questioning the benefit of fish oil supplements and I was tending to agree with them until I saw the results given by this superior supplement.My mom is in her late 50s and is developing arthritis in her hands . Her knuckles are bony and her fingers lock up in her sleep so when she wakes up , they are frozen in odd positions that she can not move them from right away . It has been like this for years with no sign of improvement . She has daily vitamins she takes and was also taking a daily fish oil supplement.Then one day her sister suggested she try Natural Factors Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil capsules instead as she swore it helped her legs within a week . Mom took one softgel with dinner and the very next day she woke up and her hands were n't frozen into weird positions in the morning . Mom continued to take them . I visited mom several days later and I swear it was like her hands -LRB- and feet ! -RRB- had gotten 20 years younger ! The joints were no longer swollen at all and they did n't catch and lock in odd positions or ache.It makes a lot of sense to me that there WOULD be a difference with this supplement as it comes from wild , Alaskan salmon which is known to have a higher omega count , healthy fatty acids , and far less mercury than other fish , especially farmed bottom-feeders that your standard fish oil pills are made out of . It stands to reason that a healthier fish will result in a healthier supplement and provide healthier benefits to the consumer.I 'm no doctor and I 'm sure that many people out there have joint problems that wo n't be fixed by a mere addition of a nutritional supplement . It is possible my mom was never arthritic and was merely omega-deficient . Either way , her recovery shows myself and my family that as far as fish oil brands go , THIS one actually works for us .
 I love the fact these are Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil . It 's much better for you than PNW salmon oil.The coated softgels are large but go down easily and do n't leave you suffering through fish burps either.Great addition to our medicine cabinet !
 I bought this for my dogs . My intent was to cut them open & squeeze on their food but they love o chew them . I just toss one in each of their meals & they love them . I 'm sure these would be good for me too but I the gelcap are kinda large ... anyway . Reccommended if you dogs needs joint health .
 My jack russell is a very happy dogHis fur is a Soft coat.easy to dispense.throw in with dog food.like it
 I trust the wild salmon source and find the pills digestable -LRB- if large to swallow -RRB- when kept in the freezer and consumed with a cup of liquid snd a meal .
 We know how important omega-3 fatty acids are in our daily diet for cardiovascular health . The question is , how do we keep supplementing our diet with it ? There are a variety of sources in pill form . Some brands have trace amounts of mercury from the fish used and others contain none . There is research available on the internet that shows how much mercury various brands contain.If you are like me , you buy whatever omega-3 fish oil pills you happen to find when you need to restock your supply . So when I stumbled across these Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil Softgels , I purchased them . They contain 1000 mg of omega-3 oil from wild salmon , which do not contain any mercury . The wild salmon season has just passed again , at least here where I live , meaning our ability to buy it here in south Florida . We had been eating wild salmon three times per week for the past three weeks . It 's delicious baked with some white wine , and coated with a mixture of honey and strawberries.These contain oil made from , according to the bottle , parts of the fish that are not eaten , so that no fish are wasted by making these supplements . That leaves me to ponder exactly what parts of the fish were used . Was it the heads , tails or guts , or a combination of all of these ? It sounds unpleasant but all of the parts of the fish are edible.These are made in Canada . Again , I wondered how or if they are tested in some way for content , both of amount of fish oil and contaminants . These things remain a mystery and with any supplement there is the element of the unknown . In a month I will get my cholesterol tested and see if the numbers have come down . Fish oil , when taken in a daily supplement , brings down the cholesterol count in the body.The content of omega-3 fatty acid per capsule is 267 mg . EPA content is 107 mg . DHA content is 93 . The amount of salmon oil is 1000 mg . Each capsule contains 10 calories . There is no vitamin E in these contrary to what one review here states . I am puzzled that one review I read had different information than what is on the bottle.At any rate , I enjoy knowing my omega-3 supplement is coming from wild Alaskan Salmon .
 These are really good quality for the price !! Advice to note prior to ordering , Natural factors has 2 types of this salmon oil 1000mg , BE SURE TO GET ` Enteric Coated ' version Soft gels . NO fishy aftertaste w / this one !!! Better oils come from cleaner waters in Alaska per studies I have done , this one fits the bill !! Great Price for E.Coated and product quality , health purposes . I take them -LRB- 2 a day -RRB- for better health and lower cholesterol levels . They are the standard large size pills , so if have trouble swallowing might avoid . I have NO problems swallowing them myself !! I love these , repeat buyer !
 Will but again ! The price is right , and I feel great taking these daily , its alot cheaper than buying salmon filets every day !
 This is a great way to get our omega 3 . Fast easy transaction-I love Amazon shopping!I even buy a separate product from Amazon for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniels !
 No fishy smell , and hopefully , they really do what they say on the package
 I tried this as a supplement for our high-shed dogs , who also tend to have dry skin , the on the recommendation of our vet . The salmon oil itself worked great and I noticed a change in their skin and fur in less than a week of use on triple dosage -LRB- 1000 mg/30 lb . is normal dog dosage -RRB- . I liked that the softgels were pre-measured , making it easy to assess how much to give , that they were a human grade product and that they did n't need to be stored in the refrigerator , like many high quality oils . And the dogs really liked the taste , even going to the point of boycotting their kibble if I forgot to add these . The major downside was that they had trouble puncturing the capsules , so I had to cut them open and mix them into their food , which got quite messy . -LRB- It 's basically impossible to cut them in half without the oil squirting everywhere . -RRB- So , I 'm totally sold on salmon oil , but am looking into less messy options right now . But , if I do n't find anything as effective , I 'd happily return to these as I felt they did work well and , as I said , the dogs actually enjoyed them , too.PS
 I have taken a couple of these tablets and they made me belch/burp . Other than that i have no real issue with them ,
 I 'm very sensitive to foods , but have been successfully taking this product for years . Other varieties of salmon oil I 've tried have been too strong , but this is light and easily digestible .
 I love this product because there is no fishy smell , and I feel better about 2 hours after taking two pills .
 GOOD all Natural product . . Get your Omega 3 's . . wild alaskan salmon oil isthe Perfect way to get fish oil/omega 3 's into your diet ... I have orderedthis product several times ... I would recommend this to anyone .
 I 've been really happy with this product . I 'm particularly pleased that it 's produced from already harvested fish parts that would otherwise be wasted . -LRB- There is occasionally a fish aftertaste but I 'm not sure that 's avoidable with any salmon oil softgels . -RRB-
 This is a really nice inexpensive vaporizer/aromatherapy unit I can sit right on my nightstand . I only wish they had more fragrances . My nose is always stuffy , but this helps me breath better when I sleep . However , for a head cold or flu I would still prefer to use one with steam .
 Got this as a gift for my sister and her bf they have bad allergies . My sister loves it and says it helps her breathe much better . He says he ca n't smell anything and it does n't do anything , but he 's always plugged up because of cat allergies so that 's probably something this ca n't solve . Otherwise it seems to work for her !
 THE best vaporizer ever !!!! I now have two of them - one for home and one for work ! During a recent respiratory episode before traveling , I used this product with some other essential oils and within two days symptoms were gone and I traveled in good health !
 Love it ! just wonderful as I suffer from sinusitis . It really works well for Me . You will be happy . and it doubles as a nite-light ! great product !
 I bought this product on the recommendation of a colleague and all of the wonderful reviews , and it did n't disappoint . We used it last night for the first time with the eucalyptus pad that come with the unit . Absolutely wonderful scent but not too overpowering . I am anxious to try it with the vicks pads as well .
 I love this unit because I do n't have to worry about mold.I like that you can change the oils in the pads for different fragrances.Lavender for sleep , lemon for energy , eucalyptus for congestion , etc.This is a great product .
 I was looking for something to help my one year old breathe better at night and I did n't want to keep refilling a humidifier . This was the perfect thing for him . It helps to clear his stuffy nose pretty well . I only gave it four stars because I wish it would last longer . He sleeps about 10-12 hours a night and the scent pads stop working before that . Otherwise , it is a great product . I 've been using it with the universal refill oil and pads every night for about a month , and it still works !
 I used to have one of these and it was a great product somehow it got misplaced or accidently thrown away but I found another one and refills here at Amazon and such a great product no messing with water . They have great pricing here and refill kit and vaporizer pads available too . I highly recommend it enjoy !
 Hi I just saw the post about fires and called the company . I spoke with Steve Powers the owner . The current owner bought it in 2006 and completely rebuilt the vaporizer . Added 3 new safety features , TCL switch , ceramic casings , all kinds of technical stuffs . He has never had any problems with fire or hazardous malfunctions since the rebuild of the product . He said he has had 3 returns for various reasons since 2006 . Thats a pretty darn good track record . He was very helpful and had alot of information for me . Nice to see someone who is proud of his product and stands behind it 100 % . I bought this product for my 18month old for congestion and been using the eucalyptus pads and they have worked great ! I am very impressed with the product . This is a great American product and I am happy to support a home-grown business .
 My 1 1/2 year old dog developed Kennel Cough from a local doggie day care . I started immediately using the Vapor-Eze with the menthol Eucolyptus and it has helped her tremendously thought the night ... Thank YOU !
 This product is a great , especially if you do n't like water vaporizers . Personally , I do n't like water vaporizers because of the mold that can build up in them , and the mess created by them.This product is inexpensive and easy to use . All you have to do is plug it in , pull a pad out of the packaging , put it in the machine and you are done . In less than ten minutes , the room is filled with the vapor and your child stops coughing . My daughter has bad allergies and gets frequent colds and this helps her a lot.Plus IT 'S MADE IN THE USA ... It is very cheap to buy vaporizer and first set of refills with Amazon . But -LRB- sorry Amazon -RRB- it is better to buy the refills directly form Vapor-eze -LRB- they are MADE IN AMERICA too !!! -RRB-
 I do n't know who 'd even buy a unit that runs on water anymore . It 's nice and small , and it 'll work with Vicks pads that you can get in the drugstore .
 I LOVE THIS HAD ONE AND MY BABY BROKE IT I ASAP GOT A NEW ONE , SO MUCH BETTER THEN HAVING THAT HUGE THING OF WATER IN THE BEDROOM , THIS IS GREAT FOR BABIES THAT ARE SICK IT REALLY WORKS GOOD THE ONLY DOWNFALL ARE THE REPLACEMNTS CAN BE A BIT EXPENSIVE , BUT FOR ME IT 'S SO WORTH NOT HAVING THE MESS OF A BIG HUMIDFIER .
 We bought this for the labor and delivery room . The first thing that all of the nurses said when they came in for their shift was how good it smelled . Three of them wrote the product number to purchase it for themselves . We now use it for the nursery .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR COUPLES WHO ARE JUST STARTING THEIR TOY COLLECTION . PLAYFUL COUPLES WILL ENJOY THIS BOX O ' FUN .
 This is my second order . It has worked so well for me in controlling my hot flashes , I ordered some for my friend .
 Do n't know how they feel on the outside , but from the inside , they are smooth . If I were n't so self-centered and caught up in my own activity , I 'd ask her how she likes the feel of the outside of these things .

I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I ordered this product just last month and let me tell you it is the best that I have ever had . I have problems with my spine and I was looking and looking for a product that I did not have to take internally . I was in a car accident a few years ago and never fully recovered from it . I have trouble with my upper back muscles that then to pull on my spine a great deal . I use this product and it sooths that pain and I can go about my daily activities . I even found the companies web site that is www.bluestuff.com that has a lot of other products as well . You will not be sorry that you tried this product really for any pain that people have . SuperBlue takes the pain away so I can have a life !!!!!
 ONE OF THE FEW heat rubs/pain relief rubs that ACTUALLY works.This stuff is worth EVERY penny . I get many injuries in karate and this keeps me going . Helps with all muscular aches and pains . Removes very bad bruises in hours.It 's GREAT .
 I 've been using this stuff for about 3 years . It stops the pain almost as soon as it touches you . It takes only a tiny dab and the bottle lasts for a couple of years for me . I gave tons af samples to people and who-ever I give the samples to , they order one for themselves . Sometimes it does n't work on something , but if it 's going to work , it will be instant . I 've used it for burns , bursitis , aches + Pains and even across my forehead for headaches to . I got it for my foot pain , but it did n't help , but before I was to send it back , I tried it on my stiff neck and it was better before I even put the lid back on the jar . You wo n't be sorry .
 My husband has suffered from pain for much of his life . We originally saw Super Bluestuff on an infomercial years ago and decided to try it . It was amazing how quickly and well it worked on his pain . We never go without it now ! I was so happy to see it was available from amazon and for a cheaper price than anywhere else . I sent a bottle to my mom last week . She said she 's had neck pain every night for years , and after just one application she had her first pain-free night in a long time . I know the price seems a little high , but a bottle lasts for months and is n't living a painless life worth it ? I sure think so!Good luck getting rid of your pain .
 Great product for lower back pain this product goes a long way my wife and I both depend on this when I first found this it cost me twice the price at retail store
 I have had terrible neck pain due to stress for the past few years and I have tried everything before this cream . This cream seems to work as well as my chiropractor and the cost of 1 tube costs as much as 1 visit to the doctor , but the tube lasts much longer .
 Have used the SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream for some time , it has been very useful in reducing osteoporosis as well as Arthritic pain in back and shoulders , We hope they do n't change the formulation in the future - we are very satisfied as is . Hubert Doke
 Although pricey , this lotion really works . After rubbing the lotion on the affected area , in about 5 minutes the pain is gone . I will order more when this one runs out .
 I bought this product after receiving a sample in the mail . SuperBlue smells minty blueberry . It really does temporarily help pain . It is a bit pricey but with the 12 once bottle last a good long time because it is applied in thin layers . In short it 's a good product .
 I am very , very , very pleased with product and the results.I use it every day and I am grateful that there is a supper blue product like that . DMC
 This product was purchased for an elderly couple who do not have a computer . The man is 100 years old on Christmas Day this year !! I guess the cream really works .
 The pump dispenser makes it easier to use.We like this product because it helps with aches and pains and does n't smell awful or make you feel like you 're on fire .
 In the last 4 + years , I have experienced a lot of pain with arthritis ... This product has helped me tremendously ... It will relieve pain and soreness associated with arthritis -- and other types of pain as well ... I do take prescribed meds for my arthritis -- but SuperBlue is my first preference before taking pain medication ... And most of the time is ALL I need ... Also , It has never stained my clothing -- nor can I smell the product after a few minutes ... Love the pump ...
 Great pain relief cream and easy to massage with . I also use and recommend biofreeze for athletes and poeple who work out . Have a friend with fibromyalgia and she uses biofreeze gel and superblue pain relief cream for her muscle pains . I do recommend it !
 SuperBlue Pain Relief Cream , 12 Ounce Bottle with PumpI love this product , it really works !! I have muscle spasms in my neck and it takes care of them !
 I got just what I expected great price and it arrived in a timely manner .
 I have used this for many years . I recently pulled some ligaments in foot ... After 3 weeks of pain . I reordered my super blue . Thankful that I did .
 i have major foot surgery . I used it every day after . It healed quickly and looked so much better everyday using it . I really liked it
 Works good . I really like that it does n't smell like most &#34; pain creams &#34; and it does a great job . Only complaint is it is a wee bit pricey . I recommend it .
 I absolutely LOVE Super Blue Stuff . It works great . If it does n't work for you in 5 minutes , reapply . If it still does n't work , get your money back and go back to the planet you came from : -RRB-
 I really do n't understand what this product does , but it seems to work on aches , pains , sore muscles and the like.My wife , my mom -LRB- at 94 years of age -RRB- , my children , and I love this stuff . I do n't think it will help serious cases of arthritis , of cancer pain , but for the everyday problems , it 's great .
 Out of curiosity I have used this product after seeing the infomercial on TV . I refer to it as the miracle worker . I have purchased several bottles because each time I lone a friend or a relative to try it they never return it . Now I tell every one to go to Amazon and order their own . IT WORKS.Try it and you will never be without it .
 SuperBlue is a fabulous product that REALLY works . If you have pain or aching this will really help you . Try it .
 Blue Stuff is amazing . I have used it for years . It really does ease the pain of arthritus . I love this product !
 SuperBlue works great to soothe pain . I suffered a serious sports-related injury a year ago and have been using this ever since to soothe the pain I feel whenever I overexert myself . A little of it goes a long way too .
 This pain cream really works ! And the best part besides that is the sweet smell of peaches ! Awesome stuff !
 This product is excellent for arthritic and muscle pain . I have used it for years and am never without it .
 I had a similar neck pillow made by another company - which got lost on a plane , train , or ... somewhere else along the way on a recent trip . I was very glad to find this!These pillows are filled with rice and buckwheat , which comform to your body and provide much better support than foam , air , just about any other material.We bought 3 , -LRB- 2 `` travel '' and one `` spa '' -RRB- and are very happy with them . The fleece provide warmth , and this one -LRB- the twilight crush -RRB- stays nice and cool -LRB- better when you 're in the tropics ;-RRB- -LRB- the fleece will be held for use in travel -RRB- . I 'm adding this review for those who ca n't tell the difference between the various pillows offered -LRB- as the descriptions are pretty sparse -RRB- . I believe the fill is the same on all of them . -LRB- so they should all be microwabeable -RRB- . They all have removable covers , and so , are washable . The fleece retains warmth better , and the smooth fabrics stay cool . beyond that , i ca n't tell the difference between the `` travel '' and `` spa '' pillows.These are very well made , and a real bargain at this price!One other thing to consider if you are buying this as a travel pillow . It 's pretty substantial -LRB- weighty -RRB- , and might be more than some want to carry ... but they are so much more comfortable than air pillows , and really good if you have neck or back problems .
 I LOVE this thing . It works every bit as well as it says it does , and then some . I use it on my neck nearly every day , but even more than that , I use it on my lower back , or even wrap it around my knee when my arthritis kicks in . Love it , love it , love it .
 Initially this wrap feels wonderful , but after a little while you might find it to be a little hard . Still it does feel great to start with and its hard to turn down the wonderful smell the herbs give off and the fact that it can be warmed in the microwave and it 's so easy to clean . You wo n't regret getting it . : -RRB-
 My 90 yr old mother loves these . Not only do they keep her warm , but she does not slip on the hardwood floors .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor .

 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I 'm sure my results are a combination of exercise , calcium , vitamin D and strontium , but despite the fact that I take a prescription that causes bone loss , my bones are stronger than they were 2 years ago !! That 's all good !!!
 Great price and received it quicker than expected . I am anxious to see what my test results are after using it for awhile . Heard alot of great reviews on it .
 It 's sparkls suspended in gel . It has a pleasent smell , and the gel is not thick and heavy but light and easy to apply . The color of the gel showes the color of sparkle , and it applies a clear coat , a pigment can be added to give it color , if desired . The Stardust , when applied , lasts for a long time if clothing is not rubbing agaisnt the application . Thier customer service is promt in anwsering any questions via e-mail . Note , you get one 2 oz jar per order , not all four as shown in the picture ; although , if you order more than one , you might get a free sample of another style gel .
 My mother has macular degeneration and has not been able to watch TV for 5 years . She is now able to see it again and is trilled to watch golf , basketball and news.Try it , it works .
 I use the screen to magnify my computer screen . When the agency I work for changed to a smaller font to ` squeeze ' more onto the screen , my eyes were constantly tired . They burned and itched , and by the end of the week , I just wanted to keep them closed all weekend . The very first day I used the magnifying screen I could tell the difference . It was like a big relief ... no more burning , itchy eyes . I would n't be without it at work and would recommend it to anyone !! Loree Halvorson
 It works good for TV watching ! For computer use , you ca n't magnify the screen much -LRB- by moving the lense farther away from the screen -RRB- or else it gets too blurry to read fine text/etc . . For TV use , I do n't notice any blurring . There is glare . I can see my own reflection , which , mind you , is a beautiful thing to look at , but it 's not something I want to see when I 'm using my computer or watching TV , especially when I have n't shaved or showered in a while . There seems to be a slight blue tint to the lense , probably just a property of the kind of plastic they used , but I truly can not notice it affecting the TV or computer colors . I made sure I did n't eat any smurf cereal in a while before double checking on this . The more enlargement you use , the more you have to be watching it from straight in front of it , probably obvious . I 'm sure it could be improved technologically , to have some kind of anti-glare coating , and to not have any blur effect for computer use . But , I 'm using it and pretty happy with it .
 I attached this screen magnifier to my computer screen . It was simple to attach and I like the fact that I can slide the screen to any position , forward or back , as needed . I 've found it very helpful .
 I only needed a 15 '' size , but they were out , but this one is fine . I imagine I could use it on a smaller computer .
 Bought this brush to do the wheels on my car when I was washing it . Turns out it was a great brush to help clean up the bathtub with.Hard to go wrong with that .

 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 This product is very good for the price . It is NOT the best , but the `` best '' is only marginally better and costs 3x the price . If you are taking 2-3 shakes a day that can really add up . At the start of 2006 , I 'd say Biotest produce the best products , you can read about them at T-Nation . HOWEVER they are very expensive and this is a fine product . I would give it 5 stars except it is a bit below the quality of others . Most protein brands I would only give 2 or 3 stars.I am writing this review to help anyone who is unsure , as I was , about FLAVOUR and MIXABILITY . You can read detailed reviews on the bodybuilding website.The flavour is not bad . Mixed only with water , it is not bad at all . Which is important because you will be taking it all the time . I have only tried Vanilla , which I prefer as a flavour , since you can mix it with other things , such as orange juice . The fact that it mixes with water and tastes OK is a great bonus.Mixability - it is about 90 % the mixability of the current best in the world . Most powders out there are 80 % mixable at best . I mix with a spoon . But really , it pretty much mixes itself . I use it with soda water which fizzes , I put a bit of water in the cup , put the powder on top , stir it - and it fizzes to the top of the cup . Then I stir it up , add more water and it is done . When drunk , there is almost NO residue . That means no washing up . There are always small amounts that are not mixed , but these are very small indeed , and who cares your stomach will mix them . When drunk , the cup needs only a light rinse in water and is practically clean - the best cleanup of any product I have ever seen . Note that these useability benefits - clean mixing , easy cleanup - are essential if you are going to use the stuff multiple times a day . Who wants a trail of dirty cups along the sink?Hope that helps . I certainly would recommend this product to anyone as the base of their protein , even if you can afford the more expensive brands.Good luck with your training .
 Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Protein is without a doubt , the BEST protein supplement on the market ! I have tried both the vanilla and chocolate flavors , each being superbly delicious in their own fashions.The vanilla is rather smooth and creamy when mixed with milk and also does very well when mixed with smoothies . However , the chocolate is my favorite of the two . It is surprisingly rich and flavorful that makes you craving for more!Overall , you can not go wrong with this product . With 23 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs per serving , this is the ultimate protein supplement drink on the market today .
 great Whey Protein , ITS REALLY WORK FOR ME , pls trygreat Whey Protein , ITS REALLY WORK FOR ME , pls trygreat Whey Protein , ITS REALLY WORK FOR ME , pls try
 It 's the best product I could find for the price . I read a lot of reviews , some negative , about taste ; but I have no problem with it . I use a shaker cup with cold water for about 20 seconds and it tastes as good as any .

 I LOVE this thing . It works every bit as well as it says it does , and then some . I use it on my neck nearly every day , but even more than that , I use it on my lower back , or even wrap it around my knee when my arthritis kicks in . Love it , love it , love it .

 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Great product for the price . Helped me put on some weight in combo with some other stuff -LRB- jack3d and l-arginine -RRB- . Serving is 4 capsuls but they are small compared to other amino acid suppliments - I once got pills that were so large you hand to cut them into 4 peices to swallow them , and a serving was still 4 capsuls . Overall pretty good product and there are 360 capsuls for pretty cheap .
 Highly recommend . My hair was falling out from medication and this helped dramatically . I have more energy throughout the day . Well worth the cost .
 I 've tried several different amino acids supplements and have decided this is my favorite . For the price you get 360 caps which last well over a month for me . I liked Amino Energy by ON but it 's just too expensive to justify . I take 2 each morning and 4 after workouts to supplement my protein shake . Powders are n't bad either but this is grabbing these caps are too convenient .
 This product is a great deal for the money , the pills go down easy , and they are not flavored ! Will buy again !
 i take a serving of these whenever i need an energy boost . the cost is reasonable and i would recommend it . the only thing i do n't like is that 1 serving is 4 big capsules -LRB- use 1-3 servings per day -RRB- .
 Great deal for the price . The capsules are easy to swallow and provide me with energy . Much safer than drinking those energy drinks . Excellent buy .
 I looked up the recommended amount of each amino acid required for my body weight . This product provides roughly 1/10 of each one in 4 capsules . So I would have to take 40 capsules per day to get the recommended amount.I do n't want to take that many capsules per day and it would be very expensive.However , I do think it 's a good idea to take SOME of these every day to make sure you get all essential acids daily , which is not likely unless you are a nutrition fanatic .
 Folks , amino acid supplements are NOT gon na give you muscle mass or weight gain by itself . Calorie intake gives you weight gain and working your muscles give you muscle mass growth . Amino Acid supplements are primarily for people on vegetarian diets who do n't get enough protien because they do n't eat meat . If someone is on a diet and trying to burn fat , the fat is used and broken down into glucose -LRB- carbs -RRB- . The body can not manufacture the 8 essential amino acids produced by breaking the peptide bond in proteins . Thus , people who do n't eat food rich in protein , need protein supplements . After the body recieves an adequate supply of amino acids , more amino acids wo n't help any . The body can not store excess amino acids - thus the daily intake . IF you want massive muscle growth , inject steroids . I do n't recommend it , though .
 I will not take too much vitamin B6 , because it can have negative long term health consequences .13 mg of Vitamin B6 are added to each serving = 650 % RDV . I already take 1/2 of aSource Naturals B-125 Complex , 180 Tablets . To remedy this extraordinarily high level of B6 , I have adjusted my daily dosages of other supplements which contain vitamin B6 .
 While the product advertises 120 or 360 caps , there are only a total of 30 or 90 servings , because the serving size is 4 capsules . NOW Foods Amino Complete
 I saw information about these amino acids on a show and wanted to try them out . My energy levels have increased after starting them .
 I take two of these before i work out and two afterwards . It helps my endurance and i perform better . I like the results .
 the product is really great . I have used powders in the past , but the tablets are just easier . You do n't have to make a drink or a smoothie to use to product . Also the price is much better than organic food stores.Excellent packaging and delivery was right on time . Could not ask for more .
 I think this is a great product , has all the amino acids needed for health daily . I would purchasde this product agin .
 NOW Foods Amino Complete , 360 Caps What can I say good price . still taking them do n't know if they work or not yet
 These pills helped me gain some muscle in about a month . I did double the dose a few times to get more results . I take about five capsules a day , love the effects . I highly recommend this product , just up your dose .
 Huge bottle . My husband and I are currently taking it - seems to help - but will continue to monitor .
 I had a similar neck pillow made by another company - which got lost on a plane , train , or ... somewhere else along the way on a recent trip . I was very glad to find this!These pillows are filled with rice and buckwheat , which comform to your body and provide much better support than foam , air , just about any other material.We bought 3 , -LRB- 2 `` travel '' and one `` spa '' -RRB- and are very happy with them . The fleece provide warmth , and this one -LRB- the twilight crush -RRB- stays nice and cool -LRB- better when you 're in the tropics ;-RRB- -LRB- the fleece will be held for use in travel -RRB- . I 'm adding this review for those who ca n't tell the difference between the various pillows offered -LRB- as the descriptions are pretty sparse -RRB- . I believe the fill is the same on all of them . -LRB- so they should all be microwabeable -RRB- . They all have removable covers , and so , are washable . The fleece retains warmth better , and the smooth fabrics stay cool . beyond that , i ca n't tell the difference between the `` travel '' and `` spa '' pillows.These are very well made , and a real bargain at this price!One other thing to consider if you are buying this as a travel pillow . It 's pretty substantial -LRB- weighty -RRB- , and might be more than some want to carry ... but they are so much more comfortable than air pillows , and really good if you have neck or back problems .
 I LOVE this thing . It works every bit as well as it says it does , and then some . I use it on my neck nearly every day , but even more than that , I use it on my lower back , or even wrap it around my knee when my arthritis kicks in . Love it , love it , love it .
 Initially this wrap feels wonderful , but after a little while you might find it to be a little hard . Still it does feel great to start with and its hard to turn down the wonderful smell the herbs give off and the fact that it can be warmed in the microwave and it 's so easy to clean . You wo n't regret getting it . : -RRB-
 This is a great supplement that is time released , so it stays in your system longer . It agrees well with me and I just need one for the whole day .
 I ordered this cleaner for an expensive leather purse that had gotten dye on it from a dark-wash denim jean . I tested it on a small piece of leather that was hidden and it did n't change the color at all , so I used it all over . It took the denim dye right out and made the leather look brand new . Could not be happier with this product -- want to get the leather conditioner as well !
 I own a very high quality leather sofa and lounge chair which I have had for 10 years . I use the product faithfully to clean and preserve the beauty of the leather , and it has never failed me .
 I bought this with the Apple Leather Conditioner . My 2Unfold grey leather bag from Hard Graft was really getting covered with scratches and dirt , so i wanted to revive it back to its former glory.I followed the instructions - Use with a soft cloth , wipe in circular motion . Repeat with Leather Conditioner after . I did it with half the bag so that i can compare the before/after effect.End result was fantastic - The Cleaner lessened the visibility of the scratches and brought the leather back to its original , darker color . The Conditioner gave it a shine , and a nice , smooth protective feel.It 's been a couple of weeks by now , it feels like the bag is more resistant to scratches.Overall , i am just so glad and relieved it works with my leather bag !
 I have a leather planner , a leather purse , leather shoes , etc. . This product never lets me down . It cleans well and seems to condition even before I add the Apple conditioner , which really ads a shine :D I 've used lots of cleaners and conditioners , and this one just works . It keeps my leather products looking like new ! When I need to , I use with Meltonian cream polish , which I also highly recommend for leather care due to consistency and beauty of MANY colors .
 I think most people have two uses for leather cleaners.One is for day to day use ... your fancy leather luggage , backpack , wallet , iPad case or purse starts looking a little shabby , and you want something to make it look revitalized and almost new again . For this scenario , Apple Leather Cleaner works well , especially on darker leather products . It cleans , softens and generally helps your leather product look like new , and if you use it regularly , it gives your leather item a bit of protection so that it will be easier to clean next time . Only very minor complaint is that light colored leathers tend to come out looking very slightly darker , and leathers with a natural matte finish tend to take on a bit of a sheen . Otherwise , the results are generally great.The other use is for stain removal ... you get -LRB- say -RRB- ballpoint pen on your favorite leather iPad case . Unfortunately , here the Apple cleaner does n't work quite as well . With lots of elbow grease , you can sometimes work maybe 80 % of these stains out , but the most common outcome will be a fainter stain , not a removed stain . If stain removal is important to you , then I might suggest a different type of product .
 Would definitely buy this product again in the future as it completely cleaned my leather goods as described . The best !
 I used to to take the denim transfer from my dark jeans to my white purse . It took the color off right away and made the leather feel very supple and didnt damage the leather or change the color . I highly recommend using it to protect light bags from denim dye transfer .
 Great product ! It really cleans your leather goods without ruining them ! Totally necessary for those who own designer shoes and handbags !

 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!

 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 Underwent physical therapy last year and again this year and was introduced to the PT-200 - As a runner it is the best stretch aroundThanks
 If only all purchases came met and exceeded expectations like this one . Fantastic for my feet and legs I use it daily .
 I used this at PT , and when my husbands podiatrist said he needed to stretch his calfs to help his plantar fasciitis , I thought of the pro stretch PT200 . It works great for this !
 I have shelled out for three different varieties of orthotics . Do n't bother . For under ten percent of the charges for the orthotics I got this tool , stretched out my plantar and Achilles , and am now a heck of a lot better , at a much better price and with out the bother of messing around with my shoes . My Podiatrist 's Warning
 Of course you can also just lean on a wall to stretch your calves , but now you do n't have to . And why would n't you want to ? Well , first you actually need enough space in front of that wall . And that space in front of the wall be clear of clutter , clean , and can provide a good grip for your shoes . And your hands better be clean too despite all that lifting -LRB- or running -RRB- you may have done preceding the calf stretching session . But even with clean hands , at some point in the future , you will see marks on that wall that you will need to do something about.With the pro stretch gadget , you do n't need to worry about space -- since you can do your stretches anywhere . In front of a chair , or in front of a table , in front of the piano , etc. . And yes , even in front of a wall ; you just would n't need that much space anymore . You can do stretching inside too . I have a tight home made gym , and this allows me to do my calf stretching right away . The `` roller '' feature allows for a good stretch easily and quickly . I have both the single and the `` duo '' version . Both are excellent . My plantar fasciities finally got healed when I regularly stretched with this gadget and used a night splint -LRB- Freedom PF II from AliMed -RRB- to bed.Highly recommended .
 The Pro Stretch PT200 Heel Stretch Device for two feet makes my legs and whole body feel energized when I use it . The Pro Stretch for one foot does just as good a job , but it is quicker to use the Pro Stretch for two feet . A reminder
 I 've had one of the ` single ' food stretchers for many years and always regretted not getting the double . Recently I 've had trouble with plantar fasciitis and decided to get the double to make treating the condition easier and more efficient , so that I would actually do it . This stretcher does n't look like much , but it 's actually very smart and effective . As soon as I started using it every day , along with a few other therapeutic techniques to stimulate blood flow , I felt a distinct lessening of pain . Very slowly and incrementally there has been a continued improvement in my condition . Hope I can get it to heal entirely eventually .
 Amazing for people with IBS . I am now able to manage this disease . The enzymes break down the food and this helps the digestion process .
 I bought me this from where I work and let me tell you this , I do n't regret it at all!I 'm not really the type into pampering and stuff like this but this stuff is amazing . It 's easy to use ; just rub it into your feet during your shower then rinse it off . After I get out and dry my feet off , they are always so soft.Not to mention it smells so good ! This item is worth every penny !
 This deoderant is my favorite . Doesnt have any crazy smell once you get going . I prefer this over right guard
 If you do n't like condoms , you will love these ! Feels like nothing at all !
 When I first saw these I was skeptical . I thought `` Lamb intestines ... on my wee-wee ? That has n't happened since that one long lonely weekend at Uncle Phil 's farm . `` Boy did these bring back memories . Soft , smooth , roomy ... and available 3 to 12 at a time.My girl ... she did n't understand my excitement when thet arrived . She thought it was kind of weird . But I told her they tied off at the end and it was like tying a ribbon in my pubes . That 's all it took for her ... for me all I needed was her to make a few animal noises and I was on cloud nine.It 's a shame about the not preventing diseases part of these ... sheep in Scotland must be at the vetrinarian for shots of penicillin all the time . But otherwise I give these babies 5 stars ... Thanks Trojan ... for bringing out the animal in me ... by bringing the animal into the bedroom !
 These are the breath-freshener of choice for one of us at home . The flavor is sweet-cinnamon , a bit hot but not unpleasant . Almost like a candy redhot . If you do n't like mint or mouthwash , these may float your boat . The tin is cute , and tiny enough to stash in a cummerbund , watch pocket , even -LRB- hmm ! -RRB- your bra .
 I 'm doing this little review in case anyone 's wondering what the `` Twilight Crush '' color looks like . The colors are n't described well , and all of the colors in the picture are n't listed , so you ca n't easily tell which is which . Now clicking on a color choice will bring you a single product on the screen , which is better than a few weeks ago , when I bought mine.I mistakenly thought that the shimmer of the Twilight Crush pillow was distorting the way the color appeared in the picture , and it was that pretty color of rose that the girl 's holding . Instead , it 's a strange , shimmery green and burgundy red color , quite similar to the picture they have up now , but where the picture looks brown , it 's actually much more red . That shimmery green is the dominant color , however , and the red is more of a `` background '' color . In my opinion , it 's not very pleasant to look at , but it smells good , and maybe I 'll get used to the odd color combination . If I could do it over , I 'd go for the blue feather color choice ... I 'd also wondered why it has the funny little heart sewn onto the front of the pillow . That 's actually a little pocket , inside which is a very small cloth scent packet . The rest of the filling is accessed through a velcro pouch on the back of the pillow . Open it up , and you 'll find a pouch of unscented buckwheat . This is quite nice ; in case you do n't like the way the scent smells , you can remove it ; and also so you 're not over-heating the scent packet when you heat the buckwheat packet !
 As compared to a neck pillow filled with loose buckwheat & the same scents mixed in , this pillow 's heat lasts quite a long time -LRB- about 1.5 hrs when leaning on back , 45 min . when used on neck/shoulders/upper back -RRB- . The buckwheat/rice are stuffed securely , so they do n't slip & slide around when you want the heat in a certain place . The scents come from a small cloth sachet inside the smaller heart , which is good for when you do n't want the aromatherapy on occasion . The cover is removable -- good for lysol-ing or handwashing .
 I drink this tea regularly for the most part . It does n't have the after-taste that I hate about most teas . It is a decent energy booster in the mornings -LRB- some mornings when I 'm drowsy at my desk , drinking this tea helps to resolve my being tired -RRB- . I can drink this tea after a heavy meal and it helps ` encourage ' the digestive process so that I do n't walk around feeling bloated with a full stomach . I workout 5-6 times per week -LRB- weights and cardio mix -RRB- and I do notice a slight increase in fat burning when I drink it at least twice a day.Also , the shipments arrive VERY quickly .
 This tea help me achieved my goal to shed unhealthy weight and yet feeling energetic as long as you couple it with good eating habit exercise and determination to stay healthy.This tea makes me feel less hungry and so I was able to control the portion of food that I eat.Balance nutrition polks , food rich in fiber , legumes , fruits and vegetables.Steak ? Why not ?
 I drink the tea about 2 to 3 times a day . I 've been drinking it for about 2 years . Gives me energy so its great for those that suffer from fatigue . I exercise also 2 to 3 times a week . Combined with drinking this tea it has helped me shed some pounds and yet maintain good health .
 My co-worker introduced me to this product and the first place I look for good pricing is Amazon . This tea really does what it says . Always take this tea with food as it basically speeds up your digestion process so if you have an empty stomach you will end up with some pretty intense stomach cramps . It is rather gentle since it has a mild laxative in it . Usually sends the `` feeling '' about 30-45 minutes after consumtion . I drank about 2-3 a day and while it does n't just shed pounds it helps maintain weight or lose a bit all by itself . Combined with a good diet and excerise and you will for sure lose weight and get healthy . It does n't have a bad taste but I chose to just gulp it down . Not one for sipping this tea . All in all a fantastic product .
 This is a wonderful tea . I have been drinking it as iced tea , unsweetened for five years . It keeps me hydrated , have a healthy tongue and helped me to detox from aspertame when I switched from diet soda . I keep a balanced wieght using it . My neighbor just started using it and has lost 4 lbs in two weeks after trying every diet she could find . It has also resolved a thrush issue she has been expierencing from one of her medications side effects . I would recommend and do recommend it to everyone I know .
 Tastes good , keeps me full , and I love it . Have n't been the best with my eating , however , I 've lost weight !
 I am looking forward to order more for a good price , because I love this tea !
 My sister introduced me to this tea years ago and really liked it . I was so disappointed when our local asian store no longer carried it . Thankfully , I found it on Amazon and placed my order . I love this tea . Worried about gaining weight ? Drink it after each meal as it helps rid of fat before they are absorbed/stored as fat in your body . I 'm also a diabetic and this tea has helped control my blood sugar levels . Good eating habits and exercise still applies .
 My acupuncturist recommended this tea to me , and along with other TCM and in conjunction with acupuncture , increased activity and healthy eating , I think it helps . Mainly , I 've noticed better digestion , decreased bloating , and decreased constipation when I drink at least two cups a day .
 I think the shipping cost is a little high . But , I received the tea quite promptly .
 I drink this tea before I turn in at night and it calms my stomach . With a little honey it tase real good . Thanks .
 I love this tea ! I 've been taking it for a long time it helps me with my weight and also with my BP . I Recommend it to all my friends and family .
 I have been using this product for about 4 months . It gives me an empowered feeling and makes me forget about food . No explosive side effects like you get with other diet teas . One cup leaves me feeling positive and with the strength to make good choices about what I eat . Does not taste bad either .
 The product is good and the service Amazon offers is great . The purchase process was easy and I got the merchandise very quickly .
 this is a very good price for the Bojemni tea -- my husband and I both drink it and it has helped us . We find we need less of it as the effect is cumulative over time . Great product and it came fast in the mail .
 I have always felt that I was that one girl that sweat way more than other girls ever since I could remember . I have always had to constantly reapply through out the day and even then I would sometimes end up smelling like sweat mixed with deodorant.When clinical strength deodorants came out I was so happy because I finally found something that worked that I did n't need to constantly reapply , but the price ... YIKES ! Ridiculous.After buying clinical for a year I decided I was going to `` go down the line '' and try different deodorants to see if I found one that would hopefully work for me . The main thing I was looking for was a great smell and one that would last for the day so I would n't sweat through it and have to reapply.After several failed attempts I finally found relief in Degree . It holds up to it 's promise of body responsive and 24 hour protection . It is very rare that I need to reapply . The price is awesome , especially for what it provides . `` Fresh Oxygen '' is my favorite scent , but I 'm sure they all do the trick.I would highly recommend any woman to try this out .
 Great vitamins . I really like capsules . Good quality . Speedy delivery . My naturopath highly Recommended these vitamins . I 'd never heard of them . Glad to have discovered them .
 A wonderful foreplay item is the feather tickler . You can use it to playfully tickle your lover , and you can use it to gently stroke his or her body , bringing pleasure to every nerve . What 's my favorite use ? Run the tickler gently over your lover 's back and down to the feet . Then , have him or her flip over , and start again . You will set your lover on fire!Buy this feather tickler , no bedroom should be without one ! -LRB- Review of Playful Feather Tickler -RRB-
 A good product . The size is very useable . The packets are easy to store and use . Would purchase more again
 We used their dish gel for a few years but I recently switched to the powder after reading what Consumer Reports said about gels not being as effective and they rated 7th Generations powder as excellent ... it 's awesome !! It rinses away really clean and it works wonders when used with vinegar in your rinse aid dispenser , no spots anywhere ! No pollution indoors or out either . Terrific value here on amazon , we combine it with our baby wipe order to get the free shipping .
 I 've been using this product for 6 months and love it ! My dishes are always clean and do n't smell like perfume . It rinses away better than Cascade powder does - which is what I previously used . I love that this product does n't contain chemicals that will harm the environment or me !
 As a person who is sensitive to fragrances , I bought this dish detergent in the hopes that it would clean my dishes without giving me a headache from the perfumes . Not only does it clean fabulously , but there are no more headaches!Even better is that this company uses natural ingredients and does not test on animals . I feel good about the fact that when I buy this product , my money is going towards a company with a sense of social responsibility . Thanks for such a great product !
 This is the first Seventh Generation cleaner my family tried and we were pleased enough to continue using it . Like many we were looking to take a step back from the daily chemical invasion of our home in the name of keeping it clean.We like this cleaner for a few reasons :1 . It works well2 . It is enviromentally sound3 . It does n't stink out the kitchen like standard commercial soaps doLeft off a star because on occasion it does clump a bit in our dispenser though it is a fairly new and modern appliance , and it is a bit less effective when the dishwasher is packed -LRB- typically the silver ware after a party -RRB- . But for every day dishes for our family of 4 it never lets us down and it feels good knowing I am not bombarding our family 's dishes with chemicals before we eat off them .
 I have been using this product for over a year . It works just a well as Cascade or any other top brand . However , if you have hard water you need to use a little less and/or a rinse aid . I used it before and after we had a water softener installed . After the water softener was installed I no longer needed a rinse aid . It works and I find comfort in knowing its safe for my family .
 We just got a brand new dishwasher and decided to switch to a detergent without harsh chemicals . This is a great product . I highly recommend it .
 It does a good job cleaning the dishes , but sometimes it may leave a little bit of soap on a couple of dishes so after dishwasher cuts off , I rinse one more time and they come out perfect . Well worth it for people with MCS . I get about 25 loads out of a box . Jerry
 I have been using this product for awhile and I think it does a satisfactory job . It cleans the dishes well and leaves no smell in my plastics , including my daughter 's plastic plates and cups . I stopped using Cascade when I realized that you could actually taste the chemicals on the plastic . Cascade does do a better job cleaning . It should . It , like every other widely available commercial brand , is a very strong base -LRB- alkaline -RRB- , very caustic . Their phosphates are detrimental to marine life . And now many contain bleach . More dioxins , please ! The Seventh Generation version does not clean my silverware as well . If anything is stuck-on before washing it remains there -LRB- especially egg or almond butter -RRB- . My solution to this is pretty easy and obvious . We just keep a bus tub in the sink with a small amount of water . Dirty utensils go there . Dishes get the same treatment if necessary . Sometimes -LRB- not often -RRB- there is a powdery white residue on the dishes which is easy to remove . Overall , I am pleased with this product and its shortcomings are not enough to make me switch back . I just feel better about using this in my home .
 Great product . Works well and gives you energy while helping with a boost of metabolism . You just have to be sure not to abuse it because there is a lot of caffeine in the pills and you do n't want to take too much . I like this product a lot .
 The best thing I 've noticed about this formula is the slight citrus flavor the pills have now . Most of the supplements like this have a terrible taste/odor , and letting it hit your tongue or remain in your mouth for too long can bring you close to gagging . This version of hydroxycut has a slight citrus flavor which reminds me a lot of a vitamin.I rotate going on and off this supplement for additional energy and have not been disappointed . I have recently switched to the hardcore version for an extra boost .
 Well , let 's put it like this - I do n't believe that there are miracle pills that will make you lose 10 lbs in 3 days . This product works for me , because it really helps me to go to the bathroom . Especially after I ate something a little bit more greasy , like pizza or so - I had to go almost immediately after I finished eating . I tried the maximum strength ones at first , but they gave me stomach cramps - so , I stopped using them . But these are really great - they do n't have a bad after taste once you swallowed them , and even though they are not the smallest items there are , they are small enough to swallow without problems . I will keep using them - because they really do work . Now of course everything works best with the right diet and exercise ... it is not a miracle pill - but it does what it says .
 I 've now began using this product so I 'm am unable to say how much weight will be affected . The product arrived in a blink of an eye and transaction went very smooth . No problems with this seller . It has only been 2 days and I can definitely say that my energy levels has increased already . I really do n't feel as tired as I have become accustomed to whether i 'm working out or not and I can not wait to see the end results of using this product .
 as you know hydroxicut give a excellent results plus diet and more , the shipping came a good time , thanks
 I 'm doing this little review in case anyone 's wondering what the `` Twilight Crush '' color looks like . The colors are n't described well , and all of the colors in the picture are n't listed , so you ca n't easily tell which is which . Now clicking on a color choice will bring you a single product on the screen , which is better than a few weeks ago , when I bought mine.I mistakenly thought that the shimmer of the Twilight Crush pillow was distorting the way the color appeared in the picture , and it was that pretty color of rose that the girl 's holding . Instead , it 's a strange , shimmery green and burgundy red color , quite similar to the picture they have up now , but where the picture looks brown , it 's actually much more red . That shimmery green is the dominant color , however , and the red is more of a `` background '' color . In my opinion , it 's not very pleasant to look at , but it smells good , and maybe I 'll get used to the odd color combination . If I could do it over , I 'd go for the blue feather color choice ... I 'd also wondered why it has the funny little heart sewn onto the front of the pillow . That 's actually a little pocket , inside which is a very small cloth scent packet . The rest of the filling is accessed through a velcro pouch on the back of the pillow . Open it up , and you 'll find a pouch of unscented buckwheat . This is quite nice ; in case you do n't like the way the scent smells , you can remove it ; and also so you 're not over-heating the scent packet when you heat the buckwheat packet !
 As compared to a neck pillow filled with loose buckwheat & the same scents mixed in , this pillow 's heat lasts quite a long time -LRB- about 1.5 hrs when leaning on back , 45 min . when used on neck/shoulders/upper back -RRB- . The buckwheat/rice are stuffed securely , so they do n't slip & slide around when you want the heat in a certain place . The scents come from a small cloth sachet inside the smaller heart , which is good for when you do n't want the aromatherapy on occasion . The cover is removable -- good for lysol-ing or handwashing .
 THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT . IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND THE PACKAGE WAS IN GOOD SHAPE . I WOULD ORDER FORM THIS COMPANY AGAIN .
 My wife just keeps going on and on about how much she loves this lighted mirror . It is fantastic
 This is a nice bag . Did not expect it but it has dividers padded inside to organize supplies inside . Two zipper pockets on the side with some other two small clear plastic zipper bags . . Good to keep at home for a big family with first aid supplies ;-RRB- hope this helps . .
 Only problem with this bag is that it is going to cost me a fortune to fill this HUGE bag . LOLNot a professional and got this for med BOB . With all the compartments , dual side pockets with detachable zippered bags in each , and the elastic bands sewn into the top , I could set up one heck of a field station with this.Heavy zippers , reinforced seams , protected bottom with pegs , medium weight material ... Could not be happier at this price.If you are a Vol . firefighter or small town first responder that does n't have a big budget , save your money and buy this bag.Also , to those who denigrated this bag , what were you expecting for this price ... gold leaf ? I agree the picture used may be misleading , though this bag will hold all the items shown and then some . Read the descriptions and reviews before you buy . If no reviews , contact the seller . Nuf said .
 I read reviews so was sorta hesitant on purchasing bag . . but went ahead and got it anyways ... I love it It came on time . . and it 's not heavy heavy duty but it was what I was looking for . . Here is a link of what I got into the bag -LSB- . . -RSB-
 These are the breath-freshener of choice for one of us at home . The flavor is sweet-cinnamon , a bit hot but not unpleasant . Almost like a candy redhot . If you do n't like mint or mouthwash , these may float your boat . The tin is cute , and tiny enough to stash in a cummerbund , watch pocket , even -LRB- hmm ! -RRB- your bra .
 I ordered this massage chair -LRB- TH404 -RRB- and received it within 2 days . The massage quality is superb . There are various combinations to choose from and each is blissful . I enjoy the convienience of relaxing at my leisure.I love this chair and the health benefits resulting from the purchase . My body & mind rejoices.Get one and see for yourself . : -RRB-
 This seller helped me saved over $ 20 a bottle . I so appreciate getting it at a bargain price . This is a natural herbal supplement that helps reduce inflammation while avoiding damage to the kidneys unlike the effects of ibuprofen .

 This is the best oil we have ever used . It is never sticky and stays plyable through the whole massage . We love all the flavors .
 This product is the best of its kind that I have ever used . The taste is light and actually yummy , I was so surprised . It is not a heavy greasy oil at all , like some . It 's full of natural oils that are really good for you , like sunflower , etc. , and no artificial sweeteners , so this is also a plus . My husband and I use it and are very pleased . I highly , highly recommend it - and I do n't normally review `` intimate '' products , LOL . This one is worth reviewing though , you wo n't be disappointed . At all .
 The product is very fragarant and is not greasy . It is very soothing . Would recommend it and would repurchase it .
 This lighter is for true anime fans . I mean who doesnt like a cool samurai on their lighter ? I do n't smoke , I just like the look of it . * -LRB- Also , like all Zippo lighters , you must buy the fluid yourself -RRB- *
 Got this lighter for my son for Christmas . He loves it ! He 's not a smoker just a collector of Japanese anything since his visit to Japan summer of 2009 .
 This is my 5th bed buddy . This product has nursed me through migraines , sore shoulders , cold feet , stiff necks , and a variety of aches , pains , and muscle strains . Every member of my family has one . They last for years and provide a level of comfort , using moist heat , that you can not get from a heating pad -LRB- dry irritating heat -RRB- . I highly recommend this product .
 I highly recommend this . Its great for sinus or migraine pain . You just microwave it and its reusable . I usually fall right to sleep . Its wonderful . Way worth the money .
 I have purchased several sinus/headache packs in the past , and my main complaint was always that it did not hold heat . I do not use it as a cold pack although I may do so in the future.However , I am so pleased with the Original Bed Buddy Sinus Pack . It is weighted so that it stays in place without slipping . It is both comfortable and comforting . I think it might be handy to have a strap , but , really , one is not needed.I 'm very happy with my purchase . I heat mine for 45 seconds and it stays heated until I have gone to sleep . Again , I 'm very pleased .
 This is an excellent product ! Two minutes in the mircowave and I 'm on my way to relief . The Original Bed Buddy is still better . This product would be better if it had an elastic band /
 she loved it and uses it when the time is needed . better then the other brand that we had b4
 I ordered this produce while suffering yet another sinus headache . As fate would have it , I have n't had one since , but I decided to try out the Bed Buddy one night any way . Now I 'm addicted . I heat it in the microwave for a minute while brushing my teeth , snuggle down in bed and place it over my eyes and that 's all she wrote . Yes , there is a slight odor which bothers some people , but not enough to be a problem for me . I also like that it 's not attached to my head so once I go to sleep and roll over , it slips off and does n't bother me when I wake up . Still waiting to try it on a headache , but it 's already worth the money .
 I use the mask 2 or 3 times a week at night to relieve sinus pressure . Works very well by heating in microwave for 45 seconds . Heat lasts for about 15 to 20 minutes . I would buy another when this one wears out .
 The product is very effective . It can be easily heated in a microwave for about a minute and lasts for about 20 minutes , enough to give me effective relief /
 I use mine so much I bought my sister one as well . Exactly one minute in the microwave and rest it over your eyes . Does a great job relieving sinus pressure . I use a different one for `` cool '' . As a bonus when you heat it up it smells like oatmeal . Sometimes I just use it to relax even when my sinus issues are n't acting up .
 Excellent product ! Love the Multiple uses ! The product was very reasonably priced and shipped very quickly . I recommend this product very highly !
 I have sinus headaches every time the weather changes . I warm the sinus pack in microwave . It sure makes my head feel better even though it may not take the headache away .
 AMAZON.COM SUPPLIES VERY EFFICIENT SERVICES FOR COMPARING PRODUCTS AND PRICES . IT ENABLED ME TO CHOOSE THE BUDDY SINUS PACK AT A LOW COST SO THAT I CAN GET MORE FOR MY MONEY . THIS PRODUCT AIDS ME IN EXPELLING MUCUS IN THE SINUSES THAT ALLEVIATES UNWANTED HEADACHES .
 AWESOME . But of course all of the Bed Buddy items are . Had sinus surgery and this was a great item to have to keep swelling down . One request I do have for all the products is to havve an opportunity to have a fragrance added .
 I bought this -LRB- at a store -RRB- for my husband who has sinus-induced migraines . It smells like old corn when heated . I thought the smell would go away after use or at least after washing . Not ! When you have a raging migraine , who wants to smell that awful smell ?! I am geting him something else - preferably with no odor !
 I love these pads . I 'm using them for a stud cat who tends to leave a puddle or two at the door of the room I confine him in at night . What prompted me to try these pads were the sticky tabs to hold the pad down . They are very good for cats who tend to dig and claw . I 'm impressed that the stickum on the tabs actually does stick , and is effective again and again . If the pad is not used I can fold the tabs back and they can be used multiple times . The only caveat is that in the folding process at the manufacturer the tabs often are slightly askew and will catch on the backing which needs to be ripped to release the tab . However , so far this has not affected the effectiveness of the pad which is excellent . It absorbs a lot of moisture w/o leaking and stays dry on the surface .
 We use this vanilla bean paste in a graham cracker recipe and we could n't be happier . I love the fact that you can see the seeds ; it adds a very `` natural '' look.The product stores very well and I like the fact that you use it the same way you would regular vanilla .
 I have never used vanilla bean paste so I was n't sure what to expect . This was an excellent purchase ! I have made some very delicious cupcakes and am very glad I have this in my baking pantry for future use !
 This is a really good value and will add a boost to your favorite vanilla flavored baking products . Also good in homemade vanilla ice cream .
 Amazing substitute for vanilla extract . Great price compared to organic food stores where I have looked for this product in the past . Highly recommended to anyone who loves to bake .
 Another great product for the kitchen and particularly for you the Chef.I do n't know about your area , but where I am it can be tough to find vanilla beans and sometimes when I do find them I 'm not willing to pay the price being charged.This product solves both problems as it is reasonably priced and a great tasting product.Buy a container and you will soon be using it in your cooking
 This brings out the flavor better than vanilla flavoring . Realy love this.Was shipped very quickly . The price was very reasonable .
 My son is a chef in the making and this will be a great addition to his ingredients list . He will enjoy this .
 love this product had ordered one from avon it did n't last ordered this one love it thank you
 I have had this product for quite awhile and have only replaced batteries once . It seems to work well and gives me some peace of mind . Our grandchildren stay with us a couple times a month and it gives me a place to store their toothbrushes and feel they are safe to use . Previously , I bought new toothbrushes for them almost every time they stayed over .
 I bought this a couple of months ago and it seems to be a good product . I would like to purchase a second one , I hope they get more in stock .
 This provides a good hold for most of the day . My dad has a flattened gumline on the lower jaw . He can get up to two whole meals without having to reapply glue , which makes life a little easier for him .
 I 've tried everything ... these are , by far , the very best . Somewhat on the expensive side -LRB- but that 's entirely relative to personal income -RRB- but I 'll most assuredly continue to buy these ! Sure wish they made a comparable product for uppers.Jerry
 This is the best of all the denture adhesive I have ever tried . I will find them where ever they are sold . I started using these about 10 or 12 years ago . and I got them in Houston , Texas . Now I have to find them thru the internet . They are the VERY BEST . patty luttrell
 I 'm in total agreement with PJ Lutrell 's opinion . These are the best . Do n't know how long my husband and I have been using them . Used to find them at the drugstore and then they disappeared . I contacted the distributor and was able to order from them . Eventually they sold their distributorship to another company and I ordered from them . Eventually I could n't find them at all . SO I contacted the manufacturer in -LRB- I think -RRB- Austria , where I was able to order a very large amount -LRB- year 's supply -RRB- Obviously not cheap but worth it . I 've ordered them from England and just about every where else I could find them . Luckily I am now able to get these through Amazon . Saving a lot on phone bills.Bottom line ... . these ARE the best . If good hold is important to you , you owe it to yourself to at least try one box . I think you 'll be sold.xoxMEF
 I purchased this product for someone who had recently acquired dentures . The product is effective but being he had to receive further adjustments to his dentures it was no fault of the product . But when he first used the tape it had lasted longer than any other store bought brand
 Dr. Mercola describes Astaxanthin as the most powerful antioxidant on the market . As we learn more about the cancer risks associated with oxygen free radicals -LRB- a normal byproduct of cellular metabolism -RRB- the more products like this make sense . Source Naturals is a company I trust and I have been taking their products for years . It turns out that their brand of Astaxanthin is also one of the least expensive on the market . So , with little to lose and potentially much to gain ... I bought this product and take it everyday .
 very satisfied with this product ! i am still waiting to see results but am confident that i will . packaged well .
 Ingredients : - Calcium 123mg - Pfaffia rhodozyma Extract 200mg -LRB- yielding 2mg of Astaxanthin -RRB- Other ingredients : - dibasic calcium phosphate - stearic asid - hydroxypropyl cellulose - microcrystalline cellulose - colloidal silicon dioxide - modified cellulose gumThe bottle has the following warning notice on it : WARNING
 I have a weak immune system , and have been convinced this is an important and affordable supplement . Personally I take double the daily amount with no side effects except that as I had read on Dr. Mercola 's website , my skin has gotten a bit more rosy or less sallow . Astaxanthin in their natural food is what causes flamingos to be pink ! The tablets have a slightly fishy taste , but they do n't leave you with fishy burps the way fish oils or krill oil can . Also , I believe you can get them in a gel capsule which has no taste . Read up on this supplement , especially if you sunburn easily or are concerned about vision -LRB- I think I remember reading it is protective or supportive of eye health -RRB- .
 Check out Dr. Mercolas reviews on his website at www -LRB- dot -RRB- Mercola -LRB- dot -RRB- com about Astaxanthin ... I take this every day ... help improve vision and health ... one of the most powerful nutrients on planet earth . Money well spent .
 I received my order in 5 days . I began taking astaxanthin because of an article I read by Dr. Mercola . I think they are relieve some of the aches and pains of old age .
 After having tried to locate this at GNC and other pharmacies , this price is very reasonable and , as an environmentalist , the bottle is filled . This is not one of those big bottles that 's half empty .
 I have been using NOW brand supplements for some time because of the high quality and purity of their products.The price was right on these and I 'm very happy with my purchase .
 For some reason I was led to believe this vitamin A & D combo came from fish oil . It did n't . Kind of weird . Anyway , it 's retinyl palmitate and lanolin-derived vitamin D. For what it is , it 's good . It 's not what I was expecting , but it seems to work . The moons on my fingernails are growing back -- that 's about all I notice from it , but if it 's doing that , it 's probably doing other things , too .
 These pads are okay , though a little pricey . I bought them because my local grocery had stopped stocking them . Then I found that I could buy the same pad at Walmart for 20 % of the price I paid on Amazon.com .
 For some reason , it seems difficult to find copper -LRB- or steel -RRB- scouring pads in stores anymore . That 's why it 's nice to be able to order them online.They are scouring pads , and they do the job as advertised . They are good for really caked-on dish messes , gum-on-tile , and other similar jobs .
 Item was exactly what I wanted , do n't remember having to wait too long for it to come in , overall satisfied with the transaction .
 I owe the fact that I still have hair at the age of 75 to these vitamins for the hair since male -LSB- pattern baldness runs in my family .
 a great toy to have !! It hits the spot every time ! I think everyone should have a toy to spice things up in the bedroom .
 Ok my ex boyfriend bought this for me.Its the first toy I 've ever had , and its fantastic.You must try it .
 But boy was I wrong ! This is a very well laid out and well stocked kit . The only thing I added was Adventure Medical 's `` Pocket Survival Kit '' tucked inside and the whole thing went into my day pack . I feel good knowing it is there and would definitely recommend Adventure Medical 's products to anyone looking for first aid supplies .
 On the product 's website , this sells for $ 36 . The book alone is $ 12.99 on AMZN , so you see why this is a steal ! It 's has about everything someone would need to travel , even locally . I 'm taking it on my trip to France as just the blister supplies -LRB- feet -RRB- will make it worth bringing.I 'm sure these will sell out fast , so get 1 or 2 now .
 All the reviews for this product are great and accurate . I completely conquer and find this to be an excellent light-weight kit with a proper book from Dr. Weiss , Stanford med center . You 'll notice that all the items in the kit are high quality and best of all it 's made in the USA . The only thing you may want to add to this kit is waterproof tape -LRB- that just saves the cost of replacing it every time you wash -RRB- . For example the gauze
 I just purchased Adventure Medical Kits Light and Fast Trail Kit . I think that it is a good starter medical kit for hikes , boating , hunting , and camping . It is small , compact , and light weight but still comes with a wide assortment of basic medical suplies .
 I purchased the kit to have a smaller , lighter kit for short outings . I think it 's a good compromise between the bare essential gram weenies kits that have a butterfly and two aspirin , and those of us -LRB- like me -RRB- who think every overnight trip is fraught with peril and pack the clotting agent and epi-pens :-RRB- . The basics for bumps , blisters , and cuts are included . Not much in the way of larger dressings , but let 's face it - How many times do you need a trauma pad while on a weekend jaunt ? The included manual is packed with practical field information that is useful for all , even city-trained EMS professionals . IMO , The manual and adds significant value to the kit .
 OkFor home its great . Never buy those store brand kits as all they have is band aidsFor hiking a few hours this kit will do.For over night trip , it will work for 1-2 person 1-2 nights . I wont rely on it if i am doing backpackers trip.But must have one in car , at home and at work . Really this thing can save lots of bleeding , pain and misery if you just read the book that it comes with and carry it with you on trips.Overall the best kit available for price , but a better kit is possible of course you got ta spend 2-3 times more .
 I have used Mucopolysaccharide for two months now and my arthritis pain is gone . I had to take the maximum amount but since both knees give me trouble and now do n't it was worth it . Cardiovascular Products is a fantastic company , good quality product .
 The service and product was much more than I could ever hope for . Fast and dependable . Even added a personal note . Was a nice gesture . Little things mean alot . Would buy from again gladly and well as soon as I eat all the bars . Again , buy with confidence from the Shirleys !! Five stars easily .
 Tastes good , though slightly chalky but all in all it 's a pretty satisfying snack . I like that it has lot 's of Calcium too .
 I have used this product for about 15 years for muscle cramps and racing heart promlems and it stops both of them for me , use it everyday , would n't let a day go by without taking at least 3 a day . a heart Doctor told me to take this product
 This stuff makes bones heal twice as fast . This was originally reccomended by my doctor after bone surgery . My experience and my relatives have shown that your bones heal upto twice as fast while taking Osteo Novum .
 The ugly hole was two inches and this hard-plastic grommet fit snugly in . As an added bonus , it allows you to adjust the hole within the grommet that your wires peek through so that the wires do n't just fall back down when you unplug them from your laptop/speakers/mice / Hitachi neck massager .
 Durable and versatile , very good product . Exactly what I expected , and for a low price . The cap pops out easily , and snaps back in tightly . Extremely useful.I would suggest this product to anyone with the same needs as myself .
 I used this in a laminate built in desk . Drilled the hole , popped it in , ran the wires and covered them up.I will say this , if you have a DivX video connection it barely fits through the 2 '' size . It will fit , you just have to give it a little force to get the cable through .
 I 've gone through a lot of grommets ... this is certainly an extremely well made grommet . The plastic is heavy and the insert spins with positive stops and snaps in solidly . Unfortunately , what I received is slightly different then what 's pictured . Most notably is a smaller opening for wires , which is just a bit too small for what I need . Otherwise , it 's a great piece .
 There is n't too much you can say about a grommet . This is well made and suits the purpose . Perhaps more importantly , I emailed the manufacturer to determine if the center section could be removed and got a response . Sadly having ANY manufacturer respond should n't be a big deal but it is . These people passed that test so I recommend them and their product .
 My desk I purchased did n't come with one , and was very unsightly . This was the perfect product to cover that hole and make it less conspicuous . Unfortunately the hole was slightly bigger than the grommet fitting , which I added double stick tape around the grommet fitting which made it fit perfectly and stay in place .
 I am a very active 62 year old . I love this product because it provides the stamina for me to do the things I love ... walking , playing tennis , spin class , power weight lifting class and cycling . I ran out and I could tell the difference . I purchased this product at Amazon because it was difficult to find locally . I recommend it to anyone who wants more energy and stamina .
 I liked this little dust buster so much that I bought a second one ! It has amazing suction for such a little vacuum . I use it to clean up the area around my cat 's litter box and for grabbing little bits of dust and hair from the corners of the room . I keep another one in my office at work and use it to tidy up my desk and vacuum out my air filter . My only complaint is that it is loud . If you do n't mind the noise , you will be very happy with this product .
 It is very good for the corner and hiding place vacuum , but the blowing function does n't works well . I mainly used it to clean my computers and slits in my sofa where my kids drop all kinds of food , small toys , different staff and dust . It works very well , but the sound is too loud . If you do n't care the loud noise which is a very good product for small area .
 This thing sucks up the dog hair like crazy . I have to use this every 2-3 days just to keep things under control . I 'm noticing a lot less hair on my clothes because of this thing . It 's helping reduce my aggravation on that front .
 This is an excellent product . Easy to handle and very powerful suction . Compact for storage . Highly recommend this product . The pet hair retriever snap-on brush is highly effective . And of course , excellent service from Amazon .
 I 'm speaking for my wife who has had her last battery powered sweeper , this works great and has power that lasts . Seems like the ones with batteries do n't last very long , That 's why we got one that plugs in . It 's a good deal if you do n't mind a cord .
 More powerful than I thought it would be . Ca n't really put it down while working because the body of the machine flips over , so always must hand hold . This can be a bit cumbersome for someone who ca n't hold a weight for long . Otherwise this machine sets out to do the job it 's meant to do .
 Great suction ! Easy to use , long cord , and big enough space to use repeatedly without having to dispose the filter too often for someone who hates doing really disgusting things like that . In fact , I 've had it for over a month and still have not emptied out the vacuum . I like the vacuum cleaner-it was a good deal .
 This is a corded vacuum that works great on furniture which has a tight weave , the beater brush is made from some type of silicon material that really lifts the dog hair up . Our dog sheds alot and you will need to empty after each use but have used this on stairs and sections of carpet and found it is the best vac for pet hair
 I bought this primarily as a car vacuum . It 's an amazing little vac - I 've had mine a few years now and have been using it to vacuum my entire house because my new full-size Dirt Devil just does n't work well -LRB- to put it mildly -RRB- . Even though the vac is small it 's got great suction and is easy to use , clean and empty . As a pet owner , I very much appreciate this great buy .
 I bought this item because I was getting tired of the handmedown , give it to someone else because I ca n't use it anymore vacuum cleaners , be they upright or hand held.This product REALLY does it 's job ! and with a cat and a child in the home , it 's just amazing.It is a bit on the heavy side for a petite person who has to clean on their hands and knees , but the overall sleek design and various uses makes that just a minor glitch.I love this product .
 I did not have high hopes . I have bought 3 battery charged hand vacuums and finally got sick of them . They always said they were powerful . I tried this one and was literally blown away . I can use this one and vacuum up the fur -LRB- the cats seem to fight in the bathroom - sibling rivalry ? -RRB- and kitty litter in 30 seconds . I am in kitty litter heaven . I have had the product for over a month and am still pleased with it . Even my husband is not as grumpy about vacuuming out the area when he has to .
 I chose this vacuum because of the reviews that said it had great power and it has a power cord . I am happy with how it performs , with one exception . I have two cats and two dogs . I find that the filter and screen that covers the filter clogs very easily and has to be cleaned EVERY time I use the vacuum . This is somewhat burdensome .
 We 've gone through several of these handhelds over the past 15 years or so . This is the best for sure . Great suction , decent cord length , easy to clean out the trash . All that plus its -LRB- as of 1/11/11 -RRB- under $ 30 ! I highly recommend it . Whatever you decide , I urge you to stay away from anything with a Shark brand on it ! We 've owned 2 of those things and both were terrible -LRB- luckily for us one was a gift ! -RRB- . Both are in a landfill somewhere now .
 Having tried several different cordless hand vacs , I wanted a corded version to make sure I got as much power as possible . The pet hair attachment that comes with this is awesome for picking up pet hair -LRB- cat -RRB- off of furniture . The attachment has little rubber stubs for brushes and it works fantastic . It 's like watching a commercial for a product , where there is a bunch of hair on a couch and with one swipe of the vac , it picks up virtually all of the hair . This thing really works great . You wo n't be disappointed if you want it for pet hair . It 's also easy to empty and you can get replacement filters for relatively cheap .
 Even though I purchased this as a gift for someone that does n't have indoor pets , they are using it to clean out the car . I was told it 's suction is so strong , it can practically pull the carpet out of the car !!! They are VERY pleased with the product . I think I found the perfect gift !!!!
 This corded dustbuster has A Lot of power . The attachments are very handy & work well . Have had numerous cordless that quickly lose power . The corded is just as convenient with definite increase in power . Very Pleased !
 The Dustbuster is everything that I expected with the added bonus of an extra long power cord . It cleans up quite nicely .
 After a couple of months , I 'm still pleased with this product . I bought it to deal with cat hair and stray litter cleanup . This unit is very powerful , works great on the floors around the litter box - still takes several passes to pick up cat hair from couch and chairs , but it does get the job down better the other similar units I have purchased and discarded .
 I got this handheld vacuum specially to deal with my cat 's shedding and the mess she makes when she uses the litter box . Before , I was just using a broom and lint rollers on my furniture but just could n't take it anymore . This little vacuum does it 's job and it does it well . When I use it on my area rug though , my back does start to get tired , but I really ca n't complain too much . I live in a small apartment and did n't want to buy an upright vacuum , which would just take up even more room that I probably do n't even have . Anyway , I 'm really glad I gave in and bought this because it 's making the upkeep of my apartment way more bearable !
 I was so surprised at the power this Dustbuster has . It is perfect for the cats room . Really cleans the floor and surrounding area .
 If all your jobs can be done with the attachments in the advertisement you are good to go.Every item Shown in the AD works really well . I purchased the VAC . thinking i would buy some attachments for cleaning computers and blinds later , NOT going to happen . The hose end is flat and all brush attachments are round , so you are limited to jobs you are able to perform .
 This works wonders ! I did have to spend a little more time getting the dog hair off the couch but it does a great job . I def . recommend it .
 This vaccum cleaner works well . I am satisfied with the product . Its easy to use and sucks in even very small particles .
 Great product and very much worth the price . I am very surprised at the power of this dustbuster . I would highly recommend this product .
 I bought the Black & Decker Corded Dustbuster for myself last year after Christmas from the gift card my brother gave me . It quickly became one of my `` favorite '' things . The suction on this little vacuum is better than my Dyson and great for little pick up jobs , getting cat hair off the furniture , and I have even used it to vacuum the keyboard on my notebook computer . Emptying it and cleaning the filter is pretty easy . I would suggest emptying and cleaning the filter often , it can get gross if you leave the filter too long . You just ca n't get the suction on the rechargable like you can on the plug-in kind . Highly recommended . This year I bought six for gifts for my family because it is one of my `` favorite '' things . Amazon 's price was cheaper than anywhere else .
 This is so much easier than taking around my regular vacuum just to clean up small messes . I recommend it .
 Been using this for about a month and very happy with it . It is powerful and the cord is long enough for all purposes .
 I just bought this so I would n't have to lug my big vaccum around to clean the furniture . Never expected it to work so great . I have two dogs and two cats and a canvas couch . Normally it takes 30min to and hour to get all the hair off my couch , in 10 min I was done . You only need to take one or maybe two passes instead of the normal 5-6 or more with all three of my past vacuums . The attachment with the brush pivots and it really whips that hair right up , it 's amazing . This is the only cleaning product that I 've ever been so impressed with to write a review . You ca n't beat the price either .
 This product works as advertized . Amazing . I have three cats and two dogs . -LRB- One is part Lab , the worst for shedding . -RRB- I have had my share of vacuum cleaners that quit , unable to stand up to the stress of the hair.This product seems up to meeting my needs for a clean house despite shedding of many mammals .
 I sell homes , and like to have something like this when staging homes . Need the blower to inflate air mattresses and the like . Very impressed with the power , it 's really much stronger than I 'd expected . Better than the similiar sized canister than came with my good Oreck vacuum .
 I purchased this product over Christmas and have been pleased well into the new year ! I own a Dyson vac with the pet turbo brush , however , I no longer have to bring out the large vac every day with this ultra powered hand held with the pet turbo brush . It works much better than the $ 70 brush attachment that goes with the Dyson . I highly recommend this item to any family that has pets .
 If you 're looking for a powerful hand-vac that does not suffer from battery fatigue this is it ! I purchased this vacuum b/c I was looking for a handheld that did n't need replaced every 1-2 years as the batter slowly deteriorated . As an electrical engineer I can also appreciate that I have one less power adapter plugged in drawing current 24/7 . There are two attachments with this vac
 Suction power better than my Dyson ! It 's corded but cord is long enough . I 'll never have a cordless one agein . Gets pet hair even off Oriental rugs . Wish I had had it years ago !
 I bought this product because I recently got a new cat that loves to shed all over the place , especially my bed comforter . I 've used the rubber brushes that brush the hair into piles so they can be picked up but they only worked marginally at best . I needed something with a little more power and I found it . While it is annoying that this devices is n't cordless , there is no way that it would work as well as it does if it were . As soon as I got it I put it to the test and it passed with flying colors . It took a few passes with the pet hair attachment , but once I figured out the trick to using it , it cleaned up my comforter in no time . Even just using it around my apartment , to clean up the cat liter mess , it worked wonderfully . I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has a small pet that has shed a lot of hair on furniture because the pet attachment works great .
 my border collie loves to leave traces of himself all over the floors and furniture . I used to use tons of lint rollers to try to pick his hair up until I found this hand vac . For being pretty small its powerful ! As long as you angle it the right way it picks up virtually everything . I even started to replace my regular vacuum with this handy tool since it is easier to lug around . The only negative is that it does get hot pretty quickly . I have never had it shut off on me as some of the other reviews mentioned but I do try to give it a break when cleaning several rooms at once .
 Have n't been a big Black & Decker fan in the past but they have a great product with this hand vacuum . It 's a tad larger than normal but very comfortable to use . It has powerful suction and is easy to clean . I 'm very happy with this product .
 This is by far the best hand held vac I have used . The power is amazing . I have three dogs and 1 cat so I do a lot of cleaning . This product is awesome . I am extremely pleased and would recommend this product .
 This is a great product especially for the price . It has a lot of power I would suggest this dust buster
 I am very impressed with the power and suction of this . Beast . I also like the longer cord and the warranty . Good job black & decker .
 This product supercedes a previous model that I had for about 10 years - I bought it because the numerous attachments from the previous model fit this model.This vacuum cleaner has 1 -RRB- Lots of power , 2 -RRB- is easy to use , 3 -RRB- and is easy to maintain & empty.Be aware that it is NOT cordless and does not come with numerous attachments . I use it primarily for clean-up after working on various projects , hobbies and cars .
 I bought this item for my new kitten , and it works wonders ! Very powerful and picks up things that I do n't see .
 So far I am glad I bought this small vacuum cleaner . I had only one occasion to use it - clean the interior of my car . It was very pleasant to work with and the suction power was reassuring . 110 volts household current are just very superior to battery power . Now I hope that it will last a long time .
 Product works great for vacuuming my sectional . My dogs shed like crazy and this does the trick quite well . Got it for a great price and was exactly what I was looking for .
 I love this thing . We have a Golden Retriever . Nuff said there . Would have given it a five star tribute but it ai n't as good as my favorite indoor sport !!!
 The Black & Decker ; Black & Decker HV9010P Retriever Pet-Series Cyclonic-Action Corded Dustbuster and BlowerPet-Series Dustbuster works terrific on pet hair in the dog beds . It is lightweight but sturdy , right power for hair , filter easy to access and empty , plenty long cord , and it picks up hair with one pass.Noisy enough to scare the dogs.It sells on Amazon for about $ 30 & I ; get no commission . : - -RRB-
 I have two American bulldogs -LRB- they have short hair -RRB- that shed and it sticks on my couch . I 've tried many different brushes and lint removers , but this product truly delivers . In a matter of minutes , my couch was virtually pet hair free . It is extremely powerful ; the only thing I do n't like is the motor gets pretty hot .
 It is a excelente product . It catch all the pet 's hair . A little noise . recomended for all dog 's owner .
 The best option for cleaning furniture , I have five cats , all with long hair , I have to remove cat hair from furniture every week , and with this vacuum is really easy to do .
 We were a little hesitant to buying a corded hand vacuum , since it is so convenient to use one with a rechargeable battery . However , we have been very happy with the B & D corded model . It 's more powerful than a battery one , it 's very convenient to use and , with the attachments , is very useful . We saw some reviews that this model was a bit noisy , but it is nothing serious . The noise is probably due to the strength/size of its motor . We are very happy with this and would recommend this to a friend and we would buy another .
 When I initially purchased this I did not notice that it was not battery powered . The quality of it in its power and the long power cord easily make up for this . This replaced a desire to have a shop vac around as it does such an amazing job .
 Already have one of these and was unable to find another in the Black & Decker store . So happy to find this from Amazon . Works so much better than the battery vacuums . Really sucks up the dirt . Easy . Long cord makes this perfect .
 This little bugger really picks things up - not just dust - 10 times better than any battery version -LRB- I have owned two -RRB- The cord is nice and long too - real happy with it .
 Now my wife says I shoulda bought a cordless!Can ' t win!I thought it was a great Valentine 's day present ! -LRB- kidding ! -RRB- ciao!Tebaldi
 This would not be the first time I bought the wrong item . But , although I wanted a cordless vac , and was hesitant to open the box , I gave it a try . All I can say is the cord is not much of a problem . This vac has more then twice the power of any cordless . And the attachments are the icing on the cake . Kind of nice to make an error in the right direction .
 I got this for the office , to pick up the mess after emptying the shredder . Wow ! It does a great job ! Ca n't wait to clean the stairwell with it !
 I am very happy with this product . It has very strong suction and is easy to use . My only complaint is that the hose comes out of the vacuum easily and I have to keep re-inserting it .
 It 's best portable vacuum you can find anywhere !! I tried almost every brands , all are freaky and after while the battery wo n't work anymore , and the price of batteries is nearly same as vacuum !! So save money with buying this corded vacuum , also the power is 750W but the suction is equal or even more than standard vacuums !! I recommend this vacuum for anybody that has pets.The only problem is the filter can be find only in black & decker ; stores .
 You wo n't believe the power this inexpensive hand vac packs !! I have not found any vacuum , including my Dyson , that works as well . The only down side is it is really loud.I am going to purchase another for my upstairs -- I love it !
 Great little thing , works great for pet hairWhen the hair is stuck in the fabric - you have to work at it , but a little work it will come up .
 Okay , I received this vacuum about an hour ago . Everything checks out fine EXCEPT for a question on the filter . Everywhere you look -LRB- even the box and instruction manual -RRB- refers to the HVF-91 washable cloth filter , but when I opened up the filter compartment what was inside was the fluted paper cone filter which seemed identical to the VF100 paper filter used in the cordless Dustbuster ! Anyone else experience this ? -LRB- After I posted the above I noticed a picture of the filter on the side of the box the vacuum came in . Guess what ? It 's a picture of the paper VF100 filter -LRB- the one that 's in the vacuum -RRB- , not the recommended HVF-91 cloth filter !!! Go figure . I 'm just going to make the assumption that you can use either filter . -RRB-
 I bought this specifically for vacuuming my carpeted stairs since my upright vacuum is just too cumbersome to do so . The cord is just long enough , and it does a good job of cleaning the carpet . The beater bar attachment even leaves `` grooming '' marks like a real vacuum cleaner would . I have only used it one time so far , so I will come back and downgrade my review if I have any problems in the future . For now it is five stars and it already exceeded my expectations for such a low-priced system .
 This powerful dustbuster works well . I can not believe how strong the suction is . I like the cord because I borrowed my sister 's cordless one and it ran out of juice before the job was down . Much better to have a cord . So far I did not try the attachments .
 this thing as a quick touch up vac and as a pet hair remover is second to none . ca n't beat the power . the bristles in the turbo brush are rubber and really pulls any embedded pet fur right out with no problem . i have really long hair that wraps around the turbo brush , but i 've found that if i use the vac alone or with the hose attachment first , i can then finish up with the turbo brush to leave my bathroom completely hair free .
 I needed to replace my cordless B&D dustbuster that I had for about 3 years-so did n't last too long . I have a black lab and when I saw the reviews for this B&D pet series dustbuster , I decided to give it a shot . I am so glad I did , this is really an amazinlgy powerful dustbuster , easy to use and really does work getting up the pet hair . The cord is a good length , so anyone with stairs this would be ideal too .
 Terrific little vac . I also ordered a crevice attachment to get in narrow spaces . I can clean in places where I would have had to move furniture .
 This machine is exactly what I was looking for . It picks up pet hair on the furniture and stairs like a pro . It is light weight and easy to handle for long periods of time . I have a cordless version of this vacuum that loses power quickly so this corded version is perfect for my needs .
 I bought this vacuum to clean up my bathroom after I trim my Bichon Frise dog and after styling my own hair . I tend to shed like a puppy !!!! It is great & it is wonderful to vacuum stairs . It has a nice long cord . I start at the top of my hardwood stairs & work my way down . I am very happy with this product .
 this little dustbuster really lives up to its hype.extremely easy to handle with adequate cord length , quickly eliminated large amounts of pet hair , loose litter and dust.attachments add to the tasks one can accomplish with this machine.I highly recomend this product to anyone with pets or needing something for a quick clean .
 Holy Moly ! This little mighty mouse vacuum really impressed me . I was hesitant on purchasing due to the mixed reviews but for the price it seemed like a good gamble . I took it out to clean up some cat litter and fur on the carpet and my tiled bathroom floor . It is loud but has incredible suction for the size . Sucked all the litter right up off the floor , from her litter mat , and from the carpet . I was super excited so I started vacuuming in the bathroom crevices , and lastly tested it out on throw on my bed that is always full of cat fur . Sucked it right up . I know this will work great getting my car cleaned up and any time I have a spill to clean up and do n't want to drag out the vacuum . This is just what I needed . Perfect for a long haired cat owner with constant furry messes .
 I really like this item . suction is very good , and the parts are easy to put on/take off . machine is solid and robust . price is very good . I live in a small apartment and I use this rather thna a vacumm . Saves me space in the house . I recommend ! :-RRB- !
 This replaces my old cordless dust buster that used hard-to-find filters . I was concerned about having one with a cord but I absolutely love this one ! It has * very * powerful suction and a relatively long cord . I 'm happy that the power does n't start to peter out after a few minutes like the cordless one . I have n't cleaned it out yet -LRB- yuck -RRB- but at least I do n't have to worry about running out of filters !
 Generally there is some disappointment when ordering online . However , never with Amazon and not with the Balck and Decker hand-held vacuum I received . It 's easy to work , store and the suction is incredible.I have been using this little gem more than my regular vacuum . I may order another one for the house as this one is used on our motor home.LOVE IT !
 this little vacuum is so powerful !! It works wonderful with and without the attachments . It 's even gotten my 7 year old to want to vacuum his room an everything else because its so powerful and fun to use . I would recommend buying the extra filters along with the vacuum as I can see them not lasting very long . I plan on buying the filters today , just to have them on hand , because I would hate to not be able to use it just because I ran out of filters . And I plan on using it alot . Works awesome on hardwood stairs and carpet . I love it !!!
 A note of caution , when I plugged it in it ran and scared me . The switch was on out of the box?When you turn it on , it twists due to the torque of the motor . With that being said , this sucks with the power of a regular full size machine . It 's easy to clean and handy to pull out for a simple cleaning instead of going to the closet to pull out the regular vacuum . We bought this to clean up our kitty litter and bird seed . The feathers were sticking to the brush we were using due to static electricity .
 I live in a very small apartment with a couple of rugs that I could n't get my hair out of ... While I do n't have any pets , I am a bit of a shedder , and I needed something that would get hair out of my rugs , and this thing worked amazingly well . The power in this tiny light thing is out of control . True , a dustbuster is neither the most efficient nor the most comfortable way to vacuum an apartment , but for $ 30 , a little discomfort is as small sacrifice for how well this works and how easy it is to store . Biggest complaint -- and I 'm not sure that this is avoidable -- but some hair got stuck very very wrapped around the roller ... I cut it off with scissors , which worked very well , but not having to do that would be preferable .
 But I use it more ! Works great . VERY powerful and lots of suction . Easy to clean by knocking the dust and dirt off outside and then rinsing the cup and washing the filter . TIP
 I love my corded hand vac . It has great suction power . It is great for quick pick - ups in our Dining room .
 This item Works grat on all Pet Hair !! Works Great On Cleaning up different dirt quick cleanup !! Works greta for cleaning up the Car !!
 Had this model some 4 years ago , but stopped working . I use it often ... mostly for the car & computer . The blower does a great job for the Computer ... : - -RRB-
 This is one of the most powerful vacuums I 've ever used - the pet hair attachment is n't the best - but overall , I love it .
 Picks up the cat hair better then all the other products I 've used . This item deserves the five star rating !
 Most important feature - Vacuum and Blower in one device . It is important to have both the function in one device . I would strongly recommend to buy .
 When I moved to NYC last year , I had to strip down to the essentials , which did n't include my vacuum cleaner . Since we were moving into an all wood floors apt , I thought I 'd get by just fine with the roomba and a broom , and I did ... for a while . Unfortunately there are always those little nooks and crannies where brooms just are n't effective ... under couch cushions , on top of the kitchen cabinets , under the bed ... Without room to store a full-size , I decided a hand-held was the way to go and the reviews lead me to this one . I love it ! Having it around has decreased my stress-level when it comes to the hairballs and dust bunnies which I was constantly chasing . It 's powerful suction and easy to clean filter combined with the hose and floor attachments are ideal for small spaces like mine . And when I 'm done , it fits oh-so easily under the bed . The also thought to use a super-long cord which means I can walk the perimeter of an entire room without the hassle of unplugging . I 'd highly recommend for anyone looking for something compact or a quick-reach alternative to the full size version !
 I had a handheld mini vac several years back , which did a good job , but this one is much more powerful and sucks in a lot more than my previous one . It easily picks up cat fur and a whole lot more . It also does a superb job on my stairs . I highly recommend it .
 I 'm very pleased with this purchase ! It is certainly worth every penny . It has strong suction for its size . I highly recommend it !
 this vacuum is inredibly powerful . Loved it so much I bought 2 . Filter is easy to clean nice accesories and blower feature is cool . Very powerful best vacuum .
 Finally , a hand vac that really does pick up my yellow lab 's hair off furniture . I have a tweed couch that attracts her hair and this really does collect it all . worth the money .
 Works better than I thought it would , only used once at this point , did have to work alittle to get stuff from the corners , and had to `` tug '' alittle for certain areas . Otherwise very pleased .
 I am really happy with this product . The B&D ; HV9010P proves for hand-held vacuum cleaners what I learned a decade ago about power drills
 I could n't find this product in local stores so purchased online . I did my homework and checked out many reviews and decided to go with this Black and Decker model . Its easy to use , clean and store . It picked up the very fine dust created by african grey parrot , as well as feathers.I also liked the feature that allows the unit to blow air . I use this to clean my air filtering units and to blow dust on fridge coils .
 I actually bought this as a vacuum my kids could use while I used our `` real '' one . Reading some reviews I figured it 'd be lackluster , but if it picked up a few things it 'd be plenty . After one day of using it , I 'm not sure what other reviewers are unhappy with . I think it has AMAZING power . Picks up pet hair , does the couch wonderfully , and even gets larger things without a problem . Popcorn always clogs my dyson , but this little thing has no issue with it . Same with pet food . I believe someone complained that it 's cheaply made & that the collection bin does n't stay on . It has a top and bottom latch , you have to make sure both of those are in place , I was able to slide it off easily before I realized the bottom part of the collection bin had n't been placed all the way over the bottom latch that holds it in place . There is no way it comes off if both of those are in place . It 's loud , yes , but it 's a vacuum . I 'm yet to find a quiet one . The price & power totally makes up for any excessive noise . I 've not had any dirt come out of it or have it fall over . I think the cord is a good length as well . I have cats & 3 dogs , hair came up off the hard areas of flooring & the stairs , as well as any fabrics . Easy to use , even my 3 year old is able to use it without problems . Love it , way more than I was expecting . I 'll likely use this more than the regular vacuum .
 Let me start by saying that there are 3 kids and pets in the house and there is always food and pet hair on the ground especially the kitchen . I purchased this hand vac after buying several cordless hand vacs over a few years . While the cordless hand vac 's were good , after a few months , they would loose their charge in 30 seconds . This was very frustrating when you need the cordless vac to finish the job.After I purchased this model , here is what we love about it : PROSThe power is amazing . It picks up everything that we need to pick up . One word of caution is to keep wet and sticky items away . What we love is the power , ease of cleanup and ability to finish the job . The attachments allow you to go on shallow carpets as well which is great . The attachment also allows you to skim floors without bending over . Emptying the vac is a snap.CONSNoneJust one suggestion for the cord - is to build an automatic retractor . It is a pain to manage constantly.Other than that I have to say I really love this and we are purchasing a second one .
 I am in love with this vacuum . It 's crazy powerful and the roller attachment is perfect for the couches -LRB- I have an American Bulldog and a St. Bernard that run my house -RRB- . The only problem , which I suppose could be a big one , is that the roller attachment came apart and I had to tape it closed . I 'm not sure how it broke , but I tend to be rough with my stuff , so I could have dropped it or something . Once it was taped it worked good as new . I have no other complaints .
 i bought this `` dustbuster '' for my daughter who is the proud owner of 2 cats , all 3 of them residing in a small san francisco apartment . she needed something to keep up with the cat hairs and i sent her this product with it 's special cat hair filter . SHE LOVES IT ! now , she tells me , instead of running after her kitties -LRB- to hug them -RRB- , she 's cleaning up each and every hair the minute they shed one . when we talk on the phone , i have to tell her to turn it off so i can hear her . she 's single and now i think she 's in love ... WITH HER NEW DUSTBUSTER !! ; - -RRB- P.S. she still hugs the cats !
 As a hand vac with attachments it seems to do a great job . It does n't replace a full size vac , but for reaching small areas , and getting up pet hair , it 's ideal .
 I love this product for the use of vacuuming cat litter around the cat box and vicinity and small vacuuming jobs that do not require the use of the regular vaccum cleaner but I am finding that after a year I have bought about 4 of these because every 3-4 months the thing dies ! So when it is working , it is a great product to use but I am disappointed that it dies after only 3-4 months of use !
 My son 's dog is the ideal dog with one exception . He sheds like crazy ! I can vacuum the wood floor but the furniture turns into a furry mess when he rubs against it . I 've bought every gadget that I could find to try to deal with this with no avail . This vacuum pulls the hair from the fabric with little time and effort . The rubber nubs instead of bristles on the brush really do the trick . I hope that larger vacuums will follow with this concept .
 I have been learning to groom my dog , and rapidly grew tired of dragging my full sized vacuum back and forth to clean up all the hair afterwards . I decided I wanted a good , small hand vacuum to just keep in the back room . I wanted it to be powerful , corded -LRB- never met a decent rechargeable vacuum yet -RRB- , and I wanted it to be very easy to empty . This little vacuum cleaner has everything I wanted ! And I have to say , I can not BELIEVE how powerful this thing is . If it were any stronger , I 'd have to hold onto it with both hands ! It rocks !
 This is a great unit and it really does it 's job . The suction is more powerful than my regular vacuum ! Easy to use , light weight and the rubber/brush attachment works well . Now if they only made them this powerful with batteries !
 I bought this to pick up dust every now and then in my studio apartment . I preferred the corded types because the cordless ones had to be charged and would lose it 's charge faster as it gets older . I think this had the best reviews versus the cordless/rechargeable types and the other small corded types . The cord of this thing is long enough , and I could vacuum half of my apartment at a time , and then plugging it into an electrical outlet on the other side of my apartment to vacuum the other side . Suction is strong , easy to clean -LRB- you just have to empty the bin -RRB- . Picks up dust balls , little pieces of shredded paper , beads from a necklace that I broke , etc. . I did not want a big heavy duty vacuum cleaner because I had such a small space . This one fit well in my storage closet area , bottom shelf . So , first I vacuum little dust balls here and there . Then I use a Swiffer sweeper to wipe off the rest of the dust on my wood floor . If you 're on a budget , small space , light cleaning now and then , this will work for you . Works for me .
 BLACK 7 DECKER HV9010P pet series cyclonic-action corded dustbuster & blower , is the pet hair retriever I have ever had . I have two long haired cats , that shed 365 days of the year . I 've slways had pets , cats & dogs -LRB- most with long hair -RRB- I 've tryed just about everything ! This is the best . The best way I found is to put a strap on it , so you can put it on your shoulder when using the hose . -LRB- I used a shoulder strap from a piece of luggage , works great ! Its stronger then my hoover , & does a much better job , & its a great price .
 Literally , this thing sucks
 Product works well for pet hair . Sawdust gets trapped in the filter , but the filter is removable so it can be shaken out in the garabage can -LRB- not washable -RRB- . The way the filter attaches to the vaccum does n't always hold well , but i have found this a very minor issue . Very happy with the product !! Very good performance and great price !
 This vacuum works great on pet hair . I loved it until I tried to order a replacement pre-filter from Black and Decker -LRB- my dog destroyed it -RRB- It has been on back-order since November , over 5 months , with no delivery date in sight .
 We are very pleased with this vacuum . It has great suction and picks up hair and crumbs very well . It also comes with a long cord so you can plug it in and reach a long area . I recommend this hand vacuum .
 This little dust buster gets every dog and cat hair off of my microfiber couch ! The suction it has is very impressive . The only thing that I found slightly disappointing was that it does n't get hair off of car upholstery as easily , and puts out a lot of heat , but it is compact and wonderful around the house !
 When my handheld vacuum crapped out and I needed a new one , I found this one . When it said it could pick up pet hair , I thought `` yeah , right . '' We have 2 dogs and 3 cats and my handheld and upright vacuum struggled to get the hair . This one does it with ease ! I was floored with how easy it got the hair up !!! I use the vacuum with the rotating brush piece on the `` extender '' hose . I have to use 2 hands
 The vacuum works great , light weight and long cord . I was concerned because the products package was quite damaged inside the Amazon box -LRB- had come with other items ordered -RRB- .
 These are my daily vitamins and have been for over 20 years . The quality is still the same and they seem to have all the nutrients needed to get me through the day . The only problem is you ca n't find them in stores anymore . I can only find them on line .
 This product is hard to find in the store . Good immune support . Recommended by my doctor . I 've been using it for years .
 I ordered Stress Tabs and was very happy that they arrivedquickly . I really appreciate getting this suppliementin a timely manner .
 I usually buy stresstabs with zinc every six months and i have been taking them forever and it just feel right for me ...
 My wife has used these stress tabs for quite a while and she knows what to expect with them . It is getting harder to find them at her regular source so when she does find them , she buys several boxes . It is also nice to find them at a good price and at a place where she knows she 'll get good service . Thank you .
 I am very happy with this product , espically for the price . I would recommend it to anybody . Very good quality .
 Very Good Product Helps Your Immune Support You Have To Try This Product Works Great Been Using It For About A Year Works Great !!!!
 IS GREAT AND HELPS KEEP ME HEALTHY AS I CAN BE.GLAD I FOUND AND WILL ORDER MORE , WHEN NEEDED.THANK YOU
 IT GIVES ME ALL I NEED TO HAVE THE STRENGTH I NEED AND TO HANDLE STRESS . IT IS THE BEST PRODUCT . I HOPE U KEEP MAKING IT AND SELLING IT . THANKS .
 This product is excellent for those - especially women - who need to supplement iron as well as to support a high-energy lifestyle and a strong immune system . Once in every drugstore . Now it is hard to get anywhere but online .
 -LSB- ASIN : B001G7QS9I Stresstabs High Potency Energy , now with new TRI-AMINO Energy Blend + Iron , 60 Count Bottles , -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- -RSB- -RSB- Since 1994 , Stresstabs is part of my live . I love it .
 This is a nice little selection if you are trying to find a condom that is both comfortable and your wife/girlfriend/lover likes . They all pretty close to the same size , but the different shapes , lubes , and material thicknesses make for a fun experiment to find what 's best for you .
 Around here , there 's only one larger condom brand commonly available - the Trojan Magnum -LRB- which smells strongly , gets somehow both gloppy lubey and overly dry , etc etc etc -RRB- . And to mail order just one condom of each type , with no idea as to what types to order , seems a little foolish . This condom sampler worked out really well , and with three of each kind in there , really lets you get a feel for what you might want . Plus , sampling stuff is just fun!Also , customer service from them was great .
 - I hit a plateau in my quest for six-pack abs and I have to say this stuff really seems to be working . Working slowly mind you but working none the less . After two weeks of supplimenting I have seen noticeable results in fat loss . This has helped re-motivate me in continuing my diet and exercise regime.-Take it a short time before meals .
 I 'm taking those pills for a month and very happy with the results.It help me lost weight . I 'm a tri-athlet and a bodybuilder .
 Like any of these products you never know if it is actually working but I believe it is because I am seeing results that I have never seen before . So I think its a good product and I 'm going to keep using it till I reach my goals .
 I was running out of test strips , and I researched Amazon . Com and came up with test strips that were very cheap . These test strips came to me within three days of ordering . I want to say thanks for the product that I was ordering as I needed very badly . Thanks so much Amazon.com , you saved my life and a wonderful price . Thanks
 Item was as described and shipped very promptly . Would recommend them again and very reasonably priced for this type ov item .
 Paid approx . one-half the price charged by local pharmacies . Prompt delivery . Expiration dates on the two 50-count boxes I received were only 60 to 90 days away from date I received delivery , but I will use all 100 test strips before they expire . Will order again .
 I ordered from this seller because it was the lowest price I found . The product was delivered 3 days later . What more needs to be said ? Excellent service !
 The test strips arrived exactly as promised with no hitches or glitches . New items and in perfectly usable shape .
 I purchased 100 test strips for $ 42 ; the cost for 50 test strips at WalMart was $ 67 , and at Walgreens it was $ 79 .
 I was skeptical about the strips . But it works fine with my glucose meter.Box looks little old , but the strip is just as original.I recomend this .
 I am very happy with this product in Maine they are 131.00 for a box of 100 and with no insurance that is a hard number to justify . will definitely repurchase
 I got em cheap and gottem quick , they work as advertised with my freestyle meter built into my omnipod PDM
 Wonderful and very quick service . Got it in only a few days . The money I saved was worth the wait .
 good price for product needs . medical ancillary products are overpriced but that is due to the insurance industry . OTC products drive up these prices on fixed incomes like ourselves and family .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !

 I enjoy this product and everything was sent on time . It is nice and gentle on the skin and lathers well .
 I have been using this Dermalogica Special Cleaning Gel for several years . My skin is fair , dry and sensitive as well . Prior to using the Special Skin Gel , when I washed my face with other products they left my face drier and some left a film of some type . They did n't seen to `` clean '' my skin.This product , is oh-so-gentle on your skin yet , cleans it gently and leaves it feeling soft as if it had never been cleaner!As this product is rather expensive , you 'll be happy to hear that you ONLY need about a nickel size of the dispensed gel to achieve these terrific results . A large bottle will last you at least 6 months and probably much longer!You first wet your hands and then your face . Place a nickel size portion of the gel in your hands and rub your hands together , then rub all over your face . Yes , it is so gentle that you can even open up your eyes while washing with it , and my eyes are very sensitive . If you get a great amount of suds in your hands , you 're using TOO much of the product . I then follow up with a light scrubbing with a washcloth and a rinse of water and then pat dry , If you feel you need moisturizer feel free to apply . But I 'm finding that the Special Cleansing Gel leaves my face so clean yet so soft , that there are many days where I skip my moisturizer altogether.Well worth the prices and I 'm certain you 'll enjoy the touch and feel of your skin.Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel , 8.4 fl oz -LRB- 250 ml -RRB- Also available in 16 oz pump bottles
 I like the pump on this bottle . Makes it easy to grab the amount of product you need while at the sink or in the shower . Also , this bottle is HUGE and I espect it to last me several months.Shipping was fast and the item arrived in good condition .
 This is a nice cleanser for oily skin . I use it daily and my skin feels great . I also got a great price through Amazon !
 This is the best facial cleanser that I have ever used . It does not dry out your skin , and my breakouts have been at a minimum since starting this product 2 years ago . I use it along with the toner and moisturizer . It is pricey , but I only have to buy it 2-3 times per year , as a little goes a long way , and I wash my face twice daily .
 This is a great cleanser to use for the first cleanse of the face . I plan on purchasing this product again .
 I refuse to use any other cleanser . I ran out and had to wait to get more in and my face broke out almost immediately ! It is so light and gentle , but gets to job done
 This is the first time I use this product . I like it , however , I received it without seal and it bothers me until now . When I buy beauty products , this will be very important to me . It is only thing I do n't like it .
 My whole family uses this -LRB- from dry sensitive skin to oily skin -RRB- . Works great to clean the skin , clear-up acne , or clean after removing makeup .
 I sufferred from moderate acne as a teenager . After having fairly clear skin in my 20 's , my acne started back up as I turned 30 . I went to a facialist who started me on Dermalogica products . She promised me that my skin would clear up in about 2 weeks . It did ! I 've been using this cleanser for 10 years now , and it 's the best I 've ever used . I have very sensitive , fair skin , and tends toward the oily side . I 'll never switch to another skin care line . It may seem expensive , but one 16 oz bottle lasts me for over a year , and you do n't need more than a pea size amount , so I believe it 's cheaper than most drug store products . I have also used the daily microfoliant -LRB- awesome -RRB- and their moisturizers . I can not think of a better product anywhere .
 I went to a spa in Alabama and the facialist recommended this product for my sensitive skin . I have been using it for over a year now and my face has stopped breaking out and it leaves your skin so soft .
 I have been using Dermalogica products for over a decade and I do n't know what it is about the Special Cleansing Gel but it smells delicious and seems to work with all skin types . I always feel refreshed and polished after using this nice sudsing cleanser
 I got this to use in the winter when Im not using as much sun screen ... does not irritate my skin or dry it out ... bottle lasts a long time because you only need to use a very small amount .
 Best Cleansing Gel on the market in my opinion . This is high quality and a popular brand . When I was in cosmo school , we used this on estitician class . It can be expensive , so I enjoy finding it cheaper on here .
 I have been using this for 2 years and I love it . I have very dry skin and this does not irritate it at all .
 This product arrived quickly and it was a great price . I purchased it locally from a salon and it was much more expensive .
 best face cleanser I 've used . very gentle but effective , doesnt dry my skin out at all ! And this size bottle lasts several months , so its worth the price .
 This product is great , cleans skin without causing any irritation . Smells nice , removes make-up easily . Great for daily use -LRB- personally use twice daily -RRB- . This size -LRB- 16.9-Fluid Ounce -RRB- lasts ages !
 It is soft and delicious , with a little bit of this product I clean my face after removing the make up . I does n't contain soap , therefore it is special for delicated skin . The size is great , I 'm so happy with this product .
 I 've been using dermalogica products for almost 15 years and have seen positive results now that I am getting older . People tell me frequently that I look much younger and I have dermalogica to thank for it . I recommend buying the larger size , although expensive , it will last up to a year because all that 's needed is a tiny bit , which spreads easily .
 This skin care line is by far the best I have ever used and yields the best results . Yes , it is a little on the pricey side , but it is not even close to the most expensive product out there . I will pay a bit extra for a product that works , especially one that works this well !
 Oily or combination skin requires a gentle cleanser that will not over dry nor leave oily residues . This gel cleanser is gentle on my skin leaves it clean and fresh not dry . Great for make up removing including the eye area . The essential oils smell is very pleasant . The pump is great helps you dispense the perfect amount one pump goes a long way . Worth the price .
 It cleared my skin up ! After a short period of more outbreaks my skin calmed down , and is almost perfect now . : -RRB- I love it , and you do n't have to use much at a time . It last a little eternity .
 I 've tried many facial products - but always go back to Dermalogica - even though it 's pricy - it 's worth it - and lasts a long time - about 9 months . When I have used other products my skin gets dull or breaks out . When I use this cleansing gel , my face glows . All entire line is wonderful !
 Best facial wash I ever used . Im in afghanistan and I went online to order anything to wash my face but found this and though its a little pricy , its worth the price .
 Love the product ... spa I go to uses and recommends it ... markup at salon so decided to try Amazon ... quick turnaround time from supplier .
 I LOVE this facewash !!! It is gentle on the face and gets my eye makeup off as well . I have sensitive skin and this facewash has never irritated the skin on my face or eyes . There is not artificial fragrance in it . This is a product I have been using for about 5 or more years and stick with a good thing . Even though Dermalogica is expensive , I feel it is a value to purchase the bigger size as it lasts so long . I am 55 years old and have dryer skin as I age , and this product does not dry out my skin . I would highly recommend it !!!
 I was skeptical about buying beauty products online from an unknown seller . I have no regrets ! The product arrived with original seal . Not only did the product arrive sooner than estimated arrival time given here on amazon , DermaShoppe included samples with my purchase . It was obvious that the samples were selected based on my purchase - they are perfect for my skin . Now that 's what I call customer service !!! BTW , I have sensitive skin and this special cleansing gel by Dermalogica is not too harsh for my skin . I use it as make-up remover -LRB- pre-cleanse -RRB- and regular face wash . Also perfect to clean make-up brushes . Highly recommend this product and this seller .
 I have great skin , and I owe a lot of that to this product ! It is a gentle , effective , and refreshing cleanser that has a nice light smell to it . I previously worked at a high-end salon and spa , that exclusively sold Dermalogica products . One of the estheticians that I worked with recommended this product to me after a very bad experience with Clinique products . I must say , I have never had a face wash agree with my skin the way this one does ! I use it morning and night , followed by La Mer moisturizing lotion . You should most definitely try this product , you wo n't be disappointed !
 I started on the Dermologica products after using Clinique for 4 years and having it stop working . I went to get a facial and she suggested I start with them . I 've been using the special cleansing gel and multi-active toner for 6 months now and really like them ! My skin is very fair and is brighter , is toned , and bounces back from the occasional -LRB- hormonal -RRB- breakout nicely ! This does n't mean it 's the best product out there , but it 's worked for me !
 You only need a small amount . It cleanses without drying . It smells fresh -LRB- not like perfume -RRB- . It does not irritate the skin or leave it prone to acne . Great cleanser . I 'm hooked .
 This cleanser feels so nice on your skin , and is definitely gentle . Purchased this in the largest size for a cost savings , and , as a previous user of Lancome , this is a great value ! You do n't even need a full squirt to wash your face ... a half of one is more than enough !
 I love this wash . Its gentle , does not burn and removes even water-based makeup . It leaves your face feeling nice and clean without any dry feeling.Great Product
 I love this product . I have tryed everything , estee lauder , chanel , aveda , philosopy just to name a few . And for me this is the only product that really cleans my skin and that also calms it as well.Just try this product .
 This product did n't make me break out in hives the way the anti-bacterial cleanser did . I like that it comes with a pump which helps keep it free from contamination . It took my make-up off without feeling like it was stripping my skin . I think it 's a good price - since you get so much of it .
 Dermalogica carries some of the best and my most favorite products for both myself and my teen daughters . This Cleanser , along with the Daily Micofoliant are 2 of the best products I have EVER used !
 I have used this cleanser for 6 years and it the best i have ever used . I always tried different cleansers but everything always made the skin tight . This cleanser is gentle enough to take off eye makeup with out having to use a seperate eye makeup remover . It has no soap in it so it keeps the skin 's PH balance in check and removes impurities w/o disturbing the skin 's natural moisture balance . The cleanser also goes a long way , only a pea to dime size for every use . Use every morning and night . Toner and moisturize after every wash . Recommended toner is multi-active toner and active moist . And of course it can be expensive for some , but its worth it . Take care of your skin . You wont regret it .
 Love Dermalogica and have been using this product for a couple of years now with great results . The lack of scent also is a great selling point for me .
 I have been using this cleanser for years . It 's a great product and gentle - no residue , no drying out of the skin .
 This is a great facial cleanser . It really helped control my oil and acne this summer ! It is a little harsh for my skin this winter , but I still feel like it cleans really well without stripping my skin of its ' moisture . For the winter , I have been using this and alternating it with Cetaphil bar soap .
 I 've been using this product for more than 6-8 years . I combine alternate it with SkinCeuticals cleansers with more power , but this is wonderful for every cleansing and even clean my eye makeup .
 This is my third bottle - and I am certain I wo n't use anything else . I really feel super clean after using it - like all the pollutants and grim is washed away at the end of the day . I have super sensitive skin and hormonal acne , and this has n't irritated me one bit . I highly recommend this face wash !
 I decided to try a sample-size of this cleanser from a local beauty shop . It worked so well , and we so gentle -LRB- on my dry , sensitive skin -RRB- that I wanted more ! I ended up buying it full-price at a spa after a facial . HUGE mistake . It cost me like $ 75 !!! Then I found it on here for $ 36 !! What a pleasant surprise !! You only need a little bit , so the 8.4 oz . bottle lasts for quite a while ! Especially if you use the pre-cleanser first ! -LRB- which I thought was total BS initially - but , in fact - is a HUGE help -RRB- . It smells a tiny bit - a little weird , but not offensive - it 's too subtle -LRB- and I have an overly sensitive sense of smell , so most probably would n't even notice -RRB- . it 's totally clear , so you do n't have to worry about any artificial coloring and they definitely did n't use any fragrances.It gets my face nice and clean without drying out my skin - but , it also does n't leave it oily . Perfect combo . Great stuff !! I 'm sticking with it!I know that it may seem like BS but for those of you with dry skin like me , I 'd get the pre-cleanser and hydro-booster with this . My skin has never looked better ! : -RRB-
 Excelente product . . face feeling really fresh and clean with a smooth and renewed texture . . I love It !! and this presentation -LRB- 16.9 oz -RRB- lasts me many months .
 Special Gel works great ! I have sensitive skin and try many different over the counter products to cut costs . I have some either allergic reaction or some skin issue , so I must find a sensitive product that cleans well and does not dry my skin . This is it !
 love this product . i use everyday and makes my skin looks clean and fresh . definetely recommend !!!
 Been using the product for years . It 's great for the face . Use it twice a day . Great price and speedy shipping from this seller .
 I have been using this facial cleanser for 7 years , and I would never switch . It keeps my skin very clean . It gets rid of makeup and daily grime completely and leaves your face feeling smooth and soft , never dry . At Amazon.com I paid a fraction of the price .
 I have used this product for almost two years . I love Dermalogica ! I started using it at the recommendation of my Dermatologist . I never have break outs and my skin feel so soft since I have been using this cleanser .
 Excellent product ! I found it much cheaper at Amazon than at the few locations at which it is sold . Also , the shipping was FREE ! You really ca n't beat it . Dermalogica is great for the skin and on Amazon it 's much less expensive and received within a few days .
 I have been using Dermalogica products for 15 years ! They are the best . And Special Cleansing Gel is the only product that makes my face feel clean - it removes all my makeup but is not too drying . The prices at Amazon were the best I found !
 I purchase Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel for my daughter , It 's the ONLY thing she will use ! She started using these products after finding them at a local spa , in Miami , and was hooked.Amazon has the best price , and the fastest shipping .
 I had been mostly using Noxema and various other skin cleansers previous to trying the Special Cleansing Gel . I was recommended this product during a facial and decided to give it a try . It works quite well ! Sometimes , it can feel a little drying , so remember to have some face-friendly moisturizer handy . Dermalogica has many excellent choices in that area , too . After finishing my first -LRB- smaller -RRB- bottle , I took the plunge and bought this larger bottle so it can refill both the 8.4 oz and travel-sized bottle when needed . Well worth a try !
 This product was a great deal . It arrived in great condition and on time . Will buy from this seller again .
 I love this cleanser ... Very gentle and you only need a dime size amount because it foams up . I have sensitive , combo skin that is acne prone but with this cleaser no problems . Only thing is the price but I guess it 's worth it !
 I 've always liked the Dermalogica product line , and now that I do n't have to hunt down a stor , I 'll never be without.Product arrived quickly and as ordered -- thanks !
 Dermalogica offers some great products.Pricy but worth it.We 've been using this product for years and will continue to as long as it 's available.The special cleansing gel is great for washing the face . Works well on sensitive , oily skin.If you have oily skin and hate having to wash your face a couple/few times a day give this stuff a try .
 Definitely prevents you from getting a sore bottom after a tough spin class . Very uncomfortable to walk in though .
 Its a good product I got it quick and fast . However takes forever to start working so I switched over to taking pills for my acne and my face is clearing up a lot faster . This product works wonders for everyone else who has used in my family just guess not me .
 I 've been acne-free for years , but I 'm just now getting over the acne mentality that makes me want to go down to the river 's edge and scrub my face with sand . Enough with the abrasives , the ex-foliants , the battery acid astringents , time for a grown-up cleanser like this light , herbal-scented gel that leaves my skin fresh but not dry . I highly recommend this product .
 this product is great ! I have oily skin and have been using the product daily for a couple of weeks and have noticed a great improvement . My skin is not as oily , reduced pore size , reduced redness and overall my skin seems to be brighter ! I love it and will continue to use it ! I am sold !!
 I was hesitant when I bought this cleanser at the beauty supply store because I have tried so many acne products to no avail . I have tried proactive , clinique , shiseido , etc. and no product has kept me from breaking out the way this gel cleanser has . My skin is combination oily/sensitive basically the most problematic skin you could have . I do n't have severe acne but I definitely see my fair share of bad breakouts . I also have olive skin so breakouts are especially problematic for me because each blemish I get leaves a little dark spot . I have n't broken out once since I bought this cleanser over a month ago . If you follow the instructions and wash twice every time you cleanse , your face will be incredibly clean , not tight , and your clarity should improve dramatically . At least mine did . It lasts a long time too because you only need to use a tiny bit each time you wash .
 This is by far the easiest daily scrub I 've ever used ; it feels effective and yet gentle ; reasonably priced , it lasts a long time !
 Used this product for about 2 years , then stopped and tried a few L'Oreal products only to have my skin breakout and become dry . Went back to this and the Active Moist and within a couple weeks my skin is back to normal !
 The cleanser came fast and packaged well . I would like everyone to give this product a try !! My dermatologist recommened it to me . You would n't belive how clean your face feels and not all dried out . Plus for you wemon the make-up comes off with ease . Including your mascara . I would give this 10 stars if I could !!
 I ca n't imagine anyone not having success w dermalogica if used correctly . A good product is probably going to break your face out at first bc all of the impurities will come to the surface . Also , if you 've never used dermalogica before , you should n't just pick the product that you `` think '' will work for you , you need to go to a dermalogica skin care store and let and aesthetician recommend the correct product for your skin . I have tried different products from time to time , but ALWAYS go back to dermalogica . You get what you pay for , and that remains true with ALL of dermalogica 's products .
 A basic non scented cleansing gel that does it 's everyday job . Does not dry my skin out and works well with my dermalogica skin smoothing cream .
 Dermalogica products are great !!! I had use this product a long time ago , and I had forgotten how great this product really is . I love the way this face wash removes my eye make up without irritating my eyes . Best of all , this is the only product I have tried that does not leaves my skin feeling dry . If you are looking for a great face wash product , dermalogical special cleansing gel is the product you need . Trust me , you are going to love it !!!
 I had problems with blemishes , and a friend suggested this for me , since it had been very helpful for her and her skin.It works wonders , and several friends I have suggested it to , is also very satisfied with this cleanser .
 I love this cleanser ! I 've used it for years . It feels awesome ... very light and does n't dry my skin out . And , Dermalogica does n't animal test !
 this soap is amazing , makes my skin really clean , best to combine it with dermalogica moister.I got the large size of it , and I 'm using really small amount of soap every day , also as a makeup remover . It 's really great
 The Dermalogica products are great ! My face has feels clean and has been fresher than ever . The larger bottle is a better deal for the price .
 I must say that I was not entirely excited when a friend gave this face wash to me as a gift . Perhaps I should have taken offense ? In any case , I looked past that as soon as I tried this wash because it is just so great -- just a straightforward , gentle cleanser that does exactly what it 's supposed to . With all the face washes available out there , you 'd think it 'd be fairly easy to pick one up that is no-frills and does n't hurt your skin but it 's been a lot harder for me than it should be . So I 'm so grateful that this was given to me , just a great overall cleanser !
 I had to write a review because I was shocked that this cleanser had such a low rating . First , yes , Dermalogica is expensive . -LRB- Although it does n't have to be . -RRB- Second of all , I use their products based on what was recommended to me by Dermalogical facialists at their store , rather than picking whatever I like . This is not a harsh cleanser that will make your face sting . It 's pleasant smelling and I actually do find it to be effective . Dermalogica actually recommends washing your face twice in a row with this product . I know that might sound like hogwash to get you to use more ... but supposedly the first time gets stickier makeup off and the second time gets the remainder . I take the middle ground and use it three times a day -- once at morning , night , and after the gym . Why am I willing to pay way more for Dermalogica rather than going to the local CVS when I 'm an incredibly poor graduate student ?? After I switched to Dermalogica I started getting tons of compliments on my skin . I mean very frequently , as in people coming up to me and asking what my skincare regimen is .
 I 've been a devoute Dermalogica user for years and held a Dermalogica certification at one point . So I should have known better - although it says for all skin types , this really is n't the best if you have mostly oily skin . It feels great at first , but the lathery composition of the face wash strips the oils which results in a little oil overproduction . My skin had cleared up after using Dermal Clay for so long , I thought I was in the clear . But after about 3 weeks of using this , I started breaking out badly again . For normal skin types , this is an excellent , lightweight cleanser . But for oily or acne-prone skin , try Dermal Clay .
 For years I had no real skin issues , but lately it seemed no matter what I tried , it was n't working . Everything was irritating my face , I was breaking out more , and my skin was oilier . I happened upon Dermalogica while shopping for shampoo , lucky for me . I ordered this cleanser , and I loved it immediately . It 's light , it smells great , my latest breakouts have clearing up without any spot treatments , and my skin feels great after cleaning , instead of dry or irritated . Recommended for anyone with sensitive skin or troublesome skin . It might seem costly , but a little goes a long way , and it 's well worth it .
 I would n't say that I have been obsessed , but maybe something close to but not necessarily obsession as far as skincare goes . So , I have tried a lot of different products along the way . Dermalogica special cleansing gel is hands down the best facial cleanser to date . Skincare 101 ... do not put any product on your face that contains perfume and soap free cleanser is best -- this product meets both of those criteria . Your skin will be clean but not stripped . You will notice the difference the first time you use this product .
 This cleanser deep-cleans -LRB- wash & rinse twice to remove make-up and cleanse skin -RRB- and manages to remove oil without drying out your skin .
 This is a wonderful product . I 've always had pretty good skin but someone gave me a bottle and since I started using the product I have n't had more than one or 2 zits in 5 years . My husband has breakouts on his back , now that he 's using it his back has totally cleared up.It does n't take a lot . Just a dime sized amount will wash your face and neck . It really cleans out and opens up your pores while not stripping off your natural oils . Worth every penny.You can buy it in 3 sizes . I would suggest getting it in the biggest/best priced size you can find .
 I have tried pretty much everything out there . Anything you can buy in the grocery store , mail order products like proactive etc. . I picked up a bottle of this at a spa b/c it is what they used at their business for a facial . It works great . I have super sensitive skin and although some other products were ok , I was alway blotchy and have a hard time with adult acne . I have mixed skin and it can never decide if it is dry or oily . This WORKS ! It is very gentle on my skin and I do n't need to put any cream or moisturizer on afterwards .
 I have super sensitive normal to dry skin with red blotchy patches on my cheeks all year round -LRB- not sure what it is from but in Winter my skin gets very red with eczema -RRB- . I thought I had just about tried every cleanser recommended with no big relief . Someone suggested this brand of cleanser & of course I `` thought '' another over priced cleanser that is going to dry my skin out , WOW what a super pleasant surprise ! First off it 's quite concentrated so you do n't need much -LRB- bonus there ! -RRB- & after washing my face -LRB- & I REALLY mean this -RRB- for the absolute 1st time my skin felt clean , refreshed , & not all tight & dry as usual ! This cleanser is liquid gold to my skin ! I love it & would recommend it to anybody . If you think it 's maybe to expensive do a search & see if you can find a free sample as I did first but I am certainly ordering a bottle of this ! I just ca n't say anything bad about it & I do speak my mind ! Highly recommended : -RRB-
 Been using this for the past years . . am pretty satisfied with it , suits me as an Asian
 This is a clear face wash that I enjoy using . It gently cleans the face without stripping the skin . I would have rated this product a 5 but it contains parabens.Made in the USA
 I have used many melatonin products and Melatonex is the only one I 've found that combines all the things I think are important-3 mg dosage , vegetarian -LRB- no risk of mad cow disease -RRB- , and slow release . The sleep benefits , and antioxidant benefits are wonderul with this product .
 I like this deodorant because it 's all natural . It do n't have anything harmful in it like the other brands that are out there on the market . The smell seems kinda feminine , I guess that 's the aloe that I 'm smelling ? Just something I will just have to get used to because I 'm not switching back to the other brands.Also , this is not really waterproof , a little bit of water will take it off . So do n't go around shooting super soakers and expect to still smell like a princess : P
 I love this stuff . I use to use Old Spice but I always had redness under my arms . With this stuff I do n't have the redness anymore . I think this stuff is great .
 This product is the best Deodorant I have ever used . I have used it for the past 5 years and it has caused no rash under my arms like other deodorants I have used that contain toxic chemicals to the body
 Product arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I ordered . I love this deodorant . It smells great and does a great job .
 I think this works pretty well at hiding odor , but does n't last me through the whole day . I live in Virginia and it 's gotten pretty hot this summer so it takes a second application to refresh my underarms . I was looking for a good natural deodorant as I have sensitive underarm skin .
 This has been a great product for me ! I used to be able to use most deodorants , but after having my thyroid glands removed my body seems to have changed . I have had difficulty finding any deodorant the does n't give me a rash . I saw this brand on the shelf at WalMart and bought a couple to try it . It has worked perfectly for me ! No problems with rash or odor . I went back to buy some more and our WalMart no longer carries it . So , I decided to try Tom 's of Main . Two days later I have a pealing rash under both arms . Today I got on the internet to see if I could find a supplier for it and happily it is available here on Amazon -LRB- I purchase quite a bit through Amazon -RRB- , so I am back in business.I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin .
 I have tried several deodorants as I prefer not to use anti-perspirants . This is the one that has always consistently left me smelling great and is long-lasting . Love it !!
 I recently stopped using antiperspirants because they were causing me to develop an underarm rash , probably due to the aluminum-based ingredients . Although I would prefer a product that could keep my underarms dry while inhibiting odor , I do like this deodorant.Note , however , that although this deodorant contains propylene glycol -LRB- PG -RRB- , there is another deodorant that does not -LRB- Herbal Clear PG-Free -RRB- -- but it is a different product made by a different manufacturer . I do n't know which product arrived on the market first , and it seems VERY odd that two competing products are allowed to use the exact same name , but the PG-free deodorants with blue labels are separate from the deodorants in yellow containers , which are made by 21st Century HealthCare , Inc.Understandably , having two independent products with identical names on the market at the same time has led to some confusion . I have seen consumer reviews and comments posted on-line by people who think that the PG-free product is a new formulation of this one .
 This deodorant combines two things that I find most important in a deodorant . I live in South Louisiana and garden year round . This product works in my hot climate . Also , this deodorant does n't leave white marks on my clothing . It is an awesome product that I use twice daily and highly recommend .
 I have been using this product ever since I found it a year ago . For years I tried to find a deodorant without aluminum . All the others I 've tried have failed me at some point during the day . It works really well , it does apply a little wet but dries fast , it does foam if you are sweating -LRB- in hot weather -RRB- , not ideal for sleeveless shirts , but its the only deodorant I have found to be strong enough to prevent bad odor all day , may need a second application if physically active during the day but no funk .
 Gentle , Clean-Smelling and it Works ! + No aluminum to negatively affect your body , + No yellow sweaty armpit stains on light colored clothes , + No past funk residue after laundering on clothes + You 'll smell good even after a hot Texas day!NOTE >> > THIS IS NOT ANTIPERSPIRANT ** It 's difficult to find locally and worth shopping around with different sellers for good pricing and shipping so you can stock up .
 `` Natural '' is a worm word to draw people into thinking that the products , including food , are healthy . It replaced the word `` wholesome '' when people started getting organically knowledgeable . This product uses Propylene Glycol as its main ingredient , but so do all deodorant sticks . However , this product uses Lichen to stop the bacterial smell , not aluminum or other metals . It does stop you from sweating , but not completely , but you do n't stink . One reviewer gave the product a one star rating because of the `` Natural '' verbiage and the use of Propylene Glycol , which she thought was dishonest . She has a good point . However , her husband seems to have a problem with many products because he is hypoallergic . You can read about Propylene Glycol here and make your own decision :[ ... -RSB- I like it because it is tentatively much healthier than heavy metal deodorants , it has no smell if you get unscented , and it does n't mark your cloths .
 I love this product , it works so well . It can even be applied when you 're already a little sweaty and will neutralize odors immediately . I first found this item at Target , but they stopped carrying it . I was going to buy it thru amazon , but the shipping prices are WAY out of line , more for shipping than the items . I ended up going directly to one of the sellers websites , and paid only $ 6 to ship 10 of these . I ca n't say who the seller was , but check into that before purchasing here ...
 I 've been using this for over a year and I love it . It has a pleasant smell and so do I ! It does n't stop you from sweating , but that 's fine with me . There 's a reason we sweat , you know , to cool our bodies when we exert ourselves . But with this product , we do n't smell . The perspiration evaporates and this keeps us smelling fresh . My husband ran out of his usual stuff & tried it , now he wo n't use anything else . We are going to try the sport scent next , to see how he likes that one . Overall I highly recommend it !
 This is a great product ! I have sensitive skin - other deodorants made me breakout with a rash and the deodorants with aluminum left light colored shirts with yellow stains . When first using this product , it didnt seem to work well , but what else could I do , it was better than getting these breakouts under my arms - I gave it a good two week trial and wow ! this stuf really worked . No more breakouts and even after getting off the treadmill , running 3-4 miles , it was still working . This product is hard to find in stores - in the San Jose area - thanks to Amazon.con I can get it when I want it . If you have eczema or sensitive skin , this is the deodorant to buy .
 My skin is very sensitive -LRB- rash/irritated skin -RRB- to a lot of brands of deodorants out there . I used Tom 's of Maine , but they changed their ingredients . I can no longer use Tom 's of Maine deodorant . Now , this is the only deodorant I 've tried that I wo n't react to , and I can not find it in any stores near me anymore . It does a good job for day to day wear . It may not be ideal for sports , and I should note that it is not an antiperspirant -LRB- although to me this is a benefit , as it will not clog your sweat glands -RRB- .
 My husband has sensitive armpits , and gets red and broken skin using normal deodorants , so he has been trying all the usual suspects in the natural deodorant space . The Herbal Clear Sport does the best job of masking odor all day .
 This deodorant works great for me as I am allergic to almost every other product on the market including all antiperspirants . There are no irritating ingredients . It does n't sting or cause any bad reactions . Love it !
 Recently , my skin developed a rash when appying deodorants with aluminum -LRB- basically all the standard ones -RRB- . I tried this deodorant and it works very well . As an active male , I sweat a lot but this product gives me more than 12 hours of protection against body odors and my skin is now perfect .
 I fell in love with this deodorant because it does not contain aluminum , which the human body can not break down . Unfortunately , the store that I used to buy it from stop carrying it . Well this online seller has it and my buying experience has been great . Pricing is a little more than I was paying for at the store , but the selection is greater and shipping and processing is quick .
 We all have sensitive skin in our family , this is the first deodorant that does not cause swelling , itching or those crazy little red bumps . It smells good and feels great too ! The good news is that it is a fabulous product , the bad news is that it is difficult to find locally . Thank goodness for Amazon .
 it took me just maybe a few hours to get used to the smell , but i do like it and probly will buy it again , im going to try another deodorant first though
 It 's hard to find in stores , it 's small enough to take on a plane . What more could you want ? I 'd buy it again .
 After trying lots of different products , we found this one to be the choice of our family . We all have very sensitive skin and this is the only deodorant we can comfortably use . It does the job well !
 Plain and simple this is the best deodorant I 've ever used its natural feels like it to and the white marks on your black shirt ? Just wipe it off with your hands love this product .
 I have been using this for years , as it is a natural product , inexpensive , and does the job . I liked it so much that when I could not find it locally anymore I went online and ordered several .
 This is the most effective healthy deodrant product on the market - I am a energy healer and this product is excellent for all woman as a prevenitive measure against breast cancer and lymphatic issues .
 Herbal Clear natural deodorant is a good inexpensive natural product . Costing less than $ 3 per stick , it 's one of the most affordable natural deodorants on the market . I will freely admit that this is the main reason I decided to try this brand . The smell of the deodorant is a light , pleasant smell -LRB- clear aloe fresh scent -RRB- . Not too feminine or too manly so that either sex can wear it comfortably . It 's a clear solid type of deodorant that does n't leave any marks on your clothing at all . The `` clear solid '' of other brands is usually still white and tends to leave faint marks on clothing , but not this brand , it 's literally clear . This deodorant really keeps me dry throughout the entire day . The only thing I do n't love more than my old chemical-laden deodorant is that this deodorant only keeps me smelling fresh for 10-12 hours . My old kind would keep me smelling fresh all day and all night , but this one requires a re-application late in the evening . Still , I think it 's more affordable and works better than some of the more expensive natural deodorants . They also offer a sport version which may provide protection for a longer period of time , but I have not tried it yet.Among its other benefits , Herbal Clear donates a portion of their profits to breast cancer prevention . This deodorant is hypoallergenic , contains vitamins A & E , and does not contain aluminum , parabens , alcohol , dyes , or artificial bactericides . Manufactured by 21st Century HealthCare and made in Canada .
 I absolutely LOVE this product , but find it hard to find . I found it on Amazon , and am VERY PLEASED . Was shipped right away , and I felt that the prices was great . Awesome value . THANK YOU !!
 I first found this deodorant at Target years ago and decided to try it since it seemed to be a healthier product -LRB- no aluminum , for example -RRB- and was remarkably inexpensive to boot -LRB- about $ 2.00 back then -RRB- . I decided to use it in combination with Crystal Deodorant , the 100 percent mineral salt deodorant -LRB- about $ 5.00 for the roll-up version that lasts about a year -RRB- to see if I could stay odor-free for long , active periods using both daily . I start with a base of the Crystal Deodorant and add Herbal Clear Aloe Fresh over that . I had been using Tom 's Deodorant , to the tune of about $ 5.00 each , each stick only lasting a relatively short time , prior to this combination . I was surprised to find that the combination of Herbal Clear Aloe Fresh with an initial base of Crystal Deodorant not only kept me odor-free all day , but also did n't stain my white T-shirts or leave a white residue on my armpits . I have very hairy armpits and am an active man living in an area that can reach over 100 degrees in summer , so I 've always had a bit of an uphill battle to stay odor-free on especially active summer days . I can report that is no longer true -- I was very happy to find this combination of healthier products and terrific low prices . Target has since discontinued Herbal Clear , so I am buying it elsewhere . I found other retailers through Herbal Clear 's parent company website .
 First , I 'm not a heavy pit sweater so antiperspirants are not for me . I tried many brands of deodorants before finding Herbal Clear . All of the others either gave me a rash -LRB- and I 'm not known for having sensitive skin -RRB- or they completely destroyed my white undershirts . I was replacing my undershirts every couple of months due to yellowing and hardening of the fabric . So gross.I was so happy when I found Herbal Clear . Great smell -LRB- Aloe version -RRB- and no annoying side effects . For years Target used to carry this stuff and it was dirt cheap . Under 2 dollars a stick . For some reason they stopped carrying it . So now I 'm forced to bid on this stuff on eBay or buy it from Amazon for nearly twice the price . The fact that I 'm bidding on deodorant on eBay is a pretty big endorsement for this brand . Give it try !
 Over the last 15 years I have tried a ton of natural based deodorants , most have had little to no effect . I found this brand at Target and it was inexpensive so I figured `` Why not '' . This is truly the most effective natural product I 've used by far . Most products just try to cover the odor , this eliminates it on a chemical level using the lichen extract . It actually neutralizes the odor . I have even had people ask me what fragrance am I wearing when I do n't even wear cologne . When I could no longer find this brand locally I was very happy to find it online and bought a six month supply . For anyone who has tried other brands and been disappointed , give this a go .
 I tried this because I am a bit unsure about the safety of using aluminum-based deodorants ; there are some studies that suggest a link to conditions such as Alzheimer 's . The deodorant smells nice , and is far from overpowering . It 's not heavy-duty deodorant by any means , but if you 're not going to be exerting yourself -LRB- or if you just do n't sweat much -RRB- it 'll probably do the job .
 In two words
 I live in San Francisco , so I am lucky enough to have some wonderful natural foods and groceries stores in which to shop . for years , I have tried many , many natural deodorants . none of them worked , unfortunately - after about an hour , it was as if I had never applied deodorant . I used to use Aromacreme by Lush , which is a fantastic product - IF you do n't develop a reaction to it , which I did . after reading the customer reviews on Amazon for this product , I decided to try it . I was pleasantly surprised at how effective it was . it has a nice , fresh scent - a bit citrus - that does not linger . nor is the formula sticky . to my delight , it keeps me nicely deodorized - all day long ! after a week of use , I have developed no reaction to the product , and I have very sensitive skin . it is also concentrated , so I do n't need to use as much as other natural deodorants . and the price point is very good compared to other natural deodorant products -LSB- believe me , I 've spent quite a bit trying to find a good one . -RSB- I highly recommend this product , and will be purchasing it again .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I took one vial and felt great . I felt like I 'd never want to use any medication again . Then I had another and did n't feel any different.Ginkgo on its own improves circulation and is a mild stimulant , but combined with eleuthero -LRB- aka siberian ginseng -RRB- and rhodiola , it can create a significant feeling of relaxation and concentration.I suppose it works for some people -LRB- like the previous reviewer 's roommate -RRB- and does n't for others . But , based on my experience , I can say that it works best if used sparingly and if it is taken on an empty stomach.Once I started taking it while I ate and doing it every day , I stopped feeling any effects . But if I avoid it for a long time and then take it on an empty stomach , I feel awesome again.In any case , it 's a good supplement and at under $ 10 a box , it 's a good deal .
 This is one of the greatest purchase I have made ... the stuff works great . . not only on my memory but has done wonders for my health !!!!
 These little bottles definitely have a noticeable effect on my memory and energy levels . I take one every day , M-F when at work . I have n't experienced any decay in effect like the other reviewer posted.They do taste pretty bad though , but the taste does n't linger in your mouth after a drink of water . For the price , they 're worth it .
 My husband and I use a vial daily . Since starting this product we notice that we have more energy . Also this produce suits our gluten free lifestyle .
 I first bought one of these Hyland 's Remedy Chests decades ago when my children were very small . If you had to replicate this Chest by purchasing each of the remedies it includes one by one , it would cost well over $ 250 , making this an exceptional bargain.Based on over 200 years of research and observation , Hyland 's pharmacists carefully put together this Chest by choosing the homeopathic medicines that apply to the widest range of everyday , acute illness and injury . In addition , the Chest includes a helpful reference guide to all the remedies it contains and the symptoms they address.I 've listed below the remedies included in this Chest . Note that the product name for this Chest as listed here on Amazon states there are `` 29 Pieces . '' In fact , though there are 29 different remedies included , there are 30 bottles because there are two bottles of Arnica . I have included a notation of the most common usages for each remedy .1 ACONITUM NAPELLUS | for Colds & Fevers with Sudden Onset2 ALLIUM CEPA | for Runny Nose3 ANTIMONIUM TARTARICUM | for Coughs with Mucous in Chest4 APIS MELLIFICA | for Bites , Stings & Swellings5/6 ARNICA MONTANA -LRB- 2 BOTTLES -RRB- | for Bruising & Muscle Soreness7 ARSENICUM ALBUM | for Diarrhea , Food Poisoning , Anxiety8 BELLADONNA | for Fevers & Inflammation9 BRYONIA ALBA | for Dry Cough/Arthritis Pain10 CALCAREA PHOSPHORICA | for Teething11 CANTHARIS | for Bladder Irritation12 CARBO VEGETABILIS | for Nausea and Indigestion13 CHAMOMILLA | for Teething & Irritability14 FERRUM PHOSPHORICUM | for Fevers & Inflammation15 GELSEMIUM SEMPERVIRENS | for Headaches/Flu with Muscle Pain16 HEPAR SULPHURIS CALCAREUM | for Cough & Runny Nose17 HYPERICUM PERFOLIATUM | for Nerve Injury18 IGNATIA AMARA | for Grief , Emotional Upset & Insomnia19 IPECACUANHA | for Nausea & Vomiting20 LEDUM PALUSTRE | for Bites , Stings & Minor Puncture Wounds21 MAGNESIA PHOSPHORICA | for Menstrual Cramps & Muscle Cramps of All Kinds22 MERCURIUS VIVUS | for Sore Throat23 NUX VOMICA | for Indigestion , Nausea & Hangover24 PHOSPHORUS | for Cough & Sore Throat25 PULSATILLA NIGRICANS | for Colds with Runny Nose26 RHUS TOXICODENDRON | for Arthritis Pain , Measles , Chicken Pox & Poison Ivy/Oak27 RUTA GRAVEOLENS | for Sprains & Tendonitis28 SPONGIA TOSTA | for Coughs29 SULPHUR | for Rashes & Eczema30 VERATRUM ALBUM | for Diarrhea with VomitingIf you have never used homeopathy before , it is a good idea to read at least one introductory book on the subject of using it for home health care . For example : Homeopathy
 Love this homeopathic kit ! Have already used so many of them and they are safe for babies as well . Great to have on hand . The kit however did not come in this case as shown . Came in a cardboard type of fold over box .
 This chest of Homeopathic Remedies was a real find for me ! I love the original hard plastic case , the new ones come in a flimsy cardboard container . Homeopathic remedies do not expire , so very happy to have bought this . There was an issue with the purchase , but the seller was awesome and we made it work .
 THIS IS A REAL GOOD BUY . I WAS GLAD TO GET THIS . EVERYONE WILL NEED THIS IF THINGS GET REALLY BAD IN THIS COUNTRY .
 If you are not a runner or if you do n't do cardio prepare yourself because this will make you sweat . The first time i used this it gave me and the parner of that moment a great surprise
 My hubby likes these -LRB- and I do too -RRB- because they do as they say -- delay climax , but they do n't totally make it numb , as some other brands we 've tried . If you put it on the right way -LRB- lube in -RRB- , they wo n't affect the woman . They work well for us and give us a few more minutes play time !
 This is a great tongue cleaner . Just what i wanted . It does a great job cleaning and i agree with the other reviews above . If you need one , definitely try this out !
 I must say that this is a very good tongue cleaner . I have tried many but this one is the best . My mouth never felt fresher . The beautiful attribute about this tongue cleaner is that it does n't activate the gag reflex . That is a definite plus !! All of my other tongue cleaners are going in the garbage !!
 I scrap my tongue regularly . I 've been doing it since ... I do n't know , since I was 12 ? This product is very effective at helping me keep my tongue clean . Believe me , tongue scraping really works . My last tongue scraper broke , and I had to go a few weeks without scraping my tongue . My breathe started smelling foul after shorter periods of time ! Cuh-raaaaaaaazy ! Good stuff ! This is a fairly good price . This is the best tongue scraper I 've ever used !
 Easy to use . Easy to swallow . Following your doctor 's advice before using vitamins and supplements is always the safest bet .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- .

 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I found this product by accident . I was looking for something I could give my dog for her arthritis pain and Cerecomp came up on Amazon 's ` people who bought Heel Zeel also bought ... ' list of products.I always had a very good memory and never had any trouble focusing but over the last 6-8 months or so , I noticed that it was getting harder and harder to remember names or songs , concentrate at work , even remember to do simple things I 've done every day for years . Some friends told me it was probably hormones/perimenopause and there was n't much I could do about it unless I wanted to find an endocrinologist and see if he 'd prescribe hormones . Other friends wrote it off as the effect of long term stress . Well , I do n't really want to start taking hormones and I have n't been able to figure out how to live stress free so when I saw the Cerecomp write-ups , I figured it was worth a try.It took about 5 days , taking 2 per day , before I really noticed a difference . I 've been taking it about 3 months now and my memory is almost as good as it was several years ago and I 'm able to concentrate for hours at a time again . My husband has even noticed the improvement and has started taking it , too . I 've had no negative side effects at all . I never thought it would work as well as it has -- it 's made a huge difference in my quality of life .
 This product comes highly recommended by a coupleof my Dr. friends . They use it in their practice , and saidthey had received favorable reports from patients .
 This is a product that we are having more trouble finding . NONE of the replacement creams that Johnson & Johnson make work as good as this one and I believe that they have stop producing it . WHAT A SHAME . It is the ONLY cream that helps heal the cracks on hands .
 We used to use Desitin . Then we switched to this because it does n't have any fragrances in it . Hooray ! Dollar General sells it . You can email Johnson and Johnson and they 'll send you a list of all the stores around you that sell it-that 's what I did !
 A friend recommended 3-in-1 for age spots . Doubtful , I rubbed 3-in-1 on my arms , which have many `` age spots '' . In about a week , I noticed , as did several co-workers , that the age spots were indeed lighter . They are not gone , but are definitely lighter . And with the zinc oxide , it made for a good sun block , too . Very disappointed that I can not find it at any local stores , so I 'm stocking up . Thanks , Amazon , for carrying this product .
 This is the best diaper rash cream that you could invest in . It has taken care of any rash my son got within 3 days . Unfortunately most stores have stopped selling it .
 This diaper cream is great . It 's fragrance free . It 's white so you can see where it 's been applied . And it does the trick in preventing diaper rash . I 've used it for both of my kids and it 's been very effective . This diaper cream used to be cheaper and a lot easier to find -LRB- Target carried it -RRB- ; even though the price has gone up and I have to search for it , I continue to seek it out . -LSB- If ever a touch of rash does appear , I use Aquaphor -LRB- another great product -RRB- on the affected area and then coat the entire diaper area in diaper cream . -RSB-
 has lanolin to help heal the skin as well as zinc oxide . Better than butt paste .
 THIS IS THE BEST STUFF I 'VE EVER USED . I HAVE USED ALL THE NAME BRAND ONES AND NONE OF THEM WORK ON MY CHILD LIKE JOHNSON 'S . MY DAUGHTER IS 16 MONTHS OLD AND HAS HAD ONLY 1 DIAPER RASH AND JOHNSON 'S HEALED IT WHEN OTHERS DID N'T .
 While not delivering on a super close shave , the Merkur Classic has the advantage of gliding across beard without tugging . 4 stars for it 's smoothness .
 I like shiny metal objects that are built with care . This is certainly one of them .
 This is my first safety razor . I have found it easy to use and of good quality .
 I ordered this razor because of all the positive reviews , got it a while back and I love using it , But after I placed my order Amazon suggested to me the `` Murker 180 long handle '' which does n't seem to be that much different but $ 10 less . All of the pictures of the long handle seem about right as far as height but I really ca n't tell . The classic I ordered is n't too short . I wish someone would have posted pictures of the two side by side and give a reason as to why one is better then the other or If it even matters . Could have saved me some time and money . Also it seems like the `` Long Handle '' would cost more then the `` Classic '' because more material is used and its more of a specialty item but that is not the case , makes you wonder if the $ 40 price is inflated some.This is the one I orderedMerkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor , StraightThis is the `` Murker 180 Long Handle `` Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor
 This was my first safety razor , and it 's still my favourite . I do n't have a very thick beard mind , so I did not miss the feathered edges that some of the others have . What really sets this razor apart from the others though is its handle . Octagonal in shape , this one is very easy to hold onto , and you wo n't likely slip while your fingers are soaked during your daily wet-shave . Beyond the practical matters of control and comfortability , this razor just looks like something out of an antique shop , class all the way.No , it is n't a family heirloom , but it might become one after you 've experienced a fine shave with such a fine-looking and comfortable razor .
 I started using this Razor in July with a wet shave and loved it . It was my first `` real '' razor -LRB- non-cartridge -RRB- and the hype matched the results . The razor provides an irritation free shave and has only caused two minor cuts ... to be fair , I caused the cuts by speed shaving . Neither of the cuts were serious , about equivalent to a paper cut.The inspiration for this review was the fact that I have a gillete razor at work for emergency shaving . Well , I had an important meeting earlier and had forgotten to shave this morning so I pulled out my shaving cream/razor and went to shave in the bathroom . It felt like the brand new blade was pulling the hairs , not cutting them . My face is still itching and I regret trading a quick cosmetic improvement for my face 's comfort.Give a real razor a shot and you will never go back . I promise . ------- Pros1 . Short handle but good heft .2 . Easy to transport .3 . Quality materials and well crafted.Cons1 . No included accessories -LRB- carrying case , stand , etc. . -RRB-
 I was a bit spectacular about this razors . I looked at all reviews on amazon on all the razors and come to find out that the Merkur model is the best razor . I was getting tired of the buying new razor blades for my Gillette Fusion at a high price . So I figured I 'll give the Merkur razor a try and order it a week ago . As it arrived I was a bit shock how small the device was . I tried the razor immediately and wow did I feel the difference between my Fusion and the Merkur.The only downside is that you have to patients with razor . You may cut yourself if your not careful with this classic razor , but its expected to take your time . I would highly recommend this or any Merkur model razor to anyone . If your still wondering about getting this , watch some videos on YouTube to see if its right for you .
 Switched to a double edge -LRB- `` DE '' -RRB- razor after becoming fed up with the high price and inconsistent quality of cartridge-style razors from Gillete -LRB- the Atra , Sensor , etc. -RRB- . I chose the Merkur based its simple construction and favorable user comments . I have been using this razor for about eight weeks and my first impressions are positive.The razor itself is of very high quality . You will feel the difference the second you pick it up . The Merkur 's two-piece design is simple to open and it holds the blade evenly . I 've yet to encounter any trouble changing blades , even when half-asleep in the early morning . The blade is perfectly aligned every time . The guard is sized well and is very forgiving if you get impatient.The shave quality is good , but temper your expectations . You 're still shaving the same face , merely using a different tool for the job . Your choice of blade and shaving cream or soap will have more to do with the quality of your shave than the razor itself -LRB- Derby Extra blades are my favorite -RRB- . I have not experienced a single ingrown hair since switching to a DE kit.Overall , I am happy with this razor . It does a fine job of holding the blade and is easy to handle . When used with a quality blade and proper shave soap it will give you a shave closer than that of a 2/3/4 / 5-blade cartridge razor .
 First the razor
 I am brand-new to DE shaving . I 've used this razor for a week and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience . Be sure to do your research on Badger & Blade as well as the YouTube videos from mantic59 and you will be fine .
 I 've been using this razor for about a year and a half . This is the same razor as the 34C -LRB- not sure why they use two model numbers for the same razor -RRB- . When I first started shaving in the 1970 's I used a Gillette adjustable safety razor . When I went off to college I was given a Gillette cartridge razor and was told this was `` new and better '' . It 's too bad that it 's taken me all these years to figure out that the `` old '' safety razors are better in virtually all respects to the `` modern '' expensive cartridge razors.A few things to keep in mind . After using something like a Mach 3 , switching to the Merkur HD will take a week or so to get used to . You must be more careful using a classic razor as it is easier to cut your face by accident . However , with a little bit of practice you will get shaves so close you wo n't believe it 's possible with this circa 1904 technology . Trust me , it 's true . You will get the best shave of your life.Here are some tips . Use a good razor blade . I recommend the `` Derby Extra '' . They are very , very good ; not too aggressive , just right . I find that one out of 40 blades or thereabouts I get a lousy shave . Probably a manufacturing glitch . Each blade lasts me about 6 shaves . You can buy a pack of 100 blades for about $ 14 or $ 15 on Amazon.com . So your total cost in blades for a whole year is about $ 7 to $ 8 . Also , buy yourself a good `` super badger '' shaving brush and some Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream . After you finish shaving rinse your face with cold water and finish by running an Alum Block -LRB- Bloc Osma is great -RRB- on your face . After a month or so of using these products your skin will look fantastic .
 I have always been a wet shaver and enjoy the process of lathering up with a good badger brush . It has irked me for a long time to have to team the scuttle , brush and soap with a piece of modern plastic . I was delighted to find that traditional double-edge razors were still in production and purchased this model from Merkur.I was expecting that I would sacrifice closeness and comfort for the stylishness of using this classic but am delighted to report that I sacrificed nothing in making this step back in time . This razor rivals , and in my opinion exceeds , the efficiency of modern multi-blade razors.Yes , it is safe ! I have nicked myself less -LRB- actually zero times so far -RRB- with this beautiful instrument than with anything else I have tried.Bravo Merkur !
 Nice weight , looks good . When I took it out of its box , I could immediately tell I was holding a tool that was made with pride . The finish was beautiful , everything fit precisely together . Think of going to wall-mart and buying a knockoff tool , and then comparing that same tool to a craftsman or other reputable tool maker . You can tell the difference by sight/weight/balance and feel . I also own a parker 22r gunmetal finish butterfly safety razor - I recommend the merkur . It gives a much smoother , less aggressive shave . I learned Merkur is owned by Dovo - a reputable straight razor company located in Solingen , Germany known as the `` city of blades . '' They have stringent quality control and a product can only be marked with the `` Solingen '' name if it meets the criteria for quality set by the government . This merkur razor is branded Solingen . You wo n't be disappointed with this product . ** Note
 Down right the best razor I could have purchased . Before purchasing the Merkur DE I was getting razor burn from the multi-blade cartridges . I tried everything , pre-shave ointments , steaming , creams , gels , different shaving lubricants , I mean everything . Finally I got fed up with having horrible razor burn and ingrown hairs , especially on my neck . I was originally going to go with a straight edged cut throat razor but the more research I did the more I wanted to purchase a Double Edge . I kept looking and this was the razor of choice . I use it with `` Derby Extra '' Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades and its the more comfortable shave I can get . Still perfecting shaving against the grain and not just pulling the hair out but I 'll get there . The only con I can think of is the time it takes to learn to use a DE and the fact that I do have to shave a little more regularly since it does n't pull the hair and then cut it like the multi-blade cartridges do . All in all more then I could have asked for , have n't had any razor burn yet . And how can you beat 5 + shaves with a $ 0.20 blade !
 My first safety razor , it has exceeded my expectations . I 've used electric and all of the multi-blade versions over the years , but never got as close a shave with so little irritation . There is a little more technique involved using this razor , but the results are worth it . For a simple device , it has a feel of substance and quality .
 I 've read some great things about safety razors . Read a ton of reviews . Everybody points to the Merkur as the top dog . I 've used 2,3,5 bladed razors . Shave creams , gels , oils ... . This razor has a small learning curve . Normally I have a heavy beard shadow by 11am , but with this I am baby smooth through the day , no irritation , just soft skin . I bought the merkur blades as well - though I have n't tried others . I would also recommend Proraso shaving cream from florence italy . You can find that on Amazon as well .
 This was my first DE safety razor . I have fallen in love with it . The grip is steady , even with damp hands and the weight of the razor does all the work for you.There is a slight learning curve . And I nicked myself a couple of times the first time . But each time was drastically easier than the last . Now , I get near perfect shaves every time.What once was my most hated and dreaded of chores is now one of my favorite hobbies . And my girlfriend likes kissing me again.But remember , the actual blades are just as-if not more-important to make sure you get the smooth , steady shave you are looking for .
 After decades of use with my old Merkur razor , I checked to see if this razor is still being made . Imagine my surprise when I found it on this site ! I bought the same , identical replacement razor , which should tell you how much I believe in this razor . I expect to get the same decades of use . It 's built solid -LRB- it 's all metal construction gives it more weight than those plastic disposable razors I take with me on trips -RRB- , still has that great easy surface grip handle , and with the Mekur blade is a joy to use . I always get clean shaves without any nicks -LRB- what would you expect after years of practice ? -RRB- .
 This was my first safety razor , and it 's still my favourite . I do n't have a very thick beard mind , so I did not miss the feathered edges that some of the others have . What really sets this razor apart from the others though is its handle . Octagonal in shape , this one is very easy to hold onto , and you wo n't likely slip while your fingers are soaked during your daily wet-shave . Beyond the practical matters of control and comfortability , this razor just looks like something out of an antique shop , class all the way.No , it is n't a family heirloom , but it might become one after you 've experienced a fine shave with such a fine-looking and comfortable razor .
 Hundredth review right now on this product ! Cool!Merkur 178 and 34C is the same razor . It 's just different codes by who is selling the razor.This Merkur is very nice . The grip is wonderful and the razor length is kinda small and old school which is what attracted me in the first place . Bought this 4 months ago . Traded off and on with an Edwin Jager which my last review . The Edwin has nice plating and appearance . I prefer this shorter razor though . Not sure why . I 've used 3 blades with it
 Many decades ago in the USA streetcar tracks were ripped out in cities all across the country and replaced with buses . And it was called `` progress . '' What actually happened in these cities was that the public officials were bribed , excuse me , enticed , by the manufacturers of buses , tires and producers of gasoline to scrap all street cars and trollies and enter the 20th century . The product that replaced the street car was actually inferior . Same for the DE razor
 This classic way of shaving has been a perfect . And this safety razor is godsend . Good weight , manufactured to last , and give good clean shave.I 've saved a TON off $ $ $ . I 've also reduced razor burn . And it is the best shave I 've ever had.The disposable razor industry sold us a bill of good . Grandpa had it right all along !
 First and only double edged razor I own . It has a nice weight and feel to it . Looks great too
 I switched to a single edge safety razor a few months back and never looked back . For someone like me , whose beard grain swirls all over the place the single edge razor is much more effective and does n't irritate my face nearly as much .
 Ive had this bad boy for 3 years now , its not going anywhere , blades are super cheap and environmentally this is a more responsible option than your standard supermarket options .
 In an effort to save money I started into the DE razor market . This is one of my first . I really like it . Well balanced and really good shave . Now I own several DE 's . Ok about 10 or so . Do n't judge me .
 I love this razor super close shave , just have to be carful , do n't apply pressure just let the weight of the razor do the job . Please at the office has stopped to ask me who do i get suck a clean shave . Give it a try you wont regret it . It also saves you money and is better for the environment .
 I 've been using electrics exclusively for the past 7-8 years , until recently my wife has gotten into couponing , and she picked me up a Gillette Fusion something-or-other for next to nothing , so I decided to give it whirl . Well , that got me interested in wet shaving , which went out of popular style well before I was even conceived . After much deliberation , I went with this Merkur and some Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Soap . I just received the package a few hours ago and tried it out - Amazing shave ! Yes , I cut myself maybe three times on the middle of my neck -LRB- where my beard is thickest -RRB- which is nothing compared to the fifteen cuts I got with the Fusion the other day . This razor and wet shaving all-together have introduced me to the `` lost art '' of shaving . Also , the included Merkur blade is intensely sharp , but not too sharp as to not allow for a second pass against the grain -LRB- where I cut myself , lol -RRB- . It was a bit smaller than I expected , but I warmed up to it quickly . All-in-all , this is a fantastic razor and the best shave I 've ever had .
 This is an awesome shaver ! I 'm new to the true `` wet shaving '' process , and am hooked . I 've been spending tons on the latest multi blade refills for years , roughly 2-3 bucks a refill !!! You 'll need to commit to some time ... . my first shave took me almost 10 minutes and I had several nics -LRB- this is more about my inexperience , and less about the shaver/blade ! -RRB- The shaver has a nice balance and is easy to handle . I highly recommend it . Get a good badger hair shave brush and soap for the total experience ! After shave is a must , and a good moisturizer afterwords makes you feel like you just left the barber shop . You can keep your Gilette Mach 24 vibrating , moisturizing , battery operated , turbo charged , multi-colored , shaver with replacement blades that cost more than a happy hour beer ! I 'm going old school ... and this is a great shaver to do it with ! Wait til the first time your lady friend feels the new shave and comments on your smoothness ... . you 'll be hooked too !
 This is the razor of choice . Good German Engineering apparently applies to their razors also . The Merkur DE Safety razor does a good job of holding the blade in place for a wet shave . Have used it for nearly 6 months now and no complaints here .
 this is the razor you should start with if you 're new to double edge shaving . an inexpensive pack of merkur razors , and some good shave soap.a thing newcomers may find our quickly is that this razor absolutely devours facial hair . dont press down as you would a mach three , or disposable , as you 're working with the sheer face of a real razor against your skin . i havent found a beard thick enough to clog it yet.blades are remarkably inexpensive , and extremely sharp !
 I am please with this razor . It is a good travel size and always delivers a good clean shave . It arrived in excellent shape in aprompt time frame .
 If you are sick of razor bump and paying wayyyy too much for mach 3 blades , then this is right for you . I bought this as my first blade to get me into wet shaving and must say I am VERY happy with my purchase . I highly recommend this as a good start for a safety razor !
 Simple to use . Solidly built . Hefty in the hand . No gimmicks . No BS . Just a great razor .
 Just finished my first shave with this razor and no cuts , no razor burn , and the closest smoothest shave I 've ever had.Granted , you have to pay a little bit more attention to what you are doing with this razor - also , you have to do it right with a badger brush and shaving soap -LRB- I used the $ 13 badger brush form Amazon and Col. conk 's shaving soap -RRB- . It 's all about patience - short , careful strokes with almost no pressure -LRB- let the weight of the razor do the work -RRB- and after the first pass , re-lather and make a second pass.It took me a little bit longer to shave , but this is easily the best shave I 've ever had - it beats my Norelco Reflex to shreds , and is also better than the venerable Gilette Mach 3 . I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone wanting a better shaving experience . But you just have to remember to be careful and go slowly . If you want to rush through shaving and just get it over with then stick with an electric that ca n't take your face off like this thing can : - -RRB-
 Being 25 years old and far from financially wealthy , I became sick of paying so much for cartridge blades and looked into my grandpa 's way of shaving . After reading lots of reviews , I went with the Merkur Classic as my first safety razor and could n't be happier.First off , there 's definitely a learning curve . I was hasty and impatient and the first couple weeks of shaving -LRB- I 'm not that hairy of a guy , I only need to shave every other day -RRB- were a bit dreadful . If you buy this razor , I really encourage you to take a few minutes to study the direction that your hairs grow . I now make about two passes following the grain , then go back for one or two more passes against it . I 'm also using a badger hair brush -LRB- $ 25 -RRB- and some shaving cream that I found at Bath & Body Works -LRB- It 's in a green tube , cost about $ 10 for enough to last seemingly forever , and it works great ! -RRB- Be warned that these will take more time to shave with . Whereas I could shave with my old Mach 3 in about 5 minutes , I now set aside about 20 . However , the closeness of the shave , the reduced irritation , and the warm badger hair brush definitely make it worth the extra time.Happy shaving !
 I just got a Merkur razor for Christmas and I had a great first shave with it . I am really impressed with the shave . As others have said , you want to apply light pressure and make multiple passes . I would also like to add that I do n't normally shave upside down , but did with this razor and got a very close shave . I did not cut myself and found it to be easy to learn to shave with . I would recommend this razor and am throwing out my disposables .
 The Merkur classic 178 is my first safety razor . My father turned me onto double edged razor shaving , and once again , the old man proves wise . I read the reviews before ordering this model , and the only negative ones that I read had to do with it 's length . Granted , it is short , but the length provides accuracy I believe . The weight of this instrument is great in the hand , and the build is impeccable . The German 's really know how to craft a piece of steel , and I doubt it will ever wear out . Upon my first shave with this razor I was a little skeptical that I would be able to get a `` barber '' style shave with it , being an absolute novice with the handling of it . For the most part , I just let it slide , with it 's own weight on my face and the rest is history . I went with the grain of the whiskers first , reapplied some shaving soap , with a boar brush , and then against the grain for the second pass . Wow , how close and clean this razor performs !! It takes almost no effort at all to be honest . It does take a little more time though . I will never go back to the disposable , plastic monstrosities that are on the market today . The Merkur products are very cost effective , long lasting , and well made , plus the razor blades costs about 1.7 cents a piece . Much cheaper than the cartridge type . Buy this razor , you will thank yourself ...
 Decided to put this razor in my cabinet after getting tired of paying to much for cartidges that I do n't think are giving me as close a shave . The handle on this model was a little shorter than I anticipated so if I had to make the purchase again I think I would go for the model with the longer handle .
 The handle could be a bit longer , but this razor is absolutely wonderful . Very well made with durable construction and should last a lifetime or even longer .
 My boyfriend had this razor and occasionally I would use it when I 'd stay at his place . I absolutely fell in love with it . I know it 's a guys razor , but given that I 'm a woman and as a woman , you basically shave everything , I was getting tired of razors that did n't shave as smooth as they should ... oh plus the fact I 'd have to replace the razors that are made for women , whether it 's paying $ 30 for a new razor head , or just buying a new razor all together . Anyway , I decided to buy one for myself and I will never go back to cheap , disposable , plastic razors ever again . The benefit with this is that it 's heavy and you can change out the blade , which means it cuts close -LRB- which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how steady your hand is -RRB- and it shaves as smooth as fresh as the first time , every time -LRB- because you can change out the razor blades which come in huge packs at once for a reasonable price -RRB- . This razor was worth every penny and I use it to shave everything - just be careful because it is so sharp and heavy , if you are n't paying attention it is easier to nick yourself than with plastic razors . Either way , I would gladly recommend this razor to any friend , guy or girl . It 's so worth it - the feel , the positive results , the endless supplies of razor blades you can purchase aside from this , and the fact that it is just cool looking . Nice product indeed .
 If you want a new shaver to pass to your grandchildren , this is a great choice . Wet shaving with a single blade is not a lost art . These new crazy razers with 12 blades are just a bad joke.Want a smooth shave that wo n't take off your face ? Try a single blade , with a decent brush & soap . You wo n't go back to the goop in a can , and a face remover.HPS
 This razor is great . I have tried many shaving systems and nothing beats this . It can shave extremely close . It is very comfortable . And it is cheap to use . My electronic razor is a disappointment compared to this . This is one luxuries razor that Gillett ca n't beat .
 I 've owned this razor for 6 months now and am very pleased with it . To be honest , my main motivation was the sticker shock of dropping a pack of modern , 3 bladed cartridges into my shopping cart . `` $ 20-odd bucks for blades ??? What a con . There are machines out there stamping these out by the thousand a hour '' . Men have been shaving for hundreds of years and they did n't need to shell out that kind of money . Harken back to the days of ` Mad Men ' etc , no Quators for them and they got by ok.To be honest , it does not shave as close as the modern cartridges , so technology has moved on . I ` feel ' some stubble growing back the next day , but since I have a fairly slow beard growth rate and only shave twice a week anyway it is not an issue . I did switch up to a cream-in-a-squeezy-bottle type shaving foam instead of a spray can , but skipped the badger hair brush etc. . It DOES take a little longer to shave with it as you ca n't just whip it about your face , but after a couple of goes you get the feel for it.My -LRB- old school -RRB- barber was interested in my change , so I brought it in to show him the next haircut I had . He said the Merkur blades were the best out there . I did see one comment about others being better , but I can not comment on that as I have only used the German ones.I like the heft of the razor and the build quality . I was surprised it was so reasonably priced , I was expecting to pay more . I also feel smug when out shopping and look at the prices of modern razors blades . Pack of 10 is less than $ 6 and I am only on my third blade . I figure it will pay for itself several times over it 's lifespan . So long suckers .
 This razor has a small but important learning curve . If you 're used to using something like a Mach 3 -LRB- as that was my first wet shave razor -RRB- or any of the multi-blades this will take some getting used to . Small easy strokes with absolutely no pressure except by the weight of this razor are the way to go . Do one stroke with one side , another stroke with the other then rense . One pass with the grain for most is the way to go but if you desire a closer shave then I suggest re-lather , -LRB- which is important for wetshaving -RRB- and lightly shave across , not against the grain . For those wanting a good shave , you will have to spend a little more time than using the multiblade razors . I suggest a badger hair brush with some traditional shave cream or soap like Geo F. Trumpers or Trufitt or Taylor of Old Bond Street . Plan on no less than five minutes for a good close shave from the start of lathering to toweling off . I also suggest a skin food from Trumpers or some preshave oil from The Art of Shaving that will help the razor glide . I enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade and I think any user who will take the time to learn to use it will to . If you 're constantly in a hurry to shave and be on your way , I do n't suggest using this razor or any other double edge or straight razor for that matter .
 You can hardly do better than a non-adjustible safety razor made by Merkur if you 're just starting out . The only one that might be a better choice is the `` hefty '' variant of the Classic , but it costs a bit more , too.I 've been shaving with this razor for a year now and I really love it . Remember
 After 15 years of shaving with Mach3 or its predecessors , I decided to give double-edged razors a try . The results are so much better ! You have to be careful the first times , as there is a tendency to apply too much pressure when you 're used to M3 . Since I started using this Merkur , six months ago , I have n't had ingrown hairs , and when I get nicks , they 're much smaller and cleaner than those produced by multi-blade cartridges.The proof of the pudding for me is how painless it is to shave long growth with a double edge razor . If you 've tried to shave a 7 day growth with a Mach3 , you know what I 'm talking about!A related recommendation is that you use real shaving soap or cream , not canned foam .
 Because they 're not worth the money.First of all , to clear away any confusion , the # 178 is the same razor as the 34c and the HD Classic/Hefty Classic . Like many people I did a lot of research before deciding to upgrade to using a double edged -LRB- DE -RRB- safety razor . I 've used every single type of mass-market plastic razor , from single blade to five blade , none of them remotely compares to the Merkur in terms of functionality , aesthetics , or price . Many people who use DE razors buy shaving brushes and various products , which tend to intimidate people due to the time , expense , and technique necessary to use them . These products are n't necessary , but they do add significantly to the pleasure of shaving . Just like with cheap plastic razors , I usually lather with plain soap in the shower and shave quickly . You do not press down when you shave , you let the razor glide across your skin while slightly changing the angle you hold it . This allows you to race across your face with practice . I can also shave without fear of irritation or ingrown hairs , allowing me to do the unthinkable
 I shaved for 20 years with multi-blade razors and their ilk , and it was a huge waste . How did we ever get so brain-washed by Gillette ? Their only advantage is that they make it almost impossible to cut yourself , and let you fly over chin and jaw without slowing down , but they do so by giving you a much duller blade and a worse shave.I have tough stubble
 Do you remember the first time that you shaved with a Mach 3 Turbo ? You were young , perhaps , and the hair on your face was effeminate and soft . As you slid the cartridge-razor over your youthful , silken face , the hair just seemed to glide away with the razor and you were very happy with that . But as the years went on and your facial hair became the thick forest of black cable that you currently have to fight off with a weedeater to remove , that Mach 3 Turbo slowly lost your faith . Perhaps you 've even tried to convert to some other brand , hoping that even more razors crammed into a piece of plastic would do the trick.Not so.Your first shave with this simple , single-blade , stainless steel safety razor from Merkur will not be easy . But it will change your life . Where you may have been forced to use pressure to hold the cartridge-razors of your youth close enough to your skin to actually give you a clean cut , this blade is not some pair of safety scissors - the mere weight of the metal on your skin is enough to close in on even the deepest of furs.Gentlemen , do your adult-face a favor and dump those sissy cartridges . You 're a man now , so why not use a man 's razor ?
 Ladies like this razor too ! I feel a bit odd writing this review about a traditionally men 's product but I feel compelled to praise this excellent razor . I use this razor to shave my legs and I concur with many of the remarks made by the gentlemen . It gives a close and long lasting shave . There is a learning curve but I have never cut myself once in two years of use . Mainly because I just use the weight of the razor and I do n't apply pressure . I can not say that about the many disposable and cartridge razors I have used over the years , too many cuts to count . In addition , the blades are quite long lasting . Yes , the expense is upfront but the razor is well made and I fully expect it to last a lifetime.I decided to try the Merkur after being rather less than thrilled with the `` modern '' razors and the cost of replacement blades has gotten absolutely absurd ! If you are using the higher end razors and cartridges as I was , switch to the Merkur , you will break even in a year or less and be ahead the game for the rest of your life.My husband has used this type of razor for twenty-five years and says that there is nothing better . Judging by his face and my legs , I agree .
 It took me two weeks to finally learn how to properly shave with this razor . I am not going to go over the finer points of dividing your face into zones for different angles and hair growth patterns , keeping plenty of lather on your face , etc. . You can get a book or read plenty of stuff on the internet . Just Google for `` shaving with a safety razor '' . I will just say that my experience with this razor has been very , very positive once I somewhat mastered the technique.But if you are going to buy this , I recommend you also get these things :1 . I recommend you get some good shaving cream . Shaving cream is a little easier to work into thick lather compared to shaving soap . I use Proraso , but there are plenty of other high quality shaving creams .2 . A good shaving brush -LRB- Kingsley is the brand I bought , genuine badger hair for a reasonable amount of money -RRB- . You can get cheaper brushes at CVS or Walmart , but they are not going to be near as soft as a quality badger hair brush .3 . A box of at least 10 more spare blades . Each blade lasts me about 1 week . The razor will typically come with a Merkur `` test '' blade . So if you use that one to start with , I suggest you continue on for a while with the same brand . You do n't want to be switching brands of blades too often -- blades are a little different . So get some Merkur spares for starters . If you choose a different brand , I suggest you do n't put in the `` test '' blade and just start using the other brand from the get go.That 's a bare minimum of what you will need . A few other things wo n't go amiss :1 . A shaving stand is nice and pretty , and it keeps everything organized and allows your brush to dry well .2 . A shaving bowl . Some people like to create lather in a bowl and then apply it to their beard . I like to create lather on my beard itself . But I still need a place to put my wet brush down , so a bowl works nicely . You can get a special shaving bowl , but a small ceramic cereal bowl or even a cup works just as well . Do n't get anything metal . Metal transfers the heat too well ... you do n't want cold lather on your face , trust me .3 . A good aftershave balm . I just use Nivea Sensitive , but I would n't mind having something with a more natural smell . A lot of people think Proraso balm is nice .4 . A styptic pen -LRB- any major drugstore will have them -RRB- . Yes , you * WILL * cut yourself the first few times , if you are switching from a `` modern '' razor . A styptic pen stops the bleeding -- instantly . Do n't get scared , you will not cut your throat from ear to ear with a * safety * razor . But you will nick yourself here and there -LRB- Adam 's Apple area , most likely -RRB- . When I bought this razor I was torn between this one and Merkur 180 -LRB- same thing , but with a longer handle -RRB- . I 'm a big guy -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' , shoe size 14 -RRB- and I typically have to get all my things slightly oversized . However , I do not regret going for the shorter handle . As much as you have to adjust for all the angles of your face , I think I would have struggled with the longer handle . Besides , you will want to hold this razor with two fingers anyway , on the very tip , so why get a longer handle ? This is not a backhoe . It needs very little effort . If you have to force it , your blade is either dull , or you are doing something very , very wrong -LRB- like cutting at a very aggressive angle -RRB- .
 I 've owned this razor for about a year now , and I 'll never go back to the triple and quadruple bladed razors that are all over the place . First of all , I no longer get the razor burn and ingrown hairs that I used to get with my old razor . I used to shave as rarely as possible , because it was such a horrible process , but this , along with a shaving brush and soap , makes me not mind it at all . I am still lazy though , so I do n't shave everyday . Which brings me to another advantage of this razor
 Like most others , I fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years , I had to buy the latest , greatest design in razors . With each new design , the blades got more and more expensive until I realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money . About a year ago , I bought a Merkur safey razor and have not regretted it . I believe it will last forever and the cost of the blades will save me a bundle . If you are a newbie to this type of razor , you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique . Then , enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket .
 I do n't really have much to say that has n't been said already . This is my first DE safety razor , and it has been great . Also , this is labeled # 178 ... it is the same as the 34C .
 Like a lot of guys I was using the Mach 3 razor before and then I switched to the vibrating six blade razor -LRB- tag line
 This is a great product for a close shave and to keep that beard neat like barber did it.M . White
 I was not in anyway dissapointed when I bought this product , in fact , I feel like I wasted so much money and effort on those Mach 3s . Shaves very well , will only nick and scratch on your first time , but from that point on it is close shave after close shave.Highly recommended .
 I have been researching wetshaving for approxiametly two months now . I ordered this razor and shaved with it using some Taylor of Bond Street avocado cream along with a vulfix brush last night for the first time . I love the feel of the razor and it makes me feel like a true gentleman . You feel distinguished using this razor but I think I 'm going to try some different blades . The merkur blades were okay but I think I want a closer shave . Overall , an excellent razor .
 I bought this after feeling the `` sting '' of paying twelve dollars for 5 of the multiblade replacements for the Gillette Sensor . I 've had the Merkur Classic and have been using it for a week now . This product is very solid , well-made and will no doubt last a lifetime . As some of the other reviewers have said , there is a learning curve to using it . The first shaves I had bad razor burn in a few spots . After learning to take my time and be more careful I discovered that the Merkur gave me the best shave I 've ever had . I do n't use a brush or shaving soap but shave wet with an almond oil-base shaving oil and it works great . The solid metal of the razor stays warm from the water while shaving creating a luxurious and relaxing shaving experience . Even better , you can find 100 `` Derby Extra '' brand replacement blades online for around $ 15 . Considering I 'm getting a week 's use per blade this is not bad for a five years supply ! I would recommend this , hands down , to anyone looking for the best shave of their life and a huge cost savings over modern multiblade razors !
 This razor is amazing . I have been using Mach 3 's the majority of my shaving lifetime and recently switched to this razor and there is a big difference . After just three shaves the skin on my neck is in much better condition then when using the Mach 3 . I no longer have any razor bumps which makes shaving easier every time . This razor also has a much closer shave and leaves a smoother finish . If you can handle the very small learning curve then this razor is for you !
 Once I started using water I had just boiled , shaving with this became a two minute pleasure with almost zero nicks . I just took an old electric kettle and put it in the bathroom . Just put the hot water in a shaving cup , dip in the brush , make your shaving foam , and use the hot water to dip your razor . Please be careful the razor and the brush are not too hot -- dip in the hot water , wait a few seconds , test it , etc. . This improved my ease of shaving with this merkur a ton . I use the derby blades , they work fine .
 I like the feel and look of the razor a lot -- it 's heavy , shiny , and the texturing on the handle looks and feels good . The handle is n't too short for my rather average-sized hands.I just used this razor to remove 3 weeks of beard -- took me 1/2 hour or so . Having done the same exercise with gilette swivel-head razors , my face feels better after the Merkur -LRB- though the shave is n't as close -- I 'm inexperienced -RRB- . The razor did n't do as well as I had hoped regarding clogging -- it still clogged when confronted with a beard . However , since there is a lot more room underneath the blade compared to common N-blade razors , I believe it can definitely cut more hair before it clogs.I was surprised to learn that when shaving off a beard , I had to push harder than expected -- plenty of advice floating around the internet says , `` Use no pressure , just let the razor 's weight do the work . '' However , that does n't work when attacking a beard .
 This is the premier shaving instrument . Do n't bother buying old Gillettes or any other brand . This is the only one to buy . Get Darby razors , Van Der Hagen glycerine -LRB- not delux ! -RRB- Shaving soap and a good badger shaving brush and you will have the perfect shave !
 I admit , I used to use those multi-bladed razors . I just did n't know any better . I came across a few articles on shaving with a safety razor and thought I would give it a shot . I love it !! Much better of a shave then the newer cartridge types !! Just take your time , rushing will lead to irritation and possibly cuts !
 I bought this razor simply because I was tired of paying high dollar for the cartridge blades . This one takes the standard DE blade . The razor has a short handle , which is ok for me , but for some guys with larger mitts they would need the long handled razor.The razor has a good solid feel and is well balanced , which is important when you are going to cut yourself , if it was n't . It may take a few tries to keep you from cutting yourself . Luckily , there is help out there . From books , to youtube videos and shaving blogs , help is at your fingertips.This razor is a nice addition to my morning routine.I look forward to using this quality razor for years to come .
 I used this razor for the first time this morning . Once with the grain and then once more after relathering . I only knicked myself once under my chin when I was going against the grain . I 'm not a master shaver or anything so I do n't know why so many people report having so much difficulty with this razor . Take your time , use a little common sense , and you should n't have a problem .
 Merkur Classic Safety Razor , Straight - # 178 - Made In GermanyFrom Kimbo 's husband
 Merkur Classic Safety Razor , Straight - # 178 - Made In GermanyI read the reviews and thought I would give it a try . My wife had complained that my beard was like sandpaper . I got a shaving brush , shaving soap , and used my Safety Razor which worked but still not thebest . Decided to order the above . I was worried about the plastic on therazor I read about , but no one else talked about it and people stated they used the razor over 20 years and it is still like new . So I said , maybe they improved the razor . The razor came in the mail and I could find no plastic or non metal part . The Merkur worked better than my old Safety Razor I have used since 1957 . This was with the same shaving brush andshaving soap . The only change was with the razor . They have the razordesign right . I did test my American razor blades against the Merkurblade and the Merkur blade did cut closer . This may be my learning curvewith the new razor . Again I am happy with Amazon reviewers and I amone too . My wife said my result is better .
 If I had all the information on how to get a good shave with a single edge that is now available on the Internet , I would probably still be using my old Schick injector instead of abandoning it many years ago . Since that item is missing , I tried the Merkur 178 to apply this new -LRB- to me -RRB- knowledge . The heavy weight and handle length make it easy to get the right angle and pressure to learn the wet shaving method . So far I have been able to learn with this one with only very minimal damage to my face .
 I really hate the multi-blade cartridge razors , and electric razors really irritate my skin . I decided to try wet-shaving using a safety razor , and after reading reviews , I went with the Merkur classic.Although a little intimidating at first , the Merkur is actually very easy to use , and provides a nice , close shave . The key is to just be patient while you shave , and to pay attention to what you 're doing . The single , straight edge makes shaping sideburns and facial hair pretty easy . Combine with a decent blade , brush , and cream , and you 're on your way . I bought the inexpensive Tweezerman brush , Tom 's of Maine cream , and the Derby blades , and I 'm very happy .
 The most basic razor ended up becoming my favorite . I have yet to use my contemporary five razor over this one . Try it and you will not be disappointed .
 It 's funny , but the older I got , the more retro I started getting ; at least with shaving . Classic old time double edge blade razors like this one give a much better shave than the current trend of adding more and more blades to -LRB- expensive -RRB- replacement cartridges . The last time I bought a pack and finally realized they ran around $ 2 a cartridge I got out my grandfather 's old double edge and found it gave just as good a shave . I decided to invest in the Merkur Classic -LRB- more finally crafted than grandpa 's shaver -RRB- and have been extremely happy with the results . The initial cost may be more , but you will save money in the long run.Be sure to get good blades . Merkur 's stainless steel blades work well . They are still 1/4 the price of the Mach 3 .
 Just buy it guys . If you like a quality shave most days of the week then go for it . I switched months ago for a multitude of reasons . Firstly the blades cost dramaticaly less and are of a higher quality than most disposable multibladed cartridges . Secondly , the closness that can be safely achieved means less irritation , thus , less burn and ingrown hairs . Lastly , there is the style element . What a remarkably sturdy , all metal , durable peice of workmanship . Combined with a standard pure bristle brush and a glycerin soap -LRB- having the added bonus of not smelling like a deoderant , unlike can gel -RRB- , this method of ` old school ' shaving exfoliates and wakens you up in the morning . Additionaly , unless you have a face that bares a remarkable resemblance to the surface of the moon - I.E. pitted , then there are no more cuts than with 3 or 4 blade razors .
 First things first , this is really the Merkur 34C also known as the Merkur HD -LRB- Heavy Duty -RRB- . The 178 is just a number that the distributor gave it.As they say , `` Good things come in small packages '' . It 's small safety razor -LRB- roughly 3 '' tall -RRB- , with excellent weight and balance . It 's a three piece , and you must unscrew it to replace blades . It was recommended to me as a not very aggressive safety razor that you 'll be able to learn how to wet shave with much easier . Overall a very popular safety razor that does what it 's suppose to do perfectly .
 I received my razor today and tried it out a few hours ago . I have been using the Gillette razors for years and only recently discovered this whole world of `` classic shaving '' . I started out with a single edge Gem razor I found in an antique shop . They no longer make single edge razors , but you can occasionally find the blades . I just had too hard of a time finding blades for it , so I decided to try the Merkur double edge razor because it was highly recommended in several online reviews . I also ordered some Derby extra blades to use with this razor.After lathering up and assembling the razor with one of the Derby Extra blades , I had a very smooth and pleasant shaving experience . I am thoroughly pleased with it . The derby blades are so sharp the whiskers offer zero resistance . It glides through them as if they are n't even there.Like other reviewers have stated , you do n't need to apply as much pressure . the blades are so incredibly sharp that all you need to do is gently `` wipe '' the lather off you face with the razor and the whiskers come off with it.Also , like other reviewers have said , this is n't for those of you in a rush . I 'd still keep a modern razor handy for those times when you are in a hurry -LRB- or a lot of bandaids and styptic pencils -RRB- . This is for those times when you want to really enjoy a great , close , careful shave . It 's like the man version of a bubble bath , a way to spoil yourself.Another advantage is that the blades cost WAY less than Gillette cartridges . I got the 100 pack of derby blades for 15 dollars . Even if I only use each blade 4 times , I will still be able to shave for over a year with 100 blades . At 15 cents per blade that beats the heck out of the Gillette cartridges.If you want to treat yourself to a luxurious , traditional shave this is the way to go .
 I do n't want to be misleading , as I never got around to actually using it , but I 'm writing the review I wished someone would have written earlier to save me some time and grief . The advertised picture on every website that sells the 178 is a little misleading ; it appears bigger than it really is.The razor arrived to my home , I giddily opened the packaging , and was rather dissapointed . The thing was weel-made , shiny and pristine , but ... well , tiny . I have medium-sized hands and the 178 was too small for them . The handle , from the bottom of the head assembly to the hilt of the handle was about 3 inches . My hand is about 4 inches at the widest part . I just wanted something more substantial , so I sent it back for a refund and ordered a 38c `` barber pole , '' which is more to my expectations and liking.The two razors have the same heads , so the only difference is the length and weight . Although I do enjoy my 38c , having shaved a couple of times with it , I can see why one would opt for the smaller 178 . Because it is smaller , I can see where the 178 may be a little more managable and agile . It seems more `` strictly business '' than the more cosmetic 38c . If you want to save some money and do n't mind the looks of the stumpy little razor hanging in your razor stand , then go for the 178 . If you want something more substantial and aesthetic , buy the 38c . You ca n't go wrong either way .
 I 've been using this razor for about 4 years now . I went from using a Mach 3 with standard shaving gel at the sink to shaving with this -LRB- usually with Gillette blades -RRB- and Shave Secret shaving oil in the shower . A few observations : * Pros : - I went from having a constant red razor burn rash on my neck to basically blemish free skin . I attribute this to GREATLY reduced irritation from shaving . I actually enjoy shaving now . This in and of itself makes this a worthy purchase in my eyes.-I can and do shave against the grain with this thing , but only after making a first pass with the grain.-Blades are incredibly cheaper . 10 blades for $ 5-10 dollars instead of 8 blades for $ 15 . They last longer as well , which makes it an even better deal . I usually get about a month out of each of my blades . * Cons : - Learning curve is a bit steeper . You have to train yourself to vary how you hold the razor to follow the curves of your face , the razor wo n't do it for you . I cut myself the first few times shaving with it . Get a good styptic pencil , and maybe some hydrocortison cream.-After 4 years of using it in the shower mostly and not drying it off before storing it head down , the chrome has started to flake a bit on the top curved portion . I did ding that part up a little by dropping it a while back , so I 'm going to say that 's mostly my fault . Still , it 's worth noting.-Don ' t go really cheap on blades . You can get a pack of 10 for around $ 3 . Do n't do it . Trust me . Your face will curse you if you do . * Bottom line
 Nice weight , looks good . When I took it out of its box , I could immediately tell I was holding a tool that was made with pride . The finish was beautiful , everything fit precisely together . Think of going to wall-mart and buying a knockoff tool , and then comparing that same tool to a craftsman or other reputable tool maker . You can tell the difference by sight/weight/balance and feel . I also purchased a parker 22r gunmetal finish butterfly safety razor - I recommend the merkur . I learned Merkur is owned by Dovo - a reputable straight razor company located in Solingen , Germany known as the `` city of blades . '' They have stringent quality control and a product can only be marked with the `` Solingen '' name if it meets the criteria for quality set by the government . This merkur razor is branded Solingen . You wo n't be disappointed with this product . ** Note
 I have been shaving with this for a few weeks now . I would NEVER go back to cartridge razors . With how expensive cartridges are I would try to make them last about 3 months . I actually got used to shaving better with a dull blade . The replacement blades for these are so inexpensive I change them every Sunday.If I did n't shave one day with my cartridge razor it would clog up the next . Not with this one . This will give a nice smooth pass every time .
 This is one of three Merkur razors I have purchased - the first one was the long-handled version of this one - I purchased for my husband . We had a small fortune invested in the Mach razors - which never really worked except for the first shave . A few minor nicks the first few times he used it , but quickly got the hang of it and it gives him a very close , non-irritating shave -LRB- we also use natural goats milk soap rather than chemical `` shaving cream '' -RRB- . Then I purchased this one -LRB- short handle -RRB- for my teenage son . He loves it , too . I also purchased the 1904 replica for myself - I figured if it worked so well for the guys , it might work great for the girls . And it does . Nice close shave without stripping my skin . Respect the razor , know the proper way to use a safety-razor and you will never want to go back to those other things again.The short-handled razors like this one are great for my small hands and my teenage son , but a man with large hands would probably prefer the long-handled razor -LRB- which is about the same length as a Mach razor -RRB- . Also , the 1904 one has `` open '' teeth whereas this one does not . To me , both types give just as close a shave - I see no difference -LRB- neither does my husband -RRB- . Perhaps those who allow their beard/hair to grow longer before they shave might find a difference .
 I 've used double edge razors once upon a time . My dad used to have an old butterfly style adjustable Gillette that I ended up with , and subsequently lost somewhere . I used it almost with a sense of nostagia more than anything , before losing it and having to go to the typical contemporary offerings -LRB- Shick Quattro -RRB- . Anyways , the sheer cost of the today 's razor cartridges finally pushed me towards revisiting this great style of razor.The Merkur is like a precision tool compared to my dad 's old gillette , and after 2 weeks of use , i can whip around my face as w / a disposable style . I definitely recommend a good-quality shave cream like Proraso or Omega shave soap . The quality of the shave easily meets or exceeds that which you would get w / one of the Quattro / Fusion styles , and with significantly less skin irritation . Note , i even use the generic drugstore double edge blades in this razor with great results ! For optimum results though , I would recommend higher-quality blades in general -LRB- still way cheaper than cartridges ! -RRB- . I enjoy the short handle of this razor - I initially purchased a long-handle Merkur classic which ultimately went to my wife for shaving her legs -LRB- another double-edge convert ! -RRB- . I really do n't think a long handle is necessary for facial shaving , even if you 're used to it from what you 've used in the past . With the shorter handle , this razor `` turns on a dime '' , and requires less pronounced hand movements or adjustments when getting the proper angle as you shave . It does take a little getting used to , because it is such a more compact package -LRB- length-wise -RRB- than a typ . disposable , but with a bigger cutting swath . The razor will pay for itself within the first year of ownership with the money saved on blades all the while delivering a top-notch , healthy , and enjoyable shave ! I 'll never go back to cartridge style .
 This was my first classic razor . I had always used the typical schick and gillette multi blade models , I tried them all . This one is so much better ! You have to be gentle , but not in a tedious or difficult way , you just have to take it easy . People and websites say that it takes more time with a classic razor , but in my experience it is about the same . Mach 3 and all those razors would leave my skin really irritated and scratched up but these kind wont irritate your skin very much at all if you do it right . You can get expensive creams but the best I have found is an ordinary can of gillette cream . Not the gel the cream ... that used with this razor will be a world of difference . Good luck !
 Took a couple times to get used to , but I actually look forward to shaving now .
 Last year I finally got fed up with paying extortion prices to Gillette . I tried an electric razor for about a month and that sucked -LRB- Braun -RRB- . So next step I decided to try wet shaving . Purchased this razor , some blades , a cheap badger brush , and some shaving cream -LRB- Taylor of Old Bond Street -RRB- . Everything has worked out great . I have a giant beard that grows quickly . I often skip a week or so of shaving and have no problem cutting it down with this setup -LRB- cuts through the beard without pulling -RRB- . Best shave I 've every gotten and I wish I 'd started this sooner.I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing all this stuff , but it has worked out great . Took about a week of shaving to get adjusted , and after that not much of a problem . Just take it slow and check out some of the sites online dedicated to wet shaving for tips.If you 're contemplating make the jump , do it ! You will save money in the long run at the expense of about 5 minutes per shave.I have dropped this razor without issue . I have used it exclusively since November 2009 . I can only compare it to the cartridge razors I used before . This has a much heavier feel . I can not compare to other safety razors though . This is the only one I 've owned , and may be the only one I 'll ever need.Only problem I have ever had was the occasional clog . Crank the water up or unscrew the bottom 1 turn and it 's gone . This is probably not normal though . As I said earlier I sometimes skip a week or two of shaving and my nick name in high school was Teen Wolf .
 I love this razor ! Have had a few others and they were build cheap . This one is well crafted and made right so you actually can shave without worrying about razor cuts all over your face .
 My son has a heavy beard . Multi blade razors keep cloging up while he 's trying to saving.I decided to buy him a quality German safety razor for his birthday . I chose the Merkur Classic by the reviews , giving this product high marks.The delivery was timely . The razor meets the expectation . It 's of good quality steel , with a hefty feel . My son is very pleased with the effortless saving experience.Considering what some multi blade razors cost , the purchase price of this quality German safety razor will be recovered in the savings , compairing the purchase price differential of safety razors vs. multi blade razors.Merkur Clasic is a life time quality razor .
 I 've used a number of shaving systems
 After reading so many positive reviews on this razor , I decided to get one and found out that I was lucky to get the Merkur HD . The # 178 is the model number given in another part of the globe . This is the same as the Merkur HD or 34c . The razor is made with precision and finesse . It is so heavy that it shaves with just its weight gliding down the face . Very sturdy and it looks all set to last a lifetime.The shaves itself are so close that some care has to be taken initially as there is a little learning curve . But it is a beautifully balanced razor . Excellent product !
 Like most guys looking into this , I 've used countless multi-blade razors over the years . They 'd throw another blade on and I 'd be in line waiting to try it out . In addition , I used -LRB- and am still using -RRB- quite nice shaving cream -- 1st Trumper almond , now Anthony Logistics -- and a badger hair brush . I thought I had it all figured out . Then I started dabbling in a goatee . The multi-blade razors did n't give me the precision I needed , and that , more than a closeness/expense of razors issue led me to try this little number out.I 'm never going back . The closeness is profound . Not only that , but there 's much less irritation . I have n't had a razor bump since switching . And , although I nicked myself once , it was ONCE and has n't happened again.There 's been a lot of talk about a `` learning curve '' and something even about utilizing a 35 degree angle or some such junk . Really , you set it on your face -LRB- very little pressure -RRB- and you make short strokes along the grain of the hair . The angle comes naturally
 Merkur is the only razor for me . I liked this one so much , I also bought the slant version . This puts my Gillette to shame . It 's well worth the cost .
 I bought this for my father . The quality and finish are great . The grip is comfortable and wo n't slip . I had never bought anything from this brand before , but now would definitely do it again .
 Okay . I have been shaving my face and head with cartridge razors for the past 4 or 5 years every day , and I finally got sick of paying 25 bucks for 4 new razor heads . I suppose like most people that have decided to take this route instead . I first wanted to try a cut-throat razor , but after reading about it a bit I learned i had to learn how to sharpen it , buy a strop for 100 bucks , and the razor itself was over 100 . I decided to try out a DE , for much less money , and the merkur series caught my eye.i read a few `` how to and why '' articles online about DE shaving before i attempted to shave . i havent cut myself with a cartridge razor since i first started shaving , but i was still a little worried after reading reviews and warnings.i had about 4 days of beard growth , i took a shower before shaving , washed my face a few times , kept my face wet , lathered up with dial bar soap -LSB- using my hands -RSB- , and had a nick free shave . afterwards i applied some nivea after shave . it seems to be much smoother and more effective than a quatro or mach 3 . i dont think ill buy another cartridge razor again.so anyway , extremely high quality product . great shave . maybe read the `` how to and why '' article at classicshaving.com , and as long as you take a couple extra minutes to shave , you shouldnt have a problem .
 Got the Merkur 178 , a badger brush and Proraso shave cream and I am not looking back.I exclusively used cartridge shavers for years and the Merkur shaving experience is a REVELATION.Good bye cartridges , forever!I think younger men have to read a few articles on '' how to shave '' then take the Merkur in hand with confidence . Sadly , too few dads and grand dads have taught us how to shave properly so discovering this type of shaving is unnecessarily scary but do n't fear , just enjoy and be giddy with the results.Now I actually look forward to shaving , thats a first for me .
 I just purchased this razor and made my first foray into old-fashioned wet shaving . I spent a good while researching the different types of razors available , and pondered long and hard on whether to get this one or Merkur 's `` Heavy Duty '' razor . I 'm glad I went with this one , as the weight of the head is just right and I got a nice , easy shave out of it the first time I tried . I prefer the shorter-handle because it encourages me to hold the razor properly and the balance feels a little better than the long-handled ones , but that 's all personal preference . On the whole , I love this razor and would buy it again in an instant ; I 'm not sure why it took me 15 years to try a DE razor , but I 'm sure glad I finally did . My Gillette Fusion ProGlide is going back into the medicine cabinet , never to return .
 After about a month shaving with the # 178 , I 've only noticed a few drawbacks : The handle is a bit short , if you 've large hands , I would suggest you consider getting the # 180 , which is the same basic no-frills design , just a longer handle . I would say I have slightly smaller than average hands for a guy , and if I had the chance to order again , I would go with the longer handle . The posture you 'll need to use the razor is a bit different than a disposable , but easy to get used to . The overall weight is good , heavier than a disposable system razor , but if you want something hefty , look for the HD models , which are a good deal heavier.Also , be sure to get a stand to hang the razor when not in use , as its generally not a great idea to have the razor 's edge so close to a hard surface , as it would be if you just laid the razor down on a counter.The # 178 has a lot of great points though : A rugged design , all stainless . Changing razors is a breeze , and with the screw down mechanism , you can feel confident the blade is not shifting , nor going anywhere . I would say that the learning curve switching from a modular disposable razor is short and easy to deal with . The available replacement blades are all generally sharper than in the disposables , but the design of the # 178 allows for some lee-way , you 're not going to cut yourself as long as you use deliberate strokes and take your time.I personally would recommend getting some Derby Extra DE blades `` Derby Extra '' Stainless Steel Double Edge Razor Blades , I find they are better than the Merkur blade that comes included , but that 's another review . Just know that there is a wide range of replacement blades , and it could mean the difference between a slightly better than average shave , and an exceptional shave .
 I started shaving in the very early 70 's . My first razor was the Gillette Techmatic -- anyone else remember these ? It used a razor strip rather than blades and one got a new surface by turning a wheel to get fresh blade surface . My father was a Gillette double-edge user while I was growing up , and I ended up with one myself . The kind that has the little hangar-type doors that open up for blade change.One problem with those -- they gum up the mechanism over time with accumulated shaving cream . I bought my Merkur in the late 70 's , found on vacation . I was fascinated by the mechanism -- so much simpler and easier to keep clean . To change blades , one simply unscrews the top surface which is attached to a long threaded screw inserted into the top of the handle . Put the new blade in , put the top on and screw down.I have used my Merkur since I was in my 20 's , and I 'm in my 50 's now . How many shaves would that be ? My razor could pass for new . Periodically I can just brush the disassembled razor parts with some dish detergent and it looks like new.I never liked the waste of either plastic-encased blade assemblies or disposable razors . Still seems like a waste when all one needs it just a new blade surface.I 'm not a blade snob . I have happily used Gillette , Merkur , Personna , Walgreen 's , Wilkinson blades . I have a relatively soft beard , not the Fred Flinstone type , but it grows fast . It 's another thing I really like about a double-edge . If you go on vacation and skip shaving a week or so it wo n't -- ca n't -- clog up like the multiblade systems . I 've ended up loaning mine to friends on camping trips when theirs ca n't cut the mustard!One of these Merkur razors is an investment , as mine proves . I am amazed when I see what replacement blades for these multiblade systems cost . I expect I 'll be using this type as long as I shave .
 After many years with the multiblade , titanium , battery powered , `` real man '' shaving systems who 's blades last 2 shaves I decided to try something new . I must admit that I 've never experienced a closer , more satisfying shave outside of an old fashioned barbershop . This is a well made razor that will last for many years . It 's simplistic design , solid construction , and quality finish is sure to make this my lifetime razor . Thank you Merkur .
 Ok , well , it 's still kind of a chore , but I do n't feel like I need to stretch my razor blade 's life -LRB- thus cutting my face -RRB- because they are so expensive anymore . Like others before me , I was fed up with paying $ 25 + for a package of razor cartridges . In fact , I was at Walmart , had Fusions in my cart and left them at the checkout when I realized it was going to cost me $ 25 for just 6 -LRB- or maybe 8 -RRB- razors ! Instead , I opted to go ahead and spend the $ 35 on the razor and $ 17 on thissample packto get started . Yes , I paid $ 50 to make the transition , but that would have been what I would have paid for 2 packages of Fusion blades that would only last at the most , 4 months . The sampler pack alone will easily last me a year given that I use one blade per week . I do have a favorite in the sampler , but I 'll wait til I 'm running low to order a year 's supply of the one I like , and that will still only cost about $ 15 . But about the razor ... This razor is exactly what I had hoped for . A solid , heavy-enough razor to use daily with inexpensive razor blades . I did some searching around the net to find a recommended razor for a newbie to DE shaving . This one came up in almost every recommendation . I 'm not a huge guy , but have bigger hands than some , and it fits perfectly in my hand and has enough weight to it that I do n't feel like I 'm going to lose control . The screw-on top secures the razor perfectly and lets me worry about my shaving skills and not about the blade coming loose . It cleans up easily and nicely and I can lay it on my counter to dry without the blade making contact and eventually dulling . This razor is built solidly and feels like it will last a very long time . The shave you ask ? Oh , well I now get a shave that my old Fusion , or even Mach 3 , could n't get close to . The learning curve for this guy , or any DE razor , is about 5-10 shaves , but once I got that down , I get a close , smooth , no-cut shave in about 6 minutes . And that 's from start -LRB- lather -RRB- to finish -LRB- rinse -RRB- . I do n't even think I could shave that close with no cuts in 10 minutes with my Fusion . I used to shave every other day -LRB- and deal with stubble on day 2 -RRB- to stretch my Fusion blades to 2 weeks , but now I shave daily with my $ 17 , one-year 's supply of razor blades.Whether your new to DE shaving , just shopping around for a new DE razor , or possibly wantiing to gift someone a razor , this is a great razor for any man . Just make sure to get some blades for him as this only comes with one Merkur blade . And if he travels a lot , it does not come with a case , so consider thisleather travel caseto secure his razor . And because this is fulfilled by Amazon , packaging is great and shipping is fast , as always .
 I really enjoy this razor and wrote a full review , complete with day by day descriptions , on my blog . You can read the full account here : http://ducksaway.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/safety-razor/Here are my main thoughts if you do n't want to read the whole thing : - There is definitely a one to two week learning curve so plan appropriately . It also takes about a week for your face to get used to the new razor so be prepared for some healthy razor burn at first.-The razor is very good , but I think some of the reviewers may be overly influenced by their desire to believe the razor is better than it really is . You can get a very good shave but it wo n't be the greatest shave in the history of man . If you have a thick and dark beard like me you may be initially disappointed after you realize you are still unable to get every single hair . When using this razor -LRB- or any razor for that matter -RRB- it 's important to recognize the limits you can achieve , otherwise you 'll find yourself taking far more passes than would be advisable , especially when the razor burn kicks in . In the end , it 's only a razor and there is only so much you can accomplish in terms of shaving.-Using soap is great and probably the best part of the process . It feels very good on your skin and is far preferable to canned shaving cream.Overall , I am very satisfied with this razor and the associated products but it 's important to be realistic and objective in your assessment when deciding whether or not a safety razor is for you .
 This is a fantastic razor . And a great beginner razor for those exploring DE wet shaving . Note this is really the Merkur 34C Heavy Duty . The # 178 is just some random number assigned by the distributor.For a great shave , unlearn your Mach3/Fusion holds . Hold the razor as if you 're holding a dart -LRB- i.e. playing darts at a bar -RRB- . Let the razors own weight do the shaving . To learn more on how to get a great shave from this razor , watch Mantic59 's series of videos on safety razor wet shaving techniques on YouTube .
 This little demon is an excellent razor for shaving especially sensitive skin.It takes about two weeks for your skin to get used to and perfect your own technique to avoid the odd nick or two.The razor is 3 '' long styled in the old gillette superspeed era.it is extremely well made and is a hefty wee bugger with the weight being a perfect balance for holding and shaving.I would also suggest shopping around as the prices vary from seller to seller.One of the secrets of using this type of razor is make sure your shaving area is well lubricated as to enhance glide this might mean you should put on pre oil , shave cream then your gel or foam.Also dont press too hard when shaving let the razor do the work a couple of passes and Bobs your uncle.Dont try and get too close like a babys bum cos you might get irritation just nice and gentle and you will really enjoy the shave you get.There are various types of DE blades on the market , ones that get good reviews include , Merkur , Derby and Feather , I use Derby and can highly rate them as very good quality.This is one of the best investments I have made when it comes to shaving and I highly recommend this Merkur razor along with quality blades.The quality of the blades you use makes a big difference in the shave you will get , rather invest in good blades.Hope review is of help .
 The tea was sent in perfect condition and in a timely manner . I will most definitely be ordering from them again and would recommend them to anyone that may be looking for these types of products .
 Ive continuously bought this brand since I 've found it my favorite chinese restaurant was serving it . It is very relaxing and caffeine free .
 I 've always loved this tea , but it 's getting harder and harder to find it in the stores so thank goodness for Amazon . It 's organic and caffeine free -LRB- in the version I bought -RRB- . I love the taste -- it 's mellow and not bitter . Perfect !
 I 've bought the exact same item at a Chinese grocery store much , much cheaper . Product is good but can get it cheaper elsewhere .
 This product worked wonders for me . My knees have given me extreme pain for over 10 years and this is the first product that helped but did not cause any stomach problems for me . I was very sad to see the price go from $ 29.21 to $ 37.81 in under six months . I will continue to use it and hopefully the price will go back down to a reasonable cost .
 Right now it is summer time , and our Arthritis is not felt much.We take it all year long . When winter comes we are not in as much pain as we use to be , and function very well.I have tried other type of Arthritis vitamins , but none has helped as much as Arth-X Platinum has.I notice the name has been changed to ActivJoint platinum , but comparing both Arth-X and this , theyare the same.I only take two aday , although it says to take more . My husband takes two aday in the summer , andsometimes 4 aday -LRB- twice a day -RRB- in the winter . We live in the mountains in Ca.get snow , and live at the beach . These are a pill , and some what large . Wish they where a capsule that are easier to take . Afterawhile you get use to them.Love this product , I would not be with out them.Keep a extra bottle in the pantry .
 The woman at the health store highly recommended but Amazon sold it for less . After 3 months my joint aches are so minimal , I forget I had an issue with them . I am very active , exercise 5 days a week , but at 50 , bones have changed and I feel this is working !!!! Highly recommend !
 I have used this product for years to help minimize joint pains from chronic osteoarthritis . While it does n't elimiante the pain , it certainly aids in removing some of the discomfort . For maximum benefit our herbalist recommends 6 tablets per day , 3 with breakfast , 3 with dinner . Amazon sells it in a the large quantity -LRB- 180 tablets -RRB- which is difficult to find in local supplement stores . In addition there is a price break with the larger size through Amazon .
 Newborns have really delicate skin , and if your 's is like my daughter , will break out very easily when washed with a harsher soap.This baby bath was great for washing body AND hair for her whole first year . Never dried her skin out ONCE.We had received other types as gifts and returned them all when we saw how her skin became dry and red when we used them on her.Super super super !! Can not say enough great things about the Aveeno baby products!I plan to use them again on my new arrival due in May .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products .

 Bought two of these to keep my scale for UPS shipping going . Use one and keep the other charged to swap out when needed . Way better then keeping a dozen batts on hand all the time.A normal battery last me one day . These , yea , last one day per charge . Perfect .
 i wish the product would have listed how many mg 's . i now have to take additional pills . i couldnt tell by the product description . otherwise all is good!after i left my review -LRB- see above -RRB- the seller called me and went out of her way to assist me . i 'm very impressed . i will buy from this vendor again .
 With five dollar shipping this would not be worth it -- but as for the product itself , i find it kinda fun if you find it for only a few cents.There are 4 red card and 4 yellow cards . Every red is the same and every yellow is the same -- so there are only 2 variations.The red card has choices like -- What
 Well shipped and packaged product , but I find that the dry cloths do not do as good of a job as the moist cleaning cloths do . Especially on sticky finger prints or food debris . And if you have a family , you know what kind of stuff gets stuck on CD 's and DVD 's !
 the item was a little slow getting here but it was well-pakaged and exactly as ordered . thank you . woud order agsj
 We spend alot of money keeping ourselves entertained with little discs . CDs , DVDs , CD-ROM , PlayStation ... so it makes sense that we want to keep all these discs working at top performance.The `` Maxell CD Cleaning Cloths '' are a safe -LRB- lint-free and non-abrasive -RRB- , easy and econimcal way to keep them dirt and smudge free , insuring a better quality playback.One gentle wipe of your disc may help to eliminate mistracks or sound distortion.The price here , for the quanity is the best I have found . I was paying much more by buying them at my local video store.Although , Amazon 's price at this time is just a little higher than some of the merchants here , but when you consider there is free shipping from Amazon , it works out pretty good.And ... Do n't forget about the CD and DVD players themselves ... cleaning the lenses occassionally also helps to improve perfomance . I use and recommend the Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens Cleaner . It does a good job , is reusable , performs optimazation tests -LRB- that checks your system -RRB- , and is a very reasonable price as well.So throw these in your cart , the next time you need just that little extra for the free shipping . . and do n't forget ... always clean your CDs in an outward motion starting from the center -LRB- never circular -RRB- reviewer update 3/1/11 - These cloths no longer offered direct by Amamzon , can still be found by checking the outside sellers - see upper right on product detail page - to see which ones are now `` fulfilled by Amazon '' and therefore are eligible for the free shipping option with qualifying amount total -LRB- $ 25.00 at this time -RRB- Go for it ...

 I am not sure if I will buy these again , but they do work well . Hard to get the first cloth started .
 I get dvd 's from the library and I found these wipes work great on them . They get off all the smudges from frequent handling . I have found that thoroughly cleaning a dvd prevents a lot of skipping during play .
 Amazing product . The cd becomes clean and new like almost immediately . Great product
 This is the best idea to wipe off all those CDs and DVDs.Easy and will not scratch ... . Wonderful product .
 What a great product . The cloths are especially useful for rented discs , or for discs from the library . Great service , amazon
 Kotex makes wonderful personal products . I have used many different products and am happy to speak about these . These tampons are long and a bit bulky . However , they are well worth it . The plastic applicators on these tampons are easy to use and keep your hands free of messes.This particular pack had 3 different sizes . The regular I recommend for very heavy light days to light medium . The super are for medium to very light heavy days . The super plus I recommend for nights and very heavy days only . The reason I rate them like that is that Kotex tampons are super absorbant , so wearing the right size will allow for leak free days.With this pack it has you covered for most days depending on your own flow . Instead of having several boxes you buy one to cover the various days .
 i bought this product from walmart on my visit to miami & i am very satisfied . i bought 2 boxes of these & some boxes of the no-applicator o.b. tampons . i love to know that i am all stocked up on my monthly essentials . this product is actually a little cheaper @ walmart too.what was strange about the product is the way the string of the tampon is attached , it 's seems to be kinda wrapped around the tampon close to the base , then it comes out of the base of the tampon . since i never used this product before , it looked really weird to me , but it works very efficiently.the applicator is very easy to use too , the easiest i have ever encountered . there 's no discomfort @ all on insertion & the plastic applicator is a little softer than the regular ones , so it 's really easy 2 push the tampon up & out . these are definitely not like the cardboard applicators which bend or lose shape & make it hard for you to push the tampon out or the other plastic applicators , which have you pushing endlessly to get the tampon up . i 'm VERY impressed because it 's only takes a couples seconds & the job is complete.i love these tampons & i will continue to support Kotex .
 It 's hard to find this particular Variety Pack in stores . This one has a 10 Super-Plus sized . I stocked up for convenience & comfort !

 Light , heavy or medium , this product covers all the days . The multi-pack is a great way to not worry about having picked the right one , all are included .
 I have been using the G-U-M Protect toothbrush for some time and find it to bethe best I have ever tried . The design of the handle makes it very comfortable to hold and maneuver the brush head to contact all of the tooth surfaces . I wish that I could find someone who carries this item . I 'm not sure it is available anymore .
 I ordered a bunch of these for my children and am soo pleased with them . Nothing really special about them except for the Suction Cup Base . The are really effective and it keeps the germs off the brushes .
 The Flex-A-Pleasure vibrator is an interesting little toy . It consists of an egg-shaped vibrator at the end of a roughly 5-inch long flexible wand , with the controller being at the other end of the wand . The vibrator is controlled with a variable speed switch , and is powered by 2 N-batteries , which are included . -LRB- N-batteries look like stubby little AAs , and might be a little harder to find than their big brothers . -RRB- The Flex-A-Pleasure is surprisingly quiet , and works excellently as an `` outie '' or an `` innie '' vibrator . The flexibility of the shaft allows you to shape the toy to your needs , though there are limits to how much you can flex it . And finally , a big plus is that it is also waterproof , which means that it can be used in the shower or bath . As for me , I think that it is a fun and interesting toy - perhaps not one you would want to use all of the time , but definitely one to use as a `` vive la difference . '' -LRB- Review of Flex-A-Pleasure -RRB-
 My orthodontist provides only wimpy little between-the-teeth brushes that shred and break after one or two uses . These snap-on tapered brushes are much sturdier , and the angled toothbrush-size handle they snap into is a lot easier to use effectively than those little pocket-size brushes with their tiny handles .
 My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl / 54P7J , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! He said the experts are still adding to the long list of evening primrose oil benefits :1 -RRB- Relieve the discomforts of PMS , menopause , menstruation , endometriosis and fibrocystic breasts2 -RRB- Ease the joint pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis3 -RRB- Prevent diabetes-associated nerve damage4 -RRB- Reduce the symptoms of eczema5 -RRB- Help treat acne and rosacea6 -RRB- Combat damage from multiple sclerosis7 -RRB- Treat Alzheimer 's - related memory deficiencies8 -RRB- Counter impotence and female infertility9 -RRB- Nourish nails , scalp , and hair10 -RRB- Prevent alcohol withdrawal symptomsI bought this for hormone regulation , and it 's very helpful . I have been having heavy periods , and started taking two of these a day . This time , my cycle was MUCH lighter ! Much better than taking hormones for no reason ! I have been taking this for about 3 months now , and it has almost completely done away with those `` female issues '' ! It has reduced cramps , irritability and reduced flow . My hair and skin is ever more radiant and it REALLY helps relieve the stress of hormones . My pre-menstrual mood swings have significantly improved . My boyfriend has noticed the difference and has been very grateful for the product . Amazing !

 This calcium supplement is superior to anything I 've used . I 've been taking Beyond Calcium for about ten years . Unlike other brands , I really notice when I miss a few days .
 My roommate was raving about these tweezers he bought while vising Europe and so I snuck in his bathroom to try them and saw the little Henckel 's logo on them and was n't surprised . Not only do they make great knives , but these are the best tweezers I have EVER used ! ... and what makes them even better is that I can get them from Amazon ! You ca n't go wrong with these . I HIGHLY recommend them .

I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all .

 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I take 600mg CoQ10 with fish oil -LRB- 2 big gel capsules -RRB- and vitamin B for familial tremors , as recommended by a neurologist . If you have similar tremors , check with your doctor about this vitamin regime.Finding a cheap source of CoQ10 has been challenging . Amazon has the best prices available . Even my doctor could not find a lower-priced source.I take NOW vitamins because I have had no problems with them . Once I bought some B2 from CVS , because they were on sale . After two days , I was feeling very jittery . Going back to NOW B2s solved the jitters .
 Having acquired Parkinson 's Disease 8 years ago it was always a challenge to take 6 horse pill size pills daily to achieve my dose of 1200 mg daily . The NOW product is high quality and dosed at 600 mg allowing me to split my dose into 2 pills daily . Works well and are easy to take.NOW Foods CoQ10 600mg , 60 Softgels
 I 've shopped for this item at other stores and on-line stores and found this price and quality the best value .
 I Needed 600mg of this a day and was taking 6 pills before of the 100mg capsules . This is so much better only taking one capsule a day !
 We were unable to find these in any viramin store . Even though they were large pills the fact that they were a capsule they were easy to swallow .
 This is the second time I buy this supplement for my auntie . She is currently being treated with parkinsonian meds and her doctor recommended her to take 1200mg daily twice a day . The highest dose of CoQ10 that We could find in Venezuela and Australia was 100mg so you can imagine the challenge of having to take 12 pills each time she needed to take the supplement . Fortunately , we could find this product in Amazon for a reasonable price . You also can imagine how happy she is now that she does n't have to take 24 pills of CoQ10 daily -LRB- in addition to all of the meds and supplements that she needs to take -RRB- but 4 !! ; not to mention the improvement in her health . We have NOW products in Venezuela and I do n't know why we do n't have the CoQ10 600mg presentation but 100mg only . It would be great to have it , not only for my auntie but also for all of the people out there who are in the same condition as She was
 I wo n't make any claims about the supposed health benefits of CoQ10 , however the NOW brand seems to deliver quality capsules in every bottle . All Star Health has some pretty fast shipping too !
 I am a repeat customer/user of this product which is a great buy in the 600mg form . Will repeat more purchases in the future .
 My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl / jYlSF , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! I was told that CoQ1O is a very powerful antioxidant and neutralises free radicals . It is widely used to support healthy cardiovascular . It also works with vitamin E to protect cell membranes -LRB- and particularly immune cell membranes -RRB- from free radical attack , thus boosting the immune system . CoQ10 is found in virtually every cell in the body , primarily in cellular mitochondria , and it is a vital component of the electron transport chain which generates 95 percent of the body 's energy via ATP . It can cross the blood brain barrier and further studies have shown a protective role in delaying dementia.The Dr told me I should take meds to control my slightly elevated blood pressure -LRB- 138/93 -RRB- . I tried this . I noticed a small difference in my energy level on just the 3rd day . On the 6th day , I increased to 2 capsules per day and began noticing a difference in my severe allergy symptoms as well . After 3 weeks my BP reading is 122/84 . My mother has had a high cholesterol problem since her early 20 's . She used the product along with Red Yeast Rice -LRB- goo.gl / koavD -RRB- to reduce her cholesterol count from 300 down to 167 in just 6 months . Amazing !
 This is the best of all the brands that we have used ... works much better than the others ; it is the only brand we buy now .
 make b12 a part of your every day routine and you 'll feel healthier for it . I 'm sure there 's plenty of pro/con for vitamins , but these help me . ymmv . but it 's your health , so if you use them good for you . if not , oh well .
 I ca n't go without this stuff . If I do , it just feels like I 'm moving in slow motion physically and mentally
 It seems to work fine , except that I thought this was the sublingual vitamin form , and it seems to be an energy drink supplement mix .
 This supplement is definitely a good one . I take it everyday and it is very helpful in maintaining balance under stressful times . Thank you .
 Contains a good mix of vitamins and a lot of B12 which is what I was looking for . I have minor anemia and I felt better a week after taking this .
 Have used before . Item came very quickly as ordered . This site is a site I use often . I have no issues with order .
 did not go out and run around the block but it works really well with my other vitamins . no upset or side effects and the taste is not bad so yes i will buy again
 After reading some of the reviews that complained about the taste , I was nervous to try it for the first time . I 've taken a lot of herbal tinctures and take fermented cod liver oil , so I was expecting something gross . This stuff tastes FINE , absolutely nothing offensive about it . I do n't even find it that strong of a taste . Citrus-y and mildly minty . Liquid , under the tongue is the best way to take B12 , so there you go . If you 're worried about flavor , do n't be .
 I was experiencing some symptoms tied to B-12 deficiency so I decided to try this as the price was low enough and it also contained several different sources of B-12 . I found the taste fine , a little vitamin-y , not as pleasant as some of the sublinguals out there but not bad and I really liked that is contained B-12 sourced from Methylcobalimin . It 's not always easy to find that source in B-12 . I will continue to use it in strong doses and then taper off when I see more results , would like to come back and report , but so far so good .
 ... in your `` git along '' . This Liquid B-12 is a great start . I love the liquid aspect because the vitamin -LRB- s -RRB- get into ones systems faster and are fully used . Tablets , about half really get used because a body 's system ca n't dissolve them as easily . The rest are expelled from the body . There goes half the money you spent to get your supplements . These days we can not afford to throw ANY money away , no matter what form . So ... the liquid form of vitamins are the best way to go . No waste !!! This is an AWESOME product , and no needles ! I 'm not a Dr. but liquid form is a great alternative for the needle , especially when you ca n't get to your Dr. right away .
 I made a mistake , the product did have the seal ; it was an oversight . Please accept my sincere apology .
 This is the best deal for this product if you 're using it long term , as I do . The taste is a little minty , though , so it does n't always go with what I 'm eating at the time .
 Since I use alot of this liquid supplement , I like the size and the price of it . I ca n't find a bigger size anywhere else .
 But I do n't know of any product that does . This contains three , although it is best to take all four . It is missing hydroxycobolamine which I take as drops by InterPlexus.After being diagnosed with pernicious anemia about 10 years ago and on daily B12 shots for months , I can not risk not taking supplements . Most adults have lost the intrinsic factor in the gut allowing absorption of pill forms , so sublingual or liposomal sprays are better , or at least liquid forms . I do n't have a lot of brand loyalty but figure that experimenting around will get me what I need.If you are experiencing depression , fatigue , hair loss it is worth experimenting to see if these water-soluble vitamins will help you . For years I took just one form and did n't experience much benefit until I discovered all four forms are necessary . Folic acid and B6 help metabolize the B12 correctly.UPDATE
 i take this every morning for my supplementation for b-12 . this is definitely better than the regular one as it has all these forms of b-12 and it does n't taste too bad either .
 Good product , good brand , and it 's liquid . I like that ! I 'm still looking for a &#34; B &#34; , though , that they do n't make soooo sweet ! I know they must have a reason for doing that .
 I bought this for my granddaughter . We had great results . She does n't care for the flavor , but that is not unexpected . I will continue to buy this product on a regular basis .
 The person who said this in not the `` right '' kind of B12 was wrong.From the label
 I take them 3 times a day - 2drops at a time . I am so much more productive and energetic ! I tell everyone about how much they have helped me get motivated to go to the gym , clean my house and some days just get out of bed ! They do n't have the best taste but what vitamins do ??? I find the best thing to get the taste out of my mouth is to drink a Coke Zero or green tea - anything but milk and water should do the trick as well . I am afraid to try another brand because I am sooooo happy with the results I get from these . I only gave 2 stars on my first review b/c I could n't get past the taste but the more I used them the more I found I did n't care how they tasted b/c the results were worth it !! And after a few uses I got used to the taste and they do n't bother me as much !! They really do n't taste bad just not great !!!
 I have used a few vitamin B liquids . Usually they taste awful . This is sweetened with Stevia and is rounded out with nice compliment of B complex vitamins and precursors . I really like this product .
 I starting using this as a suppliment but have found that it 's also great for stress relief . I fell calmer but have slightly more energy when using it . : -RRB-
 Now Foods Ultra B-12 liquid is an excellent way to get your B-12 in for the day . It is sublingual , which is what doctors recommend . I highly recommend this product too .
 I have been using this product for over two years now . Do n't take it every day but when I 'm tired , traveling , or just hungover it gives me energy and makes me alert . I keep the small bottle -LRB- 4 oz -RRB- on my desk and refill at home from the 16oz . The taste is very pleasant . I would highly recommend this product .
 This is a grt B12 product , it gives a huge amount of energy even at 1/2 strength.I enjoy I can take it & w/in 1 hour I feel great , especially on the Hcg diet . It works well . 2 thumbs up , product .
 Really works and came just as was represented . Very happy with this product and the timely manner in which it was received ... helps enormously with stress which burns out the B vitamins from our bodies .
 I relay like it taste is pleasant and i hope it has no synthetic food coloring ...
 I used baby bath tubs designed to fit in the kitchen sink with my 3 kids and was surprised to find them not readily available in stores anymore when my oldest had twins . This tub is similar to the ones I used and better designed . Why lean over a bathtub when you can comfortably bathe babies in the kitchen sink ?
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm .

 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !

 Heard about this product from older -LRB- over 50 -RRB- athletes and decided to try it for my knees . It has worked great and I will continue using the product .
 These product is excellent ! I tried just normal Fish Oil pills to help my joints but that did nothing compared to Osteo Bi-Flex . This stuff is great !!!!
 At age 63 my knee pain was getting to the point where I did not want to do anything physical unless I had to , I started taking this product in the triple strength version and it has made a huge difference . Other than a slight twinge every now and then the pain is gone . I have a farm and can do my chores along with some moderate exercise every day pain free . I do n't know how or care how this stuff works but it does and is worth every penny !!
 I have a problem with osteo-arthritis in my left leg which causes a constant aching or even pain for me all the time . This is n't shocking as I 'm at the age that sort of thing occurs for many of us . This had been going on with increasing pain for about 10 months when a friend suggested I try Osteo Bi-Flex . I ordered two bottles from Amazon and have been taking it for a little over a month . Previously I had been taking a Glucosamine , Chondroitin supplement as well as MSM but they did n't seem to be doing all that much to relieve the pain.The Osteo Bi-Flex contains , according to the box , `` the unique International patent pending ingredient 5-LOXIN Advanced . '' I 'm not sure what that is but I knew I was n't getting any of that and felt it just might be worth a try to see if it would help me.It has taken a few weeks but I do seem to be experiencing considerable relief from the pain ; the results are good enough that I 'll reorder when I run out of my present supply . I 'll freely admit I 'm not as faithful about exercising as I should be but I have been faithful about taking the Osteo Bi-Flex tablets , two a day since I got them . I did n't really expect a dramatic improvement in seven days but I believe I 've gotten substantial improvement in one month.If you are having to deal with arthritis it would probably be worth your time and money to check this out for yourself . I have been pleased with the results and would be very willing to make these tablets a part of my dietary regimen for the foreseeable future.Less pain is good !
 My knee joints did feel a bit better after using it for a few weeks . Try to front load in the beginning to have . It really work
 Used to get this at the supermarket . Usually was a good price on account of buy 1 get 1 free . Looked for some today , I did n't see a 2 for 1 deal , looked kind of expensive , so I thought , geez , why do n't I just buy this stuff on the internet?Well , I see that you can indeed by it on Amazon at an attractive price.As to the stuff itself
 I 've gone back and forth on different similar products over the years because sometimes with working out all the time you can get some joint discomfort even when your being as careful as you can in the gym but i always got back to Osteo !!! best product out there . .
 After so many years of using and abusing my body -LRB- I am close to 60 -RRB- exercising and running and just being active , my joints started screaming in pain . My knee got so bad I was afraid to put weight on it and would walk around with a soft brace . Started taking this stuff and was just amazed at the fast results . Amazing ! I am literally pain free and can do step classes , yoga , jog ... I mean , this has given me back my life . I ALWAYS order these now , and get nervous if I get low . They are expensive , but so worth the price .
 My wife 's uncle , a WWII Vet , was using hand crutches . He started taking this and walks unaided.My wife has knee problems . Based on her Uncle 's experience she started using this.Two a day saw a big improvement in a couple of weeks.I do n't know how or why this works but it does .
 I started with two tablets a day for a month then went down to one tablet per day . I have noticed a reduction in knee pain . I am able to squat without pain in my knees and run miles with no issue . Pain is greatly reduced . I only have pain now when I get a tight muscle or twist my joints.I previously took this solution and found the exact same results , though some claim it to be better . If you are willing to shell out extra money then you can check it out :[ ... -RSB-
 I 've been having shoulder and hand aches and pains for about a year now and thought I would try this to see if it would help . I 've been taking it for two weeks and after one week was amazed at the difference this has made ! I still have a little achiness but NOTHING like it was before . I will keep taking this as long as it helps which I have a feeling it will based on the reviews here . Try it a bottle of this ... what do you have to lose except your pain ??
 My orthopedic surgeon recommended this to me over a year ago , after my arthroscopic knee surgery during which procedure he discovered that much of the cartilege in the knee was eroded . Osteo performs as advertised and I am very pleased with the results .
 This is the cheapest place to purchase this product.I wanted something that had quality Glucosamine and Chondroitin along with 5-LOXIN . This product seem to have it all at the best price on Amazon.I have read several praises of Glucosamine and Chodroitin.My mother and wife swear that these products do help with joint maintenance , however , I have not notice any significant difference.I will test it for a few months to see if there is any significant improvement.Anything that will help my joints is worth taking.For now , I will give it a five stars .
 I have used Oster Biflex for years and it works . A couple of times I have stopped using it because I ran out and forgot to replace it and I noticed a difference within about 10 days . Joint pain returned but when I re-started taking it , it helped quite a bit .
 I have been having knee pain -LRB- runners knee -RRB- for about 5 months before I tried this . A lot of my friends told me about this product and I was concerned that it would be a waste of money and it would n't help my pain but after a few days , I am back to running , pain free . Great product , great results , great price !
 I really like this product . I have mild arthritis in my hands and Osteo Bi-Flex helps me to maintain flexibility . The pills are rather large , but they are n't that hard to swallow .
 My husband has a terribly painful case of joint pain in his hips and knees . He has taken this product for over a year and swears by it . It greatly lessens pain to the point of making it tolerable to hardly noticeable . He also uses kratom powder which is a very good muscle relaxant and natural pain reliever used in herbal medicine in parts of Asia and India . When the pain is very bad , it makes him feel much better . It is hard to find but of course it is on amazon , Warrior Mist Vicozen Combo -LRB- Vicozen Only - -LRB- 6 bottles -RRB- -RRB- . Another good supplement for joint health he takes is cissus powder which is something we both take consistently for overall joint health -LRB- I have a mild case of carpal tunnel , it helps slow down the inevitable -RRB- . The cissus powder has a natural inflammatory effect on joints and ligaments which make it a necessary supplement for my husband to take with the Glucosamine and chondroitin . Very effective for it 's intended purposes , and just for maintenance too . A very wonderful group of products that have no negative side effects as far as either of us can tell .
 Started taking this after about a month and a half of working out following a two year hiatis from any sort of exercise . While I should let myself suffer for being so lazy for those two years , I purchased Osteo Bi-Flex to help alleviate ; shoulder , elbow , and knee discomfort . And alleviate my discomfort it certainly has . I take two pills -LRB- one at breakfast and one at dinner -RRB- daily and I feel great . I currently experience no pain in any of my joints and have been working out 4-5 times a week pretty rigorously -LRB- rigorously for an out of shape 30 something -RRB- .
 Five months ago I received a bone scan that revealed my hip joints had degenerated due to my juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . I 'd been taking a pain killer ever since for my hip pain . I tried THIS product and I can only attest to the fact I am no longer on pain killers . With just two of these tablets per day . That should say it all .
 I have been using this product for about a month now , and can honestly say it works . I was having very bad pain in my right knee , some thing that would occur from time to time , but this time it got really bad . I was told by my doctor to try this , I figured it was just another waste of money , but it was not . After about a week I could really tell a difference and could not believe how much better my knee felt . I golf a lot and that was what started the pain , know I have been golfing pain free . It 's not often I find some thing like this that actually works , but for me it really helped . I think it is worth trying for sure if you suffer from joint pain .
 This product really works well . After 10 days you will notice improvement if not complete `` remission '' fromjoint pain . I was on a strong anti-inflamatory until I started osteo bi-flex and no longer take the anti-inflamatory .
 I recently went back to taking Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM because of severe arthritic pain in my left knee that suddenly emerged . -LRB- I had stopped taking it about a year ago because of a major study that showed that Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MCM was not effective , but have since learned that this study was funded by Celebrex ... anyway , that is another story . -RRB- I had been taking another Glucosamine supplement for about two months , as well as using Penetrex as a topical anti-inflammatory and doing PT exercises . My knee pain had lessened substantially . However , when I shifted to the Osteo Bi-Flex , my knee pain pretty much completely vanished ... within three days ! At first , I could n't figure out what could have caused the improvement , but the only change I had made was shifting to the Osteo Bi-Flex , so I have to think that it made a real difference and surprisingly quickly . I 'm definitely going to continue taking this indefinitely to hang on to the cartilage I have left . My orthopedic specialist says that Glucosamine effects are the placebo effect , but I do n't think so . -LRB- Maybe he is receiving gifts from Celebrex -RRB- . However , if this is the placebo effect , I 'm all for it ... no pain and no side effects -LRB- that I know of -RRB- .
 This product works great for me !! I have occasional pain in my joints , and a couple of these tablets daily can quickly get the discomfort under control . . Could not find any glocosamine suplements in my local stores but thank goodness AMAZON HAD THIS . . Great product !!
 I have had knee pain for a long time . I am diabetic and consulted with my doctor before trying . It works really well .
 I had been taking another brand of glucosamine/MSM for many months and did not feel as if I was improving . My right knee still hurt ; both knees still `` popped '' when I walked , and I was still waking up in the middle of the night with lower back pain . I have a host of chronic illnesses - including MS , Fibromyalgia , and lupus . After FOUR days of taking this supplement , both my knees stopped popping , my right knee felt so great I walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes - and had NO PAIN ! I slept through the night , and my lower back does not hurt ! Like I said - Absolutely A Miracle !
 Thank you ! this product is awsome , I think keep buying !! From Ecuador ! . it help to ma father !! he has artritis .
 The product is of excellent quality and is meeting my needs.He earned this rating for keeping his promise.I really liked the product and recommend it to all who have joint problems or anything else that needs this product .
 We had switched to another brand because of cost , but had to return to osteobi-flex because the other was not as good .
 My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl / DoPrb , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! Hyaluronic acid has been nicknamed by my personal physician as the `` key to the fountain of youth '' because it has been noted that at least some people who ingest a lot of Hyaluronan in their diets tend to live to ripe old ages.He told me the enormous benifit of it :1 . Hyaluronic acid moisturizes skin from the inside out , smoothing out wrinkles in the process .2 . Hyaluronic acid helps people who need to ease the flexing of their joints , especially their knees , by restoring cushioning to their joints .3 . Hyaluronic acid is suitable for men and women in their 30s and 40s who are beginning to see the first signs of aging .4 . Hyaluronic acid is suitable for seniors who have established joint conditions.My personal physician told me that Hyaluronic acid is essential for the health of the synovial fluid which supports the bones and joints . To maximize the benefit , he asked me to take it with Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM for my joints problems . I decided to have a try and was recommendeded to buy at goo.gl / 7CEUP , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! Usually vitamins and supplements take a few months to work but I can tell you that this product has made a DRAMATIC difference to my skin and I 've only been taking it for 2 weeks . I am 42 and I have not been kind to my skin due to sun damage and harsh products used on my face for adult acne . I am simply amazed at how moist my skin feels but it 's not oily or greasy . I will definitely keep up with this product . I 'll let you know when it starts to help my joints which is the initiial reason I ordered the product . : - -RRB-
 I have used this product for years . It is wonderful . I highly recommend it for joints that need oiling . Thank You
 I 'm in my thirties and was recommended these by a friend as I was having knee and elbow pain from boxing and running . I have been taking them for three weeks and after about a week I noticed relief , and after three weeks my knee is fine and the pain and restriction in my elbow is greatly reduced , I have n't made any other changes to my regiment or diet other than adding these tablets so I 'm very happy to keep taking them .
 This is a very good product , my husband loves it . I gave it to my husband for Christmas due to the price , but it really does work , he usually feels the affects after taking it for a week first . This arrived promptly and was packaged well .
 I was skeptical of the Osteo Bi-Flex claims of benefits , particularly of the 7 day improvement , however , after using it for about a week , I can attest to the remarkable effects . Osteo Bi-Flex is the only brand to feature the revolutionary formulation of ingredients in Joint Shield -LRB- tm -RRB- , with patent-pending ingredient 5-LOXIN Advanced -LRB- tm -RRB- . Taking 5-LOXIN Advanced -LRB- tm -RRB- showed improvement in joint comfort within 7 days .1 Joint Shield -LRB- tm -RRB- with 5-LOXIN Advanced -LRB- tm -RRB- works to guard against the action of enzymes that affect joint health . * 5-LOXIN Advanced -LRB- tm -RRB- is a super concentrated extract of Boswellia serrata , which helps with joint flare-ups . * Osteo Bi-Flex self reports that it is manufactured under the strictest standards for product purity and potency . It is made exclusively with naturally sourced Glucosamine.A publication discussing the use of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate -LRB- the most common forms of the supplements -RRB- to treat knee osteoarthritis was published in the July 14 , 2003 , issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine . The publication reviewed the best studies from 1980 to 2002 , and concluded
 This is a good product ... it has worked for me ! My doctor said supplements generally take between six months to a year to show any results . I 'm sure this is normally true , but Osteo-Flex helped me after about 60 days .
 My husband uses this product for joint pain . He says it works great . He notices increase in pain if he misses a few days . It only took about 2 weeks before he felt a decrease in joint pain . This is a great product .
 It has been 2 months since a dislocated my right knee and it has n't been the same ever since . No matter what prescriptions or therapy I was prescribed with doctors I did n't see much improvement . Five days ago I went grocery shopping and noticed Osteo Bi-Flex triple strength and everything it claimed sounded great , after 5 days I noticed decreased pain and strength in my knee that was ' t there at all before taking the supplements . I can only imagine how better off my knee will be when I 'm done with the bottle.Unfortunately I discovered that this product contains Titanium dioxide , a compound well known to cause cancer . I wo n't be buying another bottle until they correct this flaw and will be looking for other alternative products that do not contain harmful chemicals as well as are more natural .
 I read package info and read reviews and thought i would try because of joint pain especially in my knee 's , the only thing i can say is try it you will like this product , my wife also loves it say 's she can tell in her hands and elbows , we both had improvement in a week .
 This is an expensive supplement . I got this on a lightning deal for 15 bucks -LRB- and free prime shipping -RRB- . Normally this supplement runs 30-40 dollar range for this size and strength . An option to save money . Rite Aid pharmacy does a buy one get one sale monthly -LRB- give or take -RRB- . You can get 2 bottles for about $ 18-22 each that way.I have been using this for years . When I run out , or have a few crazy days and forget to take it , I can tell a big difference.I also have tried other brands , and feel this is one of the best in quality and consistency .
 I 'd been giving my husband a generic store brand -LRB- and lesser known name brands -RRB- of Chondroitin Sulfate , Methylsulfonylmethane -LRB- MSM -RRB- for years then switched to Osteo Bi-Flex brand last year on the advice of physical therapists and doctors.I experimented to be sure it was working . I stopped giving it to my husband without his knowledge -LRB- I prepare all of his vitamins in one cup so he did not notice he was not taking it -RRB- and when I did this his knees and joints started to hurt again -LRB- like before I first gave them to him -RRB- . Then I started giving them to him again and within a week or two he stopped complaining about the pain . The change was gradual but it was clear . I tested it this way to make sure any benefits were not `` all in his head '' . When I told him about the experiment he was thankful I proved they worked -LRB- so we do n't waste our money -RRB- , and he agreed he should keep taking them . And even though Osteo Bi-Flex is a bit more expensive , he wants to spend the extra money because this brand has been recommended by professionals in the health care industry -LRB- my doctor and my physical therapist -RRB- . The other brands seemed to work just as well -LRB- I tested them also , in the same way -RRB- , but after hearing so many reports in the last year about the poor quality of ingredients in many brands of foods and vitamins/supplements we have decided to continue using Osteo Bi-Flex brand as long as the price does not go too high and as long as we can afford it . In my opinion the price of $ 22 to $ 25 -LRB- per 120 caplet bottle of the Advanced formula -RRB- is the most I want to pay . I have purchased from Amazon and elsewhere.CAUTION
 As other Osteo products , worked as described at Osteo home page . It is trustable and the deliver arrived on time .
 This stuff works . It kept the swelling in my knee down and was able to continue working until I could see a doctor and get MRI and surgery . Told the Dr. I was taking this and he said its a good product and to continue taking it . Had surgery to repair the knee and am still taking this . I would recommend this to anyone with knee problems .
 I use Osteo Bi Flex Advanced Triple Strength and I like very much . This product is excelent for atletic performance , protect muscle and body .
 My husband swears by this stuff . He was in such pain and had to have surgery on his knees . Surgery worked for awhile but the pain came back . He went searching for anything to help and found this . He went from not being about to sleep and limping when he walked , to sleeping all night and walking without a limp . He ran out and I bought something else with similar ingredients but it did not work as well . He is so pleased and says he will never run out again .
 I purchased this after looking at a lot of reviews . The mineral make up is very good and the price was ok , but once I got the product , the pills are solid , somewhat hard to swallow and they tasted strange . I had to drink a reasonable amount of liquid to get the taste out of my mouth . I must say that after a month or so I got used to the taste . Also a good thing is you only need to take 2 pills/day . I decided to try a different product that requires 3 pills/day for the same amount but they are capsules , much easier to swallow and actually cost less .
 I love Osteo Bi Flex , but not in this triple strength tablet that is so large I gag on it and ca n't get it down . The package says easy to swallow , but I choked so badly , my spouse came running . I 'm glad I saved the old bottle , because there are so many variations in this product that it is easy to buy the wrong type . I will avoid the Triple Strength from now on , and go with my usualOsteo Bi-Flex MSM Advanced Joint Shield Formula with 5-Loxin , Twin Pack , 120 Ct. eachwhich I have used for the past year , and which helped my bad knee so much . If you compute the cost per pill , this is the least expensive in spite of the high up-front cost for the two bottle package .
 She tried it before and really it is effective within 1 weekshe used to feel pain in her leg joints , now she is feeling much more better with it
 My brother put me on to this and I was VERY skeptical . I had tried many different formulations and none of them seem to work . But I was desperate and ready to try anything . After just a few days , I noticed an improvement . My knees feel stronger and there is less pain . Swelling is definitely reduced.The pills are large & difficult to take whole , but I 've been biting them down into fourths -LRB- has a citrus taste -RRB- and have been able to easily swallow them . It is cheaper to take a Vit . D supplement than buying the Vitamin D formulation and it was cheaper to go through Amazon Prime and subscription than to order from another vendor . Also , the Osteo Bi-flex website has a `` club '' that you can enter codes on to get up to a $ 5 coupon .
 My husband has been using Osteo Bi-Flex for several years . Having tried many other brands , this is the one that helps the most . Great price and shipping was quick . Will be ordering again and again .
 Taking these for joint pain and stiffness . They seem to be working . I do have less joint pain now . I have pain in my lower and middle back , hips and knees . Since starting these the pain is somewhat improved . I do hope it only gets better and I can get on with my life !
 I am rather disappointed with the taste and appearance of this product ; the pills are large , powdery and taste dusty . When I take them with liquid I can still taste them hours after . I 'd give them 1star for that . After lots of experimenting I now take them with food which seems to be the solution to the after taste . I do have one BIG plus though ; they really provide comfort within a week ! This is why they get 4stars , I wish they would make the triple strength pills like the double strength pills , which are gel caps .
 My doctor recommened 2 brands for my osteoarthritis , this being one of them . It really does work for me , without it my fingers would be throbbing with pain and i would not be typing this review . I still need to take an occasional anti-inflammatory , but Osteo Biflex have really made a difference in my life .
 I do n't know if this works better than any other glucosamine and chondroitin/MSM combo pills I 've taken , but let 's just say since I 've been taking the supplements whether this brand or another , I 've gone from HAVING to take celebrex everyday to walk without pain in my knees to none . That 's right , zero . It does n't help that much with the pain in my feet -LRB- neither does celebrex -RRB- that 's bonespur related , but the help with the other pain is worth every cent and every big gulp to get these pills down ! to be fair , I also take fish oil and 2000mg of ginger every day to help with inflammation -RRB-
 I started taking these for pain in the center thumb joint . It had been continuning for about 2 weeks . Since I had taken Glucosamine and Chondroitin for severe and persistant hip pain about 10 years ago with very good results , I decided that would be the way to go.I have been taking these pills a little over 2 weeks now and am already seeing some relief in pain . I like the fact that they only require 2 pills a day . I wish that they were gel caps , because these `` Easy To Swallow Coated Caplets '' , are not that easy to swallow . Since they are working so well however , I will continue to take them.Update
 Osteo Bi-Flex `` Advanced Triple Strength '' supplement was recommended by one of my Uncles to help prevent arthritis related pains in my knees and hands . I like that the daily dosage is only two -LRB- albeit LARGE -RRB- tablets that contain Glucosamine , Chondroitin , and 5-Loxin . This also additionally provides 100 % of the `` Daily Recommended Value '' of Vitamin C and Manganese.There is some debate about the overall effectiveness of Glucosamine and Chondroitin -LRB- technically `` Chondroitin Sulfate '' -RRB- , but 5-Loxin seems very promising . I * think * and * believe * my joints feel better as a result of starting to take these products , but there really is n't any way for me to quantify the results or provide any real proof , so it is a matter of faith for me that I continue to spend the money on these supplements.Highly Recommended , with the above caveat.CFH
 As pointed out by other users , these pills are mighty humongous ! And if you chop them up into smaller , easier-to-swallow chunks , they taste like the plastic upholstery of a 1966 Volvo wagon ; straight-up nazzzty.But here 's the funny part - after just a week , my bum knee -LRB- 15 years of karate and kickboxing plus ACL surgery will do a number on your joints , I 'm here to tell ya -RRB- is feeling MUCH better , and improving every day ! Truly a miracle ; I thought I was gon na have to live with a cranky left leg for the rest of my days . That wrinkly old waitress with the rad beehive hairdo on the commercial was right ; who knew ? This stuff really works . Yeehaw!If you can stand a little nasty flavor in trade for a happier skeleton , then this is definitely the stuff for you . My advice ? Cut 'em in thirds with a pill splitter , take each little chunk with a HUGE mouthful of water -LRB- do n't breathe in while doing so , or you 'll experience a really lovely vinyl taste that lasts and lasts -RRB- , and chase the whole mess down with a small chunk of chocolate or other Scooby snack . Hey , that 's why God created Reese 's Peanut Butter Cups !
 For me , this is a most beneficial product . Within 3 days it eliminated knee joint pain . I have had both knees operated on -LRB- medial meniscus tears -RRB- and they had been doing very well , but suddenly I was getting some pain . My pharmacist recommended this product , when asked and it worked faster than the label stated it might . Always a good surprise . Sundown has always made a superior product , no matter what I have used over the years , so I highly recommend this to anyone who is suffering minor joint pain as a possible solution .
 I bought this 'cause I need it for my mother since she had an arthroscopy in her knee . Her meniscus teared and it was mandatory -LRB- according to the doctor of course -RRB- to procedd with the surgery . He recommended this product in order to help her with her joints so she could n't feel pain after the surgery and most of all , to help her with recorvery from the arthroscopy . Along with the rehab , these product have been of much help to her . I fully recommend it .
 I have used these pills to relieve my arthritis pain in my hips and while it has not cured it , it does relieve much pain . A person has to take it a while before you will notice a drastic difference but just keep with it and I do not think you will be disappointed .
 Ca n't live without it . When I run out I feel the difference in knees when I do a heavy leg workout .
 natural way to make life easier and with less pain in the AM ... . used to get up with stiff joints and some initial pain ... . not any more after using this product ...
 I am surprised , it seems to be working . My pain has lessoned and so has my husbands . Ca n't do better than that !
 Excellent product - been using for several years on advice of my orthopedic doctor/surgeon - as long as I use this product doctors tell me I will not have to undergo the surgery . Usually purchase from Walgr -- n 's , but it was cheaper in Amazon this week .
 Taking these as directly they do help quite a bit . Going to have to order another bottle soon . Thanks for the quick shipment .
 After taking this product for several months , I was once again able to walk down the stairs without pain.Climbing the stairs was never a problem , but going down was simply too painful.Now , I can do both again . Who said that growing old has to become more painful ? Not for my knees ...
 I feel better using these pills . I just wish they were a bit smaller . It hurts going down , and two pills , wow !
 Completely satisfied ! Have used it for 2 plus years and I swear by it . Has made such a difference in reducing knee pain .
 I have had arthritis in my knees and hips for years from high school injuries , and this formulation gives me relief within a few weeks . Before I took it , I was lying awake at night with my joints aching , and doing stairs was torture . I can cut back to 1 pill three times a week once I have reached a therapeutic level . If I get lazy and stop completely , the pain comes back in 6 to 8 weeks .
 I have been taking this for over five years and could not stop . I need both knees replaced . This product makes it possible for me to work a job where I am on my feet for 8 + hours straight !
 I took the pills as directed . After 10 days I noticed a big improvement in my movement . The pain was gone . I am now walking 30 minutes every day pain free .
 Three letters . O. . M. . G ! I freaking love this lip balm ! I got ta say it had me fooled , cause here I was thinking , `` this is just gon na be your average natural product that works okay , but still not be good enough for me not to stray away from . '' Well let me tell you this . . I was completely wrong . . wrong in a good way of course . The second I put this on , I literally wanted to discard all of my other lip products that do n't compare . For starters , this lip balm smell sooooo good , I was n't sure if I was suppose to eat it or put it on my lips . And it just leave your lips feeling oh so soft and supple . You should definitely put this product on when your lips are fresh and soft , or you will lose a battle to this balm being softer than your lips . And oh , the texture , so silky and smooth ; not like those stiff to the touch chap sticks , where the tops break off upon application . Everything about this product , says you 're about to get a run for your money . I honestly feel like I should have paid more for this . And the spf is just the cherry on the top . Buy this product if you want your lips left feeling silky , soft and supple ! My tip is to wet your washcloth in warm to hot water , wring it out , fold it , and bite down on it with your lips ; then apply the balm . What a beautiful result ! Kiss My Face has got my vote !
 I like this product alot , and I use it for all my baseball hats , and my military covers that need shaped . The Perfect Curve let 's you decide between two different shapes which makes getting uniforms ready that much easier . If you use a coffee cup your stuck with one shape that does n't last long if you have a good bill where the Perfect Curve shapes the whole bill and last longer on a new bill plus the longer you leave it the longer the shape lasts , so if you wanted to store your hats in the Perfect Curve you can . The price could stand to come down but it beats breaking the bill or adding extra time to uniform inspections .
 This item came exactly as described with two optional grooves for you cap . The item also came in a timely manner from 1ZEEE2ZEEEE . I ordered on the 8th and received today on the 11th . I recommend purchasing from this seller if you need a perfect curve .
 I used it for a while - it gets a good curve in your brim but I found myself going back to the baseball and rubber bands because that gives you the `` wrap around '' on the edges - this product makes a very consistent arc and IMHO makes your caps look too `` country club '' With that being said , I think it would work better with golf caps but not on fitted MLB hats where you either go flat brim -LRB- not -RRB- or ball player style with the sharper curve on the edges.If you are going for country club , this is the product for you of course .
 Great buy , quick shipping , works great ! I never thought this item would come in handy , I 've seen them for years , just bought it and I love it!saw them at the store for $ 19.99 . only paid here under 14 thanks for selling on amazon
 My husband is very peticular about his curve in his ballcaps , this was a stocking stuffer for him this past christmas . All in all , I have to say I think was a nice surprise . He uses it on new caps to kind of break them in , and seems to be happy with it .
 works exactly how it was supposed to , it curves the brim . Real good job . Only five more words to go .
 I Love the Perfect Curve Cap Curver my brims be perfect now.I recommend this item to people who love curved brims .
 The case is nice and should last a long time . I 'm not a medical person , but I would have given it five stars if it contained a tooth saver . I hung it in the garage because I work on cars and other stuff a lot .
 As the title says , this is great for the car or a boat , even in a barn or stable . This was given to me as a present , and , if you know me , you know why !! Amazingly , I have yet to use it . The metal box is great , I have already stepped on it , dropped it in a parking lot and it tumbled out of the car and plopped into a good puddle , yet the contents were safe . Almost everything you will need is in the metal container . The only addition I wll be making is an ace bandage , probably the single sticky version , but I think there should be an ace bandage in every first aid kit . If you have a van or truck , it is able to be mounted inside of the vehicle , but the case fits just fine in the hatch of my PT -LRB- along with ALL sorts of other stuff -RRB- . So , 4 stars because it is what they say , minus one only because , from my past experiences I feel you should have an ace bandage in every first aid kit .
 Superior first aid kit for car/truck with extra room to add a few items of choice . Larger size is waterproof and seriously industrial for high strength . This is one fo the best first aid kits I 've seen on the market at this price point .
 I purchased this Medique # 807M1 as a sturdier water and dust resistant replacement for a plastic first aid kit that had developed weakened/unreliable latches over the years . Keeping in mind that it 's a large case , the metal is much heavier than the old plastic case . I immediately replaced some of the items included in the Medique kit with supplies from my old kit
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 My roommate was raving about these tweezers he bought while vising Europe and so I snuck in his bathroom to try them and saw the little Henckel 's logo on them and was n't surprised . Not only do they make great knives , but these are the best tweezers I have EVER used ! ... and what makes them even better is that I can get them from Amazon ! You ca n't go wrong with these . I HIGHLY recommend them .

It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 ReliaMed TENS Electrodes Re-usable - 10 Packages - 40 Electrodes : They were brand new and just wanted I needed for my TENS unit . Shipping was really quick too . Thank you !
 They work good . I recommend getting the spray bottle as well for a better contact with the skin .
 These electrodes work well but do not last beyond three to five uses . The sticky substance wears away .
 Good deal to purchase with the TENs unit-although not sure yet how long they will last .
 I have a tens unit for Doctor Ho 's Company and they charge a small bundle of cash just for four of the jell pads so I did some searching on Amazon and took a gamble and wha la I only payed $ 14.95 for a whole bag of the 2x2 electrodes ! I order a package of four and you really get 16 ! they work just as well as the doc 's and they save me a lot of moo la :-RRB- : -RRB-
 i use these elctrode and i find that : -1 - durable you can use each one about 10 days in clean skin and it will stick with skin in nice condition.2-the quality is very good because the dimension 2 `` x2 '' and thickness is very sutable and comfortable to move it from part to another part at your body.3-fast shipping in well condition from this companythanks
 I 've used a lot of electrodes , and typically I would like to get7 or 8 uses from a set.The reliamed does this well.Additionally , the quality seems to be consistently high . The conductive adhesive is thick , and sticks to the pad rather than your skin .
 The price of the electrodes was great , but the shipping cost nearly doubled the price . The product did arrive relatively quickly , but I would appreciate a chance to pay less for shipping and wait a little longer for the item .
 I have n't used any of the extra electrodes I ordered , but they are just like the other ones that I have used and they were great .
 These electrodes are very good . I 'm glad I got them . They have longevity and sticking power . If you 're like me and ca n't afford some expensive , fancy electrodes , then these are perfect . They get the job done , and I 've been able to re-use them again and again . I will buy these again when I run out -LRB- but I do n't expect that to be for a while -RRB- .
 They were exactly like the ReliaMed Pads that came with my ReliaMed TENS unit . Fits exactly . You may get two uses out of each set , but I do n't bother trying . If you 're not moving , and they are n't going to be hanging upside-down , you can probably get two uses . Prep the skin with alcohol first .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !

 I highly recommend this for anyone that is active and takes the occasional scrape and bruise . I would n't have thought it was worth the price , but my cousin got me a trial pack of the Indigo Wild products so I put this one in my bag , just in case . Well , just recently I took a spill and lost some skin . I thought , I would give it a try and was really happy with the results . It helps keep the cut from stinging and prevents infection as well as providing moisture to help it heal . This is really great stuff !
 This antiseptic is the best product on the market . Works better than any thing you can buy at discount store or pharmacy . Promotes super fast healing of minor cuts . I will never use anything else . You have really got to try it to believe it .

 My roommate was raving about these tweezers he bought while vising Europe and so I snuck in his bathroom to try them and saw the little Henckel 's logo on them and was n't surprised . Not only do they make great knives , but these are the best tweezers I have EVER used ! ... and what makes them even better is that I can get them from Amazon ! You ca n't go wrong with these . I HIGHLY recommend them .
 this one is great , 7 settings , i hollowed out a plug and put it in , worked perfectly , first one i ordered did n't work , they promptly sent me a new one , thanks guys !!

 Goofy me . I thought that I was buying cologne . I am not unhappy . Black is nice and I have received a few compliments .
 very good product but becareful when ordering because the all the bottles look alike i ordered the after shave by accident . . but still smells good and lasts long . .
 My son loves this cologne . You had a super price . and it smells so good . Thanks Amazon for making this such a smooth and easy transaction . PS . Thanks for the free shipping ... K.T.
 This is by far the best ginger root extract I 've found . Taking the extract instead of the raw herb enables you to get a very strong dose in two pills.I have found taking two of this brand of ginger root to get rid of chronic back pain when nothing else did . Ginger is a strong anti-inflammatory herb , in addition to improving your digestion and helping with colds and flu.This company is owned by an herbalist and he makes the best quality herbs.Another favorite of mine is his cordyceps . He includes cordyceps with other energy tonics to make the strongest energy tonic you can buy over the counter : Cordyceps Power CS-4 60T 60 Tablets

 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I have a potassium deficiency and I have to take potassium tablets daily . And the cost of everything these days , I was suffering more for the price I had to pay to get this suppliment from my local pharmacy . Thanks be I now can purchase what I need at the right price . I will be a repeat customer ...
 KAL `` Potassium-99 '' Potassium Chloride 99mg is an excellent product . I take a medicine that acts as a diuretic which means that I need extra potassium and I DO N'T need the calories in an extra 10 bananas per day in order to get it . I also DO N'T need a self appointed Food Police nanny telling me what to do . Potassium chloride is the preferred form of potassium to take if you are going to take a supplement .
 Kind of hard not to mess up a bottle of potassium so it 's pretty much what you 'd expect . Quick to go through such a small bottle though .
 I ca n't say enough good things about this skin treatment . I have suffered from psoriasis for twenty years and tried just about everything from herbal remedies to steroid creams . Every time I tried something new , it would work for a little while and then the psoriasis would come back with a vengeance . This cream truly is a miracle . I have been using it for about a month now for moderate psoriasis covering different areas of the body and my skin is almost entirely clear ! The cream is light , smells nice , and works very quickly . If you are n't having any luck with other treatments , give this one a shot !
 ... this stuff really helps ! When I first began using this product on a full blown flare of Inverse Psoriasis it began to burn terribly . I put some Aveeno moisturizer over it and it calmed it down and to my amazement , the rash began to look better by the next day . Within two days , I was using it straight without the additional moisturizer and it actually cleared my rash within 5 days ! -LRB- I often have flares that can last weeks or months -RRB- . It has helped me get off of steroid lotion and I 'm very thankful .
 This product is excellant for my condition . It cures all the rash and itchiness altogether . Excellant product .
 I 've used this to help with my psoriasis , along with several other topical ointments , and this works great . I love the smell and the soft feeling it gives your skin afterward . The only problem I had was a bit of stinging when applying it to my psoriatic lesions . Other than that , it 's an amazing product !
 I am using this cream on my arms to try and clear up a weird rash type thing.Seems to be helping.The ingredients are good for skin whether you have irritations or not , I recommend it to everyone .
 Thank you for the fast shipping , this product works wonders . :-RRB- I will again make a purchase from you because of your wonderful products .
 I have tried practically every product on the market , both precription and otc . Nothing has ever worked for an extended period of time . However , this cream has brought relief from itching where other products have not . I have moderate to severe psoriasis
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have found these are the best testing lancets used with the muliticlix device , they are the best for virtually pain free testing . You can get this cheaper at some online pharmacy , but regardless your you buy , this is the best out there .
 it is an excelent product and the price is the best that i ever found .
 I originally purchased the Multiclix lancets to use with my Accu Chek Aviva meter as Amazon lists the meter , the strips and lancets in a grouping of buy these together section ; ERROR the lancet that comes with the Accu Chek Aviva is the fastclix not the Multiclix , imagine my surprise when the drum was too big to fit.Oh well I immediately ordered the Multiclix lancing device and a box of Multiclix lancets from another Amazon vendor.The original order of multiclix arrived without a hassle , the box was sealed as expected.After using the multiclix device I 've discovered it 's easier to hold and prick your finger than with the fastclix , and it has the same &#34; painless &#34; prick as the fastclix.I use setting # 1 and retrieve an adequate amount of blood for use.There is no instruction manual on using the multiclix , so you have to go to the Accu Chek website and download it.Otherwise a great product .
 There 's not much to review about these lancet drums . They 're easy to install , you never see a needle -LRB- not that I care -RRB- and when you dispose of a used drum , there are no needles exposed.The MultiClix is my lancet device of choice . I purchased it even though I have several `` free '' devices from Accu Chek and Bayer as well as my old Accu Chek SoftClix device.What is nice is that Accu Chek does n't gouge us for the convenience of the drum system . The lancets are priced pretty much the same as any other box of lancets for the same quantity .
 When I first discovered Accu-Check Multiclix lancets at a local drugstore , I thought they were a great idea but also too expensive for everyday use . Later , when I found them on sale at the same store , I bought them to try . They are so quick , painless and convenient to use , I 'm glad I did . I have since found them offered for a reasonable price at Amazon . The mail-order products I received were properly packaged in sealed plastic containers , inside unopened boxes .
 If you have to stick your fingers twice a day this is the way to go . There is less pain than I had been expecting and the price is not bad .
 This is a terrific product . I ca n't imagine any lancet or lancet system being any easier to use or less painful . Accu-Chek products are excellent , fairly priced and are highly supported by Roche , the manufacturer . They offer excellent newsletters and advice through a toll free number . Their Accu-Chek 360 software is a great product as well .
 It 's good that I had backup . Delivery took weeks . When you need this , there 's no substitute .
 It arrived promptly and is as was advertised . Very good price if this is the kind of lancets that your device requires
 These lancets are virtually painless . I 've been a Type 1 diabetic for 51 years and I 've never found a better product . The drum , which contains 6 lancets , is extremely convenient . Highly recommended .
 Smooth quick service . I will buy product from this dealer again . I have used the product for over 5 years .
 Love these lancets - they are very simple to use , and practically pain-free . The multiclix pen is small enough to tuck into my meter 's case for on-the-go testing .
 I like this product so practical and hygienic , not like others who puts single lancet , and are uncomfortable . I Liked .
 These lancets work like a charm and do exactly as the box says . I ca n't say anything more ... highly recommended from me .
 these lancets are just what they are supposed to be . priced right and functional . i will purchase more when i need them
 well , i bought this product for my granma , it is an excelent product and the price is even better .
 Product was as I expected , I sent for the catridges to insert in the device that I have as opposed to buying a whole new product
 Your service was very fast and the order was exactly as stated . Thank you for your prompt attention . I will definitely use you in the future .
 It is a good product . Little amount of blood is sufficient for the test , and it does n't hurt while drawing blood .
 I was thrilled to find my refills for my Multi-Clix lancing device for such a small price.I urge every one to take advatage of the prices offered at this site.Ordering was easy and delivery was fast .
 Reduce the pain and hassle of blood glucose testing . The ACCU-CHEK Multiclix lancing device uses a drum of 6 preloaded lancets . Plus , it uses the same technology as the ACCU-CHEK FastClix device , which has been proven least painful .1 With 11 depth settings for maximum comfort , and minimal side-to-side motion for less skin tearing , it helps eliminate the pain of blood sugar checks . Will definitely purchase again ''
 For some metal and wood , it 's a great piece of equipment ... as soon as I get a knot in my back , I use it ... and get the knot gone !
 The quality is good , I happy with this product because it wort the price I always buy this refill pads to my vapor-eze they work great i also recomend the lavender refill pads .
 Used product in my family for years . Used 2 ways . For preventive , I would give a spoonful at bedtime to my kids during the entire cold season . They either never or rarely got a cold . At the onset of a bronchial type cold works great 2-3 times a day . Did not seem to work as well for sinus type colds . Key to use to avoid a cold . My now adult children request me to find and ship for them when they ca n't find in their local store .
 When I was a child , my mom also gave us this during the cold/flu season and we hardly ever got sick.When I had the flu in March this year , the congestion in my chest was totally blocked . I went to a store pharmacy to inquire about Father Johns because other products I had just did not do the job , but I forgot that most pharmacy youth of today would not know anything about it . I came home , searched the web and was VERY VERY pleased to find this available thru Amazon.com . My thanks to AmericaRx for being there in my time of need . I ordered 2 bottles and gave one to my daughter to keep on hand in case she needs it.I began taking this immediately after I got it and the chest congestion began to loosen and cleared up in short order . I continued taking this until product was gone and I felt the better for it . I will be well positioned next cold/flu season by having this product on hand in advance .
 There 's nothing better for your cold or flu ... If you can stand the taste you 'll be just fine ... Try it ...
 This is a gr8 item and I will take this stuff the rest of my life.This is a gr8 item and I will take this stuff the rest of my life.This is a gr8 item and I will take this stuff the rest of my life .
 This stuff tastes awefull but it works really well . It 's difficult to find it in the drug stores anymore . At the first sign of sniffles , a cough or a sore throat , I start taking it .
 Tastes alittle different than when I was a kid.Don ' t need 20 words to say what I needed . It is an old-timer as far as cough syrups are concerned , My mother swore by it so thought I would try for the sake of old times .
 The product came in in tact and it had a good experation date . I use it to keep my faily healthy .
 My mother gave this to me when I was a little girl . I 'm so glad I found this on amazon ca n't find it in stores . This really work I will be ordering this again . I as well as my grandchildren use it . Thanks for listing this .
 When ever the product is on the shelf at the local market - it flies of the shelf . I have a really hard time finding . I decided to try my luck and order it . I could be more pleased . I ordered two , and plan to order more - just because I can ; t locate it locally . This product works . I was coughing uncontrollably - I took one good swallow of Father Johns and I promise the cough subsiding substantially , It did n't disappear but the frequency of it occurring was greatly minimize - I continue to take Father John and was able to sleep through the night with no coughing at all . For me , this is the answer - It really , really works .
 It 's exactly like I remember it from when I was a child . I started taking it when I felt a cold coming on and it knocked it right out of me ! . As for the taste ... I think it 's pretty good . Just make sure you shake it well each time to mix it up , or you might end up with too much cod liver oil on your spoon . Now that 's nasty . I 'm about to order some more Father J. Love it !
 prompt service and delivery of a product used when I was a kinder . It still works to releive coughs and congestion due to colds .

 My 4 yr old daughter has had this spray used on her since birth . She is still wearing pull ups at night so she gets a spray before the pull up goes on and first thing when it comes off . We love this stuff from the light scent to the fact that it works . Buy one - try it - if it is n't for you , so be it ... but we have sworn by this stuff for 4 yrs ... and I am at the site to buy more . : -RRB-
 Loved the all natural ingredients . Has a pleasing scent and the spray bottle is great . The small sample of baby soap was super nice . Thank you !
 I really love this candle . I found a small one in a gift shop and it lasted forever - I went online and found the company that makes them and bought this biggest one I could find . It has lasted so long and the scent does not over power a room like some candles do.I HIGHLY recommend this candle and the company !
 Lavendar is my scent . Not the sickly sweet candy type , but the earthy natural lavendar scent . This one fits the bill and is noce with the addition of the eucalyptus .
 I absolutely LOVE these soy candles . My absolute favorite scent is Lilac . It smells EXACTLY like my lilac bushes when they are blooming in the spring . Anytime someone walks in my room they comment on how great it smells . The candle lasts forever and I love that it is made from soy . Something about that just makes me feel calm . The other Bean Pod item I love are the Beads for plug in/heat up devices . I love Lilac and McIntosh Apple . They are both true to smell , the apple literally smells like a bunch of freshly sliced apples . I have not used any other scents , and I do not know that I will as these 2 are perfect.I was really surprised that there were some negative reviews , as I have been using this brand for over a year now and I am always satisfied . I hope this review helps .
 This candle has a great scent , just exactly what I had hoped it would be ! It has a light , clean scent which I just love ! I will definitely buy it again .
 This is a great candle ... burns long and makes the whole room smell delicious !! It brings back holiday times and makes the home smell like fresh cookies
 Beanpod candles are nice . Try them and you will see they have a smooth burn and nice aroma . I tried the automatic shipment program with Amazon.com thinking I could get a different candle fragrance each month , but I could find no way to do this at this time I am writing this . Pricing on Amazon.com is good . I would have paid more in a physical store paying the sales tax than I would buying the candle and paying the shipping charge . I know , I tried and it would have cost over $ 25 in a store for the 25oz size . Yankee Candles I used for about a year , but the Beanpod candle is just better in all aspects and on Amazon.com is much cheaper than buying in a physical store .
 Ordered my candle and had it quicker than I thought ! Love these candles and I will most certainly buy them again !
 this is the BEST candle i 've ever had , my mom and i love it and have bought this scent for several years now . we have a large , open kitchen/family room and when we burn this candle it fills the entire space ! i love it and will continue to purchase this scent . the shipping was fast too !
 After purchasing various types of candles for almost twenty years , I discovered Beanpod candles at a local gift store . Now they are the only candles I will buy . The fragrance is wonderful and they burn better than any other candle I 've ever had . They do n't leave the ugly wax ledges along the inside of the jar . The fragrance I prefer is lavender .
 I first smelled a beanpod candle at my mother 's house a few years ago . It was the cranberry clove scent , and I finally purchased one for myself recently . It is n't a scent I would have chosen based on its name alone because I would have feared that the clove smell would dominate . It does n't at all . I do n't really know how to describe the smell , but it 's a perfect scent for chilly weather . A couple of my favorite Yankee Candle scents are McIntosh and Harvest -LRB- just to give you an idea of my tastes -RRB- . I know some reviewers have had quality issues , but I have n't had any problems
 I usually get my Beanpod Eucalyptus Lavender at a local flower/gift shop , but they do n't carry this scent lately , so I ordered through Amazon via Soy Basics . It turned out to be great . It was the newer style jars and the scent was the same as ever . I 'm back to buy one or two more . I like to burn this scent after dinner , to get the food smells out of the house for bedtime . Burns clean . I 've seen other types of candles leave a film on cabinets or counter tops , these do n't . It is smokey when I blow it out , I just set on the stove top and turn on the vent if I feel like messing with getting the smoke out . So glad I found my brand and fragrance .
 really like this fragrance have used other ones wanted to get aquanity but read one review hadnt burned properly was a different fragrance so ordered 2 am on first one burned ok a slight wax left on side of jar . went tpo order more and had to get preships for same price we paid first time . so we are awaiting our next shipment . we are happy at prices . glad to find your web sight .
 I fell in love with these candles . They are fragrant and long-lasting . I light one in my bedroom and the aroma fills the entire level of my home !!!! Will never burn another candle again .

I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !

 The cream is working and my redness is slowly going away . Will continue touse it as I am tired of looking red all the time . Would recommend to anyone whosuffers with red skin .
 After so many products have n't helped me any , I was a little susceptible to try this , but my face has been in so much pain lately that I decided to give it one more go . Boy am I glad that I did . This stuff is fantastic ! My rosacea tends to feel -LRB- and look -RRB- like somebody is setting my face on fire , but as soon as I put this cream on , it instantly felt better . It took a few more uses before the redness and swelling really started to go away , but my face has been feeling and looking better ever since !
 I have rosacea where the little bumps break out on the end of my nose and around it . I know in terms of rosacea sufferers , this is pretty minor -- but it 's been distressing to me ! In May ' 09 , my mother bought me some of this Miracle of Aloe cream to try . It helped tremendously ! It virtually stopped the bump breakouts and reduced the slight redness on my cheeks . On the few occasions I did have a small flare up , I felt as thought it healed quicker and looked less red because of the aloe . Since using this I 've had compliments on my skin ; I even think it 's helped with wrinkles a tad -LRB- but I 'm not promoting it as anti-wrinkle cream -RRB- . I would highly recommend trying this product . I will say it 's effectiveness is best when used 2-3x a day .
 I purchased this product together with another product -LRB- Prosacea -RRB- as my FINAL attempt to get some relief from my ever-worsening condition . Prior to this , I had tried several other natural products ranging from anti-fungals to various `` healing '' creams . Nothing had helped at all . I decided to make one final search for something and found this pair of products . Unlike with previous products that I had tried using one-at-a-time so I would know which one was helping -LRB- and since none of them did any good -RRB- , I tried using these two products together . After a week or so I began to notice some drying/flaking of my skin . And , low and behold , after rubbing off the dead skin , the underlying skin was much lighter in color . It 's been several weeks nowof twice daily application of the two products , and the condition continues to improve , little by little ... Praise God for leading me to these products !
 I just received this yesterday and already my skin is calmed down . And it feels really nice going on . Very soothing and cooling actually . I also like how it 's slightly tinted which helps decrease the redness . As an added bonus , it did n't make me break out . I recommond this product very highly .
 I ordered four different kinds of creams for my red face and this one 's the best by far . Thanks rosacea cream .
 I 've suffered from redness and flare ups on my cheeks for a few years now , I 've tried numerous over the counter products with only mediocre results . Right from the first application I noticed an instant and dramatic improvement . I 'd estimate the redness has been reduced by 90 % , and my skin is much smoother and healthy looking . I 've been using it 2-3 times a day and I 've got to say my face looks the best it has in years . Nothing short of amazing ! I highly recommend giving this a try !
 I have suffered with Rosacea for my entire life . . a couple of years ago I came across this wonderful product . . I only wish that I had researched a relief product years ago . . this product does work wonders for me . . its cool to the skin when applying . . also I have noticed that when I have a flair up they are mild . . no longer do I get the flaming red cheeks or neck . . I recommend this product to anyone who is tired of the embarrassing results of Rosacea.You will be quite pleased !
 My stepson some how lost the clamps for the frame of his queen bed so we had to buy some more . Looked all over our town and could not find any , so came here to amazon and found these . Work great and now his box spring does n't fall out of the frame .
 My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl / xv1lP , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals , and also provides prevention against them :1 -RRB- Asthma2 -RRB- Chronic venous insufficiency -LRB- a condition that involves leg swelling , 3 -RRB- varicose veins , pain , itching , and other skin changes -RRB- 4 -RRB- High blood pressure -LRB- hypertension -RRB- 5 -RRB- Retinopathy -LRB- an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes -RRB- 6 -RRB- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -LRB- ADHD -RRB- 7 -RRB- Blood clots in the legs -LRB- deep vein thrombosis -RRB- 8 -RRB- Diabetes9 -RRB- Impotence -LRB- also known as erectile dysfunction or ED -RRB- 10 -RRB- High cholesterol11 -RRB- Male infertility12 -RRB- Heart attacks or strokes13 -RRB- Leg cramps14 -RRB- Pregnancy pains -LRB- such as back pain , pelvic pain , and leg cramps -RRB- 15 -RRB- Painful menstrual periods -LRB- dysmenorrhea -RRB- .16 -RRB- Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance . `` So , tell me what it cant heal ? '' I asked . But whatever I had a try . I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time . I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely . At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning . My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma , neither of which I have had before . The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay !! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too . I plan to start taking this twice a day instead of once so I 'm hoping that will help .
 I have been doing step aerobics and running for many years and recently my heels started to hurt when I put weight on them . I ordered these heel cups and they relieved the pain almost immediately . I have been wearing them non stop , even around the house . The reason I deducted a star is because as other reviewers have noted , they tend to slip around . Next time I will purchase an entire insole and see if that stays put better .
 I wear the left heel cup to make up for my longer right leg since right knee replacement surgery , and it makes me much more comfortable . The only problem with it is that it must be placed correctly in the shoe each time that I wear the shoe .
 I 'm on my feet a lot and have recently started to give me problems . After much research I found these low profile gel cups . They are extremely comfortable , do n't slip around and are a lifesaver !! Going to buy more because I find myself switching them out into the shoes i 'm wearing for that day . I wear a size 8/normal width shoe and they fit perfect .
 Good material , already tested in the past it really helps with heel pain . Fits easily in every kind of shoes . Though keep in mind better to be used to prevent , rather than to cure .
 I have purchased products locally that did not really give me the help I wanted . These fit my needs very well .
 I used this product for a calcaneal stress fracture in my heel and it allowed me to continue playing soccer with it on . It was kinda bulky in the shoe , but it was much better than playing without it .
 I have bone spurs , and I have tried everything . My doctor wrote a prescription for a specially made padding for my heel . He showed me , they were padded heel cups , cut out in the center of the heel . I found out they were going to be $ 80 or more . After the shock , I went to Amazon and ordered Tuli 's Gel Cups . Tried them out and was instantly relieved from the pressure . I took a small cutting tool , cut out the whole , just like the one I was shown and have worn them since . It is amazing how my feet feel , I know longer have that severe , throbbing pain . These were price far lower than any I have seen . The best thing I could have done for my feet .
 These heal cups are amazing ! I wear them in all my closed shoes . It keeps your heal from rubbing up against the back of the shoe , very comfortable .
 After a self-diagnosis of plantar fasciitis , I searched the Internet for some relief . I found a running website that recommended rest , ice , and the Tuli heel cup -LRB- of which there are several kinds -RRB- . Further investigation indicated that the Tuli Gel Polar Bears might make a good choice.I was n't too happy when the package from Amazon arrived because I had bought nails for my nail gun to qualify for the free shipping , and they had erupted from their box and were loose in the larger packing container . Then when I tried to extricate the gel heel pads from their plastic prison , they appeared to be welded to the sides . The pads are stronger than they appeared and came out with no tears.So here is the purpose of this babbling review
 I had a heel flare up out of nowhere a few months ago and hobbled around in severe pain . After researching a bit on the internet , I discovered that this condition is quite common and easy to remedy by wearing heel cups for several weeks/months . To say these cups were a lifesaver is putting it mildly because I could barely walk . I chose to wear them in both shoes because since they came as a pair , I figured I might as well wear them as a pair . I like that they make me a little taller , too : -RRB- Now , I have no more pain and do n't even have to wear them anymore . Also , I used these doing yard work and got dirt all in my shoes . These are easily washable right in the kitchen sink . Pretty much only have to rinse them and dirt comes right off .
 I used the Tuli 's Heavy Duty Gel Heel Cups when I had plantar fascitis . After that cleared up I got these heel cups because the sides are not as tall so they do n't show over the top of my shoes . These still have the waffle pattern in the center so they give the same comfort as the heel cups with the waffle pattern all over . I also like the idea that you can hand wash these when needed .
 I bought these heel cups because I was having extreme pain in my heels during my runs and after my runs . It hurt to walk even a day later after my run . I bought this product and can honestly say all my heel pain is gone . I would recommend these heel cups to anyone having heel pain .
 My -LRB- quite active -RRB- son had injured his heel , and for more than a month had great difficulty walking for extended periods , and was not able to particiapate in sports at all . After getting an MRI to confirm there was no fracture or other problem that could be exacerbated by activity , a physical therapist suggested these heel cups . The night he got them , he was able to return to soccer with minimal discomfort .
 I have used this tape before this order . It was difficult to find the wide , tan tape . This is a wonderful tape as it is porous , flesh color -LRB- not a glaring white -RRB- , and adheres to the skin without being difficult to remove . The order was sent very quickly so I had it before I ran out of the one I had . I recommend this tape to anyone .
 This is agreat price for the tape . It is the exact same tape as listed on there site . There also shipped it very promply .
 I bought this tape because I kept getting rashes left on my skin from all the other tapes I used . This tape has been great it does n't cause rashes on my skin , it has the right amount of stickiness , not too much and not to little . It 's easy to peel off and tear , no scissors are needed with this tape . If you are looking for a tape that is effective but yet gentle on the skin , buy this .
 As far as wound care goes , this tape is mediocre at best . The tiniest amount of sweat or moisture on the skin causes it to peel right off , rendering it fairly useless for holding a dressing in place.The one area where this tape really shines , however , is in binding orchestral sheet music parts . The 1 '' Micropore tape is absolutely the best solution I 've found for taping orchestral music parts together . It sticks just enough to hold the pages together perfectly , yet not so much that it ca n't be repositioned without destroying your parts . It 's extremely thin , easy to tear to length , folds perfectly , and does n't stretch at all . It 's about as sticky as masking tape , but much thinner and much stronger.I 'm constantly being complimented on how my parts are bound , and it has everything to do with this tape!Stop using Scotch or masking tape -- and buy this immediately . You will not be disappointed !
 My husband had cataract surgery recently and was so impressed with the adhesive quality of this tape he decided he wanted some . Not sure what we will do with 12 rolls but some reviewers did have some novel ways to use it . It is amazing . He was able to use the same piece of tape for 5 days .
 I have to cover my stoma several times a day and I have found the 3M Micropore Paper Tape to hold the best while still allowing the skin to breathe somewhat . A plus foe me the color matches my skin and is hardly noticeable . I highly recommend it .
 this tape works great does not pull on skin or leave any residue , this bulk tape has become hard to find in my local drug store
 Definitely recommend this product ! Who wants &#34; white &#34; tape when you can have TAN tape ! Easy to use and little-to-no tape residual which is a bonus .
 I purchased this tape to use for compiling music play books . I used it has a hinge to fasten together clear plastic protector sheets that contain my music . The music is filed in 3-ring binders . It works great ! I have used the books every day and the tape is holding up very well with heavy use . It is easy to apply , and if you make a mistake , it is easy to remove and replace . Since my original project , I have used it to make labels on plastic ware stored in the refrigerator and freezer . It performs with excellence ! It is also great for medical use in wrapping gauze bandages . It holds well and the bandages do n't slip .
 This is the second time I have purchased this tape and I was not disappointed . It is a 3M product so it 's not some generic flimsy brand . It sticks and then some . I have to use it for bandaging my legs with big pads and it hold them on just fine . I have sensitive skin and so I can only use this paper tape . Much less expensive than any of the local grocery or drug stores .
 This tape does stick though it may require some pressure to be applied in the form of clothing or a wrap.Im using it as a dressing post BRS and its great for holding the incision areas closed to reducing scarring . Ive been instructed to change the tape once a week for the next five months . The quantity provided by the supplier seems more than enough.Its breathable and pretty solidly stuck for up to the week duration when it starts peeling on its own with washing every day . I suspect baby oil and creams may speed this as well .
 I needed these items for school bags we were gathering at school . It was a great buy and savings . The product did the job and works .
 Just having some swab etc. wet will oil would do the same job . But this thing gives the oil evaporation an oomph because of the heat . I just have to remember to pull it out a bit when exiting the car , as the lighter outlet does n't power down with ignition . no big deal though , since I have a nice smelling interior ready for the next ride.I have had no problem adding my own oils to the existing tablet , once it goes dry ...
 The aroma comes out very strong , the only con I found is that the device gets really hot and I fear it burning the dc outlet so I plug it in for very short intervals .
 got this for my friend -LRB- especially for when she lets my dog ride around in her ride -RRB- . she loves it . kinda prefer the ones that have a bottle you can add oil to , but i though this might be more simple for her . she can surely just add a few drops to the felt diffuser tabs - or buy more . she said she likes the scent and it quickly engulfed her whole SUV -LRB- tho it still smelled a lil like dog - oh well -RRB-
 great product for my sinuses . great in the car because I 'm a smoker and it doubles as an air freshener ! I also have the home unit . quite satisfied .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed .

The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .

 Easy to install and works slick . I especially appreciate the ability to record TV data directly into the MPEG format since all of my video capture and editing activities are built around this format . I did get an occasional series of faint diagonal bars in the signal when recording off of a satellite but not off of an over-the-air signal .
 Actually I bought these for my pets . They work great and are cheaper than the pads at the pet store . Great product . Quick service .
 Overall great product . I would recommend using lotion first if your skin is dry . It does n't absorb well . It does have a nice scent and flavor .
 this product was heaven sent for me , i swear . i have never waxed anything and for my first time doing it at home , i got ta say im glad i found this and bought it before spending money at the salon . lol i was about to give up on this product while doing my first underarm but then i realized that i wasnt pulling the wax in the right direction , ooops . it works wonders when done right , if you are not satisfied with this you must be doing something wrong because IT WORKS , i have crazy thick/coarse hair EVERYWHERE and this product took it all out straight from the root . . give it a chance to work for you : -RRB-
 I can not say how much i love this product , i have never been able to use wax and get all my hair out unless im a a salon , the wax strips dont work for me , i have been relying on threading and tweezing for my upper lip and eyebrows , both of which are very painful to me . I tried this wax for facial hairs for the first time a few minutes ago and all the hair is gone with the first try and its allmost painless.i could see all the lil hairs on the wax with the roots they look like a lil brush , lol . im gon na buy the wax for the body , im excited to try it and say goodbye to razors and daily shaving .
 I have been using this wax for years and it is the best on the market . I have had problems with regular wax using muslin strips -LRB- torn skin -RRB- but never with this hardening wax . I just apply tap it with my finger until it is not sticky and then pull it off - perfect !!! Also fast and not messy .
 I love this wax . I have PCOS and it causes me to have more hair on my face then I should have . I bought this from a salon store and thought hey lets see if it works ? It did . No you do n't need muslin strips to take it off but it helps and if you do n't have muslin use coffee filters . If you do n't follow the directions then this product does n't work right . Hope this was helpful .
 Very nice kit , just as described . All of the medications are current , and good for at least 18 months , some more . Room to add your own meds , bandages , ect . Two watertight press seal bags , within the yellow and blue bag shown , keep things safe and organized .
 I ordered this Adventure Ultralight/Watertight .9 Medical Kit as an addition to my bug out bags . My bag out bags are for a family of 3 . I received it today and am surprised at how small and light it really is . Given I was a trained EMT who carried a fully stocked EMT gear bag , I think I was expecting something a bit more substantial . But I wo n't count that against them . Plus , I do n't think that 's necessarily a bad thing given that the weight of this kit makes it ideal for hikers or evacuees.The exterior bag -LRB- yellow -RRB- is made of a very fine plastic which feels a bit flimsy , but is watertight . I would be afraid it would get ripped if it was stored in a compartment with any tools or instruments . -LRB- In my case , I have an additional medic compartment to my backpack dedicated solely for medical supplies . -RRB- The contents of the bag are zip-locked sealed inside two waterproof bags . There is a bit of spare room in both bags to allow one to personalize this kit by adding a few additional small items . In my case , I will be adding several additional supplies to make it more comprehensive.After sorting through the contents , I am glad to report that none of the items have expired . The earliest expiration date I found was well into the year 2014 . Overall , given the price , overall packaging , and weight , I think this is a fantastic kit for basic first-aid . Once I have added a few more items , it will be perfect for my bug out bag !
 Used this medical kit while traveling . I liked that it contained pretty much everything I needed . However I took off 1 star because I wish it had contained more antiseptic / antibiotic cream instead of the 4 packets that were inside . I also wish that it had more alcohol wipes for cleaning wounds and hands . I added these and a few more bandaids and believe that the kit is now very complete . Will use it for future traveling and hiking . The contents of the kit were not expired so had no issues with that .
 I like the size of this kit for travel and the light weight is great for my back pack.I 've added a couple of items to it which fit without a problem.The color is bright and easy to see in backpack as well.Waterproof.Recommend .
 This kit replaces my 1 lb . 9oz . group-size first aid kit and right out of the box saved me a pound from my pack weight . It contains everything one could want for a weekend hiking trip , except for scissors and plenty of advil and/or tylenol . -LRB- I added those items , but not anything else . -RRB- I would have given it 5 stars if it contained a small set of scissors.I love the fact that it is water resistant , which my old kit was not , and I consider the waterproof bags to be easy to open and close . I am hoping that I never have to use this for anything major , but if I do , it contains everything that I would probably use as an avid , long-time hiker and explorer !
 The .5 kit is great . It seems legitimately water tight -LRB- have n't had a chance to test that -RRB- and it 's the perfect size for my bail out bag . I may make some additions to things in there . Other buyers have reported expired medications I received none of that . I assume they improved on providing unexpired medication . I will be making some of my own personal additions to this small medical kit . Hopefully it will never have to be used . : -RRB-
 great packing and weight . excellent for mountain biking , hiking , climbing , and pretty much any outdoor or extreme sports activities.The nylon yellow bag will let you stuff in an additional thing or too .
 This is an excellent kit for long backpacking trips . My girlfriend made fun of me carrying this until she needed it , now she likes it . : -RRB- The waterproof bags inside are high quality , as are the contents . I would recommend that you add a tube of Neosporin . The only other thing I added was some burn gel .
 This kit contains the basic first aid materials plus a few bonuses that were impressive . It should be good for most injuries occuring in the environment for which it was designed . Nice , light weight case - I like the waterproof bags inside the case .
 The kit is light , small , and have all essentials in it . Very waterproof . There is space to put your own meds there .
 When I opened the bag to see what was included , I could not believe all the items that are included in this medical kit . I was afraid the items might be stale or near expiration date but everything appears to be fresh . Considering ordering another for my wife 's backpack being that I am a firm believer you can never be too prepared .
 I did my research before buying this item . I 've spoken highly of Adventure Medical Kits in the past and I was not surprised when I received the Ultra-light/Watertight .7 . True to its name , the kit is super lightweight -LRB- around 6 ounces or so -RRB- . It comes with the basics as far as quick patch job medical supplies go but the clear DryFlex bag bag still has room to add several more items for customization . I 'm going to keep this kit in my personal bug-out bag . I picked up the larger Outfitter kit for my extended getaway bug-out box as well . AMK is the way to go if you want reasonably priced , well thought out , functional , transportable , and easily customizable medical kits .
 Has good basic equipment needed for quick fixes when out on a trail . It is light and easy to carry in a pack
 Just thought I would add that the kit that I received has all current medications that do n't expire for 1-3 years.The quality is very high , there is a pretty good seal on the outer main pouch ; and the inner bags are also sealed . Everything looks great and this thing really is LIGHT . Excellent purchase , I will probably buy several more .
 Perfect size and contents . I take mine on 3 to 4 day backpacking trips and its the perfect amount of medical gear and sill takes up little room in my pack
 The medical kit arrived in record time . I 've used this on hiking trips before and it has just about everything you would need . You may want to get an extra roll of moleskin if your hiking as you will probably use up what they give you rather quickly . Other than that , it is an essential item in my travel bags . This one 's going in my car emergency backpack.Steve BerryBattery Universe -LSB- ... -RSB-
 It 's great it has everything u need for a few days . Good for a weekend camping trip I plan on getting two more one for my wifes car an one for my truck good to have
 This medical kit is great for day hikes and kayaking . It has just enough stuff and I added some additional things like emergency blanket and more custom tools.It is very light and there is still some room in the bag . I use it in very humid conditions therefore it is great that they packed it in two waterproof bags.The price was good , too .
 As a family of four , we have two cars and always seem to run out of bandaids at home . We looked at pricing a DIY medical kit , but things quickly got expensive and were n't as `` self contained '' as the individual drug pouches , etc. . We look at a lot of kits and many contain a lot of stuff we would n't know how to use or what to use them for . These adventure medical kits include essentials , with some nice additions -LRB- like Duct tape -RRB- . These are better priced and equipped than comparable kits -LRB- like from your car dealer or some others -RRB- and does n't have a lot of `` waste '' and have a lot of the stuff I would 've gotten on my own in my DIY kit , but at a better overall rate . So , we got 3 , 1 that lives in each car and 1 that lives in the house that we take with us on trips -LRB- lightweight enough to carry on a hike or even on vacation -RRB- . Kids inevitably get scrapes and cuts . Parents tend to get headaches . Now , I 'll keep an eye on the expiration dates for the medicines in these kits ... I would have to anyway if I made my own kit -LRB- stuff expires -RRB- . And while I do n't know if the medicines or tape or band aids are brand names or generics in this kit , it 's a good price and seems to have everything I 've ever needed . It feels good to know that , in the car , I have enough on hand to quickly address an issue for 1-4 people.You can determine whether the smaller kits make more sense ... as , let 's face it , the odds of 4 people getting injured all at the same time is slight ... but , I like the feeling that I have enough `` stuff '' to quickly apply first aid to my entire family and that I do n't have to `` skimp '' on a dressing because it can handle more than 1 person .
 This is an outstanding and comprehensive kit for its size . It is a big brother to the also excellent .5 and .7 models . I prefer this one as I appreciate a bit of extra gear for extended overnighters or for when I have family or friends along on dayhikes . The kit covers basic first aid needs that you may encounter on hiking , camping , climbing , or boating adventures , and also works quite well for a car-bound first aid kit . Below is a breakdown of main points and features : * Very water resistant - The contents of the bag come in two Dryflex bags -LRB- basically snazzy plastic bags with zip-lock closures -RRB- contained in a silnylon sack with taped seams and a water resistant zipper . I am very hesitant to call anything waterproof unless it takes a serious dunking in water over an extended period of time . This kit is fairly well protected , though , and can take serious rain without damaging the contents inside . This amounts to a kit that will stand up to adverse conditions and still be there when you need it most . I would take normal precautions with this -LRB- potentially lifesaving -RRB- gear and not let it sit in water , of course . * Compact - Though bigger in girth than the .5 and .7 versions , it is still quite small and lives discreetly at the bottom of my 18 liter daypack . While I can say that it 's perhaps too large for a short solo run , I would absolutely bring this for an extended trail run . One of the reasons I like this kit is that it gives me many more options while staying fairly compact . I know I have everything I need whether I am alone , hiking with four people , or overnight , or with my family in the backcountry for a week . Yes , it 's a tad heavier and larger than the smaller kits , but only by a bit and this is one time when I appreciate the additional insurance that comes with a bit more girth and weight . * Comprehensive - this kit really covers a lot of ground
 I recently purchased this for someone else to take on their backpacking trip . I am an EMT in Montana , and I am very impressed with the amount of quality equipment they packed in there . Weight is a huge factor when you are hiking , and this kit weighs next to nothing , yet still has enough stuff to do a lot of work if needed . This has got to be , by far , the lightest and most versatile first aid kit out there for hiking/backpacking , and I would highly recommend it to anyone .
 This , and the .5 -LRB- for day hikes -RRB- are the only kits I carry now ; I leave a larger kit in the vehicle . I have n't found a more useful and lightweight kit out there . Nothing but the essentials , with room for a few personal meds.I think this and the .5 are the best buys for the money -- the .7 is n't enough more or less.If you are serious about weight , and confident in your abilities to manage a situation with a `` limited '' amount of gear , this is the kit for you .
 I bought this kit for a backpacker trip through Costa Rica . It truly was light weight and took up little room in the backpack . I had to add a couple of things , like small scissors for cutting moleskin , and a few extra bandages , and there was plenty of room to put these in the kit . I have not had opportunity to test the water tight aspect of the kit , but based on my satisfaction so far , I have no doubts it will live up to this claim as well .
 I received my .5 kit today , which I bought for solo backpacking . It 's even smaller and lighter than I expected . Quality seems good . I 'm quite pleased.The earliest expiration date on any of the medications is May 2011 , about 14 months away . I 'm not a doctor or anything , but those meds are probably OK to use for 2 or 3 years.They no longer use Aloksak bags ; the bag is labeled `` Dry Flex . `` There is a fair amount of room in the ripstop bag for other gear . I had no problem fitting an AMK Pocket Survival Pak inside . The waterproof bag is already pretty full , however .
 I bought this for my honeymoon cruise . We were going on excursions where we would be walking around Mayan ruins , which ends up being several miles of walking per site . My wife has a tendency to get blisters , so I was glad that this kit came with moleskin . The kit is small and light enough to be negligible as far as I am concerned . I just tossed it in a small zipper pouch in my camera backpack and forgot about it . Sure enough , the first day out my wife got a blister on the ball of her foot , and it was hurting her to the point that should could n't walk . I pulled out the pre-cut moleskin and she put it on . She immediately felt better and we were able to continue uninterrupted . That alone was worth the $ 10 I payed for the kit . As a bonus , one night before dinner one of the straps on her dress broke . She asked if I had a safety pin , and of course I did n't , because why the hell would I ? Then I remembered that this kit came with a few , and I saved the day again.This kit is well worth the money if you need something small .
 To address concerns regarding expired product , I am including a detailed item list here with expiration dates.Ordered on May 1 , 2011 . Received on May 10 , 2011 . Compound Benzoin Tincture Swabstick - 12-2012Antihistamine - 7-2012Ibuprofen - 10-2012Aspirin - 8-2013Antibiotic - 3-2013AfterBite - 5-2013There are other items such as band aids which do not have expiration dates . I am not listing them here but they were included.These expiration dates seem reasonable , so I am giving this product 5 stars -LRB- even though I have n't actually used any of the product and I hope I wo n't ever have to -RRB- .
 This is a waterproof , ultralight first aid kit by Adventure medical kits . They have a website , that shows contents . What most of think of as first aid is bandaging/bleeding first aid , and yes , this kit can do that sort , but You may need more specialized gear to treat that major injury , load up a 50 gram pack of pure stop leak , QUIKCLOT . THis keeps the resulting kit light , and improves it 's use for hunting and outdoor purposes , tremendously . Preppers and survivalists , too.In fact . you can use this kit as the core of a kit similar to the Ultralight pro kit . More battle dressings , and such will fit easily . Mostly because if a little kit is good , a bigger kit has to be better . If you are on foot , that may not be true , and this kit is fine.If you are using motorized transport go for the larger kit . The only thing this kit gives you that is NOT included in every kit , is the organized waterproof inner and outr bags . So a gallon sized ziploc bag will do for the inner bag , and you simply need a cover/case for the rest . or throw a few of these kits in there so that when you want to go out for a hike or a day in the woods , you are equipped.The next thing is NON-prescription drugs . Triple antibiotic ointment with anesthetic , is a must , as is an antihistamine . The bare essentials are here , you need to decide what other things YOU need and put a supply in . These drugs expire , so check it out twice a year -LRB- change your clocks forward/back , put new batteries in your smoke alarms and update you first aid kit , too . -RRB-
 This is exactly what I was looking for in planning a 7 + Day kayak trip for about 6 . It says only up to 4people but if you do n't go out adventuring with noobs this should be good enough . I added a foil emergency blanket and a pair of HeatFactory pads in case of hypothermia . It 's surprisingly small and light . Putting together a medkit such as this would cost a lot more and would n't be nearly as light nor waterproof . Hope I do n't need it but now I feel confident in case of emergency .
 This first aid kit worked perfect for two people for a nine backpacking adventure in the jungle in Panama . It is lighweight , compact , and very versatile . Could use something to help with bug bites .
 Seems like it will hold up well in my ruck . No complaints . Has a little more room in both internal pouches for a few more supplies and when inside the external &#34; bivvy &#34; it has room for a few more there as well . Good deal for what you get .
 This is a nice , compact kit . I take mine hiking frequently and for travel to undeveloped countries . I fortunately have n't had a need to use anything other than medications and moleskin !
 Good Solid Kit for what i needed it for . Added a package of quick clot , some sunscreen wipes , and a few others that you dont find in any other premade medical kits anyways . I think for the price its hard to beat because its as lightweight as its going to get with the contents inside . The fact that its very resilient but NOT completely waterproof is excellent . Most kits dont consider that and what good is your med kit if everything is soaked . Bright color is easy to see and easily recognized as a med kit . I would buy again . You ca n't build a kit for any cheaper with the quality of this kit . Everything is quality . And yes , I took everything out and put it back together . I 'm anal about things like that . I like to know what I have and where it is.If your looking for a premade kit . AMK 's are hard to beat . Pick up one of these cause it should already be in your pack.NOTE ! I put a 25 gram packet of quickclot in mine , I feel as if a 50gram will NOT fit . the 25 gram had a perfect maximum fit .
 This is a great little first aid kit , has most everything I need , I keep one in my car and one in my home . I just wish it had a tourniquet
 Delivers what you know you need and some extras that you would n't think you need , without weighing down your pack . Sure you could put all this stuff together on your own , but for the price you ca n't beat the pre-assembled pack . I found myself pulling this out of my backpacking supplies to take with us on outings with the kids so often , that I decided to buy a second one for just that purpose .
 I have this stored in my hiking backpack . It is very handy and comes with lots of stuff . Everything comes in sealable , waterproof bags that go inside a waterproof zipper pouch . There is a little room to add some extra stuff , but not a lot .
 I 'm amazed on how much stuff they packed in this little package ! And there is room to add my own stuff ! Worth every Penny !
 This is a good product in my opinion , nice size for back packing or for survival usage . This has all the basic items in it needed for cuts , burns , sprains , insects , diarhea , headaches , poison oak and from the items in it , it is possible for it to be used for a gunshot wound , now do n't get me wrong , I mean `` possible , '' There is no substitute for professional medical care . Their is much , much more in this bag and has many more uses that would take far to long to write , however , I would recommmend this as a quick use first aid kit for backpacking or survial use .
 I have n't used this in the field yet but it seems to have everything I need for my Mt.Rainier expedition next month . The product is extremely light and is definitely water proof . I look forward to using it .
 I was on a hike with my friend , and our sons , and one of the boys hurt himself , nothing serious , but it was a reminder of what could happen , and how I was not prepared . So , I did a little research , and looked at first aid kits , and got an idea of what a basic one should include . With the exception of a couple items -LRB- space blanket , and clotting pad , which I bought separately -RRB- this kit had the basic needs met , in a good watertight bag , at a good size to fit in my packs . I got two , one for my hydration pack , and one for my large day pack . Not my amended kits just live in my packs , and I do n't have to think about it again , unless I need them .
 This is the perfect size for taking along on any adventure when pack weight is important . Basic necessities for burns , cuts , and scrapes . Great for the price . If you allow the kit to catch fire and base part of your review on that , you probably should n't be putting up a review , now should you ? :-RRB- Anyway , if anything is expired when you receive it , I 'm pretty sure they will replace or refund the item . Do n't sweat it .
 When I received my Adventure Medical .9 I opened it up and checked the contents , everything was there that was expected . However the moleskin was not precut , a plus in my book , but others may disagree . The outer waterproof bag contains two inner waterproof bags , perfect if you want a striped down kit for a day-hike . Fully packed there is still a bit of extra room to supplement your own equipment , but if you plan on adding a lot , be prepared to remove some items . As far as expiration dates , the earliest was April 2013 but was ibuprofen so easily replaced , and the average was in 2014 . Very satisfied .
 There is a lot of stuff in here that you can take out and replace with your own stuff , but it is a good product and lightweight once you edit .
 This is the kit you want to buy for hunting , hiking , and any real outdoor activity i have n't had a chance to use it thank god but still its nice to know its there when my uncle went hunting with a buddy a log fell on his leg , do n't know how , but it broke his leg in 2 and he had one of these kit to stop the pain , do an emergency tourniquet , and reduce the swelling for a while he told me that after 30 min he could stop the swelling because it was just to much . when he got to the hospital the doctor told my uncle that he pretty much saved his friends leg . thats why i choose this kit from that story he told me and i hope never to use it but i rather be safe then sorry . he was ok by the way but it was the last day he ever went hunting again but still loves to go camping and takes a kit with him every time .
 This is an excellent addition to the pack on my bike -LRB- motorcycle -RRB- . The only thing I needed to add was a bee sting/bug bite ointment .
 If you 're hiking or camping , you 're probably going to take along a first-aid kit . Since you probably do n't know enough to assemble your own , then you 're buying a pre-assembled kit . What you should care most about is the contents.If you compare the contents of this kit to others , there 's a lot of supplies here for the size and money . I prefer this ultralight/watertight packaging instead of the heavy cordura nylon or plastic cases like you find on other kits . Regardless , I always carry my kit in a zip-loc freezer bag to make sure if does n't get punctured or wet.The supplies are in two small heavy-duty plastic bags with zip-loc tops inside a light nylon zipper bag . Make sure they 're zipped closed and you 've burped all the air out of the bags , especially if you 're going on an airplane . I would also suggest packaging the various drugs in an additional plastic bag to make sure they 're not destroyed in the event of water leakage.Note that this is what I consider to be a comfort-type medical kit , not a hard-core first-aid kit . It 's also not for tactical use . There 's no huge bandage for large , bloody wounds , there 's no splints , burn gel or tourniquet . This will allow you deal with cuts and scrapes and various travel discomfort , more like a well-stocked medicine cabinet at home . There 's nothing wrong with this , it 's just the limitations of size in a kit like this . You 're not going to be doing any emergency surgery.Also , a first-aid kit is n't magic . You still have to know what to do if something goes wrong . Take a wilderness first-aid class from REI or buy a decent book.Only 4 stars because -LRB- 1 -RRB- there no first-aid manual and -LRB- 2 -RRB- I have n't actually used it yet .
 I received this kit -LRB- the .5 -RRB- 3 days before the expected delivery date . I like it a lot . Fits well in my Maxpedition Jumbo , which is my EDC/GHB . I checked the expiration dates on every thing and I have about 18 months of good dates , which is better than many preassembled kits . I check all my first aid products annually any how . I had room to add a bit more in the areas of pain relief , burn gel and antibiotic ointment . I can barely feel the the weight of the kit . I plan on ordering the .9 or the weekender for my car . I really like this product and the fact that there is a little room in the bag to customize it a bit .
 Very light weight and water proof . Much cheaper than REI or other brands , yet has the same contents . Only concern is the durability .
 Four stars for nice little bright yellow medical kit . The nice thing is that there 's room to add more of what you desire in a medical kit , such as a supply of any prescription meds , etc. . Having worked in graphic design , I know that yellow is the first color you notice , so if you need to get to this quickly , it will be easy to find . It says the bag is water-tight , which is a plus . Both the water-tight feature and yellow color make it a smart place to enclose a copy of your important documents ! I included these in our emergency grab-and go bags -- I already had a different first aid kit in my car . The elders in our congregation advise having a grab-and-go backpack to get family through 3 to 5 days in case of disaster . My sister works for Homeland Security , and she advises that , too . After five days , I would rely on faith in my God , Jehovah , to get me through ... I was able to find everything I needed for emergency backpack on Amazon , which was nice to have it delivered instead of having to drive and search through lots of different stores . The only thing keeping me from giving this medical kit five stars is that it does n't already include everything you 'll need . But , I prefer this one due to the convenience of the size , the color , being water-tight , and the room to add more .
 AMK 's .7 kit is a good FAK -LRB- first aid kit -RRB- . It is missing a small scissors and mole skin , but overall a good hiking FAK . It now resides in my day pack and does not take up much room . Very good starting point for those who would rather buy a small kit than put one together .
 Great size , good contents , everything you 'd need in a little first aid kit . I 'd add in extra bandaids and a tube of antibotic gel from my medicine cabinet , but other than that , very complete .
 I purchased this pack for a corporate leadership training course.I needed something light weight , but comprehensive . This kit fit that criteria.It has everything from cotton swabs , bandages , sterile dressings , diarrhea medicine , allergic symptoms medicine , gloves , safety pins and much more.Flat out this was the most comprehensive light weight kit that I could find . I 'm very please with the value of this product .
 I just love these kits ! I also have the .9 and the pocket survival . This kit is perfect for at work . All my meds were dated from 2013 to 2015 ! The items inside are good quality from Dukal ace bandage type to Jaybird & Mais cloth tape just as good as Coach to me . The splinter/tic removers are small but very good quality . The band-aids are from Genuine first aid company , and are fabric type with pretty good adhesive . The gauze pads are nice quality as well.I own quite a few first aid kits from Johnson & Johnson who 's band-aids rock ! To kits From REI and a nice sports refill from Survival metrics , up to full EMT kits for home use . Choosing the right kit does take a little time . Fist and most important is to figure out you use of it ? home , car , work , outdoors , a mommy boo boo kit or survival or minor surgery out in the woods or ?? as all kits are very different in price , size and quality . The most pieces for the money usually gets you poor quality items . Not all kits will fit your needs perfectly so aim for the closest and add as you need . Soft kits are great for hiking or if in a safe place were not to get squished ! A hard case is perfect in the car or house in case it gets tossed around.So far , this kit has the best quality bags inside and out . They show 2 bags which is not for the .7 kit , this kit is ONE bag of items . The .9 is two bags with room for your own stuff as well . I added meds to this pack as you get 3 ibuprofen , 1 aspirin , and 2 antihistamines . Hiking in the sun can bring a few headaches , so the more people the more meds . As far as the Moleskin it says pre-cut and shaped , not in my pack , I got 1 square sheet of it , that 's it . The tincture of benzoin topical adhesive was also missing as a few butterfly 's as well , but they have great customer service - so no problem . Also check your kit thoroughly as the company will substitute items as needed to keep production going , so you might be missing one thing but have something else that 's not listed on pack to make up for it.Bottom line
 I just got the .9 kit in the mail yesterday and everything is as advertised . I was not missing any supplies listed on the package nor did they substitute for anything on the list . I received the exact product shown in the pictures with the yellow exterior bag and two interior bags . All medications had expiration dates from 2013 to 2015 . I would recommend adding a good pair of medical scissors , neosporin , and some additional bandaids to round out the pack . I also added some additional gauze even though the pack comes with a good variety and amount . You can go through gauze really quickly when dealing with an injury that involves heavy bleeding.I will carry this with me in my cycling backpack and I recommend that you add a first aid kit to the standard supplies you carry when riding -LRB- spare tube , tire patch kit , tire pressure gauge , multi tool , ect ... -RRB- . You never know when you are going to take a nasty fall and need this stuff or may need to assist another rider who has wrecked and needs some attention.This is lightweight , small , and waterproof and is the perfect kit to carry for outdoor sports . I tend to be OCD about being prepared and probably did n't need this big of a kit just for riding , but it makes me feel better knowing that I have more than neccessary to take care of myself and someone else in case of injury while out and about on my bike . In summation , this product is great for anyone who engages in outdoor activities and I would highly recommend it .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !

 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !

 This is a natural , safe product that helps me fall asleep . I have found that the lozenge works better than a pill . I can highly recommend Melatonin for anyone having trouble falling asleep who does n't want to go the `` drug route '' .
 Kal make the best Melatonin in the business in my opinion , high quality , concentrated , effective ... I put one of these lozenges in my mouth and within 20 minutes I start to get pretty drowsy and then im off to never never land . I have tried many brands of melatonin and Kal seem to be the best by far . If you want guaranteed a quality melatonin look no further than Kal . Not as popular and carried like other brands , but the winner in my eyes .
 After my husband passed away , I could get only 2 or 3 hours sleep at night because I would wake up in the middle of the night and could not get back to sleep . I did n't want to use drugs to help me sleep and heard about Melatonin and decided to give it a try . It WORKS . The chewable works best for me .
 Functional and good stability , however the `` blossom pink '' is really quite muted and does not look like the photo . Two recommendations for improvement would be to add a loop for a wrist strap and a velcro strip to help hold it closed so the plastic carrying case would not be necessary .
 As the title says , this cane is all of those things . A 20yr old coming off of hip surgery , I was told I needed a cane for support in the interim between crutches and unassisted walking . I did n't want a `` fuddy duddy '' cane and needed something inexpensive but well made to support me . This cane is a beautiful finish , no flaws in the hand part or the shaft , very affordable , extremely stable - even for being a collapsible style , and the hand grip is quite comfortable for being just wood without extra padding . 5 stars overall , and I love that its collapsible so I 'm able to throw it in my bag just in case I get tired and need it while I 'm out . Excellent product !
 What a great cane ! This cane is strong ... and so pretty . I bought it for my own satisfaction ... but get many compliments on it from others on how nice it looks . It is very sturdy ... I trust the Drive Medical company ... also have family that has used them for a wheelchair and a rolling walker ... so I thought this would be a good item as well . I have been proven correct ... and I am very happy !
 Thank you so much - I ordered this cane and was surprised how quickly I received it . It is going to be a favorite gift for a special family member .
 I like the cane - only problem is that you sent me four canes and I only ordered one . The one that I liked was the flower print cane -LRB- of which you sent me three -RRB- . However , I decided to keep all of them - one for my sister who is having a hip replacement and one for my other sister who may or may not need one - but it would be a good gag gift.How in the world did you get this order so screwed up ? I really did n't like the blossom pink but decided to use it anyway . Plus , it takes time and money to return all three canes !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

 Just received this brand of castor oil . I had bruise for over a week from a blood work up . I applied the castor oil , the first day I received it , without a bandage . I applied more castor oil overnight with small bandage and the bruise was larger than the bandage . Next morning the old bandage fell off , I applied more castor oil using the same size bandage now the bruise does not show outside of the bandage . This is only the second day I am using the castor oil . I also applied the oil to my hands . One of my fingers would seize up on one hand , after using the castor oil my finger did not lock up . All my fingers are supple.I plan on reading more uses for castor oil and try it out . I received the product within a week . I am happy with the supplier .
 If you need your hair to grow or have hair breakage/loss you may need to try this Castor oil , it works for my wife .

 Gaitors are great ! Arch support and heel strike support effectively relieved pain from plantar fascitis / heel spur . This is my 2nd pair . Tried heel cups from the grocery store but they compress in less than one month and offered no arch support . Gaitors worked for me !
 I was having pain in my arch whenever I walked or jogged . I got these to help , and they worked wonderfully . The arch support hits me right where I had the most pain . Now it only hurts when I take off my shoe ! I can go on long walks with the dog and not feel any discomfort . I 'd definitely recommend these to anyone with arch pain .
 The glue does n't hold between the support and cushion . Had to reglue . Still I think Tuli 's Gaitors are the best .
 I received my first set of these from my Podiatrist , but at twice the price . The Tuli Gators work so well for relief from plantar fasciatis , I ca n't recommend them highly enough .
 They were recommended to me by my chiropractor . They help a lot with my ankles rolling inward causing my knees to be out of alignment . I will say they make my feet hurt , but I just need to get used to them . When I 'm not at work and actually at home , I do n't wear shoes very often . If you need an orthotic they are your best option to a custom as they are around $ 300 or so to have done . I would recommend them if you have issues with your knees , back and hips due to standing or walking all day . At this point all my children have them -LRB- they have the same problem with their arches as my wife and I -RRB- and they seem to love them .
 These Arch Supports gave the relief from a bone spur that showed up on an Xray , Dr. said the Supports should offer relief , I 'm happy to report they did the trick . I will be ordering others for other shoes , so I wo n't have to be swithing them around.Greatful Shopper , josie1355
 so happy to have found these , hard to find in health food stores , i feel they make a instant effect , they sooth my groin arealike nothing else i 've tried ... thanks so much.johnny . .
 Love the smell it just relaxing and help been and better mood . . I definitely going to buy it again and more products that thay have . love aromatherapy
 I burned the clove candle and it smelled pretty good becaues it had a whole clove on the top of the candle , but now it has little smell maybe I need to put another clove in there .
 I bought this kit for my mom to use on her face . She has very coarse hair and complains that it usually takes several applications of wax for the esthetician to get all of the hair . I got everything on the first swipe . It is VERY sticky and left little sticky strings from where you pulled the spatula out , but I 've never seen a wax work quite that well . I would recommend buying a larger size of the wax removing cream because it does take a little more effort to get rid of the little spots left behind -LRB- and on off your fingers -RRB- . Overall , I was very impressed with this product and would buy it again .
 Good quality product , got more burn time than I expected , but still a bit pricey . Compared to typical scented candles , i.e. Yankee Candle lavender , this is not as strong , wo n't fill as large an area with scent , but it 's a more pure lavender scent , quite pleasant . Works best in a small space , i.e. a bedroom or bathroom .
 The candle fills a room with the scent of lavender - it is very small for the price but it does smell great !
 Fantastic !!!!! Worth every penny spent !!!!! Kevin 's points are direct and to the point . No messing around . Yes , there are a lot of times were he points you to his web site , but after reading the book you will understand why . A must read for anyone of any age .

 My husband and I have been reading health books since he bacame ill with an `` incurable '' disease over 30 years ago . After much painstaking research through hundreds of health books , we finally found `` natural '' ways to help him heal . Now in Kevin Trudeau 's book , we have found a one stop shop for everything you need to know/do for a healtier you . The information in this book is equivelant to the hundreds of health books in our library . If you can set aside the negative media coverage and take the time to read and see for yourself if this works for you , you will be blessed with a healthy more vibrant life .
 Functional and good stability , however the `` blossom pink '' is really quite muted and does not look like the photo . Two recommendations for improvement would be to add a loop for a wrist strap and a velcro strip to help hold it closed so the plastic carrying case would not be necessary .
 As the title says , this cane is all of those things . A 20yr old coming off of hip surgery , I was told I needed a cane for support in the interim between crutches and unassisted walking . I did n't want a `` fuddy duddy '' cane and needed something inexpensive but well made to support me . This cane is a beautiful finish , no flaws in the hand part or the shaft , very affordable , extremely stable - even for being a collapsible style , and the hand grip is quite comfortable for being just wood without extra padding . 5 stars overall , and I love that its collapsible so I 'm able to throw it in my bag just in case I get tired and need it while I 'm out . Excellent product !
 What a great cane ! This cane is strong ... and so pretty . I bought it for my own satisfaction ... but get many compliments on it from others on how nice it looks . It is very sturdy ... I trust the Drive Medical company ... also have family that has used them for a wheelchair and a rolling walker ... so I thought this would be a good item as well . I have been proven correct ... and I am very happy !
 Thank you so much - I ordered this cane and was surprised how quickly I received it . It is going to be a favorite gift for a special family member .
 I like the cane - only problem is that you sent me four canes and I only ordered one . The one that I liked was the flower print cane -LRB- of which you sent me three -RRB- . However , I decided to keep all of them - one for my sister who is having a hip replacement and one for my other sister who may or may not need one - but it would be a good gag gift.How in the world did you get this order so screwed up ? I really did n't like the blossom pink but decided to use it anyway . Plus , it takes time and money to return all three canes !
 This product will give you the extra edge in any sport and give you the burst of energy you need . Great flavor , healthier than carbonated bevs . I have my fridge fully stocked so I grab one just before I take my run .
 Good tasting , good for you energy drink . I 've never gotten jitters from Power Blend Juice Fusion like I have sometimes from Red Bull . I 'll definitely buy more Sweet Success .
 I picked this up at GNC -LRB- paid too much for it , it 's about $ 10 cheaper on Amazon -RRB- . I love Red Bull or Monster before my workout , but that was when I could do a morning routine and now with a change of schedule , I can only work out after 6pm . I needed a non caffeine boost and this stuff is great , It tastes great as well . I may never drink a jittery energy drink again , highly recommended !
 I think Sweet Success ' Power Blend Energy Juice Fusion tastes very good - a lot like a juice box drink . It is especially helpful to wake me up when I need to exercise early in the morning , and it 's so great to know that it 's healthy for me too ! I often drink two a day - one just before my morning workout and one with lunch.I choose not to drink energy drinks like Rock Star , Monster and Red Bull because they are so terrible for you . This power blend drink gives me the energy I need and tastes great ! I am very pleased with this product and will continue to use it as part of my daily routine .
 I have tried many drinks but this so far is the BEST ... I would highly recommend it and kodo 's to Sweet Success on a remarkable product
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 well i was debating if i wanted to get the white light or the ionic white system . seen both on t.v and figured they should work . well since ionic white was priceier i figurd it will work better , plus i saw the review for white light and they didnt seem to great so i put in the extra 10 bucks and got the ionic . the process is pretty annoying when you have to swish the stuff in your mouth for 7 min every time ... you can acumulate alot of spit by that time so its messy . but all in all my teeth are alot whighter . and they were pretty yellow . i like that it comes with a 60 day mouth wash that you have to only do twice a week for 2 min . not to bad for the great results .
 I picked this product up on sale for $ 19 and for $ 19 I 'm TOTALLY impressed . I knew about the Ionic White from a local news story where they had a correspondant try it . The news storie 's take was that it did not work , but when they showed her before and after it really looked like it worked great!Anyway , it 's fairly straightforward , follow the directions , I imagine the swishing is the most important part , so I really did do it for 5-7 minutes every time , and I 'd estimate that my teeth are 2-3 shades whiter , it 's noticable to me , so that 's good . I did n't mind the process , thought it worked well for the price and am pleased with the product .
 Love this product . So easy to use and works really well . It just should be done for a half hour . not 20min . My teeth are so white now and you cant even tell i smoke ! im buying another for my brother .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 This stuff works well and has a very pleasant scent . It 's not gender specific either , so definitely could be worn by men or women .
 Somehow this product is not well known here as I think is not marketed well by the german manufacturer.I first bought this great product in Singapore when I was on a holiday as I ran out of my Gilette deodrant.I was astonished to see the quality and genteless and longivity as it stays 24h as stated.I wish these are available like in WalMart , K-Mart etc. , someday as they are available only thru some online retailers like Amazon.com , Drugstore.com and a few others.Buy it if you see this product an you wil not be dissapointed !
 She like this deodorant and she can not find it any more in Greece . She used it for several years buing it from large Greek stores . It disappeared last 2 years an I found it now . I hope that next time she will need it , I will find it again .
 When I moved to the US I noticed there 's a different `` palate '' of smells for deodorants and I find them too sweet or floral most of this time . I 'm so glad I found this online . It 's an old favorite from my teen years and it 's so fresh and effective too .
 I liked the Fa bath gel , so when I saw that they had deodorant , I thought it was worth trying . My current brand works well , but I get a little tired of the scent . I had no idea how Caribbean Lemon compared with the Fa bath gel I was remembering , but it seemed like the closest one . As it turned out , I think it may be the same scent , and regardless , the deodorant has a fresh , refreshing scent , kind of lemony with a hint of pine . It has the usual antiperspirant ingredient -LRB- aluminum chlorohydrate -RRB- , which makes it an effective deodorant and antiperspirant -LRB- which also helps if you are stung by a bee - just rub it on liberally -RRB- .
 Scent is masculine and drying power goes a long way . I will shower at night and apply The application will last through the following day . Henkel seems to be a very socially responsible company . Nice that the package is glass so it can be more easily recycled .
 Great smell , not sticky , no residue , works all day - could n't be happier about it . Why are n't there more deodorants like this available in US ?
 A wonderful product , I first used it in Europa ... but have to order it through the websince I can not find it in stores in this country.Caribbean Lemon is my favorite.It smell nice . . does not stick or leave white marks on my clothing . I would be lost without my Fa .
 This is a pleasant smelling lipgloss that lasts for about a month with regular use . To me it 's like a colored , mildly flavored thick vaseline type lip gloss . With that being said , I would not spend more than $ 10 on this . Google online for cheaper prices . It is definitely not worth what most are asking for .
 I love this product and take it every day . I feel a sustained energy as though I had eaten a lot of fresh fruit .
 I am a fan of Source Naturals vitamins and have been for about 10 years . The vitamins are always obtained from natural sources and formulated into excellent and effective products . I found the x1 30 mg softgels COQ10 to be sufficient for my needs , and feel an almost immediate effect when using the product -LRB- taken with a meal -RRB- I do not recommend taking this product with dinner , or you might find yourself up all night . It adds a great amount of non-nervous energy and vitality . I also take Source Naturals NKO Neptune Krill Oil and this product is certified and manufactured by a company for Source Naturuals that uses only 100 % Neptune Krill Oil , which means that your getting your money 's worth . Their products are high quality and do what they are advertised to do . If you do n't take vitamins regularly , then expect that it may take some time to see benefits thereof
 Our 14 year old pug was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and given 3 months to live . In addition to his medications , I started giving him 30mg CoQ10 each day . It 's now almost two years later and he 's still doing well ! The vet says that this is a record for his practice and `` whatever you 're doing , keep it up '' . I think that this CoQ10 has helped , and I now give all our pugs the same dose each day . Prayer and CoQ10 has saved our pug .
 I started taking Source Naturals CoQ10 sub-lingual tablets , due to the quick absorption by the body and then switched to the soft-gels when they discontinued the sub-lingual tablets . If you do n't take any other supplement , consider taking this one ; CoQ10 is found in every cell in your body , scientists speculate it may be a cell building block and the high quality of Source Naturals is also important .
 I purchased this in an effort to reduce my blood pressure . I closely monitor it and it has read lower for the last few weeks by as much as 10 points in both the upper and lower numbers . Of course this may just be how it affects me , but its a small capsule which is easy to take and has not had any side effects whatsoever .
 I take a small mustache scissor and poke a hole in the top of this capsule and squeeze the contents onto my cats food and she loves the taste . A great supplement for cats with hypocardiomyopathy . Cheaper to buy this than the ones made specifically for cats ... its the same exact thing .
 This kit creates a perfect base for a small survival kit . It already has most everything you would need - especially if you have a first-aid kit in a separate pack - then this will cover most of your needs . Although it 's up to you on how much you want to carry - but if you buy this one - you 'll be very pleased with it . It 's great !
 There 's no reason NOT to carry this kit in your pack if you do any sort of outdoors activity . It contains a lot of things that could really save your butt one day , and it 's cheap as dirt.There 's a bit of extra space in the bag . I added a few items to the kit ... it 's stuffed to the gills now . I added a CRKT P.E.C.K. knife , four waterproof strike-anywhere matches , and a paracord neck lanyard attached to the whistle . The lanyard is mainly to prevent me from panicking and forgetting about the whistle , which should be the first thing you go for in any emergency .
 My daughter has left the roost and like most Dads I worry about her safety . After reading the glowing review from Don Rearic.com and the info from Doug Ritters Equipped to Survive website , I bought this to include in the survival kit I 've made for her car . Added a small folding blade knife , a surplus ECW sleeping bag , 3 days worth of emergency water packets and survival rations , an emergency 120 hour candle/matches and a small bucket of kitty litter . I feel much better knowing she has the basics in case she gets stranded in her car here in North Dakota
 Very compact , light , and has a lot of good stuff ! I added water purification tablets , and rubber-banded it to a Mylar emergency blanket to complete this kit . Good for the car and Get out of dodge bag.Learn to use this -LRB- or any survival kit -RRB- if you want to actually survive with it .
 I 've assembled my own bug out and survival kits , and this is one extremely value-friendly bundle . The tools are n't top notch , but I easily spent over $ 150 for my own kit . This has a couple of the core fundamentals that you 'd want in a price thats reasonable for the majority of people -LRB- my kit 's use in the Army requires a lot more -RRB- .
 I found this while browsing my payflex site . The mirror and whistle are top quality . I am not aware of the quality of the rest , but based on the whistle an mirror I am sure they are quality . Compass is a good backup . Add a knife .
 nice size , nicely appointed , you can add a few things if you like . Great size for keeping in the car
 This product is really great , I own three now - one for the backpack and 1 in each car . The quality of all the items is really excellent , and at $ 21.25 -LRB- for subscription customers -RRB- its a smokin ' deal.I would recommend this for anyone who wants to spend time in the woods , including boy scouts on `` great adventures '' , kids who like to explore , and of course for more serious people like myself who like to get away from civilization on backpacking trips.Buy this , and spend 15 minutes getting to know the parts and how to use them , and it could really save your life . Of course , you should add a small flashlight , small knife , and it would be useful if you were carrying a metal pot to boil water when you are out there in the woods ... But with this kit , you 've solved 90 % of your problems .
 Just got this today . As stated inside the packaging , a good knife , space blanket/emergency bivy/tube tent , and a method to PURIFY water are all necessary additions to this . This is very similar to the survival kits that I have made for myself . Not a be all end all but the price is right and this leads one down the correct path for serious survival . The packaging is nice and small and the bag is sturdy . I am curious to see how I can make a pot to boil water and cook out of the heavy duty foil , as I have not considered it in the kits I already use . 5 stars for me !
 I was looking at a survival kit for hikes , mainly to appease paranoia about being lost in the woods and all that it entails . If you look up kits on the internet , there 's literally a million ways and thoughts on how to approach it.I have other items from Adventure Medical Kits , and found them to be top notch . The advantage is that with this Pocket Survival Kit , a lot of the effort for searching for the smaller pieces has been taken care of , but it does n't include everything you might need . This kit is a good foundation to build on.The problem is that in my zealousness , I opened the bag and took things out to inspect it , and have a difficult time putting it back in . If I wanted to add anything to the bag like a small knife or water purification tablets , I 'm pretty much out of luck . You might want to consider getting aAloksak Waterproof Bagsto put things in once you 've got your kit built.It 's a great kit , and I 'm glad I bought it even if it just sits in my backpack , never to be used . But at the same time , what makes this truly valuable is that you know what each item does and how to use it properly in the event that your life depends on it .
 I do not like pre-packaged survival kits or first aid kits . They always seem to include a bunch of junk that I do not need , and leave out important stuff that I do , so I make my own . This kit is an exception
 I have three or four of these little gems and recommend them highly ! While any kit this small is going to be pretty bare-bones , when the chips are down better the basic kit in your pocket than the 30 pound Bug-Out Bag sitting back in your living room . And all the basics are represented by very high quality items ; I 'm actually very impressed . The Fox whistle is very , very loud , and the signal mirror is superb . Heck , both of them are fairly expensive on their own . The Spark-Lite firestarter , when used with the supplied tinder , is amazing . I 've seldom failed to light the tinder on the first strike . Again , it 's small enough that there are compromises . Water is very important but is hardly addressed . You are supposed to be able to make a cup from the foil but good luck with that . The kit is designed to be non-expiring , which is why water purification tabs arent ' included . Fortunately there 's just enough room in the kit for a few SMALL additions . I added a small aqua-pouch to mine.I should also point out that this kit is a screaming bargain -LRB- at least when I bought mine - the price probably varies -RRB- . The kit is actually a fair bit cheaper than you can buy the individual components on their own . When Amazon had a subscription for this item I stocked up . Then I parted a couple kits out to make slightly more elaborate kits.All in all a very well thought out mini PSK . Anyone into camping , fishing , hiking or hunting would be well served to keep a PSK like this on their person whenever venturing into the wild . Hopefully supplemented with a few choice items -LRB- eg water , survival blanket -RRB- but just the contents of the PSK could keep you alive .
 I found the Adventure Medical Kit to be one of the lightest , most compact kits on the market . The weight and size being saved by replacing the standard tin with a water-tight sealing pouch.While the tin is gone everything else is pretty much still there . Duct tape , a very good whistle , cordage , etc. . The only thing lacking was a light source and small $ 2.50 led light was easily added to the kit.The only concern I might have with the kit is whether the water-tight seal would hold , it seemed somewhat fragile and only time would tell . The kit is a easy way to have a back up . I say back up , because you should n't rely on these kits over having standard equipment , they should be for emergencies and should be practiced with .
 Doug Ritter knows what he talks about . As a Marine and avid outdoorsman , this is a great , basic kit that should be carried at all times -- and in your vehicle when you are driving . Included are basic items that will help keep you alive and get found . Yes , there are better kits out there , but for the price , conveinence and novice -- this is it.WolfUSMC 85-89
 This is no doubt an excellent kit and I wo n't rehash what everyone else has said . But why the fishing gear ??? Fishing gear in an emergency kit always makes me laugh . Your first priority is protection from hypothermia/exposure either by clothing , shelter or fire . Second is rescue , being found , extraction , etc. . I do n't think you 'll do much fishing while trying to keep warm at night , and while extracting yourself or being found the next day , as is what happens in most all emergency survival situations . Fishing gear belongs in an extended stay kit or on a planned fishing trip . I know we all think about crash landing in a remote part of the world and needing to eat something after a few weeks so we better have a fish hook just in case we are near a great fishing lake and the fish are biting ... not likely . I 'll take a compass over a fish hook any day ! Make a fish trap instead - fish swim in and they ca n't swim out . While the trap does its work you can prepare firewood or signal for help . Most people could n't catch a fish with the best pole and gear anyway , never mind just a hook and some line . PLEASE Help Me Spread The Message ... Shelter and Rescue first ! The life you save may be your own . Okay , I 've done my part . Good luck !
 I started putting together my own pocket survival kit before coming across this package , and purchased one to complete the items my own kit ... it was cheaper than buying the few items left individually ! This is an incredible deal , and contains a great assortment of items while still keeping its weight and bulk very low . I wish I had found it sooner ! There are , however , a few things I recommend adding :1 . The most essential item missing is a flashlight . I added a Photon pinch light , only 0.2 ounces and very bright . Red is the best color for survival for a couple reasons ; it is visible from the farthest distance , and gets significantly better battery life -LRB- they claim 40 hours -RRB- .2 . Iodine tablets such as Potable Aqua will ensure you do n't ingest contaminated water while waiting to be rescued .3 . A bag to contain water for treatment and transporting . I tested and chose an oven bag from my kitchen drawer , and marked the 1 liter point so I use the right amount for treatment . Also add a straw -- drinking out of a bag is tricky and straws weigh next to nothing .4 . A space blanket , cheap and only 2.5 ounces , will make cold nights much more bearable . -LSB- optional -RSB- Not essential , I added a small folding knife -LRB- Gerber LST Ultralight , 1.2 ounces -RRB- in the event that I become separated from my other knife . The small bulk and weight of redundancy is worth it to me for peace of mind . -LSB- optional -RSB- Another optional addition is minimalist first aid . Not a whole kit , but a few basic items in case , let 's say , your first aid kit is in your backpack and you become separated from your pack -LRB- I carry the survival kit in my pant pocket -RRB- . Keep in mind that the clothes on your back can serve many first aid purposes.It is false security to carry a survival kit without knowing what 's in it . Inspect each item , and think about its purpose or even test it . Then add items to customize the kit for your activity , your location , and you as a person . If you are allergic to bees , for example , antihistamine capsules are an obvious addition . Perhaps the area you 're traveling to wo n't have great fishing , but snare wire would prove invaluable in a survival situation . Learn the skills necessary to use everything in the kit , and know the steps to survive and be rescued .
 This kit is perfect.Small enough to fit in your pocket , yet everything you need if your outdoor trip takes a turn for the worse.Would highly recomend , and I will buy more.Everything is very high quality , nothing looks or feels cheap .
 This kit forms an outstanding foundation to your lightweight emergency survival pack . The contents are high quality and thoughtfully prepared , and the whole thing is silly-inexpensive for what you get . Indeed , anyone would be hard-pressed to assemble a comparable kit for the price . Given the cost , size , and quality of this mini-survival kit , there really is n't any reason you should n't have one of these on your person every time you lace up your hiking boots . You do n't need to be a survivalist to recognize the value of preparedness , and this kit is a great way to start if you are even remotely likely to be stuck in the woods , lost on the trail , injured , or otherwise in need of a rescue in the backcountry.The kit contains items that can provide for your rescue -LRB- signal mirror , whistle -RRB- , food -LRB- through snares and/or fishing -RRB- , heat , shelter , and more , and it all comes in a reasonably waterproof bag that will fit in your shirt pocket . Chances are , you will never need it . If you do , it is likely to make you much more comfortable at a minimum , and may very well save your life . Any student of outdoor survival or disaster preparedness should have one of these . I have two
 It may not make for a whole lot but I throw in a pair of disposable earplugs . Say you had to blow that single whistle -LRB- all day ... -- ... -RRB- , your ears would be ringing so bad it could hinder your rescue and possibly cause permanent hearing damage . Some may argue the other end of that logic , just my 2 cents tho . Also D.doctor `` The white cord is supposedly for fishing '' FYI , Doug states on his web site -LSB- ... -RSB- , that the 50 ft. of # 69 Black Nylon Thread / Fishing Line
 First , I have n't had to use the survival equipment , and hope I never do . That said , this product could easily save your life . The most important items in the kit are the whistle , fire starter and tinder , signal mirror and the survival brochure . These alone are worth more than the whole kit if bought separately . With this kit , a pocket knife , a flashlight , a first aid kit and an emergency blanket , you 'll be ready for just about anything mother nature or circumstance can dish out on land -LRB- sorry , a life raft is not included -RRB- . The package is very small . I can easily fit it into the back pocket of my Levi 's . It nearly fits into my shirt pocket . In a pack , you wo n't know it 's even there . But the pouch is big enough that you wo n't have any problem removing the contents . Just the right size for a slightly expensive stocking stuffer.When you send your kids off into the world , make sure they have one of these in their glove box . Yours too.Happy trails !
 Imagine this : At first you are afraid - you are petrified - You 're traveling down the Mississippi river when suddenly your canoe overturns . You are wet , cold , and your gear and your canoe float gently down the river . Unfortunatly , you were knocked out when you hit your head on the side of the canoe . Your PDF keeps you afloat , but once you come to and return to shore , the only thing you have for the night is your POCKET SURVIVAL PAK located in your back pocket -LRB- yes , it is small enough to fit in there -RRB- . For the price , it 's worth it . The materials , you will find , are heavy duty and there is even a little sheet of paper in there to help you know what to do with the aluminum foil that is included - and everything else.I did buy some water purification tablets which also will fit into the waterproof pouch . That 's about the only thing that I could really see as missing from this great little kit.Highly recommended and , for the price , well worth it . If you plan on going into the woods , take it along . It may save you life and You will Survive ! ENJOY !
 As a Volunteer Search And Rescue team leader and someone who has spent a lot of time of in the field , I recognize good gear when I see and handle it . The selection of items Doug Ritter personally picked -LRB- and in some cases worked with companies to have made -RRB- is incredibly well thought out and , almost more important , it is all of high quality . Perhaps the best thing about this kit is that you might actually have it with you when you need it - that part is up to you , but carrying this is no imposition . If you do need it , you can count on what is there to work.You should consider also carrying a small first aid kit -LRB- into which you 've put any personal meds -RRB- . One of the Adventure Medical Pocket first aid kits will fill the bill for this purpose . With only minimal additional gear -LRB- knife , map , water , something to eat as a start -RRB- you 'd be pretty well set for an active day hike - perhaps more.But anyone can carry at least this small kit basically everywhere . Do your local SAR team a favor
 If you 're the least-bit preparedness minded , this belongs in your back pocket or purse . Adventure Medical makes these and puts quality tools in them . Adding stuff is a dubious proposition , as the thing 's pretty well full , but there 's so much here already . I never leave the house without this and my Swiss Army Knife .
 There is nothing more you could add to this survival kit to make it better . Everything you could possibly need if you were ever stranded or in an emergency situation is in this pouch . Lightweight , waterproof , and the perfect pocket size .
 I 've been buying and building and updating emergency preparedness kits for over fifteen years now and this is a great package . Doug Ritter 's put together a real wealth of stuff in a small package and it 's all top notch materials . Individually the parts cost more than this total kit.This is a great EP kit for all experience levels . The novice user will find the tools easy to use and the instructions appropriately detailed . The seasoned outdoor traveler will find this a kit they go to for the odds and ends that it contains.This is n't an all inclusive kit and could use a few additions if you have the room . A small lighter is easy to squeeze in the bag . The kit does not contain a knife -LRB- there is scalpel blade -RRB- and I think that a deck of cards belongs in everyone 's EP kit.And important note is that this kit is not approved for carry-on luggage due to the scalpel blade included ...
 No idea why anyone would think it 's cheaper to buy these items separately as noted in the first review . That 's just flat out wrong as far as both my experience and common sense shopping dictates . My guess is that the person does n't like pre-packaged kits -LRB- and rightly so ! -RRB- . But this kits is an exception among the dross.Doug Ritter and his foundation , Equipped to Survive , has come up with a very economic method to equip yourself and your family with an emergency kit . It is small enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket , yet fully functional.Although you can control the amount of certain items if you put together your own kit -LRB- something of a rite of passage among the survivalists/emergency preparedness folk -RRB- , I spent twice as much putting together a comparable kit . The military issue sparklite and tinder-quick , Fox-40 whistle , and Rescue Flash signal mirror alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch gear . This pack is extremely high quality through and through , from choice of equipment to packing and instructions . I recommend looking at the ETS website at the slideshow of how such a kit is put together and what Doug Ritter himself recommends that you add to the kit -LRB- the pouch can hold a few more small items such as water purification tabs -RRB- . The Pocket Survival Pack is an amazing value . I 've purchased all of the items separately , and just the shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably covers half the cost ! If you are lucky enough to get everything at one store , you 'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as cheap as this . I know people who have purchased this kit to take the parts for their own self-built survival kits ! That 's how economical it is . Plus , if you buy this PSP , a portion of the proceeds goes to the ETS non-profit group which gives free survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved in improving survival equipment and standards . In fact , Doug Ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing body on personal locator beacons used in marine , aviation , and remote travel.The kit itself comes in a waterproof container . I found it to be a bit tight when closing back up , but there is actually some room for more items . All components are of the highest quality . It 's lightweight and I never notice it in a pocket . With the recommended ETS or similar keychain LED flashlight and a good pocket folding knife , you have a complete survival kit that rivals ones costing $ 100 + . These are cheap enough to get one for each car and any camping/hiking/marine / aviation gear you might have . I highly recommend this PSP . I 'm not affiliated with ETS , but I 've come to appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums . And if this was a bad kit , I 'd still say so . I give it 5 stars , great value for the price and it really could save your life .

 I 've been looking over Doug Ritter 's website for a while and finally broke down and bought two of these kits . In short
 I think this survival kit deserves another 5-star review . At 3.9 oz. , this kit is small , and that 's a good thing to me . It 's amazing how much stuff is in this little bag . All of the items are of the best quality . The signal mirror is beautiful . The inclusion of a lens magnifier is something I have n't seen in almost any other kit -LRB- great backup for fire starting -RRB- . I know the firestarter that comes with it is normally about $ 8 just by itself . I just tried out the Fox 40 Micro whistle , and it 's so loud , my ears started ringing -LRB- be careful -RRB- . For a complete personal kit , I would recommend adding a knife , light , survival blanket , water purification tablets , wire saw , and a water bag . For the price , you ca n't get a better survival kit than this . I am really impressed by the quality here . My only minor complaint is that I wish they made the bag that the items come in a little bigger . I have trouble fitting everything in there properly and keeping it closed after I 've taken items out and tried to get everything back in . That 's almost not even worth mentioning though because this kit is excellent . I 've bought other kits before ... the kinds that tell you they have a signal mirror until you find out they mean the inside of the tin can the items come in . Not cool . This AMK Pocket Survival Pack is the best .
 No idea why anyone would think it 's cheaper to buy these items separately as noted in some reviews with other sellers .

 Most `` pocket survival kits '' are either junk or too expensive for what you get . Most of the time , you can put together your own kit of a fraction of the cost of a pre-made kit . This survival kit is an exception to the rule . It is very well thought out . It puts the items you need in a waterproof package that really does fit in your pocket . It contains quality tools at a reasonable price . You would be hard pressed to put together a kit of this quality for the price ala carte . Anyone who spends any time outdoors and away from immediate help should carry this kit . In addition , there is a small amount of room left in the kit for you to add other items . I would suggest adding waterproof matches and water purification tablets to the kit . With this kit , a survival blanket , a good knife , and a water container , you will be pretty well prepared to survive with just tools on your body .
 I ca n't even pretend to be a serious survivalist type like some reviewers . I 'm a suburban stay-at-home-mom with an interest in preparedness because it is part of my duty to care for my family.I bought my Adventure Medical Kits Pocket Survival Pack in November 2009 and also gave them to several family members that holiday season . I 've had mine in my purse at all times since , except when flying as I do n't want to risk having it confiscated so I put in checked luggage or mail it ahead with my pocket knife . -LRB- I also carry a flashlight and first aid kit at all times . -RRB- Last weekend , while on a hike and picnic for my son 's class at a local conservation area , it was grey and rainy and colder than expected . We discovered a fire pit when we got to the picnic site , and everyone was saying how great it would be to light a fire if only we 'd planned ahead and brought matches . Someone was talking about hiking back to the cars if anyone carried matches when I remembered my little survival pack . Lo and behold , we were able to get a fire started on a damp day using scavenged downfall wood with just one bundle of Tinder Quick Firestarter and the Spark-Lite Fire Starter.Every item fits neatly in the kit and they will go back in if you unpack it to inspect the contents . I 'm very pleased with the quality of the included items and the form factor is absolutely phenomenal . Seeing the kit proven useful in the field makes it even better .
 In my quest to build my own ` perfect ' survival kit , I 've bought about 8 or 10 commercial kits and looked through every other one I could find for ideas and , sometimes , components . Most kits are very poorly thought out and equipped even worse . Every kit I 've bought or looked through has had obvious weak points
 Love this little kit ! -- the best I found during my research , and I was happy upon receiving it to see everything is good quality . It has all the absolute essentials , except would recommend a water-proof plastic bag and a couple of water purification tablets , which could be tucked into the pouch , as there is a little bit of room for extra stuff . -- -LRB- edited -RRB- just wanted to add my lesson learned - if you decide to add water purification tabs they should be in glass not plastic . I first used a mini-ziploc bag and the tablets bled out and stained . A tiny sample-size -LRB- glass -RRB- perfume vial hold the water purification tabs , and is the smallest glass container I could find .
 Great little kit for survival , keep that in mind when you check out your items . If I was out hiking in a secluded area for days and got lost , this is the kit I want with me . Yeah the fishing kit is not for your fishing trip , as most people fish for recreation and not survival . It 's a kit to keep you from starving if you ca n't get rescued right away due to location , weather or whatever . Your BRAIN is your real chance of survival anyway , this kit just improves your chances if you put thought behind it 's use . It 's small & has a nice variety of items . Yeah the items are a little on the cheap side but so is the price . Again it 's for survival and not casual use . Although some of the items are useful in daily life , as noted by other users.If your going out in remote areas or your just an all around outdoor person , you know to bring supplies as Murphy 's law has taught most outdoor people , STUFF happens , so be prepared . Adventure medical makes great products , I also like their .9 first aid kit ultra light & watertight ! Are they perfect for every buyer ?? No kit is , you have to add to suit your adventures . But they do have excellent kits to build from.Mine also arrived with a bad bag , but the company replaced it without even asking them ! Very happy , thanks!Anyone who enjoys extended time out in the woods should have one of these kits , hopefully you never need it , but if you do , you 'll be glad to have it . Then I bet it will get 5 stars once it saves your butt ... Update
 Excellent product . Wonderful aroma -- my partner really loves it . Nice glide and traction . Could n't ask for more , except a slightly lower price . Comparable products are usually $ 2.00 less .
 I have found this product to be excellent . It provides very good lubrication , and is easy to regulate so adequate friction is still maintained for massage . I can confirm women do like it , which is why I am reordering it now .
 I have been in love with my husband for 16 yrs now & he LOVES to rub FORBIDDEN FRUIT INTTIMO MASSAGE OIL on me its like the 1st time all over again it has a very sensual smell that you wouldnt mind smelling I highly recommend you to get this product LADIES GO WILD WHEN THEY GET A WIFF OF FORBIDDEN FRUIT !!!
 I have been using sugar-free vitamins for several years and find them harder and harder to get at the store . Finding them online in a large jar at a good price is terrific ! They are a bit tart , but worth not having sugar in them . Prompt and efficient shipping from this seller !
 The product was very good and here very quickly . I have always been happy with amazon purchases .
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update

These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot .

 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I use this in smoothies , and sprinkle onto warm -LRB- not hot -RRB- foods . This really helps digestion , and help prevent the tired feeling after occasional heavy meals . The bulk powder is much cheaper for the quantity than capsules . I looked around and did not find any other blends that had 20 different enzymes for anywhere close to this price .
 Excellent product , but rather expensive for the size . Dosage instructions were difficult to find . The mini scoop inside the product was at the bottom of the powder , and was difficult to find .
 I am a true advocate for enzymes . They are great for helping your food digest and even better when you take them on an empty stomach . Our bodies do n't produce new enzymes so if we do n't get them from fermented foods , enzymes are very helpful . It is also helpful when my little ones have gas bubbles -LRB- just give it to them in proper quantities -RRB- !

 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 I bought the sandalwood variety . It smells terrific and leaves your skin feeling great . I hate to shave and would keep a beard if it was n't so much trouble to maintain . I have sensitive skin and shaving is a nightmare because I 'm left with painful spots that hurt all day -LRB- new blades or old -RRB- . Most after shaves and balms result in skin irritations if not pimples . With this balm my skin feels unbelievably good , no ailments yet . The other day I wanted to shave a second time just to be able to apply the balm :-RRB- Two thumbs up and a chin .
 I 've been using this for several years - the whole `` Art of Shaving '' line is exceptional - really improved the shape of my skin !
 Shaving does a real number on my face . Aftershaves burn and do n't really do what they are made to do . So I started looking for a balm . This stuff is expensive but well worth it . The bottle lasts a long time and the lavender scent is great . This does n't burn at all . It 's like a miracle . Apply this to your face after shaving and it will instantly feel like you did n't scrape your face raw . I will buy this as long as they continue making it . Save yourself the trouble ... order this and give your face a break .
 Art of shaving makes the best shaving products . I have been using there products for over 3 years now , and am sure that I will never switch to anything else .
 Seems as though some have a vendetta against AOS products , just look at all his other reviews slamming AOS products . I have been using AOS soaps and after shave balms for a while now and they work great , smell great , do exactly as advertised . Are they pricey , yes . However the miniscule amounts that you use -LRB- that AOS dispenses -RRB- can last for a year so look at the price based on a daily use and you 'll see these products cost pennies per use . Highly recommended .
 This after shave lotion is very soothing on the face and is also the best smelling after shave product I have ever found . You should try it .
 I really lke Sandalwood pre shave oil and this After Shave is a pretty good compliment . The only reason it did not get a 5 star is that I like `` Acqua Di Parma '' products more and When I give a 5 star it is because there is no other procuct better from my point of view . This product however is much cheaper than the `` Acqua Di Parma '' products so if you are looking for an After Shave and you like Sandalwood this product is pretty close the best there is and comes at a more reasonable price.One thing that makes this after shave nice is that it sqirts out so you dont have to worry about getting to much on your hand before you apply it .
 This is a wonderful after shave balm . I have tried a number of them and this has come out as the best by far . I 'm not sure what the formula is , but it leaves my face soothed and feeling great after a shave . Very faint `` clean '' smell , no powerful scent , just as advertised .
 The Art of Shaving After-Shave Balm is the best I have ever used . It far exceeds anything you will buy in a drug store .
 I truly treat this stuff as a reward . I usually dread shaving each morning , but I tell myself if I finish shaving , I can use this stuff . I 'm a huge fan of lemon essential oil . That leads me to the only problem I have with this aftershave , the smell does n't linger long enough ! Probably lasts about 10 minutes ... maybe 20 . Which is a shame because when you put it on , it 's a blissful moment . Citrus smells are supposed to give your brain a euphoric kick and this sure does for me . BLAH BLAH , it smells good . Okay , how about the actual after shave element ? Sets in quicker than any other after shave I 've tried and soothes irritation and red bumps immediately . I often have this burning feeling with many after shaves before the relief eventually comes , not with this at all . The impact really is immediate and I will say , you only have to use the smallest of dabs to cover your entire beard zone so even with the high price , it will last a pretty long time .
 I shaved with cheap shaving cream or gel with no pre-shave oil or after shave balm for 35 years . I thought all that was a waste of money . Was I ever wrong . I started using &#34; The Art of Shaving &#34; products about a year ago after my daughter gave me a free shave at a local Art of Shaving store . I truthfully was not very excited about it ; but I liked so much I bought the whole line of products before I left and they feel great on my face . I really like the after-shave balm .
 I will say that I am new to the wet shave product line , but I ran across this and started reading the reviews and even went to their website for more information . I think this is a very good product for the price . The pump head is a bit on the small side but nothing that is a problem . The product smells good and the wife also likes it . It is not over powering and is a good compliment to the lavender soap , pre shave oil that I also purchased . It does moisturize well and it is a big improvement from the Gillette , Nivea and other stuff that you get at the store .
 My first experience with Art of Shaving products was during a time-killing visit to a mall in Miami after a cruise . My wife and I found the store and found a helpful clerk who demo 'd some products for me and went over blade shaving techniques . I ended up buying their travel-size gift package , with the pre-shave oil , brush , cream , and after-shave balm , in the Sandalwood scent . It was excellent.Having found some AOS products on Amazon , I went for the lavender cream and after-shave this time . -LRB- Personally , I never found the per-shave oil very useful . -RRB- I like it a lot , just like I did with the first Sandalwood stuff I used . The only reason this is n't a 5-star rating is that it 's VERY SIMILAR to the Sandalwood ; the lavender scent is not very strong , either in the cream or the after-shave , and so the overall character is extremely similar to the Sandalwood . I had hoped for more difference in the scent.Still , the stuff works , to me the comfort is worth the price , and I wo n't stop using it . I 'll just stop expecting a big difference fro scent to scent .
 I 've used a few premium balms such as this from AOS , Wm. Neumann & Co. , and Truefitt & Hill . Out of the three , it 's hands down Wm. Neumann & Co. followed by Truefitt & Hill and AOS a close third . But compared to many , all three are the best you can get , IMHO . I think the difference lies in the herbs and extracts in the Wm Neumann & Co Balms that make it the best for me.I have the AOS Balm in Lavender and Sandalwood . Both are very nice and I have them in my rotation despite my preference with the other two mentioned ; The variety is nice.You ca n't go wrong with this from AOS . I like it , and you probably will too !
 This is a really good product . I have tried many others of the same kind and type and use . This is a first class product at what I consider afair price . The art of shaving is really a quality site .
 The Art of Shaving After-Shave lotion is a wonderful treat and something to use daily . The Art of Shaving products themselves are certainly a finer thing in life and something to try thoroughly . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I have been using ` The Art of Shaving ' program for a few years now and I can honestly say that it works wonders . The After-Shave Balm soothes and protects well . I highly recommend it !
 So often , I order some grooming product and find out that it 's just not what I wanted it to be . It 's quality stuff that does the job , but it 's lacking something . Star power , luxuriousness , whatever . The Art of Shaving after shave is everything I want it to be . I am satisfied in every way you can be with a hygiene product.It 's rich , thick , and creamy . It makes my face feel soft and smooth after every shave . I 'm usually sensitive to anything that 's not oil free , but this has n't made me break out at all.The smell deserves its own paragraph . I 've stopped wearing cologne . The smell is a little strong in the beginning , but it stays with you at reasonable levels throughout the day . Someone has to hug you to notice , but when they do , they hang on for a minute.I ordered the travel size because I do n't want to be without it . That 's where I 'm at with this stuff .
 This give an excellent finish to a shave . I strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well . Apply hot water to dilate your pores , then apply the oil , then shaving cream , shave , and finally the after shave balm . The oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience . Your face feels incredibly smooth afterward . I do n't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone , but I do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after .
 I do n't want to sound so girly here , but I do have a sensitive skin . So whenever I shave , I ended up bleeding all over and it takes time for my face to heal . Darn . I 've used this product for about a year now , and definitely has helped my skin calm down and heal better . Maybe it 's all in my head , but I religiously use this balm after I shave to protect and heal my skin . Very good product , like it a lot cuz no scent and feels light . But does it have to be so expensive ?
 I have been using this product since the last 10 odd months and the difference it has made in my morning shaving routine is just priceless . I have the entire kit , with the pre-shave oil , shaving cream , lathering brush and this after-shave balm -LRB- lavender -RRB- . I also have the art of shaving book . This was my wonderful wife 's gift to me on my birthday and I ca n't thank her enough . The book actually improved my shaving technique and my skin over a period of time ... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to enjoy shaving !!!
 I purchased mine at Nordstrom and have been very satisfied with it . It instantly soothes mild razor irritations . And only one to two pump is really needed to get the job done . And i love the glass bottle finish definitely feels elegant . If your looking for a unscented after shave balm alcohol free try this one out . You will be so satisfied that if you try any other product after this you will compare them to this , and it will definitely set standards .
 Art of Shaving makes the best stuff you can buy . It is expensive , but a little goes a long way . This item comes with a pump-top so you can dispense just what you need -LRB- a few drops per cheek -RRB- . Give it a try and you will find it hard to go back to the drug store junk .
 It 's not that the Art of Shaving products are a scam , they are just very over-priced . In each of their products , I 've been able to substitute a cheaper alternative with the exception of this after shave balm.This balm gives my sensitive skin the best relief over any other after shave I 've tried , and I 've tried many . Fragrance is present , but not as over powering as most after shave balms . Also , like Eucerin -LRB- a dry skin cream -RRB- , the balm leaves a residue , which some might not like , but for me it seems to be the key in making the product both unique and effective.Please , someone find me a cheaper alternative !
 This stuff smells great and feels wonderful on the skin . I have much more expensive skin cream that I 'm not using anymore because I like this much better . Very subtle scent so you do n't have to worry about overwhelming people.Very aptly named , it truly is the art of shaving
 I love this stuff ! Do n't know how I will ever shave without it ! The smell is great and lasts through the day , but is not overpowering like many colones . The best part is it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and reduces the chance of ingrown hairs . It is also great at soothing razor burn if you end up using your razor past the recommended amount of time .
 I started to shave utilizing the Art of Shaving Products that I initially purchased in a mall . Way too expensive for the full experience ... while it is still a bit pricy , it 's definitely worth it to me . Excellent ... I recommend .
 My wife doesnt think this aftershave smells good , but I like it . I have normal skin and this after shave is great for living in a dry area . I am very pleased . You do not have to use a lot per application so I think it 's priced fairly .
 I received this order in the time frame stated . I love these products and use them all the time . when I received this shipment the product was intact but the box was full of ants . I called the company to just let them know and they not only responded right away they sent me a replacement at no extra cost . this type of customer service and dedication to their customers will make me a repeat customer .
 Great scent , high quality and no complaints . Just hard to justify Art of Shaving prices in this recession . Sandalwood is my favorite scent . They will have me back as a customer when they lower their prices or the recession ends .
 I bought the Trial size combination and really did like it . So this time around I purchased the full size bottles.The After Shave Balm even though in a much larger bottle still had the pump dispenser to ease dispensing the balm . That made it much easier to deal with.I love the way it works on my face and head . I shave both Head and face so I Need a lot of this stuff to cover and keep my head from braking out in a rash.It does seem to work quite well . Thanks folksdrayPS I use a Straight Razor I got from VSR it is hard to beat a Dovo but the Buckinghams seem to do very well also .
 There have been a lot of companies that have tried to duplicate Art of Shaving 's after shave balm , and they have failed . Art of Shaving even tried to IMPROVE upon it with their new Ocean Kelp line . Simply put , AoS got it right the first time , and there is simply no way to improve up the balm .
 What a wonderful product !!! Truly beneficial ... I have a truly thick heavy beard , I dull a Gillette Fusion in a single shave , and get bad razor burn ... my solution was a full beard , that is until I tried this -LRB- well Pre-Shave oils in general -RRB- and this particular brand quickly became my favorite . Preshave oil , Badger Brush , Shave SOAP , Straight Razor/Safety Razor , and a high quality post shave balm made all the difference in the world.This particular product is the best value for money out of the Quality shave oils on the market ... its more expensive than the worthless ` who knows what 's in it ' bargain store brand , but one of the most affordable and effective , $ 5-10 less than the other Quality brands . I will continue to buy this product for as long as they make it .
 It smells delicious and feels really good on the skin . Would definitively recommend it . I 'm curious to try the sandalwood scent .
 I bought it as a gift for Christmas and he loved it . I 'm personally not a big fan of shaving balm . I use a product called Shave Secret because it 's a tiny bottle of natural oils that lasts forever . I ca n't see myself using this product but my brother is VERY happy with it so I am happy too !
 This seems to be a pretty good product , albeit a little more expensive than some . It does calm the skin after a wet shave . The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming .
 This product has been the first good digestive enzyme I 've taken that works . Good price too , and quick delivery , Thats all I can say !
 These enzymes really help you to digest your food better and are worth purchasing . I buy them on a regular basis .
 My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl / k4MLG , with $ 10 off and free samples . Great stuff !!!!! He told me that digestive enzymes play key roles in our health by enabling our bodies to digest and utilize all the nutrients we ingest to the greatest extent possible . Without enzymes , food , minerals , and vitamins are useless . Moreover , these enzymes also play a key role in the elimination of toxins and the digestion and removal of scar tissue that builds up inside all of us as we age.Here is the major functions of systemic enzyme therapy :1 -RRB- Fights Inflammation2 -RRB- Fights Fibrosis3 -RRB- Immune System Modulation4 -RRB- Fights Blood Contamination5 -RRB- Fights VirusesTry it ... especially if you have acid reflux . I have n't had reflux since I started taking these babies ... a MUST HAVE . Taking these digestive enyzmes with each meal has made such a difference in my quality of life . No more being dragged down by indigestion and bloaty feeling . They got rid of my acid reflux , bloating , gas and indigestion . And even better , I lost three inches off my hips taking these . They help get rid of excess fat . Would recommend taking this product together with probiotics at goo.gl / 0qVLp if you have the same problems as me .
 Being using them for years to help with my sensitive stomach . Them seem to work pretty good . The company sends the product out in a timely manner and wraps the product excellent to keep the jars from breaking . Would n't hesitate to purchase from them again .
 I had an upset stomach so I decided to take this product just to test it out , and to my surprise it actually worked ! I am not a doctor so I would not recommend that anybody would do this , but it worked for me . Beside that small benefit that I accidentally discovered , it does what it is supposed to do !
 I 've been taking these on a empty stomach to help break up a fibroid and to prevent a reoccurance of breast cancer . I 'm not yet sure if they are helping but I am pretty sure that they are not hurting . I recently read that serraptase -LRB- sp ? -RRB- and nattokinase were better . I 'm trying them now . Prices were best on Amazon .
 I take these during my pregnancies to treat and prevent heartburn . Maybe I do n't have a predisposition to heartburn , BUT the fact that my esophageal muscles seem to take longer to get food down during pregnancy makes me think otherwise . When I have started to get heartburn I know I can squelch it out by taking 2 of these with a small glass of water . Works every time . Hope it can help for others too . It is natural and will also aid in digestion so your baby may not have as many or no food allergies . I take these with most meals as well as probiotics to avoid developing food allergies with my children -LRB- I breastfeed too -RRB- .
 I take only two caplets daily after my heaviest meal , especially when I know I 've eaten what I did not suppose to eat . It prevents me from constipation , gas formation or the sensation of bad taste in my mouth . During winter time , it is difficult to find fresh pineapple , which contains the best enzymes , I take Omega-Zyme Digestive Blend to keep my digestive system in good health.Garden of Life is my favorite brand for the product .
 After I did an ALLNIGHTER on BLACK FRIDAY to do shopping , something happened to my heart , I damaged it somehow after a full year of burning the candle at both ends . I ran hard and staying up all night on BLACK FRIDAY broken something in my body so that -- > I had racing heart , irregular heartbeat , heart beating so hard , every beat was painful , was dizzy and the room was spinning due to lightheadedness , and diastolic pressure of 40 !!!! I was sure I was a goner and the ER could find NOTHING WRONG , ekg good , bloodwork excellent , triglycerides normal range , etc. etc. etc. . I was eating raw dandelion juices , raw goatsmilk , you name it and NOTHING would help me . I called my parents to alert them I was not going to make it . Then I took OMEGA ZYME in my raw dandelion juice and my heart beat calmed in TEN MINUTES !!! I then took the OMEGA ZYME in water only to besure this was the `` fix '' to the heart rate and it IS . ******* I honestly do n't know why this works -- I know there is a HEART / ENZYME connection but I do n't really know HOW ***** . On a business trip I ran out of the OMEGAZYME and used ABSORBAID and I was right back in the TRASHER again . So not just any enzyme powder will do . I had to rush to buy some MORE OMEGA ZYME POWDER to halt the irregular heartbeat and rapid heart rate , combined with the SUPER LOW DIASTOLIC . AFter 8 hours after the OMEGA ZYME -LRB- and I now add GARDEN OF LIFE RAW GREENS -RRB- and THE RAW GREENS , my diastolic goes back up to 70 + and I feel the strength of a LION . Back to my TYPEA lifestyle . ANYWAY -- THANK GOD FOR GARDEN OF LIFE . I 'd be 6 feet under if I did n't THINK to TRY THIS enzyme I had bought earlier in the year but only took on occasion . I 'm glad it was in my kitchen during my time of extreme need . AND I HAD NO IDEA AN COMPLEX ENZYME POWDER to STOP IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT , PULL MY HEART RATE BACK TO NORMAL in the 70 range and pull my DIASTOLIC back to normal in 70 range , and blood pressure from 135 to 103 . And ... there 's a brain benefit too , faster brain speed . Wow . All that in an ENZYME .
 I ordered Garden of Life Omega Zyme for the first time a couple of years ago and since then I have been hooked on these fabulous enzymes . They bring all sorts of enzymes derived from plants which is better . I used to suffer from stomach acidity and all sorts of digestive problems and after taking omega zyme for around three weeks all my digestive problems were gone and I felt a lot better with a lot more energy . Thank You Omega Zyme . I can not live without you buddy !
 I knew something was not right with my digestion ... for years , even decades I had constant food cravings and abdominal pain . My doctor could find nothing wrong , he used MRI , bariun enema , x ray , to no avail.My weight had been going up along with my age , here i was . . 260 # 60yo . I looked on the web for any advise or help . I found Garden Of Life digestive enzymes and their probiotics ... Within a day my food cravings began to lessen and my gut pain subsided . After two weeks the situatuion is getting even better . . I have a normal appetite , I feel full after a modest meal and I am actually able to walk past delicious food because I am not hungry . Believe me I ALWAYS ate everything before.Maybe the resutls are not the same with all people , but these products sertainly work for me.Update , MAY 2011 , I am still using this product will the same great results .
 Ever since I could remember , I had painful stomach problems . After getting older , they changed and all of a sudden I noticed I specifically could n't eat peanut butter any longer . I did some research online and found out about enzymes and what a key role they played in all of the functions in your body , including and most commonly digestion . I also found out that our bodies are n't as efficient as producing them as we age . I tried the single enzyme approach for things like beans and milk and proteins in the past , but never had any luck . Then I found Omega-Zyme and it immediately worked . I was amazed ! I have n't taken it daily as recommended yet , but I should , because there is no doubt that I can eat peanut butter again as long as I take my Omega-Zyme with it!Update 6/21/2010 - I 've continued to buy this product because it has worked well for me . I 've used it mostly with peanut butter and it never fails , but I generally do n't take it with all meals because I generally do n't have problems with other foods . Recently , though , I started weightlifting again and began supplementing with whey protein and the pain and gas returned with a vengence . It made going to work an anxious experience . Because I had started associating Omega-Zyme with Peanut butter , I did n't think about taking it right away to help my problem , but after several days of pain and discomfort I remembered Omega-Zyme and tried taking it with the protein powder . I took 3 OmegaZyme pills with each of 2 drinks throughout the day and my problem was gone ! Yet again , I was extremely happy and amazed by the benefit this product provides me . As a note , though , no product is guaranteed to work for everyone . Digestive problems can be caused by a large number of issues -LRB- allergies , gulping air , intestinal bacteria profile , enzyme production , etc. . . -RRB- and I believe this product will only help if your problem is related to enzymes . I hope it helps you as much as it has me !
 I can not recommend this product highly enough . It has eliminated all my and my spouse 's indigestion problems , for which our regular doctor was going to put us on Nexium for the rest of our lives . Our wholistic doctor scoffed at this and said we simply needed more digestive enzymes . This turned out to be the most comprehensive and effective formula . Try them before you take a prescription !
 This product works . Take one tablet before each meal and snack and you will be on your way to perfect digestive health . I am a massage therapist who has tried and sold many different products and by far Garden of Life products are the best . I use the Garden of Life Probiotic and Garden of Life Fiber as well and ca n't imagine using or recommending any other product . Amazon is also the best place to purchase . Even with my professional discount on products , Amazon is the lowest price I have ever found .
 I have had stomach distress for decades . I 've tried every pharmaceutical remedy , antacid remedy , wives tail remedy I came across . When I realized enzymes were not yet tried , I bought these Omega-Zyme enzymes . They have provided me with a level of relief that I never even imagined possible . I had fairly regular bouts of stomach distress that would last all day -LRB- or sometimes several days -RRB- . The distress would affect my vagus nerve and impact my heart rhythm . It was maddening . These enzymes have all but eliminated my decade 's long struggle . I came to realize that , for them to work , I have to take them religiously whenever I eat almost anything throughout the day . If I do that , I am 90 % trouble free . It is not a coincidental relief . When I do n't take them , I can almost be certain of distress . When I take them each time I eat , almost no distress . My experience is that the standard -LRB- non Ultra -RRB- form is just as effective as the more costly `` Ultra '' . The `` Ultra '' is a capsule with powder in the capsule and the standard strength is a hard caplet . The Ultra version is consistently of poor quality control relative to amount of powder in the capsules . Some of the capsules are firm and full and others have very little in the capsules . I like that the standard hard caplet version is consistent from pill to pill . This is a great product . I could not be without them now that I have been relieved of the majority of my many , many years of stomach distress . I have tried other enzymes , but these are so consistently helpful I no longer look for anything less costly . These work for me and I would pay more if I had to for the relief they provide.A final comment for those that are highly lactose intolerant . There is not enough lactase in it to cover those that are significantly intolerant . I suggest keeping a lactaid type supplement around for those that may need an additional measure of lactose protection .
 I can poop ! I love this product it works miracles I feel better overall and tummy really notices a difference I 'd I skip a few day I would recommend this to anyone thinking of an aid
 I have tried all different types of lactose intolerance medicine . I had no luck until I bought this . Garden of life omega enzyme not only works for people who are lactose intolerant but also those with any stomach issues . I could tell the difference right away . I now have no problems eating anything . Great product .
 Unfortunately , there is not enough `` twang '' in these tomatoes but they are good . Definitely like them in hummus and in tomato sauces .
 I 've used this product for nearly a year now and I hope it 's available to me forever , and that the quality does not change . I 've never taken the time to review a product , at least not that I remember , but I want do all that I can to ensure that this product stays on the market . It 's a little annoying to read the negative reviews of this formula , because it all has to do with how it tastes . If we 're worried about taste , we 'll stick with McDonald shakes , but if it 's a super , nutrient dense supplement you 're looking for , then give it the 5-stars it deserves . I use this formula almost daily , and I disguise the earthy taste with yogurt , blue agave , berries , bananas , fruit juice and a few other special ingredients which transform it into a yummy smoothy . If you drink it with water only , it will probably act as a stomach cleanser and come back up , because the taste really is awful . But if you 're looking for increased , energy , an improved sense of general well-being -LRB- with little added perks like nicer hair and skin -RRB- than I 'm serious . . this product is AMAZING . Be creative , and you wo n't taste it at all , but believe me after a few months you 'll notice a tremendous difference in the way you feel , and possibly the way you look ! I love it .
 I bought this product for general health purposes . After using it for a short amount of time , I do notice a positive difference -LRB- to me this is remarkable because with the exception of laxatives and perhaps a few other supplements , I have never noticed the slightest difference between supplementing for any period of time and not -RRB- . But the most noticeable improvement is elimination of body odor . Which , to me , is quite amazing ! So that is what I will focus on.After brushing your teeth , your breath may still smell bad -LRB- or your mouth just not feel fresh -RRB- because your body continues producing the bacteria that are responsible for the stench . Using this product greatly lessens -LRB- you could almost say removes -RRB- all body odors -LRB- sweat , bad breath , feces , etc. -RRB- due to its anti-bacterial qualities -LRB- I suppose it is the clorophyll ? -RRB- . So I suggest trying this product.However , the taste may be intolerable to some . To me , it tastes OK . I have tried mixing it with cranberry/grape juice and it tastes much worse like that ! If you do n't like it , you may want to try taking them in capsule form -LRB- but five capsules is a lot to swallow -RRB- or perhaps buy pure clorophyll , which tastes pretty much neutral . I do n't know if that would work as well , but I myself plan on trying it . So good luck and I hope this review helps you make a better decision and that you 're satisfied with whatever product you choose and the end result .
 This is my first Amazon review , despite being in their thrall for years and years now . I felt compelled to share my experience with this product in hopes that it might help others.I have been using this stuff for over two weeks now . I initially heard about a different product , Miracle Greens , on one of my favorite podcasts . The digestive benefits the host was talking about piqued my interest . After searching on Amazon for Miracle Greens and similar products , I chose this one from Garden of Life based on ingredients . So , two weeks in , what have I learned?First , the taste review
 I definately appreciate this product for the good feeling I have after using it ; it is a solid player in my detox routine . I first tried mixing it with apple juice but did not like it . I think it goes well with blueberry , bilberry , raspberry or cherry juices . It 's not something I want to sip , I just shake a scoop with 6 oz or less of juice in a small Mason jar and knock it back . No big deal . My wife likes to mix it half and half with Kyo Green and she likes the flavor better that way.Several different merchants sell this on Amazon , be sure to check the price because it varies greatly .
 I picked this up from Whole Foods 2 weeks ago after trying many green formulas and it is by far the best . For the people complaining about taste what do they expect from a product like this ? You and not drinking it for taste but for what it does and my energy is way up and it tastes fine . Also for a container 1/2 the size offered here I paid $ 36.99 and it was on sale , it is reg $ 46.99 ! So Amazon has a great price as well .
 I have done a lot of research on the health benefits of vegetable and the greens . This is one of those products that will work in varying degrees for different people , depending on how your body wants to respond , but really , this will do nothing but good for your health.It is shown that cultures with diets high in the the natural form of what is contained here live a longer lives.In addition to regulating the digestive system with the probiotic strains , the vegetables also contain a lot of phytonutrients that help the body , regulating the blood , and allowing your enzymes to work optimally . Very cool . I have felt more energetic and , the most interesting result so far is the clearing of my acne . I used to have pretty bad acne -LRB- I 'm 23 , come on -RRB- , and probably about a month later from taking this daily , my acne is gone . Pretty marvelous.All in all 5 stars for sure . Worth the money . Really does not even taste that bad , just suck it up , its good for you . In my opinion , if you 're gon na drop like $ 50 on 600g of green powder , it seems like health is more important than taste .
 It * is * an `` acquired taste . '' Ahem.A few drops of stevia make it more palatable.The great thing about it , though , is that it contains alot of magnesium in the form of choropyll . Why is that good ? Among many things , it 's a muscle relaxant and helps me bring down my blood pressure -LRB- all foods with chlorophyll do that , but juicing them enhances the effect . Just look up the research on the web . -RRB- Further , it 's full of antioxidants.So , does it taste bad ? Unequivocally so ... but , it 's healthy stuff . So good , in fact , I ca n't bring myself to take a star away from it . I 'll just hold my nose and drink .
 I have never used a supplement that actually makes a noticeable change in my health except for this one . I take fish oil and they say its supposed to be the most amazing thing but nothing . I notice nothing . I take it anyway . When I stop taking it nothing changes . When I feel a cold coming on I am sure to take Garden of Life Perfect Food and the cold goes away . Also , talk about anti-inflammatory and slimming ! I feel it in my joints , it takes away the puffiness and slims me down too . My skin and hair also improve . I try to take it everyday when I remember . It tastes like plain spinach and collard greens but all you have to do is drink it . Sure , a hamburger might taste better , but really , it 's no big deal and I actually like it.All the negative comments about the taste . Have we become such slaves to our appetites that it 's impossible to stand a minute or two of something slightly awkward in our mouths ? Does everything have to be about taste ? Is it me or is the media -LRB- and others -RRB- trying to convince us that we have no control of our appetites ? I am tired of it . Fatness is a disease ?? Really ? Where was this disease in the 1970s ? Hmmmm ... Maybe it 's just easier to say it 's a disease as we pull up to the drive-thru window at a fast food joint . MUST . EAT . HAMBURGER . AND FRIES . No control . Billions of dollars at stake in the fast food industry so why not tell everyone they have no control over and over ? Oy veh !
 This is by far the best instant green drink product I 've tried . Noticeable improvements in bowel function and the occasional joint related aches and pains I would sometimes get after heavy weight training disappeared completely . I especially noticed this on my knees after heavy leg training days . Not sure why , but I clearly had a deficiency somewhere that the green drink fulfilled . I had tried several lesser quality brands and did n't see any benefit . They also gave me a bad case of mud butt ! As for the taste of Perfect Food , come on now people . Grow a pair and deal with it . I mix it with 8 oz of cold water every morning and evening and have no problems whatsoever . I guess it 's an acquired taste , but I actually enjoy the fresh green flavor now that I 'm accustomed to it . Regardless , this is an excellent product that I recommend to everyone I know and consider it a cornerstone of my healthy diet . Try it !
 I bought the Garden of Life Perfect Food after trying Kyo-Green and loving it , but wanting something more complete or beneficial . I actually loved the taste of the Kyo-Green . This stuff was another story . I 'm not real finicky about taste , and I know I 'm doing it just for the benefits , but this stuff was pretty bad . Kind of a strange fishy odor/taste , maybe from the spirulina ? It 's not a huge issue , but I always have to have orange juice or grapefruit juice to kill it . The pulp in these helps you ignore any lumps of powder in there too . It 's not easy to mix.I recovered MUCH faster from a cold than my loved ones after taking this religiously . I believe it was because of this product . It 's good ! Cheaper than some , but I think I 'll go with something else next time .
 My mom used to try and get me to drink this stuff ! I finally gave in ... 3 years later ... purchased it on my own at my local Co-op . The taste is n't bad !! I put a packet of stevia in and just drink it ... and I know I 'm getting great benefits . So happy about this product except I wish the price was lower .
 I 've been using Garden of Life products for years because of their quality , even though they tend to be pricey . We use perfect food in a nutritional shake at lunch and it gives us great energy for the afternoon . Amazon has the best price I 've seen anywhere .
 this product just makes you feel good and makes your skin and body look and feel well
 Helps keep my energy level up and steady , also keeps sugar cravings down . I never have to worry if I have eaten enough greens , pure and simple food as stated . This is the only supplement I take .
 Yes , it does look and taste pretty disgusting . BUT you are n't drinking it for taste and if you 're using this you 've probably tried some pretty weird things before . I like it for how it makes me feel and am already seeing some benefits in my digestive system . I mix mine with a small amount of juice -LRB- 6-8oz -RRB- and chugged it all down at once . Apple juice is good but my new favorite is to mix it with an all natural raspberry lemonade . I tried it with water and had to pour it out . Definitely try it with the juice !
 From all the reviews on this product , I do n't have to tell you that this is a great quality product . The downside is definitely the taste . I have just started drinking it . My plan is to drink a half a scoop three times a day . I 'm trying to recover to optimal health . Anyway , my advice to get this drink down without gagging is to mix it in 4-8 oz of water and add the juice of half of a lemon -LRB- a quarter is not enough -RRB- . Chug it all in one take . The lemon is so strong that it does a pretty good job of covering up at least some of the taste . Unfortunately it 's still tough to get down . The second part of my advice is the use a wide straw placed towards the back of your throat . I 've used this trick to get through the nasty concoctions you have to drink for a liver flush . You still get hit with some of the nastiness , but it 's WAY better than drinking it without a straw . Hope this helps .
 `` Perfect Food '' is the best green drink I have ever found . I will recommend this product to everyone I know who wants to live in a healthy lifestyle and for a very , very long time . Wonderful !
 A great supplement that I have taken for years . Hearty greens with probiotics that assists the liver and provides a good source of greens not necessarily found in most people 's diets . Generally I can get the 600 Grams for substantially less than on the food shelf in most grocery or supplement stores.Oh , by-the-way it has a greenish flavor so if you want a candy flavor this wo n't be for you but you easily adjust to the taste . You can mix it with a nutrition bullet or merely shake it in a container .
 No complaints about taste . Too bad some people who reviewed have n't been creative or hardy enough to figure it how to consume something which is so beneficial to health.I add a scoop to orange juice , and gulp it down . Tastes even better blended with a banana . I feel great about easily supplementing my diet with a wonderful variety of health promoting vegetables and super greens . I will buy for years to come . Amazon seems to have the best pricing .
 This is an amazing product . I thought the taste was bad at first but it 's actually grown on me over the weeks . I mix about a 3/4 liter of room temperature water with a heaping scoopful . The smell is bad but the taste is n't bad -LRB- and I have never liked the taste of vegetable juices -RRB- and I 've noticed it leaves a pleasant aftertaste & it 's filling . I do not recommend mixing with protein powder , I tried doing that once with vanilla Jay Robb in a blender and it was disgusting . I feel a lot more energetic and an overall sense of lightness since I started this product . I paid $ 75 for a big container at my local health food store , have since found it online much cheaper .
 I am surprised that so many Amazon reviewers are put off by the taste of Garden of Life Perfect Food Powder . If your diet up to now has consisted mostly of Coke and Krispy Kremes , maybe I could understand ; but if you 're accustomed to the flavor of fresh green vegetables , you should have no problem.I like the taste and prepare Perfect Food according to the instructions on the label . I mix the powder and water in a blender for a few seconds so that the final result is smooth , even a bit frothy . Then I sit back and slowly sip the dark green elixir like a fine cognac.I 've never tried Perfect Food Original , which is stevia free , but even Perfect Food is not at all sweet to my palette.Garden of Life now offers Perfect Food Raw . I 've read a lot of reviews but I ca n't find any that discuss differences -LRB- in taste or purported benefits -RRB- between the two drinks . Perhaps another Garden of Lifer could enlighten us.Don ' t expect health miracles from this product . But if you 're coming up short on the vegetable side of your diet , give Perfect Food a chance and see if it 's right for you .
 I decided to buy this after visiting my local health food store several times . The store associate was trying to sell me on Macro Greens , but my gut was going more for Perfect Food . I am happy I did ! There is much more in Perfect Food than in the Macro Greens . Now ... the taste is not the greatest , but it I as expected from eating green foods . It tastes like eating spinach and kale without dressing when you blend it with water alone . I like blending it with apple juice and/or putting a banana or mango in it . Overall in the last week plus that I have used this , my energy level has been so much higher . My energy lasts throughout the day , and I 've been sleeping much better at night . My husband even said my skin is glowing -LRB- not from pregnancy , LOL -RRB- . I feel so much more alert while at work . I 've already ordered another container from Amazon , and also ordered the Raw Meal . This has become a morning ritual for me -LRB- and now my husband -RRB- . These supplements will definitely help me as I transform my body to become more alkaline . Also , I will add , that while my husband and oldest were sick with the flu this week , I have n't had so much as a sniffle . I have also been giving some to my 3-yr od twins and they have n't been sick either . They do n't mind the drink because the eat a lot of greens anyway . Definitely try this if you are thinking about it .
 This is perfect combo with RAW PROTEIN BY GADREN OF LIFE this has done wonders for me and my husband i have lossed 35lbs in less than 4 months and my husband has lossed some too just try it you 'll love what it does for you it wakes up up you feel so good and have so much energy just make a shake with the two powdwers and mix it with juice and what ever fruit combo i use frozen fruit and it makes the beat smoothie shake full of great stuff for your body i love it !
 One of the healthiest , cancer preventive maintenance drinks you can put in your body . Do it while you do n't have to . !
 I 've already written a review on this product . It is the best ! I recommend it for anyone whose physical condition allows them to consume green vegetables . I do love the product ... I no longer have to spend time juicing vegetables . A scoop of Garden of Life Perfect Food Super Green Formula in Distilled Water -LRB- my choice -RRB- , energizes me for hours . Amazon.com picked a winner when choosing to sell this product . I highly recommend the product , and Amazon.com . I am 86 years young , vibrant , mentally alert , attuned to higher consciousness . Love and Light!Ruth `` Mama '' Long
 I am a huge fan of a lot of Garden of LIfe products , namely this product . I began using this in my mid - to late twenties now in my early forties I am still using it . I mix mines with pineapple juice the taste does n't bother me but I would recommed a straw for those who just find this to sooo bad ... . This products keeps my skin clear , my hair long , my nails growing and keeps me regular . Ihave tried other products but I alsway come back to Garden of Life . I recently tried tthe Raw Vanilla Protein with almond milk vanilla and strawberries ... . it was n't too bad ... but the jury is still out . I tried the Garden of Life coconut oil , then tried to specturm ... I will be returning to Garden of Life ...
 No scientific analysis , just drinking it down on faith , hoping something good is happening.I shake it up with a big squeeze of fresh lemon juice to taste , cracked ice , optimum with dechlorinated & defluorided water ... then down the hatch.A psychosomatic glow afterwards , thinking all will be better , even without glowing radiant green in the dark.Pungent , though not soooo bad ... oddly enough has me thinking sort of a fish meal factory , without any fish in sight.So , how did that fish odor originate without any fish ?
 This product was giving to me as a Christmas gift by my wonderful daughter-n-law . She recommended that I take this produce do to my health problems I am having with Fibromyalgia , she said ; `` it 's the best thing you can take for your body '' . I immediately got on a daily regimine and my body feels great ! I suggest this product to anyone and everyone , especially those who do n't eat many veggies . Also , people who have high toxicity levels in their bodies should definitely use this amazing produce . I am bless to have been giving this amazing product like this one that has help my bodies so much .
 I 've been using this product for several years . It is a ` Perfect ' way to get all your vegetables in one serving . Some people have trouble with the taste/look -LRB- tastes and looks like liquid spinach -RRB- but it is well worth it . Suggestions
 GREAT product , and a great way to start my day ! I mix it in OJ in the morning and feel healthy throughout the day when I drink it . I definitely feel the difference when I drink it .
 For a greens formula this taste really good . 100 % raw/fermented greens , grasses , seeds , and micro-algaes , micro-flora & enzymes . Great staple nutritional to have .
 I 've been using this daily for several months , along with an additional 2 grams a day each of chlorella and spirulina -LRB- the perfect food has these ingredients , but I 'm taking extra -RRB- . So I 've been taking green supplements for a few months now.Good things I 've noticed : My digestion is better . I have had problems that fiber and various probiotics were not really fixing , for some reason this seemed to mostly remedy the issue . My digestion is back to what it was before I did a couple of courses of antibiotics.Energy . I 'm not so much manic and full of energy , but if I have a poor nights sleep I function better the next day than in the past . I think I need an hour less sleep a day on these products . Normally I need 7-8 to feel rested , I seem to get by fine with 6-7 now . If I only sleep 4-5 hours I still am able to function in the day with less fatigue than in the past . I do n't get as fatigued as I used to.Things I did n't notice : Skin is no better -LRB- I 'm in my 30s , so maybe that is expected -RRB- . Same with hair , no difference.I still get sick . A bad case of bronchitis was working its way around the office , I got it anyway . This alone did n't stop it . In the past large doses of vitamin D helped me stop getting infections , I need to go back on that.Mood . I do a lot of things to work with my moods , I do n't know if I can say perfect food did anything in and of itself.All in all it is a good product since I do n't normally eat vegetables . The best way to ` get it down ' is to mix it with 8oz of milk and a scoop of protein powder in the blender , then drink it through a straw . This stuff does taste bad , and if you ca n't find a way to get it down you may end up puking it back up . So find a recipe that works for you and is easy to make each day . I 've even thought of doing a modified ` juice fast ' using my milk/protein/perfect food beverage instead of juiced greens . I think 5-6 servings a day of this for a few weeks could help clean me out.I 've noticed a lot of the green juice supplements in grocery stores are basically just fruit juice with a tiny amount of greens . This stuff is far more diverse and healthy -LRB- ie it is n't 80 % apple and pineapple juice with a hint of greens for tint -RRB- . It is an amalgam of various superfoods and health products . So I 'm glad I started using this instead . Plus it is cheaper , less than a dollar a serving.Edited
 I 'm so surprised at all the folks who say this stuff tastes terrible . I tried it after using another brand for quite a while and was so delighted at how much better it tastes than the other kind ! I mix with milk and psyllium . As always with psyllium , you have to drink it fast or the psyllium gums up .
 I love Perfect Food Super Greens . However , I 'm different than most . At night before going to bed , I mix the greens , protein , the super seed with some pure fruit juice and drink it with one Pure Encapsulations 0.5 melatonin and two tabs of 650 mg of full spectrum Velerian Extract . I then go to bed . This has really help me as far as my health and I sleep like a baby .
 This product along with other garden of life products has been life changing . My son was diagnosed with mild to moderate autism at 2 . He is 6 and lost his diagnosis at 5 . With the onslaught of problems he had as a toddler , the super green food formula helped tremendously !!!!! We began to have hope and now several years later we still use this product as our &#34; maintenance protocol &#34; . We use the powder form and put it in baby food organic green beans and call it his green food - he once said mom , that 's baby food and I 'm a big boy now , but when I disregard that it 's baby food and get creative , lol , he does n't care anymore and takes it on a regular basis . Some day I will meet Jordin Ruben and thank him for giving our son , his life back ... it was so hard seeing him deal with bouts of diarrhea and throwing up and the cognitive issues etc etc - I meet families all the time that tend to keep using products that do n't offer any positive results for their child , so they give up - or they do n't even look at garden of life products because it does n't fit in with the ` autism biomedical criteria ' , but I will advocate for what works ! These kids have a chance with garden of life ! I 'm so thankful I took a chance and tried these products !! It was not overnight , but we saw results within a month . Try it !
 I mix almond milk , strawberries , bananas , and a scoop of this super green formula and have no problem drinking it . It 's actually tasty . If you are a smoothie drinker , go for it.I use a blender and frozen fruit to make it creamy . Try it and stop whining .
 I almost expected this to taste absolutely terrible based on some of the reviews . However , I 've been into ` natural products ' for more than 30 years and not all of them taste like ice cream . The best way to take the Perfect Food is to get a quart jar , put 6-8 ounces of bottled water in it , add some ice , shake it up and drink . You do n't have to hold your nose or add fruit juice ; it does n't taste bad at all . And think what it 's doing for your health . Greens are probably the best foods we can consume .
 This product is life changing . I , too , have never written a product review . I have been taking this for about two months now , and I truly feel much , much better . I have more energy all day long . I feel better , well , internally . I used to take Advil everyday to help with my morning stiffness and creaking knee joints . I have noticed that my knees do n't crackle on stairs or in exercise classes , and I am not even taking the Advil anymore!About the taste , yes it is totally vile . Worst thing I have ever put in my mouth , but as others have noted , we are all grown up and it 's good for us . My trick to make it semi-palatable is to mix it with 4-6 oz of Odwalla 's Mighty Mango pur&eacute;ed juice . Just mix , drink , and do n't stop til it is all gone .
 First of all , I am a skeptic and I was addicted to caffeine and ephedra for many years because I felt incredible energy and it 's something that actually worked right away . I weaned myself off of both stimulants and it took a long time to get my natural energy back . Plus caffeine used to make me agitated . I happened to buy these greens because I heard it helps with infertility . I did not get pregnant so I gave up on it . I recently went on weight watchers and teach many fitnesses classes per week -LRB- yes I still gain wt unfortunately with age -RRB- and I started taking vitamins . I saw the green food in my closet and decided to add it in every other day . I could not believe how much energy I received about 30-60 minutes after from the greens as opposed to not feeling anything from my multi vitamin !!! When at the gym I work out like a beast with incredible strength ! I am stuck on this for life , b/c I hate feeling tired , and hopefully it will help me get pregnant . This stuff if powerful and is the bomb ! I am so happy I decided to try it again and realized my energy increase with it !
 I mix it with orange juice , I don `` t know why people have such a hard time drinking it , it tastes fine to me , although I have been using products like this for years . You will get used to it , it just tastes like powdered veggies , big deal . If you can take shots of vodka or other alcoholic drinks , you can drink a shot of this . I can feel the great effects on my body right after drinking this , as it contains nutrients that heal your body and contributes to the elimination of fat from your body as well . Drink for your health !
 I learned about this supplement when I discovered I had food allergies to all dairy products . I had severe mouth ulcers . Originally I was in so much pain I used prescribed steroids to deal with it . Since then I discovered this supplement not only battles this situation , but also provides needed vegetables for a daily requirement , and last as I am unable to have traditional yogurt which has probiotics this also covers that requirement as well . The taste was a bit of a challenge at first but I adjusted to it and just drink it now . You can make it taste better with juice or something but I just drink it quick so no biggie .
 I have to say this product is making a difference for me . I have tried many different supplements/drinks over the years , and this is probably the first one where I can physically SEE a noticeable difference . The most obvious , and unexpected , is how my skin looks . I am 57 , and do not suffer acne , but my skin looks very much clearer in the short time I am drinking this . I am excited to see how this continues to improve over time . As for the taste , it can be masked . I combine it with my whey shake from Mercola , add some organic milk , 1/2 banana , and some liquid aloe . I think it tastes quite good this way , and certainly acceptable . I shared it with my daughter , and though she did n't like the taste as much as me , she found it at least tolerable . I am at the point where I do n't want to start my day without it ! Try it !
 I love this stuff ! I immediately feel better and have more energy when I drink it . However when I first tried it and put a whole scoop in 8 oz of water I totally gagged and could not handle it . I called the company and a very nice fella told me to just put a teaspoon or less in eight ounces of water and drink it that way til I get used to it and you know that worked great ! It has taken a while . But I now I have a big 16 oz coffe mug that I measure 4 teaspoons of green drink into every day and fill the mug up with water . That 's what I have `` worked up to '' . I think they should put those instructions on the container for people who hav n't had green drinks before . I sure could n't handle the full scoop at first and sound like alot of others have that challenge too !
 I decided to give this product a shot to increase my intake of green veggies and their nutritional benefits . I have come up with the following daily beverage
 I originally purchased this product years ago for a shake I read about in a book . Since then that is the only way I have used this . It is so good in the shake that even my 9 year old likes it - and he liked it back when he was 6 . It gives me good energy and just makes me feel better . For the shake :1 cup soy milk1 banana1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder -LRB- has 2 grams fiber ! -RRB- 2 stevia packets1 tbsp flax oil -LRB- I often omit this due to not having it on hand -RRB- 4 ice cubes1 scoop super greensBlend up and enjoy . It really is quite good . Oh and of course this 60 serving is the same price as the 30 serving in the health food store . Sad , but true . If you are looking for a good deal and a good product , this is it !
 I just wanted to round out a my supplement plan by adding good greens to a my multi-vitamin and protein powder shake regimen . I chose this product because the ingredient list is impressive . Price seems very reasonable considering what buying all this fresh produce would cost , not to mention preparation and waste . Yes of course the dry product is very green and smells like dried grass or hay clippings as one would expect with no artificial flavorings added . Starting with cold filtered water , I added it to a vanilla cream flavored time release blended protein powder , along with dry oatmeal , walnuts , fiber -LRB- psyllium husk -RRB- , a dash of olive oil , about two tablespoons of low carb strawberry yogurt or a piece of banana and it was still very green but tolerable and obviously a more complete meal replacement shake . One could add lots of calories with other options and possibly make it delicious but this stuff will likely stay green colored , but so is a nice salad or spinach , and we usually flavor those too , huh ! I find it more easily digested than a ordinary vegetable meal . And , maybe its all in the head but I do seem to feel better as opposed to when I have had the shakes for quiet some time without the greens added . So far I would recommend the product if you understand what you are getting .
 I have tried to drink the recommended serving -LRB- 2T . -RRB- in a large glass of water , oh boy , no go ! I have gone to drinking 1 T in a glass of water with a serving of chocolate protein powder , much more palatable . I try to eat well but am very busy and on the days that I just do n't find time to get my greens in , this is a great alternative .
 I bought this originally at the health food store for my smoothies . I ca n't taste it when it 's mixed with the berries etc so that 's a good thing . I 've had some green powders that had a strong taste so if I can get the nutrients without an overwhelming -LRB- bad -RRB- flavor , I 'm thrilled . This does the trick .
 This is a little expensive but of course Amazon gives you about 30 % off that . The quality , however , is excellent ! Check out the label . They really pack in there all the nutrients , in the form of organic foods , that you need to survive this crazy food rescramble day and age .
 i usually do not write reviews on my purchases but i want to share my opinions on this product . i am 23 years old and like to live as healthy as possible . i think green drinks such as this are healthier than multivitamins and i actually feel healthier after drinking this . This is the best product i have ever bought for my health . I drink it every morning as soon as i wake up . this is not a miracle product but it 's full of vitamins and other healthy stuff that i probably dont even know about . Fair warning -- this product does not taste good . Once you taste it you will be able to tell that it is very healthy -LRB- honestly tastes like algea and broccoli -RRB- . if u r someone who cares about what your green drink tastes like go elsewhere . otherwise , if u r like me and care only about the health benefits and want the best product for the money you pay , this is what u want . there are green drinks cheaper but they 're far less effective in my opinion . hope this helps .
 I used this 2 or 3 times daily to overcome Chronic Fatigue -LRB- with a healthy diet -RRB- . I take a scoop a day now , and I keep a scoop in an 8-oz jar when I go shopping in case I get too tired I can just add a few ounces of water and down it . Within 10 or 15 minutes my energy is back . It is pre-digested meaning that I can take it on an empty stomach and it gets to my blood stream quickly . This is a major factor for most Americans who have poor digestion . No , it does n't taste great , but I just put it in about 4 ozs of water , shake well , and down it . I do n't notice the taste anymore . This is the only super food that has worked for me . -LRB- Make sure your `` shaker '' has a tight cap ! Hold it over the sink just to be safe when you shake this up . -RRB- S.J. in Texas
 I 've been struggling with arthritis pain , sore joints and low energy for a long time . After changing my diet completely , I was still dealing with these and other health issues to varying degrees . A reputable natural healer advised me to incorporate a quality green supplement to my organic , vegan based diet . It was when I added `` Perfect Food '' to my already stuffed Blentec that in two weeks I noticed a change , perhaps the change that was to elevate my health to another level , where I began to feel a noticeable tapering of my arthritis symptoms as well as my sore joints and muscles . It 's been a long journey , probably too long to discuss here , but i 'm relieved to feel better to the point that I can not remember when I last felt this good.Perfect Food combines many great ingredients including a quality probiotic , green grasses and vegetables too numerous to list and many are organic . It is great for those who have no time to hunt down leafy greens to eat or grind up . I should know because I spend a lot of time going to stores who are indifferent to organic produce and if they carry any , it is already expired and wilted . So I recommend mixing this product in water or even in your protein drinks for the daily helping of green . We need green to fortify our poor American diets since few of us are not fortunate enough to live on or near a farm.Recently after petting one of my dogs -LRB- another `` little '' Rottweiler -RRB- , I discovered two cysts on opposing shoulders that were 3.5 cm 's in diam . She had a dry , wiry coat and was shedding excessively which surprised me because she is on a natural/raw diet . I decided to give her and my other dogs some of my green drink since I felt they were not getting enough green and this was easy to do for me . Within two weeks , my little Rotty 's cysts had each shrunk to the size of a pea . Her coat was shiny and she ceased to shed . My other dogs ' coats also improved and two of them no longer had ear issues.This is a proven product that has been on the market for a while and it works . In my case , I had to also change my diet , eliminating many fats and `` dead '' foods . Amazon has made this so affordable with their auto delivery program and I am grateful . We go through one 600 gm . container per month as well as one `` Primal Defense '' -LRB- see my review -RRB- 180 cap bottle . Both are free shipping . I 've seen Perfect Food as high as $ 72 . Vitacost has it for $ 42 . Amazon beats them all -LRB- 600 gram container -RRB- for $ 34 total ! Thanks Amazon !
 I received it yesterday and tried it right away . Based on negative reviews , I was expecting a horrible smell and taste . I was pleasantly surprised . I may be in the minority but I really liked the smell and the taste . The smell reminded me of recently lawned grass . The taste was chalky but not bad . If you just gulp it up without stopping , you do n't taste anything at all except in the end . For the benefits the product offers to the body , it 's worth a moment of chalky after-taste . I tried Anthony Robbins ' green drink before . I think this product is superior in quality , more quantity and less expensive . I think I just found a supplement for life !
 I have taken this product for several years . Yes , it does n't good at all , but as some of the others have said , those of us who take this kind of drink are n't doing it for the taste . I know this goes against a totally healthy approach , but it works for me . I mix about 1/4 teaspoon of sugar-free Kool-Aid in it . It masks the flavor just enough so that I can take it . I choose a strong flavor such as cherry or raspberry . I do n't want to mix it in juice as I want my juice to taste like juice . So , Kool-Aid works for me .
 When I first tried this it was very strong . But with a little creativity , my husband and I now enjoy drinking our daily smoothie shake . I use Dole Pina Colada juice for a great coconut flavor , some kefir -LRB- I make myself for the probiotics -RRB- and squirt a bit of Raw Agave Nectar for sweetness , frozen fruit mix , 1 TBS of ground flax seeds , 1 TBS of DE -LRB- Diatomaceous Earth -RRB- and a level scoop of Super Green and blend . Its my breakfast drink every morning . Since starting this in May , my hair is fuller -LRB- less daily hair loss -RRB- and my husband too -LRB- he says -RRB- . The flax keeps you regular , so if you have trouble with this , definitely add ground flax seeds to your drink ... you 'll be so glad you did ! I feel so much better , in general . Since I do put several things in my super shake , I 'm not sure what has helped the most , but the combination seems to be perfect for us .
 So , considering the other reviews , I was braced to down something vile . However , the concoction tastes pretty good , kind of like green tea . I 'm not an health nut , and I have n't tried any other brands . I 'm just in it to get my greens , without actually having to eat a salad . I 'm not getting the chalky or bitter aftertaste . Maybe , they changed the recipe .
 This is great stuff . It gives me a very noticeable increase in my energy level after just a couple of days of using it , plus it 's easy to take and adds to my water intake . I 've been using it for several years and highly recommend it .
 I 've been on the Perfect Food powder for about 15 days , now . I love the energy I have . I mix mine with fruit juice ... you can get use to the taste ... it taste very organic ... but it 's good for you !
 THE PRODUCT MIXES EASILY . THE TASTE IS OK.I DONT THINK THERE ARE MANY OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE BETTER TASTING.I INTEND TO BUY IT AGAIN
 I can not imagine a day without my Garden of Life Perfect Food Shake in the morning . I 'm a 52-year old runner and triathlete and find that downing `` my green drink '' sets my body for the upcoming run or workout . I strongly recommend this drink to all the folks I train . Recently I `` hooked '' my husband on it . As a middle school teacher and football coach he needs all the energy he can muster . And during football season George says `` it 's a must '' .
 I FEEL like a grasshopper as I drink this . It tastes like I dumped my grass clippings in cup of liquid and drank them . I also FEEL like a grasshopper afterwards because this drinks gives me AMAZING ENERGY . I feel like I could hop to San Francisco . -LRB- I live in Jersey -RRB- . I mix it with rice milk and add 2 tsp of Agave . i am really beginning to like the taste . I am also beginning to look like a grasshopper .
 Writing from beautiful Maputo , Mozambique , I have to say , this stuff is great for people who will be away from the conveniences of whole food markets but want to retain a healthy amount of greens and `` green benefits '' . Unfortunately , I can not eat the raw veggies here -LRB- no one who has not been here for a significant period of time can , it 's a matter of adjustment to local water . Much like you do n't drink from the tap in US cities that are new to you -RRB- , so I consume the Perfect Foods Super Greens as well as their Perfect Antioxidant Fruits powder.Firstly , it traveled well . The packaging did not crack or burst all over my luggage . That would have been sad because the dry contents are actually sticky.Secondly , for those of you who may be interested in consuming this but will not have a blender on hand , I recommend cutting the taste with coconut milk or coconut water and a little sweetener . Fruit juice can work too but , I would steer away from citrus -LRB- local orange juice did n't taste too great -RRB- ! It wo n't be the best thing you 've ever had , but if you 're already into green smoothies , you 're ready for the taste!Thirdly , I find it energizing . In a situation where my diet is now half raw , half low-process carbs -LRB- rice , beans , cereal etc -RRB- and intermittent forms of high protein sources , my energy levels have gone down pretty quickly since lowering the raw in my diet and eating more `` white sugars '' . This definitely helps with getting me back on my US track . It 's also better than caffeine for energy.Lastly , I think the Perfect Greens products have really kept me from the real immune system suppression that can come with long flights , jet-lag and a less nutrient dense diet . Reasonably , I should have a stabbing ear infection , a cold and possibly diarrhea by now . If you 're not thinking you 're that at risk for these things , than I would say consuming the greens daily will be great for boosting your energy and present level of health ; not just keeping you balance.If you 're considering it , go for it . This will be a part of my regimen when I am back in the United States , for sure .
 Product is exactly what I was looking for but at an even better price ! The item could not be located at any store or online a this price , I will purchase again .
 Great product . I really feel that I am getting a balanced amount of greens and feel thedifference in my energy level and general wellness .
 If you 're new to green powder formulas , they will all taste alittle strange but I can say that after awhile , your palate adjust to them . They 've added a small amt of stevia which helps w/the taste . Stevia is plant based and not a chemical sweetener like splenda is and many others . This is such a wonderful product . I have stomach and colon problems but since using this product , it has helped alot and I have no problems digesting it at all . This company has put more emphasis on bioavailability . They 've created a patented production process called Poten-Zyme fermentation , which actually predigest some of the nutrients to help the digestive system absorb more , since green powder compounds are hard to digest . I do n't think anyone really gets all of the nutrition we need from the food we eat daily and this product makes such a difference . I take the powder w/just water and my husband takes the tablets w/water daily because of his busy schedule .
 This is a great product . I have been using it daily for many months and I highly recommend it . It gives me sustainable energy that gets me through my busy days as a personal trainer .
 For anyone wanting to become healthier , boost energy and overall just feel better this is a huge step . I 've been drinking Superfood products for 12 + years , this `` Perfect Food '' is right at the top . Over the years they have become easier to mix , I mix this in water , that 's it . I enjoy the taste as I 'm used to green food drinks . If you freak out over the taste , just mix it with a juice you like or blend it with frozen fruit or whatever , just get it down ! As for the price , holy cow , Amazon is the best , I signed up for the subscription % 15 off which comes to $ 35 , are you kidding me ? That is as good as you can get anywhere especially for a 60 day supply . I just bought the smallest jar at Whole foods for $ 25 , maybe a 2 week supply . For the past few years I 've been using and highly recommend Healthforce Vitamineral Green V5 , it 's on amazon for 49 bucks , this is a $ 100 superfood . So now I 'll save some money , keep the quality with `` Perfect Food '' until I switch it up again . I 'm just happy that products like this exist , it 's truly a blessing . Buy it , drink it , feel better !
 I do n't think any of us get enough of our fruits and veggies , so drinking the `` green stuff '' -LRB- which is really Perfect Food by Garden of Life -RRB- lets me know I `` m getting what I need.I feel so good and have more energy now , so I have shared with my friends.Six of my family and friends are now using it . I ' 66 years old , and making lots of healthy choices now . Never too late to get healthy and Perfect Food is a big part of it . I find the best prices are on Amazon .
 I ca n't say it tastes bad in drink form because I put so many things in drink ... like bananna and blueberries ... SO that taste is OK ... BUT ... out of curiosity I put half a teaspoon in my mouth naked and you know what ... it tasted GREAT !!! ... Now I routinely have teaspoon of it daily cuz I like the taste . .
 I 've been on this stuff for a few months , and it is amazing . It is great to have at times when good fresh greens are unavailable . It does taste like the bottom of a lawn mower , but the benefits far outweigh the taste thing .
 I 'm a veteran green drink user , often slurping them down for breakfast , and I 'm notorious in my circle for adding things that also taste bad , like brewer 's yeast , so as to drink all my foul-tasting supplements in one gulp . After reading reviews about how horrible this one was to drink , I was surprised to find it pleasantly ordinary . I mixed up a big cup of green drink with brewer 's yeast on my very first try , and it was n't the most horrible flavor I 'd ever experienced . -LRB- The worst , incidentally , was when I mixed acai juice with my green drink/brewer 's yeast mixture . I hate acai berry . -RRB- So my point is , do n't assume that this drink will taste bad just because others find it foul . If you 're used to the flavors of health foods , you may have had worse in the past . It only takes a few seconds to glug it down , and then you feel better all day . My body loves this stuff .
 To get the nutritional content of these ingredient with dietary arrangements would be very difficult . To those that wouyld complain about the taste -- what do you expect from something that is so good for you . Besides , enough bananas blended in can make anything taste good . I also recommend using Boathouse Farms `` Green Goodness '' -LRB- most supermarkets have it -RRB- mixed in to dampen the taste .
 First off , this stuff is full of good energy . I drink it in the morning and I know it satisfies my body 's hunger for nutrition because I do n't seem to eat as much as before I started drinking it . I first bought this at a local health food store and then looked on Amazon to get ideas from the reviews on what to drink it with so that it tasted good . A nice side discovery I made was the price is very good on Amazon . I experimented with different juices and what I found to work the best for me was simply to mix it with any sweet juice and warm it up in the microwave -LRB- even orange juice ... looks and sounds gross , but actually tastes pretty good -RRB- . Before I discovered this , I had to down it pretty quick -LRB- even when I mixed with any juice -RRB- but now it tastes pretty good ... give it a try .
 Helps my body functions nicely . I 'm 55 y/o and just had my six month checkup . Heart rate and blood pressure in the very normal range as well as my EKG . Doctor continues to recommend a colonoscopy as prevention but I 'm quite confident that my colon is very healthy thanks to my daily intake of The Super Green Formula . Great for all around body and mind function . Perfect way to assure your daily intake of green foods-I also assume that it 's a good way to keep myself alkaline .
 I mix a scoop of Perfect Food with a banana and orange juice with ice in the blender everyday . . it tastes good , it gives you solid veggie and fruit servings , and it wakes you up a little as well ... pricey but worth it if you are serious about your health ...
 My name is Jake , I have been diagnosed with many health issues , the high-lights would be Crohn 's Disease , Pancreatitis , arthritis & fibromayalgia . With several other serious issues as well . The reason I state this is , because , before all of my diagnosis ' I was an athlete with an AMAZING body & at 18 that is when my life changed with the first diagnosis , then my life swooned deeper into destruction because I did exactly what the Dr.s said . Then at 25 my mother told me to try this product line . It has changed my life ! This product in particular does SO MANY positive things that i can not list them all . Some ; Almost completely removed the fibromayalgia -LRB- over time -RRB- it has raised my body temp from 96 degrees back to normal . Removed almost all joint/bone/muscle pain . It gives me energy , it helps to drain my liver , it keeps me regular , :-RRB- it acts like an anti-inflammatory & it has helped my anxiety . And it does not taste as bad as people on here make it out to be . It is vegetables , its not sludge from droppings or something horrible , just veggies . I strongly recommend this product . I recommend almost everything from this company , AND they make LITERALLY the best Vitamin on the planet , it is FULLY absorbable to the body . It is called vitamin code . I WENT FROM MY DEATH BED TO NOW I HAVE 2 JOBS I WORK AS A WAITER & I WORK AS A MAINTENANCE MAN FOR A LOCAL MALL . AND NO ONE CAN TELL THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME !!! If that doesnt help people I dont know what will , please eat right , take care of your body , it can heal if you give it the right stuff . If you happen to suffer from Crohn 's please take this product , the vitamin , and the product called Primal Defense . And frankly anything else you can afford from them . Thank you for reading my two cents . The vitamin is available in sevesral different ways , including pre-natal , Here are 2 examples : Garden of Life Vitamin Code Men 's Multi-Vitamin Capsules , 120 CountGarden of Life Primal Defense Ultra Ultimate Probiotics Formula , 90 VCaps
 I began using this because a family member with multiple sclerosis was using it as a way to supplement her health regimen . Her husband was also using it and both claimed they both were feeling great . Also , because they felt their health was improving , they were eating more whole foods and lost weight in the process . Just healthier all around!This formula DOES N'T have near the `` earthy '' taste -LRB- powdered wheatgrass - gag ! -RRB- that most green drinks have . I put one scoop of Perfect Food with one scoop of Designer Whey double chocolate protein mix , add 8 oz . of water and shake . It has that `` protein-healthy-drink '' smell but tastes like the chocolate . I actually look forward to it ! This has been my breakfast and afternoon snack for almost 3 weeks and I can tell there 's a difference . The first thing I noticed was a much healthier digestive system -LRB- no problems with gas or bloating -RRB- and then added energy besides . I usually eat fairly healthy , but because this formula has so many green veggies and probiotics , it has helped me to really improve my nutrition . It 's my understanding that the longer you use this product , the better you feel so I am sure I will re-order .
 I am a breast cancer survivor and have to be so very careful as to what I put in my body . Perfect Food gives me so much energy and my nails and hair grow SO fast ! I 'm so blesssed that I found this product through a precious friend !
 Really good stuff . Has all you need and more . keeps you from feeling hungry if you use it in a shake or instead of a meal and does n't have sugars or other bad stuff in it . The friendly microbes make you tummy happy too . Is a great price and ships to you right away
 I bought this product because I wanted to change the PH of my body from very acid to alkaline . I was already drinking protein shakes of my own recipe with fruit added . I can not taste this product mixed into my shake . My PH has already moved toward alkaline after two days .
 I do n't want to blither on about that which has already been stated eloquently and not-so-eloquently by a hundred other reviewers . It is the best product of its kind on the market - do your own homework -LRB- as I did -RRB- and you will likely come to the same conclusion . What I did want to embellish on is the taste . Yes , this is covered near uniformly by most other reviewers but I believe I have found a great way to ingest Perfect Food . I originally included in my juiced drinks -LRB- i.e. carrots , oranges and apples ... altogether -RRB- . This was the only way I could choke this stuff down . But , in all honesty , it was n't exactly delicious . I have since altered my ingestion path by drinking it plainly with water . Put one scoop into a glass , add exactly 1 cup of very cold water and blend . The two keys in my formula are
 This product is so good . I am a mother of 9 and no need to say I need a lot of energy , This product not only gives me the energy to take care of the kids -LRB- ages 12mo - 16yrs -RRB- I also work in a pediatric 's office with kids.It has also helped me loss weight plus not crave junk food.EVERYONE MOST TRY THIS PRODUCT !!!
 Perfect Food is -LRB- nearly -RRB- perfect . They advertise as `` Great tasting greens '' and they could not be further from the truth BUT it 's a great product for your health . Great energy and I 'm the only one of my family of 6 who has not been sick this winter . Need I say I 'm the only one who takes it ?
 I bought this product mainly because I like to enjoy a healthy , active lifestyle ; however , I do not enjoy eating vegetables and this is the perfect replacement . I work out regularly and mix this in with my chocolate flavored protein shake , along with some chia seeds and which work great for digestion . To be honest the product is great I feel healthier and more rejuvenated in general and get my daily servings of vegetables with ease . As people have mentioned before the taste is really bad and its hard to take down with just water alone . The health benefits easily outweigh the bad taste and as long as you keep this in mind when chugging it down you should n't have any problems , also many juices mask the taste very well . I just put this in my post-work out super shake which tastes terrible , but if your mentally prepared to put in the effort to work out and live healthier drinking this in your post-workout shake should n't be a problem .
 this green drink is awesome ! i love getting all these nutrients in one glass ... i mix it with water and a little white grape peach juice ... this cuts the earthy flavor a bit ... enjoy !
 The new version -LRB- non - `` original '' -RRB- has Stevia in it , I think that improves the taste . I took the original about 4 years ago and I remember I gave up because of the taste . I found an awesome way to drink it that is actually quite soothing and tasty . I also bought the Perfect Meal dietary supplement mix , Organic Chai Tea Concentrate -LRB- By Pacific Foods -RRB- and Rice or Soy Milk . I recommend purchasing a travel mug with a built in shaker/emulsifier . You can likely find one in the protein powder/health food section of a grocery or vitamin store . Anyway ... pour the chai concentrate in the mug with equal parts soy or rice milk . Then add one scoop of the Perfect Meal Powder -LRB- I prefer chocolate , but they have vanilla -RRB- and one scoop Perfect Food . Shake it up ! This actually tastes super good and is very mild with a slight sweetness from the chocolate and stevia . I feel like its something one would drink before bed to relax .
 I 've been comparing supplements quite a bit recently , but I 'm glad to say that this one is still on my daily consumption list . If you compare the ingredients , you 'll notice that there are more than 40 different components . Granted , the amounts and proportions of the non-filler ingredients is lacking , but variety is also very important in a supplement . If you take a look at the Amazing Grass superfood supplement , you 'll notice a much higher proportion of non-filler ingredients , but it lacks in diversity . I feel like if you combine those two and perhaps switch off , then you can have the best of both worlds . I 've written a nice little supplement article below in my signature if anyone cares to take a look . -------------------------------------------------- -LSB- ... -RSB- `` Here , have some awesome . ''
 I 'm new to taking Perfect Food and it gets a little getting used to , however , that said , the stuff does n't taste bad really , different , yes , but bad , no . I 've discovered that when I take it mixed with lime or lemon juice it helps with the ease of drinking it . It is full of wonderful stuff that I would n't be getting any other way . I recommend this to anyone trying to get more greens in their diet .
 Not sure why taste is a factor ... I think it tastes healthy . I mix one scoop of Perfect Food with one scoop of vanilla flavored protein mix and eight ounces of water . You 're drinking a full days supply of vegetables in one shot . Not much to ask for increased health and assistance in staving off disease ! I 've used all sorts of `` health foods '' over the years and I can honestly say that this is the first time I feel real , positive effects .
 I tried this after using Trader Joe 's version a few times and there is definitely something more powerful about this one . Just opening the jar , you sense the potency and nutritional value by the smell and texture . I have it with kefir or with coconut milk and a scoop of GOL Perfect Meal of something like that . Yum . I feel so good on this .
 I 've been taking Perfect food every morning for about 3 weeks every morning and my hair feels thicker and skin looks good.I have n't experienced the energy boost that people mention but I do feel good.If you mix it with a glass of juice , the taste is no problem at all .
 I was a little worried to try but the supreme health benefits outweighed my taste buds . I mixed in water with a squirt of lemon juice and it tastes fine ; like liquid spinach . No problem .
 I hope the health benefits are substantial because the taste is almost prohibitive . I have found with some reluctance that apple juice is the trick . I was mixing it with water and cranberry mixed juices and it was not too bad but I finally tried apple juice / water and found that it is tolerable and even almost tasty . In general I feel good but I consume several supplement products . I would recommend this product if you feel you are not getting enough veggies and would rather slam them down in a few gulps .
 I was sooo fearful about drinking this as I read in the reviews that it tasted so bad people vomited ! But when a coworker swore by the effectiveness of this I decided to purchase it.I went to my local Health store and bought a bottle that was smaller then what is sold here . Which did n't beat the deal here but I rather try things out before committing to such a large quantity . While buying it I decided to by a juice to put it into because I was afraid of taking the taste . I opted on a Odwalla -LRB- Flavor
 I mix it with about half a glass of orange juice and it tastes pretty good to me . The first time I used it , I did n't read the directions and did the whole scoops . I had gas pains in my stomach that night , but since then , I 've been feeling great and doing 1/2 to 3/4 of a scoop .
 Not sure which product I read where folks said this does n't have a pleasant taste , but its okay by me . The challenge is mixing it thoroughly . This will be a something I can do every day . . have veggies as part of my food plan . : - -RRB-
 I feel so good from drinking this . It has reduced my appetite , helped digestion and I feel energized . Now for the taste . I do like the taste of wheat grass juice and this is just what it tastes like . I mix it in the blender with 3 cups of water . It comes out very pleasant that way . Then I drink 2 tall glass of it . !
 As an endurance athlete -LRB- triathlons and marathons -RRB- , I find it very difficult to digest the recommended 5 cups of veggies a day . With this powder , I 've found the solution . I have energy galore and have frankly become habituated to it . Every morning I mix a scoop of Perfect Food Super Greens with a scoop of whey protein and 2 teaspoons of flaxseed oil . And I 'm ready for my morning .
 I 've been taking this product for the past two months now . It is a great product and swear by it . At first , I was a little skeptical when the guy at Whole Foods sold me the product . I 'm still using the product two months later ! Many of the reviews state it tastes bad ... here 's my what I do and it does n't taste bad at all ! Mix 8 oz of skim milk or soy milk with a scoop of perfect food and a scoop of whey protein powder . I add a banana or a mix of blueberries and raspberries with it . It tastes great plus you get the antioxidants from the berries . Enjoy and feel great !!
 Garden of Life Perfect Food Super Green Formula , 600 - Grams -LRB- 60-Servings -RRB- : This review is my own personal experience with this vendor & product : I had a Rue-N-Y Gastric Bypass approx . 10 Years ago , so I have a absorption problem to say the least . I have found that this product has helped me as I went from a 390 lb . -LRB- approx . -RRB- man to a 155-165 lb . man . I now suffer from chronic pain due to the three blown disc 's in my lower back . I am now doing what I learned before and I have lost 100 lbs . since last year & working on the extra 50 Lbs . now.If I left it up to work comp . in Ca . which is one of the biggest scams the Government , Ins . Comp . 's , Dr. 's , lawyers , Judges & employers , have ever perpetrated against it 's citizens . -LRB- really , really , sick to say the very least -RRB- . I have been left to find my way with the help of my family & friends , so this product & this vendor in my humble experience is helping me . This price is a excellent purchase for this product . This product is exactly what I ordered , in the condition I ordered it and the delivery was here before I expected it.So now draw your own conclusions.Thank you , Jeff .
 This is the best thing I have ever tried . I noticed changes immediately within a couple of hours of taking this stuff . Yes , the taste is horrible . But I have a trick that was n't mentioned in the other reviews . I mix mine with a tall glass of orange juice -LRB- get the kind that is not made from concentrate -RRB- and then I stir it up really well , plug my nose , and chug it . Easiest way to get it down and I can barely taste it . Does wonders for skin and hair and I think it is also helping me with weight loss . You should try this product . Do n't be scared away by the taste . Just get creative and find the way that works for you . You wo n't be sorry .
 Love this stuff ! Gives me great pumps before hitting the gym . I usually open capsules and pour contents in with my pre workout powder for absorption .
 I 'm following the Vaso Guard therapy from `` What your doctor wo n't tell you About Hypertension '' . The author has a list of vitamins , etc to take and lists specific forms of the vitamins.Surprised me that this is needed for hypertension , but the heart is a muscle so it does make sense .
 This seems to be a good product , but I 'm still on the first bottle . Although it has n't made me sick yet , so that 's a plus !
 I like garden of life products a lot , but I will not re order because it is on the expensive side for such a small size
 This product is what they say it is , and I like it.But I understand that it will be no longer sold and anotherGarden of life product will take it 's place . But in the meantime I think Amazom.com still has this product in stock .
 At the time I ordered my first set of these , I 'd been suffering from painful plantar fasciitis symptoms for some time and had already tried a variety of solutions to no avail . I had read that that shoe inserts like this might not help the problem , so they were n't my first option . But finally , I went with my intuition and decided to give them a try despite the conflicting information I 'd been seeing online.My feet started feeling better within a month or two . And here I am , three years later , ordering another pair . Just to be clear , that first set lasted me three years .
 Not sure about the reviews where it sounds like they got defective pairs , but I 've had these for 3 years and they are still in great shape . I have flat feet and these help tremendously with my shin splints .
 I love this product and take it every day . I feel a sustained energy as though I had eaten a lot of fresh fruit .
 My husband wears white pinpoint oxford shirts and spills something on his shirt at lunch almost every day . With the instant stain remover he does n't have to change shirts for the afternoon ! I carry one in my purseand he carries one in his suit jacket !
 The first time I bought one of these was at an airport after I had spilled coffee on my shorts . It was a lifesaver then and continues to be so ! I 've used it on coffee stains , maple syrup , jam , and wine and it has been awesome at getting them all out of my clothes . Keep one handy and stop worrying about spills !
 I have received this item as a stocking stuffer and have purchased several myself - they are very useful in helping to avoid staining but you have to apply the product right away . Also , you have to try and blot the clothing so that you do n't end up with a ring around where the stain was . I find it very helpful in cleaning stains -LRB- I stain a lot of clothing -RRB- and the tube is small and portable . Just make sure your expectations for its use are reasonable .
 `` Mostly '' means they do n't give it enough credit . The directions clearly state it is not to be used for blood . I recently got blood on my shirt because I did n't notice my forearm was bleeding due to overzealous loving from a pet . I first wet the spots with Shout -LRB- I get no payment for this plug -RRB- and dabbed them alternately with a wet , then dry , wash rag . The the faded telltale stains remained . I applied the Tide toGo and the remaining stains disappeared instantly . I 've used the stick many times at work to successfully remove mustard stains - yeah , I 'm a sloppy corn dog fan .
 I was so happy to find that I could buy these Tide To Go sticksTide to Go Instant Stain Remover , .338 - Ounce Sticks -LRB- Pack of 6 -RRB- in bulk ! Although I use these sticks occasionally for stains on clothing -LRB- I always keep one in my purse -RRB- and they work very well , the biggest use I have found for these is to clean the white grout between the tile on my kitchen countertop . This grout looks stained and awful very quickly . I have tried everything -LRB- including bleach sticks -RRB- , but this stain stick is the only thing that really works well . The harder tip of this stick is perfect for this purpose . All my house guests always comment on how new and clean my countertop looks .
 These pens are amazing ! I am constantly dropping food on expensive work shirts and ties . A co-worker always had a Tide pen that worked miracles . I finally bought some for myself off of amazon . The only downside is that the liquid in the pen stinks to high heaven ... But , it gets out the stains ! So I ca n't complain . Good price on Amazon too !
 I am a klutz who does not like stains , so Tide to Go saves the day if used immediately after the `` accident '' . The way I use it is -LRB- 1 -RRB- blot the stain with a paper napkin -LRB- 2 -RRB- put a paper napkin under the stain -LRB- 3 -RRB- take of the cap , and rub the stain from the top -LRB- 4 -RRB- blot the stain with a paper napkinRepeat one more time if necessary.I have tried this with beef gravy , wine , soda , tea , ketchup , lipstick . Lipstick was not removed , but it works fairly well on the other stains . It worked equally well on cotton , nylon , and polyester.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates . There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon , this tool is called `` Online Price Alert '' . This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify . If you search on `` online price alert '' in Google it will be come up at the top . I find this tool to be very helpful .
 Many of us know how tough red wine is to get out . When I spilled a few drops on my light colored shirt and pants a few weeks ago at an office reception I was pretty worried.A coworker loaned me a Tide to Go however , and after about 3 applications , most of the wine was gone . What tiny bit remained visible came out in the wash . That made me a believer and I have bought several for the office , home and on the go .
 This wonderful , wonderful product has saved my bum COUNTLESS times and I am so THANKFUL for this product that I will ALWAYS have one with me . It keeps colors safe and blacks black and my whites are perfect . Whether its a splatter of coffee on my collar or an emergency before a presentation , I WILL NOT GO WITHOUT THIS PEN !!! THANK YOU TIDE ! This product has saved me from embarrassment MANY TIMES.I highly highly suggest this to any working professional .
 I really , really wanted this to work great , since I am both a klutz who spills stuff on herself and a mom . So far I 've used it on :1 . Tomato sauce - works perfectly if you catch it right away , so-so after the stain has started to set -LRB- 5-10 minutes -RRB- 2 . Chocolate icing - lightened the stain , but was still clearly there .3 . Baby spit-up - totally gone , but that 's an easy one .4 . Soda - worked perfectly5 . Red food coloring - smaller dots totally gone , larger dot got smeared and became a nice big light pink spot , instead of a dark red medium spot :-RRB- but food coloring 's always badI 'm pretty happy with this , it works very well as long as you get to the stain immediately -LRB- meaning you notice it when you spill it ! -RRB- and I will keep one in my purse and one in the diaper bag .
 I am a skeptic by nature . As someone with a degree in business I expect marketers to stretch the truth , at a minimum . I purchased this product thinking if it did n't work it was only few dollars . The guys at work were as skeptical as I was until the first coffee spill . This little pen even removed a coffee stain that was 4 hours old . We were all absolutely amazed!I have used this product on the following stains and it removed them completely :1 . fresh coffee stain2 . 4 hour old coffee stain3 . balsamic vinegar4 . make up -LRB- foundation -RRB- 5 . marinara sauce6 . olive oil7 . soy sauceIf you or your significant other are spill prone , pick one of these up right away . I have one in desk and another one in my purse . I knew Tide had a winner when the guys at work began purchasing their own Tide to go pens after using mine.I can not recommend this product highly enough . It is actually one of those products that does everything that it claims .
 My scenario
 This product saved me from having to leave work with an embarassing excuse . During some specific times of the month , certain unexpected things can happen if you know what I mean . ANYWAY - although the manufacturer claims it does n't remove those kinds of stains that well ; it worked VERY well . Keep one in your desks ladies ... it really works.Oh - and I 've used it on coffee stains , spaghetti sauce , soda ... the usual `` oops '' kind of stuff . Works great !
 I love this product . I find it takes out almost any fresh food stain . It 's already saved several favorite items of clothing from the trash bin . It does take a bit of rubbing with the absorbent tip to remove tomato based stains , but remove them it does . I think those folks who have been disatisfied do n't get that the tip is the key .
 that 's the rule of thumb ! As they advertise , if you apply this on fresh stains , it removes most of them . I love whites , especially in summer , but have been scared of wearing them since I 'm a bit on the clumsy side . But with Tide to Go , I risk wearing whites , and guess what , I do n't regret it . The types of stains -LRB- read fresh stains -RRB- it has helped me with so far include : coffee stains -LRB- have to use it a bit more so that it does n't spread -RRB- pizza sauce stains -LRB- do n't ask me how -RRB- soda stains -LRB- specifically cola -RRB- oily food stainsThe reason why I 've given it 4 stars is because sometimes , especially if it 's an oily food stain , rubbing over and over does n't necessarily remove it , only makes it lighter . Thus , not 100 % on those kinds of stains . But overall , it 's the best one available in the market so far .
 This easy-to-use stick has become my security blanket at work . I am an admitted klutz when it comes to eating anything with high splatter potential , and with unfortunate irony , I add insult to injury by ordering high-risk dishes just before presenting at some meeting in front of senior management . That 's why I have one at my desk at work to address the out-of-nowhere splatter from a spoonful of tomato soup , the inadvertent coffee drip from the not-tight-enough plastic lid , and the telltale grease spot from an aggressive mouthful of the pad thai noodles . It 's not completely foolproof , but it does an effective job in removing most of the residue from non-white shirts.I often think the stronger benefit of this product is psychological , the mere fact that you are doing something proactive to eradicate your sins . However , I would n't bother applying it if the stain has been on your clothing for more than an hour . It is likely a foregone conclusion at that point . With the feel of a magic marker , it offers the additional virtue of convenience , especially since you need not run to the restroom to moisten a paper towel anymore . Just like a pilfered pen from the office , a Tide-to-Go stick can be found in my jacket pocket , in my dresser at home and even in the glove compartment in the car . I am honest enough with myself to know I need 24/7 protection from myself . The Tide to Go is definitely worth purchasing in multi-packs .
 I was 5 minutes early getting out of the house to go to work one morning so I decided I could stop by a coffee shop and get a mocha . On my way back to my car the mocha `` splooshed '' out of the sipping hole in the to-go lid and got all over my sweater ... naturally , that day it was a white silk knit sweater . So I had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains , and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely late to work by going home to change.The cafe was next to a supermarket so I decided to go buy a Tide to Go pen and give it a try . I applied it as directed to the stain and immediately the stain lightened noticeably . I was a bit worried because after treatment there were still light tan stains visible , but after blotting the excess liquid and letting the sweater dry while wearing for about half an hour , there was no hint that any mocha had ever touched my sweater.The cleansing agent also gets points for not damaging my silk sweater , despite the fact I was rubbing the product in fairly vigorously -LRB- out of desperation ... I was going to be late for work ! -RRB- I 'm not sure how it would work on other stains but I will keep one in my purse from now on . On the packaging it does identify which sorts of stains it works best on , and which it will be less effective on . From other reviews this will not work so well on some common food stains , so that 's why I 'm giving 4 stars and not 5 . Another minor concern is the warning about blotting the fluid if fabric will come into contact with direct sunlight . It does n't say what will happen if you allow saturated fabric to see sunlight . Perhaps there is the potential for color/fabric damage ?
 It gets rid of most stains!Ketchup , soup , blood , cake , etc.It fits GREAT in your purse .
 I ca n't tell you how many times I have been visited at my desk by coworkers asking if I had a Tide pen they could use . I decided to give them their own Tide pens for Christmas . All recipients were delighted .
 I 've heard numerous things about this product , but I had never used it until today . During work , I spilled a significant amount of coffee on my white khakis . Since this happened in the morning -- and I did n't want to walk around with glaring stains all over my pants -- I rushed over to a near by Target to pick this product up . To my amazement , this product removed 95 % of the stains on my pants . I 'm now a believer and will be ordering the six pack from Amazon .
 Had an interview in an hour and got a pizza stain , panicked , went to 3 different dry cleaners in the city , and none would do an emergency cleaning . Went to the pharmacy and bought the Tide to go . Totally saved my Butt . Everyone should carry one of these in their briefcase/car/whatever . It removed a red marinara like stain from the pizza , I applied it about 30 minutes after the stain , and it worked . Even though it did n't remove it 100 % , it got most of it and faded the stain to the poitn where it was difficult to see , which is what counted at that time . Just make sure you use it right -LRB- push-blot , then rub/mark out -RRB-
 I always have a Tide to Go in my purse and in my home . It has some trouble with grease stains , but I 've gotten red wine out of a white shirt at a work function and no one even noticed I 'd spilled . Pretty amazing !
 I work at a restaurant and this is a must have item ! There are certain food stains this product can not erase -LRB- such as grease or chili oils -RRB- but other than that I have had so many little spots cleaned out through Tide to go ! One will last at least a month or two !
 Tide ToGo pens are the best!I bought a six-pack to give away at work -LRB- who does n't get a coffee or pasta stain on their clothing -RRB- , and to for vacation trips . These are indispensable when out of the house
 I spilled soy sauce on my shirt while eating lunch right before taking my dog for a walk , so I used the Tide stick and it removed the stain . The whole time I was on the walk , I thought I had stepped in something . I checked the bottom of my shoes , as well as the dog 's paws , but found nothing . When I went inside and the smell did not go away , it finally occurred to me that it was from the Tide stick.On the other hand , it works great . You 've got to choose between having a stain and smelling bad , I guess .
 This is a great product to keep at your desk in the office or in a briefcase or laptop bag . It is very handy and works well in getting stains out immediately after spills . I have used this on several shirts and pants and it has always got the entire stain out.It works by pressing the tip down into the clothes , which releases some of the liquid stain remover . Then , you use the tip of the pen to rub the liquid in and remove the stain . You are able to control how much liquid stain remover you use by how long you press on the tip . Very Useful!I used to keep one in my car also , but I think the heat caused it to dry up quicker . So now I keep it at my desk or in my laptop bag.I have n't used this on any `` Dry-Clean Only '' items , but I do n't think it is meant to be used on those types of fabrics .
 I do n't know what these nay-sayers are talking about , but the tide to go pen has saved my life on numerous occasions . I LOVE this product . I do n't think I 've ever felt the need to write a review on anything , but this ? OBSESSED . I 've always been a fan of Tide and they have n't let me down with this little pen of magic . I 've gotten out 4 day old coffee stains , pizza sauce stains , and many more . I have no idea what 's in this cute little easy to use pen , but I hope they never stop making it !
 I carry one of the Tide pens in my purse all the time . When one of my kids drops something on their clothes it takes me about 10 seconds to get it out . It does n't work as well on really greasy stains , but pretty much everything else comes out without issue . In the past if I was in a public place and one of my kids dropped something on their clothes I had to go to a public bathroom and get my kid all wet . Half the time the stain did not come out . With the Tide pen I just pull it out of my purse and any smallish stain can be taken care of in only a few seconds . No mess at all -- makes going places with kids lots easier !
 Tide to go is a great product . We buy six at a time and my wife keeps one in her purse , I have one in my desk and keep one in the car . Of course we keep one or two around the house . We use if a lot on our grandson.Very good product .
 If you apply it to fresh stain it does a very good job : -RRB- I tried it twice , -LRB- once on a red berry stain -RRB- and it removed the stain completely both times
 I keep a Tide to Go stick at home and at my office . It works amazingly well . I have used it on everything from dress slacks to silk ties to all kinds of shirts . I highly recommend it .
 Really ! Almost everything ! I say almost because I 'm sure there are stains it wont lift that I have n't encountered yet . So far its worked on rust , blood , catchup and a moderately new -LRB- a half hour or so -RRB- wine stain.The only problem is they run out fast , so get a pack of more than one . I like to carry it in my purse . Its a lifesaver !
 Someone at work told me about the Tide Pen . I was skeptical but I bought one anyway . Now I always carry one in my purse . I 've given them to family members as stocking stuffers at Christmas and they think they 're great too . I read a bad report about them in a popular `` Consumer '' testing magazine . I do n't know what kind of stains they tested them on but their tester did n't know what they were talking about ! I 've used mine on blood , coffee , mustard and a myriad of other spills and it has n't failed me yet .
 I was so pleased I could order this product in bulk , because I like to keep one everywhere . I love this product and could n't imagine not having one in my possession at all times !!!
 I love this product ! I 'm clumsy , so I 'm always spilling things on myself . Tide-to-Go keeps me from looking like a slob . :--RRB- It gets out most stains , and the stains that it ca n't get out -LRB- mostly stains that have already set or grease spots -RRB- , it will lighten so they 're not as noticeable . I keep a Tide-to-Go in my purse so I have it at all times .
 Very Convenient , works on common spills . Like the 6pack , one for every vehicle and briefcase for those accidental spills on the job .
 The Tide to Go Instant Stain Remover is pretty handy when you have an emergency situation on your clothing . It works great on Pen stains , not so much on the greasy , food oil type stains . Best is to use the laundry detergent right away , but in tight situations an Instant Stain Remover sometimes keeps the stain from sticking or clinging to your clothing.Removes
 I can say before I started to use this product I was always afraid of wearing white clothings but Tide to Go has totally changed everything . Initially I thought this was just a gimmick but I thought it was worth a try , ... soo ... I bought it with me during our two-week trip with my parents in August . . and it came handy ... My dad bought a brand new white jacket and had it put on immediately and then decided to drink a cup of coffee . . unfortunately , he spilled the coffee on the white jacket when he tried to open the lid to put sugar in it ... my mother immediately wiped the coffee off with napkins . . the coffee stain , however , was still there ... Then . . I remember I had put a Tide-to-Go in my purse ... I immediately used it on all coffee stains on the white jacket ... and to my surpise , all the brown spots resulted from the coffee spill were GONE ... amazing . . I have used this on different kind of food stains . I 've used it on Coffee stain , spaghetti sauce stain , juice stain and they all worked . My mother , my mother-in-law , and my sister-in law they were all so amazed at the result that they all asked me for one to carry with them . Nowadays I do n't leave home without one in my purse . . I used to be afraid of wearing white clothings , I am no longer afraid of wearing whites because of Tide-to-Go . . this is definitely a useful product to carry with you everywhere you go . . oh . . as far as the smell goes . . The smell is bearable to me ... and in order to use it you have to push it down to get the actual fluid to flow out through the tip of the Tide-to-Go marker .
 My friend and I were picking blackberries . I did n't notice the thorns had punctured a hole in my bag . Dark red juice stained my pants ... it looked like I had been shot in the leg . About 3 hours later I used the tide pen with doubt that it would work . It took me about 2 minutes of `` writing '' with the stain pen but it worked beautifully . There was no trace of the stain and my friend was amazed when I wore the pants the following week .
 This product is awesome . It really does remove most food and drink stains ! I just used it on my $ 50 abercrombie shorts ... the stain is totally gone.This thing works by dispensing detergent out the tip of the pen , which loosens the stain . The stain gets absorbed by the tip of the pen.A word of caution though -- do n't try it on grease . It 'll spread the grease because grease is n't water soluble .
 I first used a Tide pen -LRB- aka Tide to Go -RRB- when I spilt soda pop on my white -LRB- of course ! -RRB- shirt . My best friend gave me her pen to use , several hours later , and the stains disappeared.I just used it on bbq sauce on my shirt , no sauce left!BEST YET
 Everyone elses ' rave reviews on this product were quite impressive , so I decided to give it a try . I would not have believed it unless I tried , and IT WORKED ! But do n't take my word for it - try it and SEE for yourself ! Remember , works wonders on `` FRESH '' stains . Do n't let the stain sit on clothes too long .
 we used the product for the first time at dinner - spilled some food on myself , and since I carry the product in my handbag , I used it and it worked immediately . So far my experience with Tide to Go has been very positive .
 Ca n't believe this really works but it does . I have used it on new spills as well as old and like magic they were gone . I sent some to my 87 year old Mother . Good to carry one in your purse or pocket for accidents .
 Well it was our wedding day and my wife looked amazing . The only problem is that her red rose bouquet bled into her wedding dress . Could you imagine the horror ???? All I can say is thank the good lord for Tide To Go as it saved the day and our wedding ... Best product I have ever used . Once again Tide does it again with a remarkable product
 I often am a messy eater , who enjoys anything from Tacos from Taco Bell , to Meatball subs from Subway sandwich shops . But , when I have a bad stain on my shirts , I just use my Tide To Go stain remover . I like this a whole lot because this is a very convient and easy way to reduce and possible eliminate the stains you get on your clothing wherever you are . It is easy to use , and it is very affordable . Although there have n't been many convient ways to eliminate stains on the go , as there is with hand sanitizers , I definitely recommend this easy way to clean your image a whole lot.Price
 It is not one of the stain removers , which instantly gets rid of the stain.So when you spill over something over your t-shirt , you got to spill this TIDE STAIN REMOVER on it as well so it does make sure that your cloth wouldnt be clogged with STAIN but its not an immedieate relief solution .
 IN A NUTSHELL
 These work well -LRB- they 're not miraculous -RRB- , but I 'll definitely continue to buy . My only complaint is that that cap comes off in my purse sometimes . I could probably use a ziplog bag or tape to keep it closed , but it has n't created a mess yet , so I do n't .
 I love this pen , it works soo well ! I admit I was skeptical at first , but now I see how great it is . It removes anything , from chocolate to ballpoint ink . I now carry it with me everywhere I go , as should everyone !
 These things are great ! I carry one all the time and my friends often count on it !
 Got blood on my nice super-white shirt collar . Hey , it happens when you 're a professional hitman ! Kidding ! I cut myself shaving . Anyhow hours later I notice I got a blood stain on my collar ! I was livid . I like this shirt ! It fits me well ! It 's not one of those shirts made for fatties that have all this extra material everywhere . This one fits me like it was made for me . Which is why I was so mad I got blood on it ! There 's a CVS nearby , and I got one of these things not expecting much . It works . That 's all you need to say . Open it up , rub a bunch of the liquid on with that felt-marker-like tip and it literally disappeared within 2 minutes . Love this product . You should too !!!
 Tide To Go has saved me on more than one occasion when I was eating somewhat carelessly before a job interview or an important social gathering . Tide To Go correctly advertises itself as `` an on-the-go stain remover , '' not a pretreater . Once it saves you from an embarrassing or ugly stain on your garments you 'll never travel far without one of these again!Tide To Go works best on common stains like coffee , tea , wine and juice -- ketchup , too.Moreover , it 's easy to use
 I bought the 6-pack to have one in each car , at the office and a few spares . Would n't leave home without one in my shaving kit . This is an amazing product that works on numerous spills and dries within a minute or two without showing the stain . I do recommend it .
 6 Tide to go pens ? One in the office , one in the briefcase , one in the wifes purse ... they come everywhere with us now ! These things get rid of stains so quickly and painlessly , they are my favourite !
 These do a great job removing stains when they happen . What I like are that they are compact so I keep one in my car and carry one while traveling and remove stains almost immediately . What little stain may show through usually comes out in the wash later .
 Very comfortable insole . Fits a little funny in my shoe , but maybe that 's just me .
 I 'm -LRB- whoooo ! -RRB- using the HydraClens Sitz Bath right now -- as I type this -LRB- yeeee ! -RRB- , in fact.It takes some -LRB- gerk ! -RRB- getting used to , but ... Hold on a minute ... there . As I was saying , it takes some getting used to -- particularly gauging the proper water pressure -LRB- heeoooowww ! -RRB- , but it 's been a Godsend after , um , taking care of business -LRB- interpret that as you will -RRB- . The 9.5 ' hose means I can even bring it to work with me ! I get some odd looks , but I 'm more concerned with comfort and cleanliness than appearance , thank you very much.Man , this is great.Anyway , it 's proven to be a durable , reliable item . I 'd recommend it for -LRB- phooooooo ! -RRB- anyone .
 I searched for this particular deo for almost 9 months before chancing upon it on Amazon !! It is exactly as what I remembered and the smell is fresh and uplifting ! I love it ... Great buy . .
 They say that anti-perspirents are n't good for you . And this is not an anti-perpirent . It 's just a good , old fashioned deodorant that works like a charm , and has my husband loving the scent , too . It 's the only one of used for the last 5 years , and has never failed me .
 This is such a great deodorant spray , it really does smell fresh all day . Fa does not lie when they say 24 hour protection .
 I had read that real ice was more effective than a gel pack for icing injuries and this ice pack is very easy to use and very effective on my injured knee . It straps on with velcro and I like that if I need to pop up to get something it easily goes with me . Wide mouth makes it easy to fill with ice and it does not leak . Sometimes simple is best .
 I bought a Sante Fe bowl 6 or 8 months ago . It 's a nice hand-made bowl . My wife has a variety of `` art '' vases in our bathroom , and I have no qualms having this bowl out on the counter the mix -- albeit with my razor and badger brush on a drip stand in the bowl. : DThe Sante Fe is right at home.As to function
 This shave bowl is very sturdy , attractive and is just the right size . I wholeheartedly endorse this product for the new soap shaver . This will fit in your new routine as well as in your budget . Plus you get a big size soap instead of buying the smaller ones somewhere else.So I read reviews about soap not fitting in this bowl and ask `` Why does it go in the bowl ? '' My opinion is that it does n't . When you leave the soap in the same bowl that you lather in , your soap gets used up WAY too quickly and your suds are not as good of quality -LRB- IMHO -RRB- . This is how I build my lather : I run hot water in the tap and fill this very attractive bowl , letting is sit on the counter for a few minutes . I then take a little bit of the same hot tap water , just enough to cover the surface of the soap ; yes still in the plastic container.Rinse the brush in hot water and check for debris in sink , then let it sit in the bowl of water while I warm a hot towel to soften my beard.After about 3 minutes , I empty the bowl and then tip the water out of the soap too . Shake out the brush a couple times and grab some soap in the tip . This takes about 5-15 seconds of stirring . Move the brush to the bowl and start to whip , and the foam starts to explode ! If you need more foam while stirring , add about a teaspoon of water and keep going.This process gets me enough lather to manage the 3 pass technique with my razor and still have about a hand full of suds when done.I used to HATE shaving ...
 When I first started using a safety razor , I jumped in full force and got this shave cup and soap , plus a badger brush . Wanted to do the whole experience . It was fun for a while , but after going through two shave soap bars , the novelty has worn off and I just use regular , decent quality shave cream.The included shave soap smells good and lathers well . No complaints there . Very much enjoyed it . The bowl looks good enough to leave on the bathroom sink if desired.My only complaint is that the Colonel Conk Shave Soap bars are so small in the cup . The picture looks like it 's a nice fit , but when removed from the packaging and placed in the bowl , it 's dwarfed by the size of the bowl . `` So what ? '' you may ask . Well , when using your brush to generate a lather , the soap bar will move all around the bottom of the bowl . You need to have the soap stationary so you can whip that brush on it and generate a lather . However , I found myself simply chasing the thing around the bottom of the bowl like an ice cube in a cup . As it dries between shaves it 'll affix itself to the bottom , but sometimes comes loose and here we go again . The Colonel Conk soap bar is not a good fit for the bowl.Nonetheless , the shave cup itself is nice .
 I bought this for my husband for Christmas . He thoroughly enjoys it and it gives him a closer shave . I think he shaves more now solely because he enjoys lathering : -RRB- Col Conk gives him a closer , softer shave and his skin feels kissably soft after he shaves . I also enjoy the smell of it . It smells nice as well . Now , all he wants to do is shave , shave , shave .
 The ceramic bowl is a unique piece of pottery - I was surprised . Unfortunately , a piece of it chipped in the mail . The sender immediately refunded me and I did n't have to pay charges to send it back.This is the best example I know of professional business that wants my business and offers quality goods .
 Guys , invest in a badger shaving brush and then use this stuff . It smells great and is a much better shave using my mach 3 than any product found in Walgreens . This one comes with a nice pottery bowl which looks better than the traditional mug .
 I took up shaving with a blade again recently , and was looking for something beyond the normal shaving mug . This cup really did it for me , and I was enjoying it very much . I found that if I stuck the little cup with soap in the microwave for about 15 seconds , the soap would melt and re-congeal nicely . The only thing wanting was it did n't have a lid . I thought , ` OK , well I 'll just sculpt one -LRB- I can do that -RRB- . ' So a few weeks of shaving , and I got more soap , and was really enjoying using my new kit , and ... I knocked the shave cup off the counter , and it shattered into a dozen fragments . Sigh ... Dont get me wrong , I loved the cup . Custom made , really beautiful , and worked great.I replaced it with one of those 4 '' porcelain custard cups -LRB- a deep one -RRB- from the cooking store , which cost me about three bucks . It works great too .
 Before I bought this , I was resorting to squirting a little shaving cream out of a tube , and loading the brush on the palm of my hand . I felt like I was wasting a lot of soap this way . Now , I feel like I 'm much more in control of the amount of soap I 'm using . I would have liked to have had a choice of the fragrance , but considering how cheap these bars of soap are , it 's not really a big deal to buy a different one .
 I 've tried a lot of them and this one definitely ranks up there in taste and with 30g of protein per bar , I 'll be on this one for a long time .
 Bought this for my son -LRB- along with their protein powder -RRB- . He loves them ... much more than other protein bars he has tried.He 's working out six days a week , including lifting weights , and is seeing a huge difference in his endurance and strength with the protein added to his diet.Good price on both items ; great , fast shipping by Amazon/vendor .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !

 This product leaves you with a clean , close shave and an amazing smooth skin after .
 LATHER Almond Shave Cr&egrave;me , 4-Ounce JarThis is a great shave cream , as my husband has a sensitive skin and he swears that this is the only shave cream which does n't irritate his skin since it makes the shaving experience so smooth . He loves it !! This is the only shave cream he uses now and has to buy it online now as we moved far from Pasadena store . I think lather products are generally very good as I like their natural formula , therefore the fragrance is very nice and natural , too . But I also think it 's overall overpriced so I do n't buy their products often . However this shave cream is the one of exceptions since it is so good , and so worth it . Anyhow my husband wo n't use anything-else after experiencing using this one anyways.For me , I usually can get away with a bit cheaper product with more foam so I do n't use it regularly , but when I tried it once on my legs , wow . It was so smooth and was a luxurious experience . No foam was not a problem at all . It spreads really well and the blades slide like a dream . We just bought a jar since his last one is run out , but this time I may use it more , or buy one for me.I usually not am into the `` almond '' smell so much but it 's very subtle so it does n't bother me . Which means that this does n't have such a `` girly '' aroma so my husband does n't mind either . I think this makes a really great gift for men and I 'm sure that they will appreciate your good taste in such product ! And yes , like the other customer mentioned , it seem to last long . My husband shaves 3 times a week or so , and seem to last about a year or two -LRB- I do n't even remember the last time we were at the Pasadena store -RRB- . We also bought one pre-shave oil which has such a great citric aroma , which worked really well and made the experience even more luxurious . But again this shave cream does work wonders by itself , and the oil is very expensive so now we just buy the cream . But for some who has extra budget wanting to experience ultimate shaving experience , I would recommend the oil also.Update
 I dig this shave cream , always try to pick some up when I pass thru Atlanta airport -LRB- there is a LATHER store in one of the terminals -RRB- . Ordered this product online , when it arrived the container was cracked but still sealed well . The product was dense , and dried out ... had to mix some water into it to make it useable .
 This shave cream is the BEST !! I first purchased it from the Lather store in Pasadena , CA and I 've never had to try a different brand since then . I 've tried endless numbers of high priced shave creams to try to combat the razor burn and bumps I get from my combination of sensitive skin and hair that grows very tight against my face , but from day one of using this , I was sold . It 's moisturizing without being greasy , it really helps the razor glide across your skin and it has a nice mild scent that is pleasant , but does n't cause you to smell it all day.Here 's the most amazing part , you need to use so little that it will last you forever . I marked the date on the bottom of the bottle and I began using it December 24 , 2010 and it 's now October 7 , 2012 and I still have another few weeks of use left in it . For reference , I shave 2-3 times a week and have a thick beard . I shave with a double edge safety razor and a badger brush , so all I need is a finger tip size dab , work it into a nice lather and I 'm good to go . Like I said before , nearly two years later and I 'm using the same bottle !!! On top of all that , it leaves my skin feeling great and with no more irritation . Buy this ! You 'll love it !
 Amazing product !! You 'll never buy another shaving creme from a local store again . Perfect for all skin types and provides the closest shave . The jar lasts about 3 months making it an even better deal .
 Pros
 A very good low compression leg wrap . The 6 inch is very nice especially for a larger leg.There is velcro on either end ... I would buy again and reommend to friends ...
 I have used this 6 '' elastic wrap with Velcro end closures for years . The elastic seems to degrade at the ends after a couple of weeks of use - I wear them daily for lower leg circulation help - but most of the wrap stays elastic for an extended period of time . The price is great when purchased in the 10 pack - a fine bargain .
 I have been using these for several months now for a wound on my leg . The Velcro ends are very convenient for keeping it in place without the old clips . The quality is good and generally survives multiple washings and reuse . This product has been better than any other product we have tried .
 My sister recommended the Doc Johnson Pocket Rocket and this was the cheapest model of it at the time . I had previously bought a knockoff in a novelty shop and loved it until the motor wore out after a couple uses . Well I 've used this several times and the motor is still going strong , so I guess this is one instance where branding is actually more than just packaging.The vibrations are strong for me -LRB- although I know everyone 's different -RRB- . It 's much stronger than the little bullet I have which only runs on watch batteries , and the AA is much easier to find than a watch battery . Also , the battery seems to last a good long while , even if you leave it in between uses -LRB- which I know I 'm not supposed to . -RRB- I took it in the shower a couple times and the battery did n't get wet , but I expect that the rubber seal will be the first thing to wear down . Be careful when turning it off under running water not to open it ! The on/off takes a light touch.It does n't matter to me , but you may care to know that the item I received was not plain as in the picture , but had the Doc Johnson logo on it on the thicker part of the vibe just above the controls.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an external massager .
 I actually recieved this with an order as a complimentary gift ... and it was my favorite part of the order ... it 's pretty much my shower toy ... and works great , definately gets the job done ... highly recommend it !
 It 's adorable ! Soft and smooth , just as advertised ! The vibrations are strong , though maybe not strong enough for me ... It only takes one AA battery , which is nice , and it seems to last a long time . Have n't owned it for long , but it seems very well made . It feels great , the textured cap is really nice , easy cleaning - overall a great adorable little product ! It could be stronger , but it will probably work well for most people . It 's a lot of fun for not a lot of money ; I highly recommend it !
 This is a very good product and I would recommend it to a friend . It really does what it says !!
 It was well worth the price , yes when your turning it off it may open up , But to me it 's not much of a problem . It 's a little bit noisy but i dont mind . the plastic head did come off , if your picky then it might not be for you . i just wanted something simple and that would give me what i wanted and it does that .
 This is my second Pocket Rocket . They work and are not expensive . I have had issues -LRB- as stated by others -RRB- about turning it on only to have it stop ... but I found that it has a touchy turn dial and you just have to turn it back just a tiny bit to engage it . I also have an electric unit -LRB- a different and MUCH more expensive brand -RRB- that I love , so if you want a marathon affair , choose something that plugs in -LRB- and has a very long cord -RRB- . For a spur of the moment need , this one works great ; which lasts for years , and is cheap .
 I received this as a gift along with a long vibe as part of a gift pack called the White Nights Collection . I love the velvety exterior . I had this and my other &#34; friend &#34; for about 5 years and they are both going on strong!I have had such a positive experience with Doc Johnson products I think it would be the only brand I would purchase from.I have no need to replace at this point , but once I do , I know where I will be looking.Highly recommended to everyone !
 Perfect , exactly what I wanted , worked great . I did a lot of research . Price was the lowest I could find .
 I love this OMG . I had a pink one & it somehow got lost & I replaced it with this . It simply is amazing . It gets the job done & lets me move on with my day within a few minutes . As a really busy working professional I hardly recommend it . ; D
 I have bought pocket rockets for myself and all of my friends . We are all very happy with doc johnsons products . This is a wonderful toy for an awesome price . The one thing I have to mention is it is quite loud but not so loud that it 's a problem . I highly recommend this product .
 I 'm kind of a freak about cleaning . I got this for my work desk so I do n't have to use those Lysol wipes that are so popular in every office . This stuff is great . Cleans my surfaces down and you do n't end up smelling like chemicals after using it . Two thumbs up !
 One of my friends introduced me to this product several years ago and I fell in love . Smells great , works wonderfully . I use it on the desk , the bookcases -LRB- laminate -RRB- and I do n't have to be afraid of the cats walking on it and then cleaning their paws . Even better , the male counterpart , who is very scent sensitive , has no problems with the light citrusy smell .
 I love the fresh citrusy scent of this product and that it 's so natural and safe to use around my kitchen !
 Now that I have this cleaner , it 's true that I clean my counters more often . The scent is pleasing and it cuts grease quite well .
 It seems to clean well . Without the harsh chemical fumes . I am trying to get away from harsh chemicals that are bad for your lungs
 Cleans well , smells great , and is safe for all surfaces . This is the only cleaner my husband has commented on , saying he likes it AND which he often sprays and uses himself happily . Normally , he wrinkles up his nose at chemically things and avoids them like the plague . Not this.Smells clean , not chemical-y , and leaves counters smooth , vs sticky or covered in residue.I use it daily on my granite countertops , on my stainless steel faucet and sink , as well as on my induction glass cooktop and also inside and outside my convection microwave unit . Have n't tried it on my stainless steel fridge or stainless stovefront , as I had been using something else prior and am going to use that up first . I use it on my ceramic bathroom sinks and compositione countertops , too.You can use microfiber cloths , sponges or paper towels with this spray-on cleaner ; all work equally well.Love this stuff .
 No issues with the cleaning ability of this product . I would like to smell more grapefruit scent , though the general fragrance is citrusy and pleasant . I do like that the products are not tested on critters , and are safer than the commercial products .
 This is my go-to all surface cleaner , especially for my kitchen . It does a wonderful job and smells fantastic , leaving a wonderful grapefruit citrus scent . Love this product .
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !

 I bought these ice packs for relief from sore nipples from breast feeding . They are amazing !! I use a pair to heat in the microwave for before feeding to help let down . Then I use a frozen pair after feeding . I would highly recommend ! After feeding is behind us , they 'll be perfect for boo boos and lunch boxes !!
 I am happy with this product and would like to order more , but see that they are not currently available .
 I use these on my eyes . They are better than any of those eye mask products , which never fit properly . Soft and cool . Work great for puffy eyes !
 These ice packs are great for little kids ! Even when frozen they are soft and pliable . If the blue side it too cold you can flip it over and use the cloth covered side for the perfect cold temperature ! This is a must have for all mothers and fathers of preschoolers and beyond !
 Bought these to use on my eyes as they burn and itch . The cool feeling makes my eyes feel great .
 I purchased these to use in a small lunch bag I carry . They are a great size and have come in handy when a grandchild is over & gets a mosquito bite , etc. . They can also be used in the morning for puffy eyes . More uses than you can imagine !
 I have been looking for an ice pack to relax my eyes after long periods of computer use , this one does the job.I also like the padded back so my eyes wo n't freeze.They do n't stay in place very well because there is no strap , and they are not as tight as those eye masks , but that 's to be expected.Overall good quality product .
 These ice packs are perfect for icing my arms after receiving allergy shots . They are the perfect size and the fabric on one side is quite nice for preventing ice burn , a problem I have had in the past . I 'm so glad I found these !
 I bought them for my kids to replace the usual bag of frozen peas that we use . I was hoping that , even frozen , these would be pliable so that you could shape the pack to the `` boo boo '' . When you first take them out of the freezer they are hard as a rock . As they thaw , they soften a little , though and you can form them around the injury . One thing I love is that one side has fabric on it and the other side is plastic . So I do n't have to wrap it in a towel to put it on my son 's skin - we just put the fabric side against his skin and it works great . On the whole , I 'd definitely buy them again .
 I had septoplasty and turbinator reduction , and these ice packs molded around my nose comfortably . I also was able to fold them in half to place one half on one side of my nose and the other half over my cheek/eye area . They also sat comfortably on my forehead between my eyes , and the cloth side was comfortable directly against my skin . They `` chilled '' quickly too , and by having 5 of them , I could rotate through them easily . I HIGHLY recommend them !!! They helped numb the pain and reduce the swelling .
 Came right to my door . Was the correct item . Came very quickly.Worked perfectly with the wrap given to me by my doctor .
 These are inexpensive but they do the trick . Great to use on any part of the body especially on the face and neck . These are the perfect size for kids too ! I would recommend .
 I have dry mouth due to radiation treatment for head and neck cancer . The OralBalance gel helps me to sleep as many as 6 hours straight without waking up due to dry mouth pain . The taste seems neutral to me , but I do n't have much sense of taste at the moment . It is a bit like sticking pnut butter to the roof of your mouth , spreading it out evenly with your tongue , and then leaving it there . The gel breaks down a little at a time and keeps your mouth nice and moist . If you have a dry throat , this can help a little bit , since you get some wetness to swallow every so often . Sometimes I still need a swallow of water to wet down the throat . Overall I am very happy with the product and am grateful for the improvement in my quantity and quality of sleep . My only complaint is I kinda wish it was available in a larger size !
 I was not sure if I could buy this product and get it soon in my country v&iacute;a Amazon . But I have it now and Im very pleasant because it is important to relief people with Jogren Syndrome.Thanks .
 I have been using this product for about 8 years now . It is absolutely a lifesaver for me . Due to radiation treatments for head and neck cancer , my saliva glands do not work . At first I had to drink water constantly and it did n't help at all . I always felt like my throat was going to close up , especially at night . Dry mouth hurts . But since I discovered this Biotene gel , I can talk , eat , sleep at night , and feel relatively normal . A little bit in my mouth lasts a long time . A little bit in the mouth , let it melt and you will feel like you have saliva again . There is hardly any taste to it at all . I carry it with me constantly . I am convinced I could not get by without it . I highly recommend it to anyone with dry mouth for any reason !
 I take medication that dries my mouth , plus I sometimes sleep with my mouth open . Using Biotene gel keeps my mouth from becoming completely dry , which goes a long way toward my better oral health overall .
 Unfortunately I have to deal with an extremely dry mouth during sleep time , apparently caused by many of my medications . Oral Balance does a good job of keeping my mouth moist over a period of several hours .
 I love this product ! I have been using this gel for about a year now , as I have osteonecrosis of my jaw -LRB- ONJ -RRB- , and certain medications that I take for my cancer cause my mouth to be very dry . This product is wonderful , and makes my mouth keep moisturized for the whole night.Biotene Dry Mouth Relief Moisturizing Gel - 1.5 oz
 I 've been using this for a couple of weeks and it 's good forabout 4-6 hours . BUt , it does the job . I ordered from drug store.com , for free shipping if over 6 or 8 . These peoplewant over $ 50 bucks for shipping ! Are they crazy ? It 's a more expensive , but the free shipping makes up for it .
 I hunted every drug store and big box store . The price I got here was 3.00 less . This product is excellent for sleeping and preventing dry mouth . That is a must for some of us on a lot of meds .
 Began using this for dry mouth disease when it came on the market ... I find it does a good job in place of having to use the GUM during the night
 Perfect for anyone who has dry mouth . This product keeps my mouth moist which enables me to sleep . It is expensive but have been unable to find any other product which is as effective .
 Let 's face it , I only ordered this product because my dentist told me to , and I did n't do it because it so much fun to use . That said , ordering was easy . It was much cheaper than buying in any of my local stores . And , the product was delivered promptly . Although I 'd rather not need this product , but I am happy about the whole procedure .
 This stuff is great . I have a very dry mouth and I use it every night when I sleep . It works it helps to keep my mouth moist so I am able to sleep better . I have a hard time finding it in stores so I buy it through Amazon so I save money and time looking for the product .
 I have a problem with dry mouth at night and was getting more cavities as a result . This gel has a pleasant taste and keeps my mouth moist until I rinse it out . Highly recommend this , tastes much better than the spray which is awful .
 My husband had been recommending this product to me forever and I finally started using it ! What a difference in dry mouth . It really works . You need to reuse during the day after eating or drinking to get more long lasting benefits . If you use before bedtime , you do n't wake up with cotton mouth !
 I 'm on my second tube of Biotene OralBlance Gel . I have used it for about 3 weeks . My problem is I have dry mouth , but only at night . For the past couple of years , I 've had bad dental checkups resulting in high dental bills . My dental hygenist finally diagnosed the high cavity rate as likely caused by my nightly dry mouth problem . The Biotene OralBalance Gel works and lasts all night , but needs to be applied fairly heavy to do so . Since it only comes in a 1.5 oz tubes , a tube goes pretty fast , and it 's expensive . I get about 10-12 days out of a tube . A tube costs $ 6 - $ 12 depending upon where you buy it -LRB- including shipping , tax etc. -RRB- . I 've read reviews about other products ONLINE and have ordered another product in an effort to get a cheaper solution to night time dry mouth . OraHealth Xylitol Time Release Dome Mints come in boxes of 60 tablets and get good reviews -LRB- like this product -RRB- ONLINE . Even if two tablets are needed per night , they turn out to be cheaper than the Biotene Oral balance Gel in 1.5 Oz tubes . I 'll update this review when I see how those work.Update -LRB- 08/20/09 -RRB- : I 've now been using OraHealth Xylitol Time Release Dome Mints to control my nighttime dry mouth for about a month . I find them to be as effective as Biotene OraBalance Gel but at a savings of more than half when Biotene OralBalance is only available in 1.5 ounce tubes . This Biotene product needs to be packaged in a more economicle size .
 My dentist recommended I start brushing with Biotene tooth paste and out of curiosity , I decided to investigate some of their other products . Wow ! They really work . My dry mouth problem is much improved . Many thanks to Amazon for connecting me with these great products .
 It protects yours gem and teeth , keeps them moist and from bacterial proliferation , specially helpful during long sleeping hours . If you have allergy and sleep with mouth breathing that dried out the mouth , it works well too . It can works for 8 hours or may be more . Use the new PBF tooth paste and or PBF mouthwash before applying the gel even give you more protection . PBF product line has the plaque-biofilm dissolving formula that can deeply clean the debris in the periodontal pocket .
 This product is great for Sjogren 's sufferers with severe dry mouth . It is not the best tasting but it is better than the competition , and keeps your mouth moist . I will say that it is not very long lasting though , as I tend to swallow most of it within 15-30 minutes .
 My mouth got so dry at night it actually woke me up . My dentist told me it was important to have moisture in my mouth to reduce decay and recommended Biotene toothpaste , but neither that nor the mouthwash helped night dryness caused by the HCTZ I take . While I like several things about the toothpaste and mouthwash , I needed something extra and found this product does the trick . This is a small tube and with the recommended dose would be gone pretty fast making it an expensive solution , but I use only a fraction of what they suggest and find it works just fine . As a result , the tube lasts and I am not bothered at night by a super dry mouth.After brushing before bed , while my mouth is still moist from that , I use less than 1/4 '' of gel and smooth it around with my tongue . It 's great to get that needed relief . I 've also found that brushing my teeth after dinner , thus allowing longer before bedtime for natural saliva recovery , helps with the nighttime dryness -LRB- also keeps me from snacking at night :-RRB- . Then I just use this product before retiring . Highly recommended .
 As a dry mouth sufferer I have found this Biotene Oral Balance Gel to have good results . The product is rather pricey , even in quantity , but is worth the cost for the relief at night it affords .
 I love the Biotene products . The Oralbalance for dry mouth works very well . Due to the medications I must take every day , I have extreme dry mouth . I have not found any product that works as well . I also like Biotene 's Mouthwash and toothpaste . My condition was so severe , the skin came off the bottom of my tongue . My oral surgeon recommended Biotene and I 've been doing much better .
 I take medications that make my mouth dry and this product works like a dream during the day and at night while I 'm asleep -- no more waking up with bad breath ! MUCH better than competing products by orajel . Tastes great too ! Was turned onto it by my dentist .
 This is a thick gel that coats the gum tissue . If you use all of the other products and still have a mouth that feels like sand paper this is the stuff to use . It relieves some of the pain of severe `` dry mouth . ''
 Product is wonderful ; however with the S&H fees for this item purchased here it adds approximately $ 2.00 per tube ordered to the price . Not a shavings from the local drug store !!
 Some people say this tastes gross . No , it tastes like APPLES , people . Anyway , this works really well , it is a gel-that is , gel-like . Just use a little less if you do n't like the texture .
 I was browsing Amazon and found these great air freshners , , , I buy them all the time , , nice fragrance and strong too and last , , , , I got mine from HSN , , , but I will buy from Amazon , , only need the refills
 I have been a longtime customer of ` My Lip Stuff ' and have to rave about all her great lip balms and products . I have over 30 of her lip balms and they all have wonderful texture and my lips have never been healthier or smoother . All the scents are accurate , especially once you put it on , it releases all the nuances of each flavor ... I also have used her linen spray , whipped body lotion and the body butter stick and it 's all wonderful ! Try everything , you will like it for sure !
 I have Lemonade Ice Cream , Gummy Bear , and Banana Cheesecake . My little girl love 's these as much as I do , the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them . To be honest it was like you were eating them . The smell is n't faint at all and the scents are true to their names . Also the other scents were great also . I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot . It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products . I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too . These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself . You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips .
 First I would like to say I am a Carmex person and rarely use anything else . But I would definitely recommend My Lip Stuff to others!I saw how many flavors it came in and instantly wanted to try some to see if it lived up to their flavor-claims . I ordered Pumpkin Pie , and I was instantly impressed . Some flavored lip balms do n't taste exactly like their flavor , or taste &#34; processed &#34; or &#34; fake . &#34; My Lip Stuff taste EXACTLY like it 's flavor . I 'm very impressed.My shipment came on time . The receipt had a little &#34; thank you &#34; and smiley face on it -LRB- which was very cute -RRB- . The balm was wrapped up in a little cellophane baggie with a ribbon on it -LRB- great presentation -RRB- . The balm goes on super smoothly and does n't leave a whitish residue like some others do.I will still use my Carmex , but I 'm beginning to love My Lip Stuff too ! I will be ordering another one when this runs out .
 I purchased three of the chapsticks -- one for myself and the other two as a gift . I immediately opened mine once I got it in the mail and the reviews I read before were right
 So far I have about 30 of her balms , and 1 Body Butter Stick . They are all fabulous ! The balms are smooth and leave a subtle shine on your lips . The scents are very true to their names . My favorites are probably Margarita , Coconut Lemongrass , and Brown Sugar and Cinnamon . I 've reccommended My Lip Stuff to all my friends , and I highly reccommend it to you !
 I love all the flavored I purchased and was thrilled that it did n't feel dry on my already dry lips !
 The balm melts a bit when applied , coats without too much effort and leaves a shine but is n't too heavy but you can feel it there and the scent lingers for just a few minutes too.Some of the scents are n't as strong as others but they 're pretty true to their name :-RRB- Dessert/creamy ones tend to be `` weaker '' and citrus/tangy ones are stronger . My favorites -LRB- I 'm a fruity/tangy lover -RRB- are midori and gummy bear .
 Very good product ! This smells good and feels very soft on your lips . I would buy one in every flavor !
 Now , I love coffee , coffee flavored things and coffee scented things . This is none of the above . The reason I 'm not sending it back is because it is an awesome lip balm in general.update
 I read the reviews for this while I was looking for a specific flavor -LRB- red velvet cake -RRB- for a gift . And I was sold . I bought the Red Velvet as well as Blueberry cheesecake , chai , pecan pie and zombie . I love these . They go on so smooth and they 're shiny enough that people think I 'm wearing gloss!It came in a little box , in just a couple days , and they sent pens and cards and other fun stuff!I have really sensitive skin and this stuff does n't bother me at all . In fact , I was recently sick with a cold and my nose got really raw from blowing it . I actually put some of the pecan pie one on my nose , -LRB- I was sick ! -RRB- not only did it smell great but the next day my nose was n't raw at ALL.They really do use all natural oils , which I love . Gon na order more soon . There are 400 flavors , hard to pick just one !
 You have to try this flavor !! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line . I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far ! 1 I hope to try them all some day !!
 I ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Ala Mode flavor from this vendor and was pleasantly surprised with an extra stick of the Angel Food Cake balm . The seller was incredibly communicative and pleasant to talk with , and the product is fantastic . The balms are very moisturizing and smell fabulous . The Strawberry Cheesecake is my favorite ^_^
 I love this chap stick , it has to be my favorite!The scent I got was Nighttime and it really does remind me of Nighttime !
 Tried Pumpkin Pie and Strawberry Daquiri and both are incredibly moisturizing and smell great !
 Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time . I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff , and I 'm happy with every single one of them !
 I remember taking Wheat Germ Oil as a kid and I had the thickest hair , strong nails , and smooth skin . Now that I 've destroyed my hair with relaxers and toxic hair colors , I 've opted to go back to natural -LRB- out of necessity and choice -RRB- and require some aid to assist me on this journey . Wheat germ oil is one of them . Good supply of Vitamins A , D , and E. Also , natural oils such as these helps to keep internal plumbing in check , as well . I do n't recall this brand having any filler oils such as soy/soya bean or the like . You really ca n't go wrong when doing nutritional stuff for yourself . So buy , use and enjoy ! And you 'll bear witness to all the good things Whet Germ oil has to offer , such as healthy hair , nails , skin and eyes .
 This product comes fresh and in glass bottles for extended shelf life ! The price made this even better . I highly recommend these to anyone looking for quality Wheat Germ in capsule form .
 I bought this wheat germ oil as a suggestion from a friend . I have a long scar on the back of my neck from surgery . I 've had it for seven years . The skin around it is raised and hardened , so I figured I 'd have to learn to live with it . I 've been applying the oil to the back of my neck and scar for about a month now and I can already tell that the skin is softening , feeling more pliable . If you have a scar that 's a nuisance , I suggest trying Country Life Wheat Germ oil .
 The item is a bit smaller than i imagined but it was shipped fast and it in perfect condition , ill enjoy the item a lot , and at such a cheap price too ! I think its well worth the price .
 I 'll be honest . I bought this as a gag gift for a friend who is deploying to Iraq . It made him laugh on the day he left , which is worth 5 stars to me . I have no idea what he 'll do with it , but if he uses it I 'll amend this review . Which is highly doubtful .
 ive used it for years , its recommended by top health care professionalsVitamineral Green 16oz New 3.5 Version
 I may be weird , but I actually LIKE the taste of VitaMineral Green . It is n't bitter like most green supplements - it tastes like Springtime . VitaMineral Green fills me up so I do n't snack between meals as much , and I do feel alert and energized when I drink it . I use a scoop each day in plain water , and just keep refilling my water bottle until it goes pale green . This causes me to drink substantially more water than I did before . I 've tried mixing it in juice but I really prefer it mixed in plain water.I do n't know how much I believe in the health claims of green foods supplements , but taking VMG definitely helps me with hydration , and keeps me `` regular '' .
 I am a true believer in the benefits of this product . I highly recommend it to those who want to stay healthy and ingest all the greens they can . My only complaint was that it seemed to take a little too long to get shipped out .

 I bought this corn plane to remove lemon zest . It does a great job and makes nice little slivers rather than other tools costing much more and harder to use . So much better than a grater . Got it at a great price with extra blades to boot !

 eliminates the painful -LRB- and goofy looking -RRB- head-bob which usually wakes you up when traveling by car - of course this assumes you are not driving . might want to look at an inflatable for air travel -LRB- save space -RRB- but concept would work . fabric has a nice feel and conforms easily to your neck for comfort . velcro is a nice touch to keep in place .
 This was a really nice item . Very happy with the purchase . So much better than foam pillows .
