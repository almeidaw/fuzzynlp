 hated these . no support for my arches or heels at all . save your money . I guess maybe it is a bonus how small they are so they will fit in small shoes . But i need real support and these just didnt do anything . I found them uncomfortable too . Dont recommend them .
 The insoles started to fall apart after a few weeks . On top of that , it hardly did anything for my plantar fasciitis . Do not buy , it is a waste of money !
 This product is useless . It does not provide any support whatsoever and is not worth the amount of money spent to obtain it . Do n't purchase !
 one has a very thick gel support and the other a very thin gel support , obviously a manufacturing defect and a bad buy . If you have crack problems on the bottom of your feet , I recommend Easy Spirit Comfort 2 sneakers , which are really great , if a little pricy at $ 69.96
 I received a 60 count bottle instead of the 90 that I paid for . Also there is no Goats milk and probiotic cultures as the website claims.Garden of Life Antioxidant Formula , Radical Fruits , Caplets , 90 caplets
 When these first came out , I thought they were great . In fact , I could n't believe how well they got stains out . I was very impressed . I always carried one in my purse as I spill stuff on my shirt DAILY . Yes , daily . I 'm that messy.However , not too long into their production cycle , I noticed they changed the material of the tips of these pens . Initially , they were a kind of felt material . A tad absorbent . Now they are hard plastic and I feel this is the reason these no longer work for me . Ever since they changed the tip material , I have been really disappointed with how these pens perform . What I 'm left with now every time I try and get a stain out is a two-tiered stain ; the larger stain where the Tide liquid expanded to and the original stain itself . Hard to know which is worse - my now larger-in-size and faded two-tiered stain or the original stain itself . Think about it
 I tried this product the other day while at a bar . I tried to remove a stain that resulted from me spilling a little Kung Pao on my shirt that I had a Thai/Chinese restaurant . The stain remover was given to me from a lady that I had met at the bar , and as I tried to use it , I noticed that the tube was really hard and nothing came out as I squeezed it . I tried to loosen the stuff inside the tube with a toothpick , but very little came out . The stuff that did come out was n't effective at removing my stain -LRB- maybe because not enough of the stain remover was applied -RRB- , but it did manage to remove some of the color in my shirt -LRB- that might have been due to the bleach-smelling substance that was in the spot remover -RRB- . Eventually , I used a spot remover that I had at home and the stain was washed out . Based on my experience with the Tide Instant Stain Remover , I will not buy this product and will not recommend it to my friends . It does n't even deserve a `` 1 Star . ''
 I purchased a six-pack from amazon , and used one on brand new Billabong board shorts within minutes of lightly dropping a dab of pizza filling . My initial test of the tide-to-go stick worked alright ... within several hours , I looked again and noticed that some color had faded out where the tide was applied ! I read the stick precautions and saw no warnings with regards to color loss . Always test on a hidden location beforehand and all of that , but I am extremely disappointed . What is in this thing , bleach ? No warnings on the stick to speak of!I am never buying another Tide product .
 I have ruined 2 white 100 % cotton shirts with the tide To Go Pen . Both were left with large yellow stains even though the very miniscule original stains were gone -LRB- salsa/sauce splatters -RRB- . I will NEVER use this product again . After reading the reviews on the Tide website , I learned of several others having the same response . Tide claims the substance reacts somehow with natural light and recommends you `` wipe the area '' after use . Beware !
 This morning I spilled coffee on my `` million dollar '' white dress shirt . It left me with three large coffer stains . I remembered that I had my Tide To Go in the car . After drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions , most of the coffee stains had disappeared ... what remained , however , were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread . So , most of the coffee stain was gone , but I 'm left with the unsightly rings ... not quite as noticeable , but there 're still there .
 I really wanted this product to work , especially based on the Kelly Ripa advertisements that made it look so simple and effective . Alas , I have tried it on very small Ketchup spots , very small tomato-based soup spatters , and finally , today , I tried to remove stains from a Starbucks Green Tea Frappuchino . I have to say I am disappointed in the results . In each case it did lighten the stain significantly , but in none of these cases did it work `` as advertised '' . That is to say , it did not leave my blouse looking like new . It left a still-quite-visible spot each time.On each occasion , I was wearing either 100 % cotton or a cotton/synthetic blend fabric , if that might make a difference.I will say , at least it did n't make things worse . After pretreating and washing all three spills were completely gone.I will continue using my Tide To Go pen when these little accidents happen , and maybe I will eventually spill something on myself that it does work on ; but at this point I seriously doubt that I will purchase another .
 Do n't waste your money on this product if you want stain removing power on the go . This `` pen '' does not remove stains , it actually makes them spread . If you want an item that does a great job on the go at removing a multitude of stains , I suggest Shout Whipes -LRB- they conveniently fit in your wallet -RRB- .
 I applied the tide to go stick to a chocolate stain on my 100 % cotton t-shirt . I looked down 45 minutes later and there was a huge hole where I applied the product . I was at school and had a huge hole over my stomach , it was embarrassing to say the least . I called them and they reimbursed me % 75 of the cost of my shirt . They also offered me a coupon for another stick , I said `` no thanks '' to the coupon ; I wo n't be using their product again !
 Do not use this product on an item of clothing that you like ... it will not only sort of remove the stain , it will also remove the color . I would not recommend this product nor would I ever purchase/use it again . As a matter of fact , I have never in my life rated any product this low , I usually can find something positive to say about it . If I could give it no or better yet negative stars , I would .
 I 've had a tide stick at my office for 6 months . The three times I 've used the stick , after a salad dressing spill , coffee stain , and mustard stain , the stick has gotten rid of the stains , but leaves a white stain instead . In some of these cases the white stains are more salient than the original stains .
 I figured I would give these a try since the Oxyclean stain sticks I bought did nothing . These did nothing either . We are only talking about dried blood on light cotton too . Nothing too drastic . In fact , one would expect with cold water and a little stain remover the stains would come right out . Did n't do anything . In fact , after watching it do nothing to remove the stain , these sticks actually made the stain more resistant to simple soap and water . Do n't waste your money .
 The whole box was dry when I received them . They could n'tremove a single stain . I will never buy them again .
 The insert did not help my foot problem , decided on another type of gel product , much more effective . But the 11-14 mens size was a pain to reduce to size which was n't accurate enough . They need to have the lengths more precise -LRB- like the brand I choose -RRB- , i.e. 11-12 or 10-11 , or 10 , 11 , 12 , etc rather than an all size -LRB- does n't -RRB- fit all . Disappointed !
 I have IBS - C. Was having a lot of stomach issues and thought I 'd try this . Caused diarrhea which was a surprise and did n't help my stomach . After the fact I looked at the ingredients and the first ingredient listed is sucrose . I do n't do well with sugar items .
 ... hardly `` elegant '' as the decription states . Soap does not fit well in the dish . Would have returned it but I could n't justify spending $ 5.00 and the time involved to get a $ 20 refund . Any old coffee mug would do just as well .
 A warning ... Myoplex Deluxe Bars are like chewing a shoe . I 've eaten my fair share of protein bars , and these are the worst .

 I bought the White Nights Doc Johnson Pocket Rocket after purchasing many quality Doc Johnson products , however , when first trying to use the product it took me 5 tries -LRB- and 5 different batteries -RRB- to actually get the battery to work correctly . The seal , upon further inspection , does not seal tightly enough to allow the battery enough contact with the cells to keep the product going . I 've tried to rig the connection and it seems to be working okay , though not as satisfactory as I thought . I would recommend buying this product if you 're willing to deal with a less than perfect model .
 I bought it as a gag gift for a baby shower but when I put the battery in and turned it on nothing . I am waiting to hear back from them about wether or not I can return it since it did n't work at all . It 's pretty cheap so I guess you get what you pay for . If I was using it as it was intended I think I 'd invest in a much better one .
 I have always used vibrating eggs but they would always stop working because of the wiring coming loose . So I decided to try something wireless . I bought this product and while it may have enough power to produce strong enough vibrations for some it certainly does n't for me .
 Tried for 45 minutes and nothing only worth the money you spent on it sadly makes you wanting watt more
 This is my second one and it stopped working after 2 uses.I changed batteries and nothing ... Same thing happened before pssshh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 I have had a pocket rocket for years . Mine broke had heard alot of `` Doc Johnson '' thought i would try this and its water proof . The fact is the vibration is poor I might as well use my fingers .
 cheaply made . does not seem very durable . I like to get my money 's worth . And like the product I purchase to last a long time .

 I 'm amazed at the great reviews - I really do n't understand it . The product works for me while it 's in my mouth ; but eventually I ca n't help but swallow and soon it 's gone . I may feel better for a couple of minutes as there is still residual product in my mouth but eventually , my dry mouth is totally back and I need more . What good is that ? I ca n't be doing that all day ; it 's a little difficult to carry on a conversation . That 's not a fix . The manufacturers claim it lasts up to 8 hours ??! I 'm trying to think how it might work in the people who claim it lasts that long for them . Does it cause some transformation in the salivary gland cells ? My dry mouth is medication caused and it makes my life misery . I wish there was a product out there that worked . I 'd be happy if it lasted half an hour .
 Hard to use as it tends to gag you when you put it in your mouthy . Couldnt really tell a difference in my always dry mouth ;
 Unexpectedly , the gel is less effective than the liquid moisturizing spray . So , I do n't use it much . It 's far too expensive for what it does .
 That 's the long and the short of it . It 's so thick that it does n't go into the nooks and crannies . I much prefer the Biotene LIQUID , which is easier to get it to cover where it 's needed . Biotene does make good products . My dry mouth is the result of radiation treatment . I do notice that both the spray and liquid tend to make me hoarse .
 I bought this to see if it would help with the terrible dry taste caused by open mouth breathing after sleeping ; it did not help at all .
 My problem is this
 I ordered this product because I have always suffered from dry mouth . Mostly because of some medications I take . Well I did this treatment only once at night and almost threw it up . That was the grossest most disgusting taste I have had in any type of treatment and it did not work that well to relieve the dry mouth problem anyway . I did order the other biotene products such as the mouth rinse and the spray and although the taste is not as bad , they also did n't help that much with dry mouth . I would highly recommend that people save their money and buy gum -LRB- sugarless or not -RRB- instead that they can chew on to create more saliva .

 This wrist brace was too stiff . I bought it to help relieve some pain while doing data entry but I could n't move my wrist in it . I tried to loosen it up and even remove the metal brackets inside -LRB- which are removable -RRB- , but it did n't help . Very uncomfortable.I tried to return this item , or at least exchange it for just a plain `` wrist band '' but they told me since I 'd opened it , it was non returnable . Their customer service would n't even work with me to resolve the problem.Needless to say , I am stuck with the item which I will never use and out some money.If I had gone up to the local store to buy this item , I would have been able to return/exchange it . I wo n't be buying from this company again : -RRB- I give this company 0 stars , the product 1 star -LRB- for those who do n't need to move their wrist -RRB- .

 I love every other product I have gotten from baby jogger , but I was disappointed in this cooler . It 's about the size of a lunch box , but it really does n't even function as well as a lunch box . . I could n't get it strapped on securely , it kept falling forward . Maybe it was `` user error '' I do n't know . Also , it needs artificial ice , regular ice will leak through the seams , which I suppose would be the case for most soft sided coolers , but that 's something you 'll need to consider with this purchase . I bought this to take on a family trip where we needed to keep an entire day worth of breast milk cold while museum hopping , and since I did n't have access to a freezer at the hotel , I planned on using ice from the machine . This did not do the trick .
 Warning , if you are buying this for a baby jogger city select , do n't bother , it does not fit . Must fit a much smaller baby jogger .
 The item I received is a baby jogger cooler bag , but it is not the same as the one pictured . Also , my bag came without any instructions so I attached it as best I could . Its very small . Im not convinced its worth having . And it does impede the folding somewhat . I was hopeful for some storage since the basket on the city mini itself is fairly worthless . Overall , I 'm not impressed . This may be going back .
 Beware City Select owners

 It did n't work for me , in fact I could n't get it to stay in place reliably.Don ' t know if there 's any scientific or anatomic rational for this thing . Possibly placebo effect only . But , could work for you - who knows ?
 I ordered a similar product , but of the original brand by Kendall . I was sent a substitute made by Medline without any notification . This product does a poor quality of work , there is no comparison with the one made by Kendall , and it should not be substituted without me agreeing with it .
 The item that was included in the box is a short story that has smaller and smaller font as it goes along . This is not what is pictured on the website . This is also different than what is pictured when I went to request a return .
 I was informed that the Master Massage tables were top of the line . Could n't be more false.The cushioning material has already deformed after only 4 months of moderate use.My cheaper massage table I got 3 years ago has held up better.AS a long term Amazon customer , I am terribly upset that there is no option for returnor compensation . Amazon should be ashamed to carry defective merchandise like this.I will be posting negative comments on any and every massage site I can towarn off other unsuspecting professional from making this mistake .

 Compared to other 2x2 gauze pads I 've used in my practice , the weave is much thinner , more open , and less absorbent . In other words , you use more to get less .
 If you 've ever seen a ` normal ' packet of 200 count gauze , you 'd be surprised to see these packets which are half the size of a normal packet of gauze . I was looking for a thin , unfilled gauze to apply a facial toner that came in a small bottle and was quite pricey . Cotton balls used too much product so I was looking for a product like this . Thin it was , but density was thinner than cheesecloth requiring you to use two . I work in healtcare and prob should have ordered from our supplier because the filled and unfilled gauze is a much higher quality . Disappointed . It does the job using two pieces but was n't quite what I was looking for .

 I did not like this tea at all . I 've bought grocery store teas that had tons of flavor , but I wanted to try this tea for the pure presumably stronger tasting experience . Even with 2 bags , this tea produces nothing more than slightly colored hot water . And one time , there was an aftertaste of dirt in a cup of tea .

 I have 150/80 range of BP . In the last 2 months have taken over one liter daily of hibiscus tea and my systolic blood pressure has not changed at all . Although , the diastolic BP ras reduced 3 points in average . It looks that the hibiscus is not effective as prescribed medications . All is publicity and the evidence is not scientifically validated . Will need to go to my Doctor to ask for medication .
 I tried drinking the tea and it made me chock on it . I believe that is was an allergic reaction to the tea leaves . I gave it away to a friend of mine that recommended in the first place . I am sorry that it happened that way because of the benefits that is applied to my health .
 I have brought these few times , the first bottle that we have received seems to mix well , also the taste was good , but the next 2 bottles were not as good as the first one . It seems to be a hit or miss if you buy this product it might come out good or bad . These powder seems to come in two different packaging one is purple and other is green , I tried both and they seems to taste bad . BTW also tried perfect acai which is costlier but the taste is much better then this one and also it state the ORAC ingredients etc upfront
 This stuff will mix with hardly anything . It floats to the top of whatever liquid you try to mix it with . Looks a little like gun powder and has a gritty -LRB- although not unpleasant -RRB- taste . I think I will switch back to grape juice and take my chances .
 Maybe i 'm allergic , but the stuff gave me a headache every time I used it . I did n't notice any health benefits because i was in too much pain . Good luck .
 I am totally annoyed . I STILL have not received this product and my credit card has been charged .
 It is certainly -LRB- generic Benadryl -RRB- Dyphenhydramine Liquid Antihistamine.This products strength is 12.5 mg , per teaspoon.Although packaged well and arrived in new condition , this product is labeled , ` children 's allergy medicine . ' Had the seller included this information in the product description , I would not have purchased the item . I am an adult and require full strength medication .

 Very disappointing but true it would not stay up on my knee I would put it as tight as possible and it would be down around my ankle after a minute or two so I returned it !
 I was not happy with the fit of this brace . I was in need of support and comfort due to a torn muniscus . Surgery did the job but this brace did not help at all .
 The package arrived faster than expected which was great . There is no medial or lateral support in the brace at all and I have had it on for 10 minutes and it is already slipping . I am not impressed with his product at all but was happy with the shipping .
 Despite the description , it not prevent or even inhibit twisting or side-to-side bending , because the metal in it is coiled wire -- very flexible .
 Bought this for my large , football-playing son . Looks like a great product , but we do n't know because he ca n't wear it . Big on top , but does n't taper below the knee so it does n't stay on . Not too many people have the same size thigh and calf !
 These just do n't work either they are too big or too small . I have purchased three , and all different sizes thinking it was me , and none of them work . Oh well better luck next time . I would n't recommend buying it , but maybe I got a defective size .
 I used the size guide from the seller , but the wrap is too large - it slides down . -LRB- I 'm not sure if this is a size issue or a design issue . -RRB- But in order to exchange it for another size , I have to pay to ship it to them and they will charge to ship another to me . Since I ca n't be sure that the smaller size will work I did n't want to invest another $ 14 to make an exchange .
 This product is a waste of money , is poorly made , and the customer service from the buyer is awful . I 've rarely encountered such nasty customer service reps as I did with this buyer . Additionally , the product is not manufactured well , is difficult to use , and overall does not stablize the knee . A one star rating equates to `` I hate it '' , which sums it up nicely . However , I wish I could rate this product with less than one star to also account for the seller 's poor service !
 The posture corrector actually does a lot for your posture , but it is so uncomfortable that I really do n't wear it . If you are willing to wear it over clothes , it may work , but it can really irritate the skin when worn direclty over it .

 I had high hopes for this product but was disappointed at the taste and the `` thinness '' of its taste . I thought that the protein level would be higher and in this way it would be healthier while limiting calories . Having to limit food intake to just on source does make it easy to diet but for me I needed a variety and some pleasure from chewing . Carrots looked really good to me in the end of the first week . I did manage to loose a pound but on week two I went on Weight Watchers and found it more filling and easy to follow and I lost mega pounds .
 After giving in to the suggestion to try Slim Fast for weight loss , I bought this item on Amazon , because the price was far and away the best I could find , and I figured I 'd be using it for a while . I was not impressed . I tried to stick to the plan as suggested on the can , but I found myself starving most of the day , and ravenous by dinner time , even with snacks . I tried modifying it a couple of ways , and ended up actually gaining weight . I was not over-eating . When I stopped using the Slim Fast and just went to an adjusted calorie diet with more protein in the morning -LRB- a Weight Watchers style program -RRB- , I started losing weight again . I think that these shakes contain far too many carbs , and not nearly enough protein , and they are too sweet , and kind of weird tasting . Unfortunately I put myself on the automatic shipment plan and did n't cancel before the second shipment came out . What a pain . I am sure there are people Slim Fast works for . I am not one of them . I just like real food too much.My suggestion is that you go to the local store , if you have one , and buy a can of this stuff to try before you purchase it online . It 's a lot easier to return that way . If you just like the taste , this is a great deal .
 I bought this product due to an article in First womans magazine . Supposedly , Slimfast is patenting the Optima formula , because it isso great as a weigh loss aid.You are supposed to replace 2 meals with shakes and eat a regular dinner . Optima is different than regular Slimfast , and you are supposed to stay full longer thereby not eating bad snacks nor suffering hunger pangs in between meals . blah blah , blahMost of my weight is due to the getting older syndrome '' and the metabolism slowing down and not over eating . I am not used to eating large amounts of food , nor am I a heavy snacker , but let me tell you . I would drink my shake , and in less than 2 hours I was starving . I mean stomach growling so the neighbors can hear , pangs so strong my gingerbread village was not safe.I gave up on this plan after 3 days . I was either miserably starving most of the day , praying for my next meal , or eating the Optima snacks in between shakes twice as often as I was supposed to.Bottom line , I was either starving , or gaining more weight from having to eat more often to get rid of the pangs.Don ' t understand it , and not saying that it will work for you . It might . I quess if you are used to 3 large meals each day and snacks in between it may make a difference , but I 'm not hopeful for you.I hate to diss a product like this , but it really did not work , and actually did the opposite of what it is supposed to do.I have quite a bit left , since -LRB- like an idiot -RRB- I bought a month 's supply to faithfully do the `` Plan '' . Maybe , my mother n law would like some . -LRB- She goes on a different diet every other month and seems to get larger every year-so apparantly she does not care if they work or not.Kim Schild
 Product tastes good but within 20 minutes of consuming it I was extremely hungry . Sounds good , tastes good but still has a lot of carbohydrates , sugary carbos that fuel the appetite . The Optima line of Slim-Fast does NOT control appetite for up to 4 hours as the label claims . This product would work if someone has a iron will and impeccable self-control but then any person with these attributes most likely does not need to use the product .
 I think 300 calories per shake is waaaaay to much for people that do not burn calories like others do . Oh yea ... they call it a SLOW METABOLISM ! I used it as directed for two weeks . I never lost a pound.I lost 70 pounds on the Medi-Fast Shakes , but they are waaaaay too expensive.I bought 2 - 3 packs of the 3-2-1 Plan shakes . They are OK tasting -LRB- but not very sweet and rather Bland . Even only using 6 ice cubes and 6 ounces of water they are very thin and not like a SHAKE!Tip - get the Jello Sugar Free - Fat Free INSTANT Pudding -LRB- adds very few calories -RRB- and add just one level tablespoon of it with your shake mix before you put it in the blender . You 'll get a slight texture to your shake and it sweetens it up just right ! I use the vanilla Pudding for the Strawberry Shakes and the Chocolate Pudding for the Chocolate Shakes.A few Frozen Strawberries or half a banana helps add a little consistency to the watery shakes too ... but the more you add to it - the more calories are adding up!The thin watery shake made me feel like I was drinking Flavored Water . YUCK !
 Nice product , and it works ... but as soon as you stop using it . . you 'll get a bouncing effect . . you will get back your loosen pounds back faster than you think . It works as long as you never stop using it .
 It is good tasting and if you drink the shake at night , go to bed as fast as you can so you wont feel the hunger !!! After 2 weeks , maybe less , you will not even want to see the shake near you , because it really bores to have the same thing all the time !!!!
 The only thing good I can say about this product is that it tastes good . That is true of the entire Slimfast line of products . They all taste good . But due to the high sugar content they are not weight loss products as the name of the product and company advertising suggests . The Optima line of Slimfast products reduces , but does not eliminate the volume of sugar . This is really stupid on the part of the Slimfast Company . They could have eliminated sugar all together and replaced it with Splenda . Then they would have actually had a weight loss product . But due to the low cost of sugar and the fact that most people prefer the taste of sugar , they chose to `` reduce '' the sugar content . The smart consumer will not buy this product , unless you have no need for weight loss , and do n't mind buying a good tasting product from a company that misleads the public in their advertising.Since the main ingredient in all Slimfast products is sugar , their products have absolutely no weight-reducing characteristic . I tried the Slimfast products and program myself , so I know from my own experience that it does not work!The US Department of Agriculture did many studies to result in their well know `` food guide pyramid . '' It states that `` sweets should be used sparingly . '' Consuming meals of primarily sugar in 2 out of every 3 meals consumed -LRB- the widely published Slimfast diet plan -RRB- , could not possibly be described as using sweets sparingly.The Nutrition Action Health letter website indicates
 I tried the catnip tea after many recomendations . However , I discovered that this product is no different than any herbal tea , and demonstrated no positive quality of sleep-inducing . I will never buy this product again .
 This stuff had no effect on me . I followed directions and everything . I waited , zero effect.But i just tried these pills called -LRB- sam-e -RRB- its at walmart or any local store.I took it for two weeks , and i saw major improvement!The only con is that there a little pricey .
 The zombie flavor is just gross . The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I could n't get over the smell of this flavor .
 It does n't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed . I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor . Atleast It has a taste .
 So disappointed . Ca n't even wear these . They slide down . The quality of the hose part seems good , but the top is so loose .
 I got a box for just over a buck on sale to try . I do n't have problems going but there are days where I barely do and it 's hard so I decided to try this on one of those days . I drank before bed just like the box said , let it sit in boiling water for 15 minutes . Not even an hour after drinking the cramps started . I spent the next hour , maybe longer on the toilet . It was not fun and I was exhausted , I just wanted to sleep . Finally after going more than I ever have in my whole life . I was able to go to bed . Thankfully I did not wake up due to cramping . The next day I felt okay , then I was out shopping and lo and behold the cramps started again . I ended up going back home just to be safe . I went , and went and went throughout the afternoon , wondering when I would ever stop . I did n't stop going until in the evening.So , the reason for the two stars is the cramps . They were bad . Maybe not as bad as some I have had before . The instructions are not exactly honest , especially how I drank the tea and not even an hour later was going . So clearly it is different for everyone , I will only drink this again if I am so constipated I have n't gone in days , that probably wo n't happen , but it 's there , just in case . The product clearly works but the cramps just are n't worth it too me . Next time I will probably try brewing for only 5 minutes to see if this lessens the side effects . The fact that it cleans you out , is 5 stars .
 SmoothMove accomplishes its purpose , but after only five uses over 6-8 weeks my large intestine feels irritated and my usually efficient digestive process has been thoroughly disrupted . The nurse who recommended it did n't warn me to try brewing it only five minutes or less at first try ; I did n't find that out until it was too late . BTW , I had to take this because of hydrocodon side effects . Be very cautious about using this product
 Not for people who have high blood pressure , heart disease , kidney disease , etc.Dumb me , should have researched this product before I purchased it . I have high blood pressure and am on medication for it . I could n't figure out why I would start getting heart palpitations after about 30 minutes after I drank it . After going to the doctor , I was told , liquorice extract and high blood pressure do n't mix.Some licorice that has the active ingredient of glycyrrhiza , which raises blood pressure -LRB- which this product must have , -RRB- because of my blood pressure rising , should never be taken . Now there is another type of licorice , called DGL or deglycyrrhizinated licorice , it does n't seem to have the same side effects , then it might be okay , from what I 've researched . Liquorice also makes you retain water , and lowers your potassium levels , which people with high blood pressure need ... . potassium!Email me if you want the website link , I do n't think Amazon allows it.I found this review from another website regarding this product , after coming back from the doctor , so do your own research . ************************************************************* Smooth Move Tea , and other Smooth Move products , contain a dangerous combination of ingredients . When Senna and Licorice Root are taken together , dieters and consumers can experience heart problems , increase blood pressure , impaired kidney function , impaired function of muscles and nerves . No weight loss or laxative supplement is worth taking if the combination of ingredients can lead to serious health risks . Senna is also linked to dependence , which is another reason to stay away from Smooth Move Tea .
 I 'm not sure if I like it , the taste is a little weird to me . I think I 'll stick with magnesium .
 The product has a great potential for people not wanting to get hooked to normal fiber intact supplements like Metamucil or Miralax , or just the consistent pressure of wanting to go to the bathroom . Senna Tea has its laxative properties imbued with a little bit of discomfort when the urge to go arrives and can be quite painful , and the continued use of it can lead to bowel cancer and other unspeakable horrors . The only reason I gave it two stars was the fact that it does n't put your body in a state of requiring fiber supplements , for example after 1-2 sessions of the tea you can put your rests aside and look forward to gaining all your intakes from eating right .
 I really did n't like the taste of this . It is so sweet its nasty and it was very hard for me to swallow . Triple Tea Leaf was more subtle and worked immediately . Takes too long for it to take affect . Will not be purchasing again .
 I ordered this item , however the merchant told me it can not be shipped to my country.They offered me to select a different product.They did n't have the second one I picked , , but from a third try wefinally found a product they can ship.It arrived quicky and everything is ok.Two cons : - it would be better if condoms are packed in some bag and not just put in an envelope - product they send me is cheaper than the one I initially ordered and I was charged for thepricier one . I asked if I 'll get few condoms extra cause I pay them more , but I got no reply
 So disappointed . Ca n't even wear these . They slide down . The quality of the hose part seems good , but the top is so loose .
 Bought a couple bottles at Costco to try out . This stuff is horrible tasting . I 'm going to bear it out for the duration of these 2 bottles because I 've already bought them and others say it will work for aching knees . Check back in a few weeks and I 'll update my review . The taste is something like an awful cough syrup with some rotten berry jam swirled in it . It 's nasty !
 I 'm a firm believer that liquid medicines & supplements absorb in the body faster than pills . However this stuff tastes HORRIBLE . I tried some of the tips/tricks other reviewers suggested to make it a little more palatable -LRB- mix with seltzer water , dilute with water , add to juice , drink water immediately after taking it etc -RRB- , I just ca n't stomach it . Back to pill form for me .
 I used these every day , two or three times a day for several months TO NO AVAIL . Fortunately I read about olive oil and I found out how wonderful olive oil is for chapped , cracked lips . Olive oil has made such a * dramatic * difference that I no longer buy these sticks .
 I gave 1 star not because of the product itself . The product is absolutely great . We have Miele W4802 . This detergent works very well as advertised . I heard that Tide HE works well too but some customer reviews out there are saying it 's hard to get all powder off the cloth - so we went for Persil . We are happy.The problem IS : As soon as I placed the order , I realized that our local Miele store has the same product that actually costs a little less . We can get it right away instead of waiting for shipping . i immediately tried to contact the seller from Amazon website . There is no phone number and only email is made avalaible . I sent them 2-3 emails asking for cancellation but they NEVER responded !!! In a few days , the product arrived.I think it is totally iresponsble if you allow customers to contact you and you do n't intend to respond to our requests . At least , I would like to get a response saying something . No , never heard a word from them . I hope Amazon can monitor these sellers and give them feedback if these sellers do n't live up to their promise.Be aware of this problem . I do n't think there is a way that customer can cancel an order with this seller .

 These are full of chemicals and crap and expensive too . I should have bought plain grape seep oil -LRB- the best alternative -RRB- and added essential oils as needed . All natural , and much much cheaper alternative .
 We really only like 1 of the 5 scents which is why I 'm only giving it 2 stars , but we do really like that scent and have used most of it .

 Art of Shaving Pre-shave oil works fine but is very very oily ... I 'm not a fan ... One could use olive oil or something similar and the result would be the same . Art of Shaving Soap and Post Shave Balm on the other hand are excellent , however the Pre-shave is sub-standard to other products . Once you apply the Pre-shave oil , your hands and face are coated in oil which is tough to remove even with soap.As an alternative , I use the Kiehl 's Pre-Shave which allows the face to be slick but not oily so that your shave is smooth . I should note , that Kiehl 's shave cream is very much lacking compared to Art of Shaving .
 In October 2010 I purchased Source Naturals L-Tryptophan . It was recommended to help me with light insomnia . One hour after taking only two 500mg capsules I became desperately ill and my health has continued to decline to this day to the point I am now housebound and can not stand for more than a few minutes due to terrible pain . My experiences led me to write two books about what had happened , the horrors myself and my young family have had to endure because I took only two Source Naturals L-Tryptophan capsules . Before and after writing the books my research turned up some very alarming information about this so called `` natural '' company . They produced L-Tryptophan in the 1980s which caused the disease I have now to endure , EMS , or Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome . They were litigated to be held accountable to the victims killed or disabled for life . Tryptophan was then banned for a period of more than a decade . And now ? Source `` naturals '' think it acceptable to buy their Tryptophan from China , where it is usually made from duck feathers , -LRB- diseased or not -RRB- . They do not tell you this on the label , the label on the bottle states `` made in the USA '' which is a lie . The Tryptophan is imported from China and merely put into capsules in the USA , then sold to an ignorant public . Legally it is a disgrace , although they are permitted to act in this manner by current legislation . So why should you care ? Why should you stop buying Source Naturals ? For one reason . They are a firm which does NOT have the consumers interests at heart . They are interested mainly in profit , as there are sources of ethically produced Tryptophan around -LRB- plenty of them -RRB- , but Source Naturals consider it more profitable to buy in bulk from the one country we have all heard so many horror stories about when it comes to foods and supplementation - China . If you wish to keep buying Source Naturals products I wish you well , and I hope and pray that you do not contract a horrible disease from their products as a result of their greed , as I have done . Think for a moment before you press that buy button - the Source Natural product you are about to buy may well have an ingredient from a VERY un-natural source .
 These pills are massive and they smell so bad that I could not continue taking them . They taste horrible and the taste lingers for a while ... its totall gross ... i would reccomend Source Naturals Herbal Resistance Liquid -LRB- Alcohol Free Formula -RRB- as an alternative . It works amazingly and basically you 'll never be sick again ! and it tastes much much better and is much easier to take !!!
 I am still hopeful regarding this product despite my poor experience . I want this stuff to work and hope to come back and edit my review at some point . My colleague was so vehement in swearing by this stuff , with several examples of others she knows that it works great for , that I went online and bought 2 of the biggest bottles of 180 tabs and 2 of the largest bottles of the alcohol-free tincture -LRB- for my 3 year old -RRB- to keep us healthy against those nasty pre-school germs . He recently started preschool and it 's been the typical runny noses & colds plaguing everyone in our home relentlessly since then . Probably a coincidence , but the week I got the stuff and began taking it , I felt a flu coming on , so I did the triple dose every 3 hrs as suggested and ended up getting one of the worst flus I 've had in 15 years despite nearly going through 90 tabs ! I 've had several colds since then , and each time I try to thwart it at the `` first signs of imbalance '' as the bottle says , by taking 3 tabs every 3 hrs , and each time I still get sick . WTF ??? My husband actually makes fun of me now because taking Wellness Formula is such a joke , I 'm always getting sick regardless ! And yes , the tabs are so big and stinky they make me gag , but if the stuff worked , I would n't care . I am just so disappointed with this stuff -LRB- or with my immune system vs. preschool -RRB- , bah !
 the one thing I hate is ordering something and waiting for 2 weeks and have to back track and check to see why it 's not here . This company does n't have the common deccentcy to send an email that it IS N'T IN STOCK ... POOR SERVICE . . WO N'T BE BACK .
 Had a virus . Tried everything to help get over it ... . Dont know if this helped or not . I was down at least 14 days ... . ugh !
 I ordered 240 tablets and received 240 capsules . you have to take twice as many capsules as tablets which means my product cost twice as much as expected . very misleading image and labels in the order form .
 We bought the 90 tablet pill version -LRB- these are solid pills -RRB- from a GNC and they worked well . They do smell a bit and where somewhat hard to swallow , but we started using them at any sign of a cold . We never had any side effects . Recently , we bought the 240 capsule size -LRB- these are made with a soft gell capsule -RRB- via AMAZON as the savings vs the pills was almost 50 % . My wife and I both experienced abdominal pains after taking these capsules . We tested this several times and each time we had the same low grade abdominal pain . It was almost as if your inards where inflammed . It wouldnt last very long , but it was obviously from the gell capsules . We bought the 90 tablet pills again from GNC and did not have any problems with the product.I am not sure why we would have pains from the capsule vs the pills for the same product , but these are my recommendations .1 -RRB- Make sure the reseller is an authorized reseller for Source Naturals . They list the vendors on their web site -LSB- ... -RSB- This will prevent any , potentially dangerous , knock offs getting in your hands .2 -RRB- Before you buy , ask for the shelf life of the product you receive . We bought the 240 capsules and the shelf life was only a few months . If you buy the pills from a store , you can see the expiry date is much longer .3 -RRB- Buy the pills vs the capsules . They may smell and may be harder to swallow , but I believe they are better for you . The counter argument may be they dont break down as fast , but capsules can spoil faster than solid pills and could also be more easily tampered with .4 -RRB- If you encounter any pains . STOP taking this product and see your doctor . Dont forget to take the tablets with you for your check up . Wellness Products should not cause any pains or discomfort.Be well.Sincerely , Andreas
 The Wellness Formula pills really help you from getting a cold if you start them as soon as you feel a cold coming on .
 Ok , so , the taste and smell is very strong . When you are felling sick at first , this smell really want to make you gag . My girlfriend got a bad stomach flu that resulted in it coming out both ends . I knew it was only a matter of time for me . I went ahead and started this product ... no suck luck . I started having the double ended action too . I actually kept that up until I dehydrated my way into the hospital . Maybe that bug was just too much for it . She took nothing and got off better than I did .
 I bougth these with some expectations to dodge a cold . My two kids need a healthy mom to care for them when they are sick . However , I 'm sick with a cold now and had another one last week . I take the recommended dose and I 'm a healthy eater . SO ? I guess my colds were too hard for this to work.They also repeat on me something awful for a hour after taking them . Burping this is not pleasant . I will stick to tylenol and get back to work .
 I have been taking these for almost a year - they are amazing . At the first sign of getting sick , follow the directions , I would take more than 1 etc. . I would swallow them with a bite of food to get around the taste . They worked 100 % of the time.I bought them at GNC . My GNC is out of them . I went on-line , ordered them , and much to my delight saved 50 % . Yea . I took 1 today and got so dizzy and sick and nausious . Ugh . Why would I order something on-line and swallow it ???? I do not recommend buying this on-line .
 Bought this product based entirely on the rave reviews . I have 2 toddlers and I need to keep myself healthy when they are sick . Well , I take it daily and overall eat well . However , I have a cold right now and had one last week . So much for that.The pills also produce some serious `` repeating '' on me . I burp up the flavor for a while after taking a dose . That is not good , the flavor is pretty bad.I mean I made it through horse pill size prenatals vitamins !!! I will not be buying these again . I 'll stick with tylenol for a cold .
 This product does not work . It is nothing more than a low dose multiple vitimin.Do not waste your money .
 I received the wrong product . I ordered peppermint and was sent lavender . . and when I contacted the customer service e-mail twice , they did not respond , so I had to file a claim through Amazon . A first impression is a lasting impression . I will never do business with them again .
 So disappointed . Ca n't even wear these . They slide down . The quality of the hose part seems good , but the top is so loose .
 I got a pair of these very same Herbal Concept slippers about 4 years ago for Christmas . I agree that they are a true godsend when winter cold seems to inhabit our footsies and chill them . If you are someone that suffers from chronically cold feet , than you know that no amount of blankets , wrapping , or swearing at them will perform the miracle that genuine heat will do . These slippers lasted me for quite a while , and I was appreciative of the gift . However they did not last as long with me as perhaps some of the others here for I am admittedly lazier than most and refused to take them off every time I had to get up . Walking with any of these kind of slippers is an art that like anything else must be practiced and learned , but it is manageable . Just remember that whether you get right competent in walking with them like I did , or just stumble on down the hall here and there , be aware you will wear them out that much faster as I did . So unless you 're either as lazy as me , I would not recommend walking in any of these slippers . I had to sadly part with mine just over a year ago.Though I have fond memories of my Herbal Concepts , I have to find myself recommending the cheaper , and in my opinion just as quality built pair of Carex Bed Buddies that I now own . I bought the Bed Buddies at a local mall here over a year ago for less than half the price of the name brand Herbal Concepts . In my opinion , they are just as comfortable , just as well made , and warm up the very same way that the Herbal brand does . Both of these type of slippers have a bag of beads that are very heat sensitive in the heel . You peel back the velcro strips holding in the bags and tuck them into your microwave for a couple of minutes . The beads soak up heat like a sponge and hold it for well over an hour . After owning the bed buddies for a year now , I have to say that they are every bit as good at what they are designed for as the much more expensive herbal concepts . Its my recommendation that if you are in the market for such a pair of snuggies for your feet , that you follow the link enclosed and at least check out the bed buddies.Remember that I have owned them both . And I feel you can save a lot and still have the warmest tootsies around by avoiding the famous name brand featured here ... Carex Bed Buddy Warming Footies
 This product is like putting a heated bean bag in a very loose oversized sock . It is NOT designed for walking nor standing . If used in bed , the bag WILL fall towards your heal , leaving your toes and top of your foot cold . The outer bootie will eventually fall down also . There is nothing to keep the bootie portion above your ankles . Overall this is a very poor design and a waste of time and money . You are better off buying a good pair of heavy socks , heating them with a blow dryer or putting them in a clothes dryer .
 I purchased the Herbal Concepts Comfort Booties after my previous pair `` sprung a leak '' on one of the booties and needed to be replaced . I based my purchase on a 4 star rating which was better than most of the other brands displayed . My first surprise came when i tried on the delivered pair . It seemed very tight , but I managed to put them on after warming them in the microwave for a little over 1 minute . I noticed that the seeds tended to bunch up in the middle under the arch of my foot and needed to be manipulated to warm the toes , where they were most needed . Although I am used to this procedure , I am not very satisfied with the ultimate result . I think the booties need several smaller compartments to distribute the warming seeds around primarily the the front part of the foot and not in the arch.Since returns involve authorization , repacking and mailing I am living with these booties and derive some -LRB- albeit not enough -RRB- benefit.Alfred Fischer
 First of all the biggest strike against these is that they are constructed of polyester and despite the warning on the package that they should not be heated for longer than a minute or two the fabric will ultimately melt . The herbs and flax retain heat to the point of ultimately burning their way thru thru the cheap and highly flammable fabric.Mine developed a hole after one two minute heating.Had these been made of cotton or wool or a natural fiber this could be a decent product .
 While these booties do warm your feet , the heat pack inserts are a rough uncovered sack that comes directly in contact with your feet and are uncomfortable to me since my feet are very sensitive to texture . Also , the fit is loose with no way to tighten the cuffs around your ankle so it 's awkward keeping them on . I 'll probably end up getting something else .
 This wrap is very soft and takes heat very well in the microwave without the seed filling burning and smelling awful . I used this wrap heated 4 times with no problem , however the 5th time it came apart and seeds went everywhere . I have never had a wrap do that . It appears to just be glued together instead of sewn .
 This product needs several more stich lines to seperate the herbs and keep them in place . When you drape it around your shoulder the contents all shift down with gravity leaving no heat on top of your shoulders .
 The wrap is partially-filled and the baffling is poor , meaning that you can shake down the seeds to one side and have empty fabric for OVER HALF of the length of the wrap . Since the seeds carry the heat/cold , I end up having to constantly readjust and fold it over . I am sewing the ends and the neckline to try and keep the seeds together . If I had been able to see it first , I would not have purchased it .
 This wrap - while nice for neck , shoulders , and back - does not smell nice after a few uses . It 's supposed to have twelve soothing aromatic herbs . Unfortunately , after a few uses , it smells like nothing more than cooked rice . Over the Christmas holidays , I took it with me to a party . One person said it smelled like sausage while another said it smelled like chili and another said it smelled like urine ! I kid you not ! And then whatever clothes you are wearing when you use it also smell horrendous . It 's a great style and provides warm comfort , but unfortunately , they sooo missed the mark on the aromatics !!!
 WHEN I RECEIVED MY 2 SHOULDER WRAPS I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE WRAPS WERE COVERED IN A FURRY KIND OF MATERIAL AND AFTER BEING IN THE FREEZER FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS LAID OUT FLAT I PUT ONE ON MY NECK AND THE FURRY MATERIAL WAS HOT NOT HELPING COOL ME DOWN . I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER BOUGHT SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THEY HAVE A PERMANENT PRESS LIKE MATERIAL AND ARE THE GREATEST . CHANGE THE MATERIAL THEY ARE MADE OF ON THE OUTSIDE AND GET BACK TO ME . THANKS SUSAN
 Kama Sutra needs to work on their packaging ! The oil had leaked all over the rest of the kit and was such a mess I couldnt salvage anything but what was left in the bottle yet . They need to use bottle caps instead of corks and seal the plastic bags properly to prevent this from reoccuring . Ugh !
 Loved the smell !!! The honey dust and feather ... wonderful . The oil didnt warm as expected =O -LRB- . The stimulant oil was not so great . I like warming sensations over cool minty ones .
 Heating for 2 minutes made this warm but not very warm . So i heated it for 3 minutes and it must have toasted the herbs inside . Now it stinks of burnt toast and the smell will not go away . I have other heat pads/bags which can be heated for this long and do not emit a burnt smell . Very disappointing .
 While the pack smells great it does n't hold the heat long enough . I thought it would have rice or cherry pits in it that would hold the heat longer for better relief .
 The 2 Foley Syringes is what I ordered and what I WANT !! However Direct Care sent 2 Kendall 60cc pistons . PLEASE correct this mistake before I will do anymore bussiness with AMAZON . . com Sincerely Ralph McClure
 These are good tasting bars , but I regularly get these from Sam 's club for about $ 11 , for the same box . I have been buying them for about a year now .
 Product was very expensive , and the flavor was horrid.Very fake tasting , and extremely sweet , too Much for us ! We would prefer a higher quality taste .
 When I ordered this product I thought I was getting 5 different flavors , instead I only got one and it tastes HORRIBLE .
 I was taking the other prasenta pill , then It worked very much . But I got it this time , I do n't know it is working or not.I hope it is working ...

 I have found the merkur blades to be far inferior to the quality of their razors . My merkur 180 came with 10 of these blades , and frankly , they have been actually painful to use . At first I thought it was my technique as I was new to safety razor shaving , but even with practice , different shave creams , pre-shave oil , and a variety of stubble preps , I can say these things are barely usable with my skin type.The pre-shave oil did actually help and make a difference , but not enough to make me even consider staying with these blades . Also they do not hold an edge very well . Maybe my 10 were from a bad batch , but these blades are basically single use . I 've tried several times to get multiple shaves out of them , but it just rips my face up too much to continue trying with these things.If they work with your skin type , great . I have fairly sensitive skin and I really do n't have very thick beard growth . I 'm not sure who these things are made for , but my experience makes me think they are intended for leather faced persons with no facial hair .
 Merkur may make decent razors , but these blades are not sharp enough for me . After trying 3 of these blades , enough is enough , too much razor burn and not close enough ... next .
 When I purchased my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor , I only had the Merkur blade it came with , a box of10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edgeblades and a box of Merkur blades . I used the original Merkur blade for a week and then switched to the Feather blades and used them until I finished that box . I was very pleased with the performance after a week for these blades . Then I went back to start using my box of Merkur blades and a new blade serious felt WORSE than a week old Feather blade . More tugging and effort required leaving more irritaion . I just can not recommend these in comparison to the Feather brand . If I get different brands to compare to , I will update my review .
 I tried these when first bought my Merkur `` Fat Boy '' razor . I thought they were good , however , that was before I tried Feather blades . Merkur blades are dull and not sharp from the get go , in comparison . They pull your beard and always nick you up . Feather blades from Japan , on the other hand , are THE best . Literally , `` razor '' sharp , they cut through a three day growth with ease . I will not buy the Merkur blades anymore , and will go back to the Japanese brand , which makes it a pleasure to shave . Which is exactly why I went to DE wet shave razors in the first place .
 These blades are a little too mild for my taste . My facial hair is on the thicker side so when I made a pass with the Merkur blade I could feel it tugging away . I had to make multiple passes in order to get my face nice and smooth . The result of these multiple passes was horrible road rash and a quite a bit of blood . Stepped over to Feather blades and they work like butter .
 I purchased the Merkur 180 Safety Razor and without giving it much thought I also ordered the Merkur DE Razor Blades . I 've shaved with these blades 5 times and they have been by far the WORST shaving experience I 've ever had in my life . I have a very coarse beard and sensitive skin and these blades have given me the most painful and unsightly razor burn ever . My shaving regimen consists of applying pre-shave oil and shaving cream via a silvertip badger brush yet the Merkur blades consistently pulled uncomfortably on my beard . After 2-3 shaving passes I still found myself with patches of beard all over my face . Due to all the patches I started resorting to shaving while holding the safety razor at odd angles which wrecked further havoc on my face . And last but not least after shaving I would experience an uncomfortable burning sensation that would last almost all day . I was this close to quitting shaving with a safety razor until I started looking through wet shaving forums and just about every post I ran into on blades was filled with users complaining about uncomfortable shaves and razor burn coming from the Merkur blades . I was skeptical that switching blades could make that much of a difference but after shaving with the Astra Superior Platinum Blade this morning I can tell you from first hand experience that blades make a ton of difference . With the Astra SP I had no pulling and after only 1 pass I was 90 % done . If you have a coarse beard and/or sensitive skin I highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from the Merkur DE blades !
 Do n't buy this product . It is rough on the skin and will tear it up every time you shave . It came with the Merkur shaver I bought years ago and made me consider switching back to standard triple blades . Now I use Shark , which is a lot better .
 This product includes Rose Hips but , the web description does not include this fact . The web Description must be changed . I suggest that the web page show the Supplement Facts portion of the label clearly so that it can be easily read .
 It does n't really smell like anything , and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on . But it is a good size and shape .
 I bought two of these for my kids at christmas thinking they could put it in their beds to keep warm . The first one arrived with a hole in it and I 've tried contacting them and have never received a response from them . Secondly , we put the other one in the microwave for the two minutes on ea . side and It smelled like it was burning . The first time I actually threw it outside because I thought it was going to catch on fire ! It made our microwave smell like burnt popcorn and My kids hate the smell of it . This product stinks - LITERALLY !
 Ouch.Other reviewers have said that Swissco natural bristle toothbrushes are softer than regular nylon bristle toothbrushes , and that if you want a soft natural-bristle toothbrush , get one labelled `` medium . `` Boy , are they wrong.After buying this brush , using it twice and then nursing a set of ravaged gums for three days , I decided it was better suited for cleaning small glass bottles and the nibs of my calligraphy pens . I am not putting it in my mouth again.I have since learned that Swissco toothbrushes are coded extra-soft , soft and medium , with medium being the hardest . I 'd say the `` medium '' brush I bought was comparable in feel to the hardest `` extra-hard '' nylon bristle brush I 've ever used , and since I wanted a soft brush , I should have opted for the one Swissco calls `` extra-soft . '' Unfortunately , the wooden handled brushes only come with `` medium '' bristles . * Live and learn , I guess . But it would make more sense for Swissco to use a coding standard in accord with most people 's dental hygiene experiences.Still , it is a lovely brush , warm yet minimalist , almost Japanese in its natural look and Zen-like austerity . * Softer natural bristles are available on Swissco 's `` tortoise '' and `` white horn '' handled toothbrushes , both of which are actually plastic . This wood-handled `` medium '' bristled entity is the only all-natural toothbrush that Swissco makes .
 As another reviewer explained , the head on the brush is too large to fit comfortably in your mouth and the bristles are way too hard . I could not even finish brushing my teeth when I tried to use it because it was so uncomfortable . Plus it comes in a plastic container -LRB- not marked as recyclable -RRB- which is not helpful if you are buying this product to reduce your plastic consumption . I would instead recommend the Brooks Pearwood Boar Bristle , a very similar product in the same price range that has a smaller head and much softer bristles .
 Not impressed with the stiffness of the bristles , it literally feels like I am brushing my teeth with a wire brush meant for cleaning a BBQ . NO JOKE . Ick ! Design is nice , if not HUGE , but I just ca n't get past the bristles . I bought these to replace my Brooks brand toothbrush -LRB- http://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Pearwood-Boars-Bristle-Toothbrush/dp/B000VUYQOA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330245229&sr=8-1 -RRB- which was perfect and was not so stiff but I think I will be going back to them after all -LRB- I actually found them on another website for much cheaper but I cant remember the name of the site so will have to go searching for it again I guess . -RRB- My only real regret is I bought one for each in my family . Unless I want my kids to be scarred for life I will not be giving these to them or they might avoid tooth brushing forever . OY , live and learn ...
 I thought this was a pack of toothbrushes because of the picture . Probably -LRB- ? -RRB- they say somewhere in the description that there 's only 1 toothbrush for the price , but I did n't see it . And yeah , I can definitely say the price is fair , for a nice wooden toothbrush ; it 's just not what I thought I was buying . The picture is totally misleading.Also , the bristles are SUPER hard ! I would use this toothbrush to clean a carburetor , not my teeth . My husband says he likes it , so he 's using it now , but I 'm kinda worried he 's going to ruin his gums on it .
 Having spent some time in Germany and being familiar with Merkur products , I was very much disappointed with the quality of this razor . Not only did it have a flaw in the handle , the weight is definitely too light . It 's more like a womens razor than a mens . Both in size and weight it is too small . I had one for years that finally gave out and expected a similar product . Surely someone makes a decent twin-trac razor . Returned to Sesto Senso and refunded without problem . Amazon.com informed me they would step up if need be .
 These things work okay for a while but then the plastic hose that goes from the pump to the wand will get brittle and it will just break . Then you will have to throw the unit out and buy another one because they design it so you ca n't fix or replace the hose , so plan on buying a new one every year or two . The quality of this product is extremely poor . Another good example of the garbage coming out of China .
 I 've had two Waterpiks in the last year . The first one broke after 6 months . This one the water line is so coiled , you ca n't close the lid without problems with jamming . Other Waterpik tips are not interchangeable .
 I bought the the Wp-65 model , after 1 week the pump would not work . returned it to the store for a second one but it had no water pressure after 4 days . this marks a 100 % failer rate . maybe the older waterpiks work but not the newer ones , Waterpik has really lowered its standards . If they keep going the way they are the company will probably fold in 9 months . the concept is good but they have to make a machine that actually works and without the jackhammer noise that shakes the whole house . I will be looking for a competers brand .
 It works good but this is a very noisy equipment.It bothers family while using . This is why I did n't like the product
 I have had this unit less than a year . It has been leaking for quite some time and now I ca n't adjust the water pressure . It is stuck at too low a setting so it is now useless . These things should last longer . I see many other reviewers had the same problem . Junk .
 I owned another waterpik for a few years that broke recently and replaced it with this one because i loved the old one so much . Unfortunately the button that pauses the water from spraying requires you to push down really hard or the water will still run.my fingers start to ache after a few seconds of using this . So unless you have a strong grip with your thumb and wont mind a big dent in your finger , go ahead and buy it . Otherwise stay away from this model at least .
 Bought this less than 30 days ago . I have been having trouble for a few days but tonight it wo n't even pump water . I 'm exchanging it in hopes it was a fluke . If not ... I 'll return for full refund . Thank goodness Amazon has a great return policy .
 From the start mine has worked only intermittently . Very frustrating .
 My WaterPik was great -- I did not mind the noise and found that I ould contol the twisted coil hose by putting it in a cup between brushes . But the thing quit -- just quit . What in the world is going on ? Is there any recourse for inferior units like this ? I am disgusted with such thinga being foisted on the public . Where is WAterPIk 's quality control ?
 I have used variations of this Waterpik product for over 40 years and most last years before needing to be replaced . In the past two months I have replaced two and am on my third . The motor slows then stalls never to start again . Of course , they are within warranty but I ca n't be without the oral irrigation for the length of time required by repair . It 's sad to see what had been such a good product deteriorate so terribly .
 I went to amazon to order another Waterpik system -LRB- foolish me -RRB- and I just thought I 'd check the customer reviews . Virtually EVERYONE has had the same experience as me . You get it home , it works for a week or two -LRB- if your lucky -RRB- and then it fails . I actually did n't get more than a couple of uses out of it . I just assumed that I got the odd lemon but obviously this company is marketing something that IS NOT RIGHT and yet it 's amazing if you read the reviews how many people still come back to give them another chance . Beside the product being a LEMON we must be LEMMINGS !!!!!!!!!!!! Do n't jump , go elsewhere ... someone mentioned that Panasonic has it 's own oral irrigator ... Good Luck .
 -LSB- 2009 update -RSB- I got an OralBreeze from Amazon to replace my third WaterPik : QuickBreeze - Dental Oral IrrigatorThe adapter attachment & little hose mean having some extra stuff there at the faucet , but there 's no more motor noise , no reservoir to fill , no fumbling with the WaterPik on the counter , etc. . I also prefer the higher pressure & steady flow as opposed to the WaterPik 's `` rat-tat-tat '' pulsating pressure flow , but I also think if I 'd kept using WaterPik , by now I would 've had to order another replacement ; these new models just do n't seem to last very long.Original review : The old WaterPik I had lasted for years , and when I finally broke I replaced it with this new model . I 've found that the water flow often stops and I have to fiddle around with the cutoff & flow adjusters on the handle to get it working again.I 'm not normally an `` old things are good , new things are bad '' kind of complainer , but in this case , the old simple design did n't have much to it and was hard to break -- but I believe the new handle design is poorly done , and if the one I bought does n't fail completely pretty soon , I expect it 'll just malfunction one time too many and I 'll pitch it in the trash . I 've have n't looked at many alternatives yet , but I like the looks of OralBreeze -LRB- not near as noisy and not does n't look like very much there to break -RRB- , and will probably avoid buying another WaterPik ... Message to WaterPik
 I bought the Water Flosser after my original Waterpik -LRB- model 100 -RRB- died after six or seven years of usage . This model looks much better than the older models , but it 's a piece of garbage . The first one I purchased died after four weeks . Figuring that I must have gotten a defective one , I sent it back and got another one . Well , would you believe the second one lasted about two and a half weeks ? Both did the same thing - the motor starts sounding louder , like it 's vibrating or something . Within a day or two , water is no longer coming out of the stupid thing . Waterpik will be getting a complaint letter from me . It 's a shame that the company is still selling these obviously defective units . Do n't waste your money .
 The first one I bought broke in less than two weeks . The second lasted barely a month . I suggest buying something else .
 I have used this device for over 20 years . My &#34; old &#34; one has worked flawlessly for over 10 years . I am now returning my THIRD &#34; new &#34; one all of which have failed within 30 to 60 days-pump fails to pump water thru pic or fails to have proper pressure . Do yourself a favor DO N't buy one .
 Noisy , and does not tolerate addition of mouthwash to the water . Unit failed after about 2 months . Contacted Waterpik who advised me not to use mouthwash in the flosser tank because there is a materials issue involving a gasket that swells because of the mouthwash ingredients . Ridiculous , I had another brand for several years with no mouthwash issues . Waterpik sent me a replacement part which I installed . I should not have to deal with a product that has gross limitations . Will never purchase a waterpik product again !
 I have been using Water Piks for over 30 years and I believe that the use of Water Piks has been a major factor in helping me to maintain the condition of my teeth and gums.During this period I have had quite a few different Water Pik units -LRB- I 'd say at least 6 -RRB- . In most cases I have had to replace the units because of leaks in the hose . The cost of repairing the hose almost equals the cost of a new unit , so I always end up buying one . I object , not only to the cost of replacing my Water Pik every few years , but also to the effect on the environment of discarding so many of these machines .
 ` would give 0 star if possible ... This item is the worst product I have ever bought at Amazon . After just 3 days , it starts giving very loud noise -- as loud as a lawn-mower . I am trying to cope with the noise until it broke and stopped working . Now , I have a broken item with just more than 30-days old - :-LRB- ... do not know what to do ...
 I have always had Water Pik and never have had a problem . Not this time , however . I purchased the WP-65 . It worked fine shooting the water through , but there seemed to be only a very weak or a very strong pulse ; therefore , when I wanted it on the medium setting -LRB- # 3 -RRB- , the force was the same as on the high setting . I sent it back and received a replacement which worked beautifully for the first two days . Then , when I filled the resevoir with water , it leaked out the bottom . Faulty gasket , I presumed . When I realized after several attempts that it was indeed the machine and not me , I sent it back again . I have switched to a different brand .
 When it works , it 's great . Unfortunately , we 've already been through three of these units in 3 months . They all worked for about 2-4 weeks then they just stop working . It sounds like the pump is trying to pump but is all jammed up . We did n't clog it with anything and yes , we did our best to prime the pump . I 've never seen a product like this which consistently breaks after 2 weeks . Amazingly bad quality control .
 It worked very good for about 45 days an then dead!DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT !!!
 The Waterpic does the job it was designed to do but it is very noisy and has a cheap sound to it . I would not recommend this product . You may be able to spend a few more dollars to get a much better machine .
 Picture does n't show there is no lid on the device so dust , etc can ge tin the fluid . Would not recommend this item .
 Product was unable to be delivered and returned to sender . I will try to purchase it some place else .
 This is a perfect description of what this product has become and the people who use them . After purchasing two battery charged water piks , the first was an Inter-Plak , and having them both die within weeks , I looked at the comments and found everyone has the same problem . What 's worse is that the nickel cadmium battery ca n't be thrown out without environmental harm , they have to be returned to a qualified dealer . Of course , most people probably do n't do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers , they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that ca n't be safely disposed.I just bought the model that attaches to the shower . Do n't know how it will work out , but it wo n't burn out . It wo n't foul the environment . It does n't use electricity and it wo n't clutter my counter . Its considerably cheaper . It seems like the way to go , does n't it ?
 I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device 's tips quality . The tips are extremely fragile . if the device tips over , they WILL break . Mine broke within 2 days . I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips , that was in December 2010 , and as of today , Feb 13 , 2011 , I have not received the replacement tips . I will never buy another waterpik product .
 I like this product very much when it is operational . However , each of the two that I purchased stopped working after one year of occasional use . The motor simply dies . I am very hesitant to buy another Waterpik product .
 One month after purchasing this Waterpik it would n't pulse water when sliding the selector to higher pressures . It seems as if the pause button was activating at the higher flow .
 I had this model for 10 years before it broke down 2 months ago . I ordered the same model thinking if it lasted 10 years , it 's good enough . Not so . I ca n't get a hard pulse ; only works on the lowest pulsing . I have many caps so I must maintain healthy gums . I wo n't give up on Waterpik , however , so I am ordering the next model up and hoping I have better results .
 We have a 25 year old water pik and a 5 year old one in a different bathroom . Guess which one fails ? The new one . Every time I turn it on , there 's a 90 % chance there 'll just be a buzzing sound . If you bang it against the counter and suck on the hose while it 's buzzing , the motor might start spinning -LRB- or it might not -RRB- . then you can put the reservoir on and do your thing . Other than that major offense , it does what it 's supposed to do .
 I have been using this product for the nth time and was quite satisfied with it until recently when it came in with a new design style . It used to look sturdy and more stable when placed in a countertop , now it is so lightweight , nosier and the material used looks cheap . Even the design has been modified . If i were based in the United States , I could have returned the product but since I have to bring it home with me to my home country , the Philippines , I have no choice but get stucked with it . Frankly , it 's quite a disapointment .
 I thought I would go with the Waterpik name in that I have had their products in the past and got many years of use out of it . This particular model seems to work OK at first but within 60 days the control for the different settings stops working . You have to keep moving it from low to high to try to find one that works . Maybe it works for a day or two but then you have to try another setting.I have gotten this model twice , thinking I got a bad one the first time , but the second one had the same problems.I am a heavy user of these devices , using it twice a day . I would expect it would hold up to this use .
 The hose broke on my first WP-65 within the warranty period . The manufacturer replaced the unit but would n't guarantee the replacement unit . Within three months the handle of the replacement unit lost the ability to hold the piks and they would shoot out of the handle whenever I turned it on , rendering it unusable . I purchased my third WP-65 and within fifteen months the motor/pump seized . As an aside , all units were quiet when new but became excessively noisy within weeks - like a minature jackhammer . Ca n't someone at WaterPik design a high quality and reliable product ?
 Our first waterpik jammed within the first week , and we opened it up and pushed the little gear back in place several times . It would work for a while an then jam again . After a while , it would only last a day or so between breaks , so we took it back for a replacement.The replacement lasted about two months befor it stated jamming too . As well as spraying out around the head and not holding the head.It is loud and bulky , but I have to laugh at the other commenter who tries to get the whole apparatus under the tap -- You can fill the reservoir seperately and place it on the base later.It does feel good to use , but I 'm not sure I can put up with the dismal quality . Can anyone recommend a good competitor ?
 Two of these have failed in two months , both for the same reason - the motor stopped working . I 've used waterpiks for 10 years and never had any problems.It seems as if this company has seriously lowered it 's standards . I will be trying another brand . I suggest you do the same .
 I had the original , and it worked for many year . Did wonders for my gums . I was hoping to get the same quality product . However , after a few months the pump Stopped working .
 I was one of the lucky ones , I got eight months and two weeks use from my Waterpik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet . It works great , for a while . I plan on buying another oral irrigator but definitely NOT a Waterpik brand ! This is also very loud which could be an issue for apartment dwellers .
 I purchased one of these in June 2004 . First one arrived and did n't work out of the box . Amazon was great and replaced it very quickly . Replacement item is now about three months old and has failed . Only used by one adult in the household . I would not recommend this unit . In all fairness I bought a WaterPik unit almost 15 years ago and it lasted until this year , in spite of the fact that it was used by two teen-agers and an adult!The WP-65 seems to be basically JUNK , I can not recommend it to anyone .
 I was overwhelmed by the choices , and selected this model , in part , because of the reasonal price . I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product , but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially , which certainly made sense . However , the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment `` toward the tip '' , which turned out to be the highest , not the lowest setting ! The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening , but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later . The spray was very powerful and actually `` hurt '' , especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink , not in my mouth ! It felt wonderful on the lower setting ! I reread the directions again -LRB- and again over the next several days -RRB- to see if the error was mine or theirs . I still think the directions were not written properly . The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all . This continued for about a week , some days getting more or less , but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING ! My guess is that it was in a permanent `` pause '' mode . I gave up and pursued returning the item . It needed to be returned to an `` authorized repair '' , which luckily was only a few miles away -LRB- there were only three in my state -RRB- . The repair man had told me , over the phone , it was a discontinued model and had n't been made in about a year . When he looked at it , he found it had been made in 2006 . He said he could fix it , but was n't allowed to ; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail .
 I bought this item 8 months ago . All of a sudden , it stopped pumping water . It has a two year warranty . Now , I have the option of shipping it back to the service center or buying another one . I need a water pik , but the postage and the hassle of sending it somewhere is simply not worth it . And the time it will take to get it back . This is how they make their money - they sell you something that is shoddy and give it a two year warranty then they give you no choice but to buy another one because when the time comes to make use of the warranty , the time and expense you have to take to make use of it cancels the benefit . If they gave it a 6 month warranty , I would not had expected so much . A two year warranty led me to believe this is a mugh better product than I thought . It is a sales tactic .
 It worked fine until last week , now the water does not come out right . Where the 2 black things connect , are not making the proper connection , for the water to flow out right . Have been using the product about a month . It is the waterpik water flosser shown here Mrs Jean Walker
 I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A CLEAR ACRYLIC COLOR RATHER THAN BLUE.THIS ONE BROKE AFTER JUST 6 WEEKS OF USE . IT WILL NOT GO FULL FORCE WHICH IS WHAT IS USEFUL TO KEEP MY TEETH CLEAN.THIS IS MY 3RD ONE BOUGHT OVER 30 YEARS . OBVIOUSLY NOT AS WELL MADE AS USED TO BE . VERY DISAPPOINTING .
 This WaterPik lasted less than 60 days and now wo n't cycle water at all . The warranty was only good for 30 days , so I 'm out-of-luck . Do n't buy it or at least buy it at a reputable store when you can return it .
 Okay - I read some reviews stating that the Waterpik Water Flosser was ` loud ' . I had no idea what I was in store for.I live in an apartment . In my opinion , this product is completely unusable for anyone who lives in an apartment . I heeded the noise concerns of other users thinking I would use the Waterpik at an acceptable hour , say 8pm instead of 11pm when I 'm heading to bed . I would say there is NEVER a good time to use the Waterpik ; it 's that loud . If you have any respect for your neighbors , you will not want to use this product at any time . The noise can best be described as a motorcycle idling in your bathroom.Even if it does what it 's supposed to do , I think a one star review is warranted because of this unacceptable flaw . Maybe the noise is unavoidable based on how the motor works , but I do n't think that is a reasonable excuse . In that case , perhaps more R&D ; needs to go into this technology before products are placed on the market . If you still plan to by one , all I can say is be warned , and own a house .
 I purchased this model 1 and a half years ago . It worked really well until this week . The hose split where it enters the hand held end and it sprayed water all over the bathroom until I turned it off . I would have expected it to last longer .
 if i could find a substitute for water pic products , i would do so . they are poorly designed and do n't last long at all . for a personal water pic , it is much too big . i had a personal waterpic a while ago that was small and lasted for quite some time .
 We 've used this model in the past and it started to get very very loud . We thought because it was old . So we took another stab and bought a new one , exact same problem . It was extremely loud that my neighbor would hear it . The hose was shaking vigorously . Without trying a second time , I returned it to the store the next day .
 These Item I purchase on 2/21/07 I used only for 3 week and it broke I do not kwon if I can return or not to have my money back or replace with another
 WATERPIK DOES A GOOD JOB OF CLEANING AFTER 1 YEAR , WATERPIK KEEPS TRIPPING MY GFIC CIRCUIT SO CANT USE ITWROTE TO WATERPIK AND NO REPLY !! DR B
 Yes , that 's right . This worked for me for only one day . What a disappointment .
 I had to return the unit to Waterpik via the local outlet because it was only working intermittently.Waterpik gave me in return a WP60 which makes me think the WP65 wo n't be around for long .
 It never worked ! Now I 'm trying to return it for repairs ...
 This is probably the worst Waterpik Flosser I have ever bought , and so poorly made that it is greatly overpriced . I had a Waterpik Flosser for many years without a problem , using it daily . Recently its hose was so old and worn that it cracked in places and leaked badly , but it did n't owe me a dime ; I think I 've had it for more than 10 years , so I bought this new flosser . Here are my cons :1 . The water container is topless . When you have finished using the flosser you are forced to leave the water tub open to dust , dirt , etc. because no cover was provided .2 . Maneuvering the water container on top of the assembly so that it is tightly in place at the fitting where the water runs through is so difficult to do that I wanted to give up on the whole task . I had to struggle with it to push it down enough times so that it finally seated well enough that after turning the switch on , some water was able to come through the hand flosser tool .3 . The whole assembly is very flimsy . I can not imagine that it will last anywhere as long as my previous sturdy Waterpik Flosser . The water tub does not fit onto the bottom assembly firmly at all , and everything else kind of teeters .4 . When you are finished using the flosser , you have to leave the entire assembly uncovered -LRB- since there is no cover -RRB- , otherwise you have to remove the empty -LRB- I do n't leave warm water in the tub -RRB- tub and perhaps turn it upside down over the assembly over which it does not rest squarely , or store it elsewhere , or cover it with a towel , or whatever . It 's a pain . Then of course when you go to use it the next time , you have to struggle to get the tub seated firmly over the little water outlet again and again .5 . My previous Waterpik had a nice sturdy cover with a little lidded insert in which a number of extra tools could be stored . This one has some apertures that you can place the tool heads in , but they fall out easily . On my previous Waterpik I never needed to cover the tub at all , since after I emptied it , it had its own well-fitting cover .6 . The whole thing tips over easily . I have it on my vanity counter , off to the side , but if I happen to bump it with my arm , it tips over.This purchase was an absolute disappointment . I actually have no pros for this , except that once you get it working , it does the intended job , but by the time I get to that part , the air is pretty blue .
 I have been using waterpik for a long time and I love it . Nothing can give you that clean feeling in your mouth better that water flosser . But I always bought mine from store and this time I decided to buy it on Amazon . It stopped working after 2 months and I ca n't request replacement per Amazon rules . I can send it back on my own expense and get partial refund . I do n't think that is right . But the first two months that it was working , I love it .
 BAD-BAD-BAD PRODUCT EXPERIENCE . THIS IS THE LAST MODEL WATER PIC ; I DO N'T KNOW IF THE 2 EARLIER ONES I USED WERE EARLIER MODELS -LRB- WITH SEVERAL YEARS ' LIFE -RRB- WERE MADE IN CHINA , BUT THIS ONE WAS MADE IN CHINA . IT LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR -- WITHIN WARRANTY . THEY SENT 3 REPLACEMENTS FOR A TOTAL LIFE OF THE 3 A TOTAL OF ONE YEAR MAXIMUM ; AND I RETURNED 2 OF THEM SO THAT MFR . COULD `` INSPECT '' THEM . THEY ALL SEIZED . MFR CLAIMED I SHOULD EXERCISE MORE CARE IN RINSING AND USING . I NEVER RECEIVED THEIR `` INSPECTION '' RESULTS.I FINALLY REPLACED WATER PIC WITH A CONAIR `` INTERPLAK '' -LRB- MADE IN CHINA -RRB- MACHINE WHICH I HAVE BEEN USING OVER 2 YEARS -- RELIABLY !!! -- AT BEDTIME , SAME USAGE PATTERN AS I USED WITH WATER PIC .
 The Waterpik worked fitfully from first use . After three days it quit entirely . Thanks to Amazon we had no difficulty returning it . We replaced it with the ConAir , lower rated but more effective .
 The item seemed to do a very nice job for the short time in which it was operational ; it left my mouth feeling very fresh . However , the motor conked out after 5 days . In some ways , that 's almost a good thing -- it 's twice as easy to return mere days after purchase than if it hung on for a couple of months before dying .
 Hard to get the resevoir to seal and to get the fluid to flow and now the motor runs w/out creating pressure . Get something else .
 I have had another water pik which I wore out . This one did not work AT ALL and I returned it for a refund , because of the hassle of shipping , I chose to buy another locally and that one works just fine .
 It has absolutely NO power -- it 's no where near as efficient as the former , less expernsive , model that I have always used . I hope to exchange it.Thank you for the opportunity to review this product . Joanne Jenks
 Lasted 2 weeks Return for and second one and that lasted 2 weeks . No suction , very loud bought Waterpik ultra water been a month now works great
 This waterpik stopped pumping out water after 5 weeks and used a few times . It is still under a two year warranty . I returned to a local repair shop who told me they do n't repair this equipment but return it to Waterpik who should send me a new one . I do n't expect much reliability from the device . If it was within the 30 day period after shipment I would return it for a refund . Do n't get stuck with this product like I am .
 Ok , I 'm an idiot . My 3rd -LRB- or 4th ? -RRB- Water Pik has given up the ghost after 2 months . The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle ; nothing came out the tip , it all came out in the handle . The latest one leaks water and so it 's obviously an electrical hazard . Every one has only lasted 2-3 months . Amazingly shoddy quality control .
 The WaterPik works much better than floss for me ... when I can actually get it to work . Since the second week I 've had it , it has worked intermittently . After tearing the thing apart , which was no easy task , I discovered that a very small part was not letting water pass through it . After calling WaterPik for a replacement part , I was told that the piece can not be sold individually and that I would have to replace the entire assembly . I decided to continue trying to use it when it worked until it stopped working completely , now because the pause button on the handle is not responding . I have now only had the product for two months and it already needs completely replaced !
 I have used waterpik for years ... the older models lasted a long time . My latest waterpik broke after just two weeks ... the pump stopped working . Prior to that , the waterpik I had lasted one year . I do n't have time to drive 25 miles to the nearest service center and hassle ... I do n't intend to buy any more of these . A friend has an interplak , and it has proved reliable .
 design seems flawed a bit for the container . when you pull the cord out , it bumps the tank off sometimes . the tank also seems a little loose when mounted.i tried the newest Ultra Dental water pik type , but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water .
 Do not buy it ! It is a real POS ... Worked for about 5 minutes . Then the spray stopped dead . Pump started to smell like burning out.There was plenty of water in the tank - and the tank was properly connected.On occasion - a weak spray would come out.Useless Junk.There is a reason for 47 one-star reviews - now 48 . Its going out in the trash tomorrow . If I had n't stupidly thrown out the box , I would have instantly returned it .2 / 3/2013 Update : After my disasterous experience with the WP-65 , I went looking for another Brand - any Brand . . Did n't see anything I liked . There sure is an opportunity for someone to make one of these things that works . . Anyway , I noticed the ` kids model ' WP-260 has far fewer one-star reviews as a percentage . Controls are on the housing itself -LRB- The Pressure control is continuous - not just 1-2-3 . . -RRB- . Maybe the pump is different - as its rated 110-240 VAC . Decided to take a chance - and bought one . -LRB- Saved box this time . . : > -RRB- While the reservoir is smaller - it is sufficient . After four uses - it still works . . more than could be said with the WP-65 . The pump is MUCH quieter . Top pressure may be slightly less than my previous old waterpik -LRB- would no longer hold a nozzle - stated blowing off everytime I used it . . reason for replacement -RRB- - but it is still high.If you - like me - found the WaterPik to be the only design suitable , skip the 65 and get the 260 . Maybe it will at least last a few months . -LRB- I will update again when this one fails ... -RRB- 2/10/2013 - another week , and the 260 is still working ! A minor miracle . .
 I 've been a Waterpik WP-60 user for the last 25 years , and in spite of the fact that I usually had to replace the unit every 4-5 years -LRB- either the hose or the pump wore out -RRB- , I kept going back to it because it did a decent job flossing . So , when my last purchase died a month ago , I went ahead and ordered one with the reasonable expectation that this 2012 edition would be pretty much the same as the older ones . DEFINITELY NOT . Some yahoo at WaterPik decided to cut corners and &#34; improve &#34; on it , and by doing that they totally screwed it up . Waterpik should be ashamed to even put this item on the market . So , what is wrong with the flosser ? The fact that it weighs about half of the old one should 've been the first tell-tale sign that something is going to be messed up . Sure enough , the wattage has gone down to half of what it used to be and consequently there is just not enough pressure to do any decent job . I hate it and am going to return it and feel screwed for even having to pay for shipping it back . I used it only once , but it was once too many . SHAME , SHAME .
 This product has been around for a long time without any essential design or construction changes except that it is now made in China whereas it was originally made in America . Unfortunately , this means that it is held back by substandard design choices.In my personal experience the weak link is the flexible hose between the pump body and the nozzle head . While I can appreciate that it must be both flexible and capable of containing the water pressure created by the pump so the hose materials are crucial . However , the longevity of the hose material is inadequate . I note that some people report getting seven years use , that has not been my experience
 This device gives the same reading to everyone who enters the same height and weight , regardless of their actual body composition . Interestingly , it also asks your age and gender , and completely ignores this information also . It will refuse to calculate unless you touch the `` electrodes , '' but no matter who touches the electrodes , it gives the same result . In other words , it is a simple calculator , disguised as a measuring device . If you are looking for a device that will give consistent results , then you 're in luck . But if you want an actual measurement , you wo n't find it here .
 The very first time I used the lingerie bag for my delicates in the wash , the zipper broke . When I looked closer , I saw that the metal fastener on the right side of the bag was ripped and it caught one of my delicate items . My remaining my delicate items were wrapped around the agitator of the washing machine . I am very disappointed that the lingerie bag did not protect my delicates and that it broke on its very first use .
 I used the bag once and 2 holes developed along the seam allowing clothing out into the rest of the wash . Do n't waste your money . This bag is a piece of junk .
 The first time I washed my delicates in the bag , the zipper broke . I found two of my favorite bras -LRB- that I hand-washed before I tried this bag -RRB- wrapped around the agitator . This bag ruined $ 80 worth of my clothing.I did not read the one review posted on Amazon and I should have . The one other person that had reviewed this product had the same problem as I did.Do not buy this wash bag !
 the only reason i like this is because it reminds me of the smell of my granny 's lipsticks . the colour is not rose - more like a nasty pink . still , so cheap , it 's worth the nostalgia
 Unfortunately these are sized as 8-13 . They will not fit size 12 shoes . The arch is too far back . MAYBE they will fit size 10 okay . I would recommend arch supports that have a more precise sizing .
 this product does not worki went back to walk fit which does workcan i have my 20 $ back
 while not terrible uncomfortable , i find the arch support in the wrong place for my feet ; the support feels too low and too much in the center to properly support my arch . thankfully they have a money-back guarantee , so if you buy them , make sure you keep your receipt , just in case they do n't fit your specific foot .
 I 'd heard great thing from my waxer about this product , but was n't terribly impressed . It is alcohol based , and it makes me think that regular rubbing alcohol could do the same job . Did n't do anything `` magical '' to ingrown hairs , just dried the skin , and kind of brought them to the surface -LRB- same result as rubbing alcohol -RRB- . Okay product , but you might be better off with a home remedy of rubbing alcohol .
 Has n't helped me yet . But still trying . Product got to me fast though , so nothing against the company who shipped .
 blades are dull , have to go over the same area several times for decent results
 Used once , and decided to return it.Pros
 I recommend using ear plugs or ear muffs protection before using the Andis Company 22560 Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Hair Clipper Kit .
 i did n't recieve this item . so No comment can conclude .
 This looks good , and it is packaged well , but the sound quality was terrible . Will probably not use it again .
 I bought this stethoscope so that my grandchild could listen to heartbeats , but it did n't work well at all . We could barely hear anything . I plan to return it .
 This is easily the worst -LRB- WORST ! -RRB- stethoscope I have ever owned . The ear pieces fell off and the acoustics are poor . Do n't be hooked in by the price , this is a piece of junk .
 I have never been so disappointed in an online experience in my life . The supplier , Medex Supply basically are crooks . They sold me a stethoscope that was supposedly brand new . When it came it was in an unsealed box and did not work.There was no auscultation or sound emitted from the bell of the stethoscope whatsoever . When I contacted them , they told me to contact the manufacturer . Medex took my money , and then refused to refund me . I had the stethoscope 1 hour found out the problem and immediately e-mailed them . They took 2 days to respond to say they would contact me in the future , then they contacted me two days later to say contact the manufacturer which was ADC.This was a total waste of my time , and robbery of my money .
 I bought this in addition to a littman cardiology III as a backup and all I can say wow what a night and day difference . The littman is much clearer and louder whereas with this particular stethoscope requires excellent hearing IMO to be used . I say why strain to hear something when all you have to do is take the extra few weeks worth of savings and buy a real stethoscope especially for those who considering a profession in the medical field .
 I use Stethoscope a lot on pt. , but very honestly to comment that the BS quality is not as that good/clear as what others said . Compared to Omron which is much cheaper & more heavier , but I can listen more clear .
 I am a home care nurse and use this frequently during work.I have n't had this stethoscope very long and the ear pieces keep coming off . I have been lucky enough to find them both times but very inconvenient to keep losing them !
 I was sent a ADC 609bk instead of a 603 . still waiting to find out if they can cross ship a replacement .
 I ordered this based on all the good reviews . When I received it I tried it out and could only hear heart sounds very faintly . Have definitley used better , clearer , louder stethoscopes before and this one was practically useless .
 This cane arrived quickly and was packaged carefully.The pros
 This is advertised as being a `` Rapid Release '' formula . However , the product I received is NOT `` rapid release ; '' it 's just the regular 1mg tablets -LRB- useless to me -RRB- . The information in this product listing -LRB- and the product image showing the bottle indicating that it is the `` rapid release '' formula -RRB- SHOULD BE UPDATED NOW , as the 1mg Rapid Release formula has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturer and it seems that Amazon has run out . These REGULAR 1mg Melatonin tablets are available much cheaper elsewhere .
 This product helped me to sleep . But , I then wake up every 30-45 minutes for 2-3 hours . It 's happened several times , and I did n't connect my usage of this product with the strange sleeping patterns until it happened repeatedly . Never had the problem the other brands . Tossing the remainder .
 This stuff wo n't suppport your back and it does n't stay on the lower back , it keeps running up and down while I wear it , end up return this item .
 We love the idea of Seventh Generation and what it 's stands for . We are horribly disappointed with the performance of the detergent . We had to run the dish washing cycle twice and it was still dirty . We thought our relatively new dishwasher was broken . There were stains that did n't go away until we switched to a different detergent -LRB- Electrosol -RRB- . We will continue to purchase other Seventh Generation products except for their dishwasher detergents .
 I 've been buying Zone Perfect Fudge Graham bars for years . They were a little bigger and more chewy than these new ones but they tasted great . However , the new ones I purchased -LRB- March 2007 -RRB- are horrible . Like others have said they taste artificial . I think the chocolate they use has changed and is now too sweet.I guess Abbott Labs -LRB- who bought Zone Perfect in July 2003 -RRB- was n't making enough money on the original formula .
 It smelled like old , stale coffee mixed with too strong vanilla . It was waaayyyy too oily and I felt like I needed a shower after putting it on .
 I purchased this item because I needed extra protein after Bariatric surgery . I had tried other types of protein replacement in the powder and liquid form . I was expecting a thin liquid solution that coud be mixed in juice or water . What I got was a thick , awful smelling liquid that tasted equally bad . This product should come with a disclaimer ... disgusting !!!!!!! Could n't get past the smell to taste anything cherry-like .
 The taste is not good , leaves an after taste , I do not recommend it . You have to hold your nose when you take it .
 I was shocked to see Propylene Glycol in the ingredients . This is a cancer causing solvent that scientist Hulda Clark has found to be present in the majority of cancer patients . Propylene glycol is used in anti freeze for cars . According to the latest scientific studies , propylene glycol is as deadly as benzene and both solvents cause cancer even in small amounts . Unfortunately , scientists recent studies on the effects in the human body shows that propylene glycol builds up in the body even if ingested in very low quantities . The reason for the build up is that the liver takes five days to detoxify propylene glycol , after a person stops ingesting it . So , if someone is ingesting it on a daily basis , this burden on the liver allows propylene glycol to build up in the body to toxic levels . Also , the presence of this solvent burdens the liver so much that it can not rid the body of parasites . Many scientists believe this is a major cause of cancer ... parasites and solvents in the body.Update
 I have eczema on my hands -LRB- fingers only really -RRB- that is usually spurred on my stress and takes a long time to heal.I bought this on here due to the good reviews but it actually worsened by eczema and burned upon application . I was in denial that the new cream was causing this and continued to apply for about 5 days while my spots got worse and worse.I stopped using this and applied pure aloe for a while which helped to reduce the pain and redness by a lot , but did n't clear the spots to normal condition . I use this cream on my legs as regular lotion as to not waste it . It works decently well for that purpose , but so would a $ 1.50 tub of vaseline.The search for a good eczema product continues ... -_-
 I have psoriasis on my face . It was diagnosed by a dermatologist earlier this year . I have been usingPsoriasin Psoriasis Relief , Multi-Symptom , Topical Ointment , 4 oz.ever since the diagnosis . It was working well at first , but the effectiveness is falling off a bit , so I switched to this for a week to see if it would work better.Unfortunately , this did not work better . I do like that it does not smell funny , it does not sting , it did not make my face redder or my psoriasis worse , but it did not make any improvements , either . After the third day of using this , all the scaliness and redness came back , exactly like what happens when I stop using the psoriasin for three days.I 'm giving this two stars because it does not work for me . I ca n't say `` it 's okay '' which is the definition of a three star review , because it is not okay in terms of actually improving my psoriasis . It makes no difference . But I am grateful that at least it was not super-expensive and it did not make my face look worse .
 This cream did not provide relief for my excema , which is centered around my neck area . I have had excema -LRB- dermatitis -RRB- off and on for years , but it has become chronic since a particularly bad period for my hay fever allergies last October . I have no medical insurance , so have been hunting for an over the counter remedy .
 I really like Derma-E products and have had great experiences using the various creams and serums . I have tried the Psorzema creme a few times in the hopes that maybe it would help at some point but , unfortunately , it has n't . On it 's own , it barely moisturizes my skin , much less help my eczema . Maybe I have to use more but it 's pretty expensive for the size . It works better in combination with another lotion/creme but does n't work any better with the body wash of the same name . I would n't judge other Derma-E products based solely on this one though .
 This does not work well , at all , and it is the piece of junk I see at dollar stores . I was swayed by all the great review but buyer beware .
 I purchased this product from another site , but it 's the exact same product . I left a review there , but I want to leave one here too . This would be a great product if it was made better . This lasted two uses for me , and then the red brush part detached . No , I was n't trying to remove back from a tree or anything , just lint and pet hair from my clothes and futon . Save your money , do n't buy this product . Buy the sticky rollers , or -LRB- I ca n't vouch for this but -RRB- 3M has a brush , I 'm going to try that instead . If that does n't work it 's back to sticky rollers . .
 I was hopeful that this brush would work like a charm due to positive reviews , but unfortunately , it just does n't do a well enough job on my wool coat . I have bought 99 cent lint brushes that have worked just as well as this brush . It just does n't do a good job of removing pet hair and other lint from my coat .
 Piece of crap . It broke the first day I used it . The red felt separated from the plastic handle . I was sent a new one , but the quality on this thing is sub par . Do not buy it .
 Wow , what a horrible item . I did not purchase this through Amazon , but at another retailer . On its FIRST use , the fabric part of the brush separated from the actual plastic holder . The fabric is not secure AT ALL . And it is pieced into the plastic holder , a separate piece on front and back , so that both sides can easily become separated from the holder . Never purchased something this useless before . To make matters worse , there was no way to re-attach the fabric back into the `` teeth '' of the holder , so it was tossed into the garbage . Why are n't companies held liable for selling worthless items ?????? Yes , I am angry .
 As far as removing white lint from dark clothing , cotton sweats , the majik brush flat does n't work . It does n't even get close . So save your money . It does n't even deserve one starI 'm returning it out of spite even thou it will cost more than the refund I 'll get back
 The title says it all . It does n't do anything except act as a lube .
 If you want to believe all the hype go ahead and order this product . I did and have been using it since around February of this year after experiencing a bad reaction from Lescol XL -LRB- 80 mg . -RRB- . My total cholesterol was around 226 and LDL -LRB- bad -RRB- about 142 when I first started on it . I recently had my blood work up and the numbers were very discouraging : Total cholesterol now 246 -LRB- almost 9 % increase ! -RRB- and LDL now 173 -LRB- nearly 22 % increase ! . My HDL -LRB- good -RRB- has increased , but that my be due to a Niacin tablet -LRB- 500 mg -RRB- I take each day . Ironically , I also used a Home Access cholesterol kit within an hour of my lab work to compare the results . The kit 's results showed around 135-140 ! Talk about being off ! I 'll give that product a review elsewhere.I 've been taking it for approximately 9 months now . I plan to utilize their money back policy -LRB- limit to only 3 bottles worth -RRB- . Only I tossed out every box -LRB- need UPC label -RRB- except for the present box -LRB- who would save all those boxes ? -RRB- Therefore , save your money and try a lower dose doctor recommended statin drug if you must . I would rather not go back on them , but it looks like I may have no other choice .
 It might be ok for shingles during the outbreak , but not for phn . Do n't buy it for that .
 I was so impressed with the claims on the box and the scientific knowledge they seemed to indicate that I bought this for $ 36 instead of what I usually buy -LRB- Solar Ray Super Digest Away for ~ $ 16 -- I am also using Betaine HCL routinely now -RRB- but so far I ca n't detect if this product helps at all.I was feeling similarly confused about the Super Digest Away -- which was a turning point product for me it seemed for a time , compared to the more powerful but maybe a little scary Betaine , the Digest Away seemed neglible in it 's effects . But this product seems very neglible given the claims the labels make . I am disappointed . It was a big purchase for me.Maybe I 'm just going thru a bad digestion phase and not feeling the benefit ?? I note that two others here had outright BAD experiences , so I 'm dubious about this product . And the claims had really given me hope ! : -LRB-
 These are supposed to increase your metabolism & clean out your digestive system . They really did NOTHING but bind me up . Amazon VERY GOOD about returns & got my money back .
 I am a huge fan of Garden of Life products . I take the the Perfect Food super green supplements everyday and I attribute many positive health benefits directly to them . Because of my happiness with their other products I thought I would give this one a try . Wow that was a big mistake ! within a few hours of taking just one of these as directed , I had the worst heartburn I have ever had in my entire life . I was then up all night as my body to put it politely rejected this and everything else it contained ... I was basically out of commission until these `` enzymes '' had completely been flushed out , and with them went what I can only imagine were many of the natural enzymes my body already had . The most notable side effect is that though I have always been very mildy lactose intolerant -LRB- I can eat cheese , cooked dairy , cottage cheese , yogurt , cup or less of milk at a time -RRB- I am now unable to consume even the smallest amount of any dairy product without having hours of stomach cramps -LRB- which I never used to have -RRB- . Im sure there are some other side effects I havent noticed , and im guessing as time goes on I will once again be able to eat dairy and everything else will be back to normal , but I would STRONGLY suggest you use extreme caution . Though this may be an isolated event specific to me and my body , or some kind of allergic reaction , if it happened to me it can most definitely happen to you.I will continue to take my other Garden of Life products , and search out other new supplements . but oh man was this a bad idea . additionally I have the feeling amazon wont accept a return on this , so I am out $ 30 ...
 I like Amazon because I like to read the reviews and this product seemed to have glowing reviews . I have many foods that I can not eat , including dairy and I was hoping that adding enzymes would solve the problem . I took these one pill a day for a whole week , WITHOUT changing me diet to see how my body reacted . I was running to the bathroom everyday . I stopped taking the pills and I was back to normal . These pills made me sicker than if I had eaten my `` problem '' foods . I understand everyone is different but I was extremely disappointed .
 I am allergic to dairy cow food , and got severe allergy after taking this . The ingredients do not say it has dairy . I emailed Garden of Life ; they said the dairy is fermented.I think they should have been more specific about it . I would never buy any product from Garden of Life anymore .
 Be fair warned that digestive enzyme product has given me severe urinary tract burning . It contains turmeric and ginger . Q-Zyme by Garden of Life should be avoided . It is a horrible product .
 I 've tried the Schweta brand of henna a few times over the course of my career as a henna artist , and it has always disappointed me . It 's very easy to find a tube for under $ 5 at most Indian grocery stores.Mixing your own henna is a much better way to go . Buying this kit might be a bit useful so that you can see what consistency the paste has , so you can keep that in mind when making your own .
 This product was horrible . The paste that was pre made was too thick and did n't even stick to my skin . It did n't come with a applicator for the paste you have to make on your own . Waste of time and money .
 A total waste of money Did absolutely nothing . See your doctor and save money . See your urologist and obtain prescrpition medication .

 I have never received my package of Mach 3 blades for which I was charged . When I contacted the supplier . they assured me that they had shipped the item . I was given the choice of receiving a credit or an expedited shipment . I requested that they reship the item . I was provided with an internet tracking number which , when contacted , assured me that the item had been shipped and delivered . This is my first truly negative experience with an Amazon ordered item .

 Had a flare up and ordered this product after reading all the good reviews . It 's amazing what you will try when you 're in this psuedo state of missery . By the time it arrived I think I was about over the hump and going back the other way . First application was very cool for about 15 seconds . After having it on for about a minute it started itching . After two minutes I had to wipe it off with Tucks pads . Tried it again the next day with the same results . This time I tried to leave it on for over 30 minutes . Could not tolerate the severe itching any longer and had to wash it off in the shower . Days after the application the hemorrhoids got bad again and started going back the other way.Did not notice any pungent smell . Makes me wonder how quality assurance is at the manufacturer . How can some people complain about the smell and mine had no significant odor ? This makes me wonder if some people got a &#34; good &#34; batch while myself and others did not.Buy at your own risk . Mine went in the trash .
 After reading all the positive reviews , I was hopeful this would help . Not true ! I put it on before bed and it burned like crazy . It was so strong I felt my heart racing and could n't sleep . After about an hour it still had n't stopped stinging so I had to rinse it off . I had to useBoiron Avenoc Suppositories , 12 suppositories -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- to soothe the area . I tried it once more the next day with the same result . Not only was it unpleasant to use , but the smell was sickening . I had to take my garbage out to the bin as it lingered all over the room . I could n't imagine using this stuff before work ! I have my doubts about some of these 5-star reviews being legitimate . Several are similar in tone and language , using plays on words and instructing people what products to use in great detail . I have been shopping on Amazon for years and they do n't look real to me . Buyer beware !
 During a particularly horrible flare up , I went looking for anything to help and purchased these along with fargelin pills . The over the counter stuff and witch hazel were giving me no relief and I already eat a diet of mostly plants and whole grains along with lots of water . These just arrived today -LRB- 12 days after ordering -RRB- It indeed does have a nice cooling feel . After one application I googled the ingredients . # 1 synthetic musk : can accumulate in human bodies , are potential hormone disruptors and may break down the body 's defenses against other toxic chemical exposures # 2 Synthetic bezoar
 I did n't like this product at all . I read reviews complaining about the bad smell , but I had so much pain that I said how bad could it be ? Boy I was wrong , It smells like hell.i could n't be around people , and worse of all the relief lasted for a few minutes for me it was n't worth it . I ended up using preparation H suppositories and the wipes . that gave me relief fast . But the best for me are the fargelin tabletsHigh Strength Fargelin 36 Tablets , Preparation H Medicated Hemorrhoidal Wipes with Witch Hazel and Aloe , 48-Count Refill Packages -LRB- Pack of 4 -RRB- , Preparation H Hemorrhoidal Suppositories -LRB- 48 count -RRB-
 China products should have a warning label on them . They are not controlled . Remember the pet food deaths . Remember the baby formula deaths . Remember the drywall in the south.It shows Chinese writing in the pic of the package .
 I found this product and read all the miraculous reviews and decided to try it . When you order you get three small tubes of product . I have finished one tube and have not seen the results some others have -LRB- according to their review -RRB- . The smell of it is n't bad as some have noted . I 'm going to continue and will update . It is better than Preparation H. I do n't know how the stay in business.UPDATE
 Please understand that the only reason I am giving a 1 star rating here is to draw attention to my review . I have had a history with hemorrhoids and anal fissure for about 30 years . I have tried Preparation H and Anusol in the past as a temporary relief . When I found this product on Amazon , I jumped and ordered both the cream and the suppositories . I used the cream as a lubricant to insert the suppository . After trying the product , I was very pleased and ordered 10 sup boxes that I used whenever I had a `` flare up '' . I still have 4 unopened boxes . But few months ago , I developed an abscess or infection in the `` fissure area '' that eventually translated into a fistula . I am not claiming here that the Mayinglong product is for sure the cause of the infection . However , having lived for thirty years with the fissure and hemorrhoid and then developing a fistula after I started using this product makes one wonder if it has something to do with it . Again , if I were to write this review within a couple of weeks after receiving and using the product , I would have given it a 5 star rating . Now , with this questionable side effect , I am no longer sure and this is food for thought . i just hope I am the only case with this side effect , and therefore I will have the tendency to not incriminate the product .
 OK - only read the positive reviews . Just tried it . The smell is bad but that 's not the problem . It burns like crazy - had to rinse it off . Will be throwing the rest out . Try at your own risk , should have read the negative reviews first .
 This product is absolutely an scam , it does not do anything . i tried other products and they did helped . but not this . trusting those fake reviews and buying this product is just waste of money and time .
 I am very surprised at the overwhelmingly positive reviews . I have not been overly impressed . Yes the product is cooling but that is where it stops . The smell is very strong and musky , so strong in fact that I 'm self conscious to use it if I am going out in public . Also , the packaging is entirely in Chinese -LRB- god only know what we are really rubbing on our butts ! -RRB- , and if you read through the reviews , there is no consensus on what color and consistency it is supposed to have - again , not a confidence builder . It all makes me dubious about these miracle reviews .
 I have been dealing with chronic hemmorroids for years . Based on the H Miracle ebook and the positive reviews ... thought why not , right ?!! WRONG !!! Big mistake . It did just the opposite . My prolapse hemm flared up even more ... looked like a huge pink donut ! Not the mention the terrible burning sensation and the medicine taste in my mouth . Not sure what that was about . It truly frightened me so I looked at the ingredients . The first thing I read was `` synthetic '' . If this what people want to shove up their A. . then go right ahead . Not for me ... I 'll go back to my natural remedies .
 I bought this product about a month ago -LRB- through Amazon -RRB- after reading all the glowing reviews . Fortunately , by the time it arrived , the episode cleared up and I did n't need to use it at that time . Fast forward to last night , I had another episode with severe pain . I remember I had the ointment and applied it . It is like the reviews say
 This product actually aggravated the condition making it a lot worse . If you read the warnings on the label , it actually warns about discontinuing use when this happens so obviously it is not the solution for everyone .
 Used it for a week . Caused a great deal of pain which continued even after I stopped using the product .
 It does initially have a cooling affect but then does n't seem to do anything at all . I prefer over the counter cooling gels.I also use baby ointments and they seem to help more .
 Well ... I 'm very worried , because i ordered this zippo , and you sent me , one of the world poker tour , but not this one , and that 's not what i askedPlease , i really want this zippo , and that does n't deserve a good rate from me , at least answer me to know why did you sent me something that i did n't ordered
 It works , but barely holds together and you have to REALLY play with it to get it to work.Really shoddy manufacturing .
 I can not get the stand to adjust to the right hight , or any height.It will not catch . The metal poles will not tighten . .
 I purchased two , thinking I could give one to my mom . I go it in the mail and opened it up , the first one was missing a part and I could n't set it up . The second one had all the parts , but was not able to hold the weight of my dryer . I was not happy and had to pay $ 20 + to return it . If you are going to buy this at least keep the box it comes in so you can return it .
 This stand does not stay in position . It is very cheap and not worth the money I paid . The part that is suppose to hold the hair dryer is very weak.The stand itself falls over at the slightest touch . The pole does not stay in the long position and is very hard to adjust . Please do n't waste your money . Wish I would have read the reviews before buying .
 This junky apparatus fell apart in less than 2 months . The plastic clips that hold the dryer snapped off on the first uses . That was the end of it standing up on its own . After that I used the velcro to hold the dryer but it slipped off over and over . I am now shopping for a better one . Do n't waste you money on this one !!
 This stand was not worth buying . It does not screw from the middle properly , so the top part of the stand continuously falls without support . Also the screws given were not adequate and the stand was always shaky and wobbly . The hairdryer fit fine in the upper clamp part , however , the stand is very cheaply designed and did not do the job at all . Would NOT recommend .
 People buy products like this because they 're more rugged than putting a sock over the outlet pipe to filter lint out of the water and keep the sink from getting clogged . The only problem is the mesh is still too large , so lint still clogs the sink .
 You have to check the filter often or you can get an overflow can cause damage . The potential water damage outweigh the benefits for me .
 The holes on this filter are absolutely huge compared to the lint coming out of my washer and clogging the utility sink . A Nylon stocking with zip-tie works best , but needs to be changed at least once per month or else it gets too clogged and then gets pushed off . I tried a Nylon stocking inside of this , but it just made the water shoot everywhere .
 The lint trap or filter was not what was described in the amazon write up . The traps were so large that putting on our washing machine hose would have been a problem .
 The ties included with this did not hold it in place . Eventually I got it to stay on and it did the job well and caught a bunch of lint until a few weeks later it fell off the hose and plugged up the drain in the washer drain tub and flooded the basement . So if you use this make sure you are standing by the washer when the water drains through it .
 What a waste of money this was . The brace runs about 7 sizes to small no matter what size you order and it has very little support and is very hard to get on and off .
 I am not sure when the odorless part starts -LRB- after ingesting ???? -RRB- because I am afraid to try taking it now that I have received it and smelled it . I bought it and opened it , so now I ca n't return it . I am out of a good bit of money and I could n't choke down one of these caps if I tried . They stink something fierce . I am pretty frugal and pretty adventuresome , however in this case I am afraid if I take these caps I will stink like they do . I have a job dealing with the public , and do not want to offend my family or pets either , so I will have to take a loss on this product . Buyer beware ! If I could give lower than 1 star I would .
 I 've been taking krill supplements for well over a year . I decided to try TwinLabs Cardio Krill Oil seeing it was on sale and it just does n't compare to other krill oil I have had . . same dosage etc. . Also in most stores to buy otc it 's almost $ 40 ! Amazon had a great price but it 's not worth it even at a discount . The capsules smell and my hands need to be washed afterwards because they stink from touching the capsules . I question the quality because I do n't feel that sense of `` lift '' & well being that I did with other krill oil supplements . I will now only purchase Source Naturals Krill Oil , it is an excellent quality product , small capsule and zero smell , plus they list the content of astaxanthin which is found in krill oil and not even mentioned on the Twin Labs Cardio Krill . Do n't waste your money , or if you did try Source Naturals Arctic Krill , it 's amazing !!
 Thought I was cleverly saving a few bucks buying this over the Schiff product I used prior to this , but this is of VERY questionable quality to my senses ... so much so in fact that I do n't even trust this product enough to try ingesting even one of these into my body . Product is strongly foul-smelling upon opening bottle , enough so that it makes me question the quality of the oil inside . Additionally , gel caps are all oily EXTERNALLY , which they obviously should not be , which makes me question production quality of this product even more . Never had these problems with other krill or fish oils tried before . Should have known better , as twinlab is notorious for selling one-off quality products at one-off level prices ... and I suppose there is a big enough customer base for them to thrive on ... but to me that does n't really equal good value since their products are clearly inferior the overwhelming majority of the time . Mine went right in the trash . .
 Never got the product , they took my money and I never heard anything again ! I ca n't stress enough , DO NOT , DO NOT , DO NOT buy from them ! The worst !
 THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT QUAILIFY FOR A RATING !!!!!! It just does not work . I was looking for a lil extra power and I just did not see a difference at all ! do n't buy it ! Read the reviews before you buy ! I read them after I purchased and did want to believe what I had read ! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY , DO N'T BUY IT!Herbalife has other great products except this one !! I had to give the product one star b/c the system would not allow me to advance or proceed w / the review , but it 's not worth the one star !!! L.S.ThomasWest Chester , Pa. .
 These flavors smell and taste good , but it 's extremely sticky on the skin . I would n't recommend this product . You want a massage oil that is smooth and can remain on the skin for a period of time .
 they do not taste good , and they do not get warm like it says . I waste my money on this junk again .
 This product is a very thin piece of plastic that has an adhesive backing . Because it does have an adhesive backing , it is impossilbe to get rid of the hundreds of pin drops or larger size air pockets by squeezing the bubbles out since they are trapped by the adhesive surrounding them and if you accidently touch the adhesive side you have a fingerprint mark , and any small lint gets trapped and impossible to remove . There is no way to move the air pockets to the edge . An ill conceive concept . Oh , by the way made in China .
 I bought after seeing all the rave reviews and featured everywhere . Used in shower once . I find it was fine for with someone else . BUT using alone -LRB- not in shower -RRB- , it really hurts the crown of your head -LRB- glans penis -RRB- for an uncut penis .
 It has extremely greasy feel to it and it is way too slippery.Not that much pleasant experience.Feel like diesel and even light washing with soap is n`t good enough , to get rid of it.Most women do n`t like it . Stick with water based especially if your women is self conscious . Best Yet is `` Baby Lotion '' and you ` ll not be disappointed .
 It works . It 's okay . I will probably buy a different silicone lube next time -LRB- pjur -RRB- , if only for the bottle . I think it 's a little thinner and not quite as nice as the other brand of silicone I 've used , but honestly just opening this badly designed bottle is a buzzkill and I have n't closely compared the contents of the bottle.This 8.9 oz bottle is awkward and messy to use . The stuff dribbles out , inevitably smearing the bottle , and it 's difficult to control the amount . Oops , too little . Oops , too much . Messy and bleh . Once that hassle is over , it works fine .
 I bought these in Ivory . For the 20-30mmHg compression they claim to be , they 're not . PLUS that silicone band that they have for the thigh is a joke . My stockings ended up at my knees half way into my shift . They 're expensive but they look and feel cheap . The worst is that the medical supply -LRB- Surgical World , Hollywood , FL -RRB- where I bought them from , said that they have never heard any complaits . Well , there 's a first time for everything . I do not recommend these . I should 've followed my gut instinct and spend my money on another pair of Truform surgical weight .
 I received this item and was disappointed big time . It has very little scent , and part of the cologne content was missing . It was not filled up to the top . It made me feel cheated . This company has had this same type of complaint leveled against it before . I can see why now . Do n't buy unless you want to waste your money . Tuccni is n't a good company .

 In my never ending quest to kick the habit - I started on the patches . My first run to the store I boughtNicoDerm CQ STEP 1 - 3 Week Kit - 21 Clear Nicotine Patchesand though those patches were gunky and incredibly itchy - it never occured to me to smoke while I was using them . I went to the store to buy my second box and they did n't have them.So I noticed that not only did they have this brand , but they were cheaper by about ten bucks . So I bought a box . First of all the patch itself is much more attractive -LRB- a round flesh colored circle -RRB- and second of all - they do n't itch or coat you in gunk.The problem is that you might as well buy a pack of stickers and cover yourself with them . There is NO nicotine relief to be felt in these patches . I do n't know if in their attempt to make the patch more comfortable they prevented the nicotine from entering your system or what - but they do n't work . At all . In fact I think I 've smoked MORE since sticking these stupid things on . I 'll be back to the nicoderm next week when they get them in the local store . Those actually helped with the cravings .
 It has everything we need a vitamin but my two year old will not take it . The taste is awful , I taste everything I give my daughter .
 I have no idea how good or bad this stuff is because neither my child nor myself can get past the very strong flavor . It is a bit like drinking straight tart cherry juice .
 The most popular competing products have more 500mg of krill oil per softgel , while Twinlab only has 300mg . For example , Jarrow has 75mg EPA and 45 mg DPA , while the Twinlab only has 45 mg EPA and 27 mg DPA .
 The previous reviewer is correct . Twin Labs is a blend of Krill and other stuff so you get less than the other brands . Be sure you get NKO Krill , the quality of other sources is quite variable at this point . The name brands , such as Jarrow , Now , all use NKO Krill , which is a patented process . The only concern is how old it is . Check the expiration date .

 first of all , this product does not look like it does in the picture as it does in person . -LRB- it is lacking the the white wand with the on and off switch -RRB- . It is very difficult to set up onto a shower head and once it is set up , the stream is so small and strong it 's like a power washer ! thus hurting more than pleasuring.Also , it has an option to switch from your regular shower head to the love jet so you do n't have to take it off and put it back on every time you use it , which sounds like a good idea , but who wants that unsightly thing hanging from your shower head every day ... what if your mother comes to visit !? This product is a good idea , that just was n't well thought out , and definitely not worth the trouble .
 Picture of Advertised Product is deceptive as it is not a true picture of the Lovejet for Shower -LRB- it is a picture of the original Lovejet for attaching to a faucet and not to a shower -RRB- .

 Northern Tool and Equipment is a horrible seller that made a complete mess of this deal and never had the decency to respond to my concern -LRB- the product was damaged , not delivered and they never even responded -RRB- . DO NOT BUY FROM THESE CREEPS !!!!

 I recently purchased this item because of the previous reviews and the fact it was suppose to be downloadable to a PC . In fact , after purchasing it I found it came with neither software nor cable . Lumiscope 's website , copyright 2001 , claims Fox International is the vendor of parts and accessories for Lumiscope products . Fox International does have a Lumiscope product webpage claiming `` No products available at this time ... '' . The page was copyrighted in 2005 . After contacting the customer service departments from both companies , I was given excuses of software not being available now or in any immediate future and the same for the cables . From my personal experience , this is not `` brain surgery '' level programming . While the 1134 has potential , if you are looking for computer interface capability , go elsewhere . Personally , without this capability , you can probably get just about all else from a less expensive meter . It would have been far better if the manufacturer had been honest to begin with instead of engaging in bait and switch . None of the Lumiscope product line are currently PC capable or have any identifiable data cable .
 This piece of medieval torture equipment was rated fairly highly , and had some bells and whistles that intrigued me . I had been using a ReliOn Two-channel BP cuff , but it finally gave up the ghost , so I decided to try this monstrosity . This instrument goes at least 30 mm above the last detected heartbeat , with standard stops at 176 , 206 , and 236 mm . So , after a stressful day , if one 's BP has risen to , say , 165 mm , the machine will inflate to 206 mm , or maybe even , just to be sure , to 236 mm . My particular cuff deflates at a rate of approximately 1 - 2 mm per second , so the extra pressure requires at least an extra 15 seconds of loss of circulation to the hand , with accompanying discomfort . On these occasions the total time of blood restriction is -LRB- 236 mm - 75 mm / 2mm/sec = 40 sec . -LRB- or more -RRB- -RRB- Since it is now recommended that one take 3 readings to average them out , this means a total of well over two minutes without blood flow , and with accompanying discomfort . On one occasion the thing went to 236 , and returned a reading of 128/68 . That 's a lot of unnecessary loss of circulation.I have since replaced this piece of @ # @ $ % ^ with another ReliOn , which also gives me dual channel , irregular heartbeat and averaging , without the discomfort , and with much better accuracy and consistency . Admittedly , it also goes 30 mm above the last detected pulse , but it deflates at the rate of around 6 mm per second , so there 's no discomfort at all .
 Until the warranty expired it was fairly reliable with an occasional error message . All I get now are error messages .

 On a 1 hour hike by a stream , we had to reapply this several times . My pre-schooler , who has pollen allergies , sneezed rapid fire for quite a while after each application . I wanted something natural and may have continued using this despite the need to reapply , if it were n't for the sneezing .
 I 'm in DC for a while and enjoy a cigar and a drink on the balcony . Gave it an honest try , but it did not work . Got more bites with it than without .

 Followed the directions carefully for quite a long time . They are a bit large to have to take 3 at once . But the real issue is that they did nothing for me . No notable change in any aspect of my body . I expected to at least feel a little perkier and maybe have my nails grow better . But &#8230; nothing . Why bother ?

 I took a stab that it would provide more workout energy but neither my wife nor I noticed any difference .
 i am sure this might be good for some one else but every time i took a capsule i got an upset stomach
 Ordered from this company and NEVER received the order . They claim is was delivered on a day I was home all day and refuse to resolve the issue . They do not respond to emails , calls etc. . Ordering from this company is worst than gambling . You have a 99 % chance of getting ripped off !
 This product expired two months after I received it , allowing me to use only around half of what I purchased .
 The new version of Glide floss is not what it used to be . The taste is unctuously sweet and it now breaks more easily . Why does Crest insist on messing with success ? Its toothpastes , like this new version of floss , are sickeningly sweet . Is Glide still made using the original Goretex material ? It does n't seem so -- now it 's just expensive floss tape ruined by marketing overkill .
 Crest bills their Deep Clean Cool Mint Floss as being more comfortable than other floss and providing a `` cooling blast of clean feeling . '' On these counts , I can agree . Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable , making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers . The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses . And there is a pleasant cool , minty feeling left behind wherever you 've cleaned.But ... It 's the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores , and even on Amazon . And Crest 's claims of being `` shred resistant '' fall short . My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package , and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece . To be fair , I have n't yet had it shred in the course of flossing , but the fact you ca n't even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding does n't inspire confidence . At the price premium Crest is demanding , I 'd expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece .
 Purchased this product in February and went to place a follow-up order and the price had increased almost $ 25.00 since then . Sheesh .
 As the other reviewer mentioned , it does have more of a coconut smell than the other 2 I bought , but it has an off taste to it that the others do not . Reading about coconut oils , someone mentioned the gag factor . I had no idea what they were referring to until I tasted this . NOW 's a good name , but they fell short here . You 'd be better off with Jarrow or Nutiva , similar price , better taste ...
 This oil has a rancid , off-putting odor that smells NOTHING like coconut , more like yeast . It also has a TERRIBLE taste . DO NOT BUY !!! I consume a jar of coconut oil a week because I take it as a supplement and cook with it . Jarrow , Spectrum , Nutiva , Vitacost and Swanson are MUCH better . Their coconut oils smell really good with a fresh , coconut scent and taste great too.I was surprised because I use other NOW products and am happy with them . The quality , judging by my experience & others ' , is that this may just be a faulty jar but the quality is n't consistent . I do n't see bad reviews from the other oils I use & I have never had a bad batch from the others I have mentioned .
 Despite my bottle saying it does n't expire until 2014 , the moment I opened the lid and safety seal I was assaulted by a horrific smell . I assume the oil must be rancid because it 's almost an indescribable smell ... sort of yeast-like , definitely nothing coconut-like at all . I usually like NOW 's products and they seem to have good quality control , but maybe something went wrong with the coconut oil capsules ...
 As a frequent NOW customer , I was surprised at the poor quality of their coconut oil . It was yellow , cloudy , and smelled so rancid that I did n't dare eat it . NOW usually sells good products , so maybe I just got a rare bad batch of coconut oil - who knows ? I think I 'll stick with Nutiva organic VCO , which has never disappointed me .
 Dont waste your money . You will get better results by just adding regular coconut oil to your diet . This didnt work like I thought it would .
 I would not recommend this to any women how is small down there , and was highly uncufderbol .
 The product was not even sent until I complained - after the appropriate waiting period . Then I found that it was an inferior product . -LRB- I later got another pair from elsewhere that was made much differently , even though both were made by Heelbo .
 Each dose contains only 16 mg of chlorophyll ... ridiculously low . Take about 6 of these pills and you 'll be where one of the competitors ' products are at . Unfortunately , the product does n't advertise its dosage on this page . Hopefully this helps .
 SO so . The oil is ok but it does not have a pleasant smell . Kind of like the scents used in a public bathroom .
 Very comfortable to wear , but the sleeve kept slipping off my pinky toe . I was disappointed , but maybe I just have really skinny pinkies ?
 My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters . These toe sleeves did not work for me . They slipped off the toe , they were not comfortable . After trying it for about a week I threw them out.I found a better solution that works for me . I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formula - .45 ozto put between my toes . They now glide against it each other rather than rub , and I do n't have any blisters.This saved me a lot of pain , I wish I knew of it earlier . I hope this solution will help someone else with a similar problem.Ali Julia review
 The little toe sleeves fit very poorly , if at all , and do not provide any protection for the toe . They also come off very easily if you are wearing socks .
 I develop blisters on the bottom of my toes when I run long distances . For an upcoming marathon , I decided to try these out to see if it would add more cushion so that my toe would n't hurt as much . Big mistake . Only a few miles into a practice run , it felt like my toe was going to explode . I ended up taking off the toe sleeve and my toe felt better without it than with it .
 I started using Crest Pro-Health night toothpaste in January . By Feb I had developed a pronounced discoloration on my teeth , particularly between teeth . It looked like I chewed tobacco . I tried brushing harder , flossing more and mouthwashes , but it continued to get worse . I went to my regular dentist appt expecting to be told my teeth were rotting away . Much to my relief my dentist was able to remove most of it . It has be be scrapped off . She suppected it was a stannous fluoride rinse , but my rinse was ok , it was the toothpaste . This is a horribe product .
 This toothpaste tastes terrible . The mint flavor is the worst . Cinnamon is still pretty bad but slightly better than the mint .
 Before you buy this product be aware that it is non returnable even if it was only removed from the boxto see this it was too small . Poor customer service since it tooks days to reach somebody byemail or phone . Told absolutely '' no '' to all their products for returns . The item was xxlarge andwould n't fit a child . Once I filed a complaint , then I received an email that there was possibly a wayto return the item if I was willing to jump through the following hoops . To be honest , the poor customerservice was worse than buying a useless item that was money thrown away .
 not a fan of this product . They are hard to put on and it feels like my legs are being suffocated and my circulation cut off .
 This one lasted about 6 hours . I hate that I have to go back to the pine smelling Aubrey but it 's the only one that seems to last . I see Aubrey has another scent , city something , that 's more appealing to me as a woman , but I have n't found it in the deodorant .
 The new E Plus High C scent is a definite step down from the previous one I used for years and had gotten from Amazon and the local health food store . I gave it one more shot because the ad for it showed a blue cap and described it differently -- but what I received is the same old -LRB- new -RRB- one with the dark green cap and the unappealing scent . I 'm thinking of switching to Weleda Sage -- more pricey but seems to work well , and it smells better .
 I was looking for an alternative to toxic deodorants , and decided to try Aubrey Organics - E Plus High C Roll On , per the suggestion of a sales clerk at a local natural supplement store . Made with -LRB- potentially -RRB- great ingredients like aloe leaf juice , grapefruit extract , lavender , and calamine and rose water , it sounded safe enough . What I did n't realize was how messy this would be , that it would smell awful and completely burn my skin -LRB- after shaving -RRB- . It does work against bad BO -LRB- Body Odor -RRB- , but , that is about all . I really wish I could give this a higher rating . It is just challenging to to find an effective deodorant made without aluminum , triclosan or other harsh ingredients.The search continues ...
 This did not work at all for me . I might as well have been applying water to my armpits . Actually , that might have worked better . This stuff has a decent smell which is very mild . I wish it would have worked . If you 're searching for a natural deodorant , Weleda spray deodorant and Queen Helene mint julep deodorant worked better for me . Another thing that works is applying Dr Bronner 's liquid soap as a deodorant .
 I thought the scent of this was earthy and kind of nice ... until I read the other reviewer that said it smells like bug spray . I hate to say it but they 're right . It pretty much smells exactly like bug spray , which I guess is n't a noxious odor but it 's not a fragrance one tends to seek out especially when you do n't want to smell . It also did n't really work so by the end of the day I smelled like b.o. and bug spray . Really gross . I 'm going to have to keep looking .
 The deodorant works OK against body odor , but it has a somewhat strong and not too pleasant smell itself that is unlikely to be noticeable by others in a social setting , but I find it distracting .
 I really wanted this to work , but unfortunately it did n't for me or my husband . We went back to using our Crystal Body Deodorant Roll-On , which is less expensive and works very well .
 Bought this for my husband , who is trying to stay away from all the chemicals in typical deodorants/antiperspirants . This may be all natural , but that 's the unfortunate problem with this product along with others like it -LRB- ie Tom 's of Maine -RRB- . And does n't do anything for wetness or odor . In fact , it stinks ! Waste of money . Better to go without .
 I bought this hoping for good things . It worked great for three days and I thought I found THE product . However , by the fourth , I smelled something funky and realized it was me . I thought maybe I did n't put enough on or did n't shake it up enough , so I tried it for another few days . However , I just do n't think this product works for me . I would say I smell like body odor masked with floral perfume . I think that it worked for the first few days I used it because I still had my old non-natural deodorant lingering on me .
 I was looking to purchase a deodorant without all the toxic ingredents - that really works for my body.Aubrey 's Organics hair conditioner work wonderfully . But this Deodorant did n't , it did not protect me at all . My daughter also tried it and did n't work for her neither ... I 'll keep searching ...
 Too bad . I liked the list of ingredients but the `` nose '' did n't deliver , I just do n't like the smell . Also , as far as effectiveness goes , I 'm much happier with the Weleda deodorant sprays ... those are divine !
 I just received this product and have to say I 'm disappointed . It smells like bug spray :-LRB- Definitely not what I had in mind . I was hoping it smelled like this chamomile/calendula diaper ointment I have that smells awesome . Unfortunately , the patchouli , calamine -LRB- like that pink crap you put on chicken pox -RRB- , and the wood oils are winning this war . My husband told me I should wash it off . He was joking -LRB- kinda -RRB- we both agree the smell is not good . I normally do n't wear deodorant because I do n't have offensive body odor . I was just looking for something flowery to wear because natural perfume is really hard to find and outrageously expensive . Essential oil it is ...
 It may be doing a good job with BO , but this stuff smells horrible . I do n't understand all the good reviews . I threw out the bottle and took a shower immediately after first applying it . Trust me , go with something else .
 I was disappointed with this deodorant . I live in Asia , and deodorant choices here are limited , so an herbal deodorant with pine scent sounded great . But it sure does n't smell like pine to me . Even Pine-Sol bathroom cleaner has a more natural pine scent . This scent reminds me of some cheap deodorant some of the guys used to use in the locker room in high school . I ca n't believe how many people gave this product a high rating ; I 'll be more careful to read all of the negative reviews before I buy something from now on .
 Do not get this product . It smells like something you would spray on stinky shoes to clean them . Its medicinal and horrible . Your sweaty pits will smell better than this stuff , trust me . It lasts for days - on your shirt , your coat , in your bathroom , everywhere you went after spraying that stuff on.Plus - there are * no returns * on opened health & beauty products ! Buyer beware !
 Please be aware that you may suffer a severe skin reaction to Aubrey Organics Calendul Blossc Natura Deodorant spray . So test it on a small area before doing a full fledged application . Please be careful . I did n't and I suffered severe reaction to this untested product .
 the product itself , is fine . the container is unexceptable . . it is so fragile it will crack if not placed on a completely flat surface and handled like glass . we had two of our four bottles crack on the bottom in less than a month from purchase . all the contents leaked out made a terrible mess in our storage room . what a waste ! we need eco friendly products for our grey water system and we live in a very remote place and buy in quantity . we can not afford to order this product again if it is not storable and is so poorly packaged .
 Considering that this product was so cheap I should of known that it was n't going to come out well . The color is extremely faint and lasts less that 3 days . I recommend that you 're better off going to a professional and take the $ 4 plus that you would of spent on this product and treat yourself to a slice of pizza and small coke .
 this product looks good when you first put it on then it dies and flakes off quickly leaving only a light stain that you can hardly see . it doesnt work . i think i would rather mix my own batch of henna paste .
 this stuff is pretty cool , but it dries a lot lighter than i was wanting . it turns kind of a medium shade of yellowish orange . i was hoping for a red or brown .
 the tube had a pin hole at the top & the contents were dried , used it anyway , but the stain was so light , it was a waste of time & money . this is how you get ripped off because sending it back cost more than the product does and no one is accountable .
 Wow ... will never purchase this again ! The tips were horrible and the paste was even worse . Will go back to mixing my own !
 Well I bought this item and I was super excited . I went ahead and sprused it up with there mehndi oil , lemon juice , and some sugar . I did a small henna design on my foot , put a sealer , and wrapped it in tissue paper and plastic wrap like the website said . It remained on my foot for a solid 9 hours . Much to my dissapointment when I removed it , the stain was no where near the color it typically is . I waited for three days so it could darken and it didnt get much darker . I suspect they either sent me a bad blend or an older tube .
 It was ok . Not very dark . Probably because the date-code on the tube showed this product was on the shelf for over 1 year before sale .
 Before you buy this product be aware that it is non returnable even if it was only removed from the boxto see this it was too small . Poor customer service since it tooks days to reach somebody byemail or phone . Told absolutely '' no '' to all their products for returns . The item was xxlarge andwould n't fit a child . Once I filed a complaint , then I received an email that there was possibly a wayto return the item if I was willing to jump through the following hoops . To be honest , the poor customerservice was worse than buying a useless item that was money thrown away .
 not a fan of this product . They are hard to put on and it feels like my legs are being suffocated and my circulation cut off .
 I tried a bottle of this , thinking , Yeah , an end to midnight snacking!Nope . It does n't seem to have any effect at all . At least it does n't * increase * appetite !
 This product was late arriving to me and I wish to return it . I had to purchase from another vendor .
 I am not sure there 's any thing in this patch other than the glue that makes the skin itches for a long time even after you quit using them.then it 's so weired that you will not find any of information about on it on the web , and there no customer service contacts for them anywhere.you 're really better of buysing the real thing from walgreen or cvs , and make it worth it .

 This product was made sturdy . However it 's really dull . In fact it 's so dull that I could n't intentionally cut myself . I tried shaving with this 2 separate times for an hour each to no avail . I ended up running out and getting some disposable blades for the interim.Mind you this is the first time I 've tried shaving with a straight razor , but I stayed at it trying different angles and such for quite sometime . I 'm sending mine back .
 Only two companies still making SE razors should be considered
 I 've tried everything on this razor . I bought a water sharpening stone to hone it , and I have a strop . However , no matter how much I sharpen it or hone it , it remains dull . I go over my face over and over again , and very little hair is removed . I do manage to cut my self 22 times , but little hair is removed . If you want to shave with a straight razor you should either buy a DOVO or buy a vintage one from the 30 's made by a good american company such as :1 . -RRB- Waterville2 . -RRB- Genco3 . -RRB- Geneva4 . -RRB- Case -LRB- W.R. Case & Sons -RRB- 5 . -RRB- Winchester6 . -RRB- Sta-Sharp7 . -RRB- Craftsman -LRB- There is also a German version that is superlative -RRB- You can find these razors in fine shape on ebay for under $ 20
 The product is inexpensive but has a dull edge , did not cut my whiskers well and did not sharpen well either.I decided to abandon it completely and buy a more expensive straight razor .
 You CAN NOT shave with this razor on delivery . Maybe if you have facial hair like I did in the 6th grade . If you have facial hair that 's even slightly course -LRB- like most men 's are -RRB- this is not going to cut it . After the first few painful strokes that felt as if it was pulling the hair out instead of shaving it off I decided to strop it . 150 strop strokes later -LRB- properly done with the edge trailing I might add -RRB- it improved a bit but still would n't take the hair off properly . Pulled out my old trusty Mach 3 and finished shaving . Came honed from the factory but I guess I will try honing it myself and stropping . If I do n't get anywhere with it after that to the garbage it goes and a well known more expensive blade will be purchased .
 First off as a block oil , thuis works very well . Does exactly what it is supposed to do . Smell is pleasant , protects the wood well.However the ants go crazy for this stuff . I have an ant problem as it is but whenever I oil my boards or blocks the next day andfor about a week it is covered in ants . At first i thought it was a coincidence . Now that i have used it several times the ant thingis consistent . The amazing thing is that I searched the internet and there was nothing about ants being especially attracted tolemon oil , but there must be another ingredient in there that is attracting it . Unfortunately i will be throwing out a half used bottlebecause I can not deal with it anymore

 I have bought natrol time released melatonin a few years ago and it worked , but now it makes no difference when we take it .
 My husband and I have used Melatonin in the past , and were not happy with it completely . We found if we took it too late we had trouble waking up in the morning , and taking it early we would fall asleep , but wake up 3 or 4 hours later and not be able to fall back asleep . A friend recommended we try the timed release tablets he was using because he was getting a full night 's sleep and had no trouble in the morning getting up . Unfortunately , my husband and I both felt that the timed release tablets were not helping us sleep through the night and I started getting leg cramps after 3 days use .
 I bought 3mg Melatonin over 5mg -LRB- even though they were the same price -RRB- strictly because the picture on the site said it did n't come with B6 however it did . Also B6 could n't be found anywhere else on the ingredients list on the site . B6 is found in energy drinks , for example 5 hour energy and needless to say this product did n't help me sleep any faster !
 how can it be time release when it is a tablet ! do n't you need a capsule with different size granules so they dissolve at different times !
 When I first took the pill , I was shortly overcome with extreme sleepiness . And I did not feel all the good , I felt weird . The extreme sleepiness wore off after an hour or two . In the morning I had nausea . I do n't know if it 's me or the product but it did n't work out for me .
 Dont like the time release . . Prefer the regular melatonin . Disappointed . Bought a two pack because it was the best deal economically but it has n't worked for me and now I 'm unable to return 2nd bottle because it 's too late but had no way of knowing it 's quality until giving it a reasonable try . Would not buy again . Very disappointed . Have had to resort back to sleeping pills because this failed to live up to what was advertised . I thought the time release would be a step up and better but it 's not . The regular melatonin worked better . Upset that I cant return the 2nd bottle . It 's useless to me ! Was n't a bargain or good deal afterall .
 I bought these mainly because I keep hearing about how they can make you have vivid/lucid dreams and also for those times when I 'm having a hard time falling asleep -LRB- which is often -RRB- . Unfortunately though they really did n't help with either sleeping or lucid dreams . Ive took them 3 nights in a row and I do n't really plan on taking them again.The first night I took the recommended 3mg and I ca n't honestly say I slept any better , I think I might of even slept worst and my ability to recall my dreams was greatly diminished . When I woke up after eight hours I feel like the pills were still affecting me and I did not want to get out of bed my eyes felt really dry and sensitive to light . I spent the rest of the day feeling like this and just `` out of it '' kind of like when I do n't get enough sleep . Day 2 was a repeat of day one . Day 3 I increased the dose to two pills and did n't notice any real improvement in the quality of my sleep or dreams.In conclusion , I was able to sleep with these pills but the way I felt after waking up is not worth taking them . I was also hoping they would have assisted me in lucid dreaming but they did n't . If you do decide to try these be careful because as stated on the bottle these pills can leave you feeling groggy/drowsy after waking up which can be dangerous for somebody who is required to be alert/focused for difficult/dangerous activities .
 Thee pills did not help me fall asleep any faster . Also , since these are just supplements , they have not been `` evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration '' . What I have noticed though is that I have more dreams that I can remember while I am taking these . Might be just placebo effect though , I do n't know .
 I purchased the time relased Melatonin because I have the tendency to wake during the night . As usual I fell asleep easily with the Melatonin but woke up after 2-3 hours so I do not see the benefit of buying this product .
 I get a good reaction from melatonin , and usually take 1.5 mg at night trader joes brand but wanted to try a time release version . This did not work well for me , I only tried two nights but I think the b-6 had me restless or something I am not really certain what the issue was but this did not work for me at all and I am going to throw it out and try something else
 A waste of money -LRB- especially at $ 10 from the local over-priced island grocery -RRB- . I have been fighting sleep issues for years and gave up on the Big Pharma approaches -LRB- ambien , benzos -RRB- due to side effects and habituation . Melatonin has helped me before , so after reading an article that discussed TR , I thought I would give this a try . Awake almost all night , with no sense that this is anything other than a placebo ... Not even a hint of the usual melatonin drowsiness , and I tried three nights in a row with similar results . -LRB- To clarify , I 'm not going through any kind of rebound insomnia from that other stuff , which was quite a while ago ... all bets are off when that is happening . Now just looking for a reasonably reliable sleep aid that is n't toxic . -RRB-

 I tried these to compare to the `` Nozovent Large '' . The large nozovent is hard to find , hurt quite a bit the first few weeks , but works great in increasing the airflow alot . Now , this Snooze feels to me for the first few minutes , it might povide a little more airflow , but than I notice very clearly , that it actually limits the airflow due it 's relatively small tubes . When breathing in , I clearly feel the resistance it creates in the airflow . And I am using the large version . So , I think the design idea is great , but the shape is not optimized yet . This needs a re-design . It might help others , depending on their nose , but for me , the Nozovent Large is much , much , much better . The difference between Snooze and Nozovent is , Snooze uses tubes , which take away more airflow space inside the nose than Nozovent , which uses just 2 `` paddles '' that press outwards . Of cause , everyone 's nose is different , and I would not be surprised if Snooze works great for some noses , just not for mine . I could not find the Nozovent Large on Amazon , and therefore could not provide a product link .
 What on earth is aspartame -LRB- a known neurotoxin -RRB- doing in a children 's vitamin , not to mention hydrogenated oils and artificial flavors/colors ? I bought these because I remembered them from my own childhood , but I do not recommend them . Read the ingredients !
 Purchased this because it was cheaper than the other variations . All the tablets turned a shade brown after opening , and they have a weird texture and very metallic taste -LRB- tate is probably normal considering these are the ` Iron ' version -RRB- . I 'll skip these next time and get the regular version .

 I 've used both the normal Enzymatic Therapy DGL , and this German Chocolate.No comparison , this stuff does not work . The regular flavor does .
 I have almost constant heartburn that started about six weeks ago after I took antibiotics for a bacterial infection caused by a cat bite . I have been using these tablets before breakfast and dinner , and again before I go to bed . The taste is OK , chocolate with a hint of coconut , but they do n't seen to be helping me . I am really disappointed because this heartburn is making my life miserable , and I had high hopes for this product .
 I was interested in this product but I ca n't consume dairy so I 'm always wary when a product is chocolate flavored . -LRB- The description here on Amazon states that it does not contain dairy . -RRB- I went to the company 's website and in the `` Notes '' section of the description for this product was this - ** Based on 2000 calorie diet.Other Ingredients
 Guess I 'll put this one in the category of useless medicine . Went through the entire bottle with no noticeable changes or impacts . They taste good , so basically they are expensive chocolates . Pop a couple of antacids instead for a noticeable effect .
 I purchased two bottles of these tablets as I 've used them for a while and find them to be helpful . When I received the two bottles I thought they looked smaller , and sure enough - the bottles are quite a bit smaller than previously purchased ones . I decided to open one to see the tablets themselves and they are quite a lot smaller than before . No further discount , just sneaky business by the manufacturer . I hate stuff like this . Do they think the buyers are morons ? I 'll find something else to use for my stomach . I hate to be ripped off !!!
 De . Andrew Weill touted this product As a wonderful healing agent for the stomach . However , I got a stomach ache both times I tried it . And it was a bad stomach pain . The first time it happened , I thought it could be something else . When it happened again , I decided not to continue using it.So I shall stick with Inulin FOS and ALIGN to help my stomach.I was disappointed .

 I 've used this belt before for SI problems that put me down for about six weeks . The belt helps so much -LRB- paired with home exercise -RRB- and I ran the Napa Marathon after four weeks of being on the belt . The only problem
 Good forks , a good product . Seller , however , is charging a ridiculously high shipping charge . $ 8.95 to mail 50 plastic forks ? Absurd . With that add on , the price does n't look so good any longer.Do not encourage this kind of deceptive sales practice , get them from another seller , cheaper .
 this item is horrible !!! the mixer started to leak after 2 uses . safe your money . if i were in America i would suit a refound demand on the company .
 I have not used on my dogs yet ! I gave my daughter one and I believe it helped her ! She is very stressed ...
 On the first night , this worked pretty well . After that , it has n't worked noticeably -- maybe a little for a few minutes . But that does n't qualify it as a real sleep aid .
 PRODUCT IS GREAT !! but , I paid $ 20.00 extra to get this to my son at camp ASAP and it took as long as standard shipping to arrive . Seller is the problem ...
 I have a 2yr . old blind dog who sometime gets anxious when we leave him home alone , so I thought I would try this item . It has n't seemed to help him much with his anxiousness , according to the video that I 've recorded of him when we 're gone , so not sure it works .
 I would not buy this product again . It is ineffective and there was no change noted from before to after taking . Tastes awful .
 Not effective . Personally , this product did not work . Would not purchase again for myself , but perhaps would work with others .
 I personally felt no difference with this product . I would not necessarily recommend it based on my experience , but it may be different for each person .
 My wife was using this product for her canine massage business to help calm new ` clients ' and a events where a calm atmosphere was not simple to maintain . The claims are that this will assist with anxiety in pets and help them deal with the stress of new situations.So - I think the main question here is ` does this work ' . Over the course of two years and using this on dozens of dogs , the answer is ' I do n't think so ' . I fully understand the premise - flower essences are easier on the canine nose than essential oils - that makes logical sense . The reality here is do these specific essences work ? We have seen no evidence that they do . We have researched , tested and utilized this product as directed with no noticeable result.All I can say is that in our experience over a couple of years with dozens of dogs , we do n't see it being useful at all.Hope that helps .
 I have to re-evaluate how much credibility I give to reviewers after this one . This did absolutely nothing for me . Taste 's like a shot of booze . Gave it to my boss , in case she needs a `` shot '' during the day.Not recommended .
 I 'm sure this work for some people , and if so it 's entirely the placebo effect . Not that that 's a bad thing - it 's actually an enormously powerful effect that can do good in a person 's life . However , for whatever reason - and against my better judgement - I bought this product because it was listed on a breastfeeding website as a tool to help a low -LRB- or non-existent in my case -RRB- let-down of milk . I used this spray as directed , and also dozens of times more . Nothin.So - nothing against Bach 's . I just blame myself for letting the stress get to me to such a point that I actually spent money on this stuff.Actually I watched a Tony Robbins DVD and that took care of the problem quite well!A happy day to you -
 Sorry to say , this did n't work for me . In fact , seemed to make my anxiety worse ! I just hope all the favorable reviews are n't by people with an investment in the company .
 Saw this from Dr. Oz show , I really believed in him . Thought it might help me with my nervousness/voice and calm me down in class presentations . It did not , it may help other but it certainly does not work on me . The taste is dominately alcohol , much like beer .
 I did not like this product , because this product simply does not work on me . There is nothing more to add .
 I do n't get it ? Dr Oz endorses this and says even his children use it ?? It contains 27 percent alcohol ?? Who would n't suddenly relax ?
 Dr Oz is the one that suggested this . I think he get 's a kick back on all the products that he talks about . I can tell no difference .
 I really wanted this to work , I believe Dr. Oz and he had it on his show . But unfortunately , I do not get any feeling -LRB- calming or otherwise -RRB- from the spray . Just a bad taste in my mouth . Sorry !
 I 've been carrying this with me for a few weeks and have now used it for all of it 's suggested purposes , including an actual panic attack.It did NOT stop my panic attack . I think it works for people who have never taken a RX medicine for panic . I have been prescribed meds in the past for anxiety and panic & I guess I expected too much of this product.The taste is like alcohol too , which I do n't care for . It 's 24 % alcohol so that 's to be expected.As far as day to day stress/anxiety I guess it was ok . If you have severe panic/anxiety , this is NOT for you .
 Bought this for my husband because he gets a lot of anxiety at school and it makes his stomach turn . He said it tasted horrible , and he 's not a picky eater . He said it did nothing to calm him down .
 Just received my Rescue Remedy Spray sold by ` Eleven Adar ' and was very disappointed to see that the expiration date is 06/2009 . Rescue Remedy sold at reputable health food stores has expiration dates years into the future . This is my second online vitamin shopping experience in 3 months where expired or soon to expire product was shipped .
 I bought this because Dr. Oz said that it really works . I was very shocked because it has 27 % alcohol . It really tastes like alcohol , my husband can not use it for he is a recovering alcoholic . I have had thought of getting it tested up at my police station wondering if I would pass a breathalyzer test . Like I said I am really shocked . I plan on writing to Dr. Oz for I have believed in every product he has promoted .
 We have a 2 year old Husky who LoVeS to chew when we are away and he 's left at home for an hour or two . . This spray did absolutely nothing to deter that behavior . We finally purchased a Thunder coat for Dogs . Best money we ever spent . He still chews occasionally , but much less often .
 Did n't do anything . Nada . I think lavender oil is more effective . Abreva is more effective than tea tree or lavender oils but Glaxo SmithKlein , I believe , is being deceptive . See my Abreva review .
 I ordered Lifetime calcium supplent and was sent this stuff instead . Ugh!Didn ' t even finish the first bottle ... all in the trash !
 I purchased this product and have tried it in a few recipes such as pancakes and brownies , as well as simply cooking it with oat bran.The strong sawdust-like taste is very difficult to mask . I 've thrown out everything I 've made with it so far because the flavor was just a bit too strong.This product is best used as only a very small fraction of whatever it is used in , but on the whole I would look to more palatable sources of fiber.For a better tasting fiber for bulky baked items , defatted coconut flour has a much better taste and having the ability to be used as a much , much greater proportion in a recipe .
 I had this item for one week an it got a hole in it ! Thank God for duct tape !!
 these shields would become airway obstructions in use since they fall apart when opened . i returned them a few weeks ago and have not heard anything back from the company - no returned money either .
 I bought these to add to First Aid Kits at a school . The barrier is a thick plastic sheet with a hard plastic insert in the middle . Right out of the package , part of the plastic sheet is cracked at a fold . The insert is not a one-way valve , but does contain a filter . The lower portion of the insert is about 1 1/4 '' x 1 1/3 '' x 1/3 '' and is intended to be placed between the victim 's teeth during CPR . On an adult this might work , but could cause delay placing the insert properly . My main concern would be in using this in a child 's mouth , which would have more difficulty fitting between the teeth , and could also push back on the tongue . Overall , this is an inexpensive barrier that might work for adults , but a different design might be considered for all uses , especially for children .
 I bought these , at first , thinking they would be useful in the car , and in my purse . But then I find these are to be used for CPR manaquins . Even at that , I found them difficult to use in a class with the manquins . I did n't think they were worth the money . The one-way valve resuscitator masks are much better and safer .
 I ordered the small based on the recommended neck measurements . What the description does n't tell you is that there is a velcro strip approx 4-5 inches long that will scratch your neck if it is n't covered by the other side of the collar , so order with that in mind ! Otherwise it 's fine , your basic cervical collar ...
 My wife and I have been purchasing various items from Amazon for years , and we have never been disappointed until now . The issue is not about the cost of the item , it is about the seller NOT specifying that the item could not be returned . The collar does not fit me . Therefore I can not use it . I would suggest that all Amazon customers make purchases of items offered by Amazon ONLY !! That is what our family is going to do from now on .
 Horrible taste , leaves nasty after tase . I bought these after reading the other reviews what a mistake . The Choclate Caramel are much better .
 I bought this product since it does n't have parabens and I want an Emu Oil product that does n't have too much bad stuff in it -LRB- artificial ingredients , artificial color , etc -RRB- that in the long run is unhealthy . Turns out this product is loaded with all sorts of unnecessary chemicals , along with the coloring agent . Worst of all , though , it is the least useful emu product I 've tried so far . I put it on and felt absolutely no benefit . I compare that with the `` Original Blue Emu '' product that I use which despite having parabens and blue coloring has a strong quality healing , soothing effect . This Ultra Blue product on the other hand seems to have the lowest quality emu oil and/or the enormous amount of useless artificial ingredients -LRB- probably created by a dysfunctional group of suits in a committee where each suit was able to add more toxic gunk to the product -RRB- in it to render it ineffective -LRB- and likely toxic in the long run -RRB- . Also , the texture of the product is idiotic , instead of a smooth cream easy and pleasant to apply , it is a dribbly mess of fake blue goo that bounces , drips and slips off the hands instead of easy to work with . I 'll never use this awful , low quality product ever again , I 'm throwing it into the trash . There are an enormous amount of emu oil products out there and likely nearly all of them are superior to this one that is appallingly bad .
 COMPANY FAILS TO MENTION THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS POISONOUS PROPYLENE GLYCOL ! WHEN IT ARRIVED THAT IS WHEN I SAW THAT NASTY INGREDIENT ON THE LABLE . THIS IS DISGUSTING ! I WOULD NEVER PUT THAT PRODUCT ON MY BODY . A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !!! IT IS GOING IN THE TRASH ! COMPANY HAS LOUSY RETURN POLICY AS WELL-BUYER BEWARE ! I AM LETTING AMAZON KNOW OF MY DISSATISFACTION . I AM SICK OF FULL DISCLOSURE OF INGREDIENTS NOT BEING LISTED ON PRODUCTS BEFORE PURCHASE .
 I just dropped it to hate it because I am required to use 19 words ... the last time I will review a product . Its &#34; eh &#34;
 Shame on Nature 's Plus for the name and shame on me for not reading the ingredients.Rhododendron is not acidophillus , nor is it used in the same manner for the same reasons.If your child has stomach or intestinal issues ... this is not what you want !
 Socks are very comfortable and they definitely do their job.But the quality is questionable . The seams at the heels started falling apart just after few time I wore them . For that price I would expect much more durability.Next time I will try another brand .
 they did not hold up to one days wear , They are too thin and go a hole the first day .
 I found these to be extremely tight and about one inch too long to be comfortable on my legs . They appear to be well made , but I 'm not at all sure I 'll be able to use them on a regular basis . I understood from the description that they would be ` light compression ' but discovered them to be quite the opposite . -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 11 '' and weight less then 190 # -RRB- . Rubber gloves will be necessary to help put them on.Good luck .
 My first item of contention was the long time it took for delivery of package . Ordered online 08-02-2010 , Did not receive package until 08-10-2010 via FedX ground shipping . To add insult to injury Amazon has a third party vendor that does not provide package tracking ... You would think that would be a top priority for ALL items shipped that Amazon represents.After wearing socks for only two days the threads are starting to unravel . I am not a happy camper . Too frustrated to send back ! Who knows how long this will take to be corrected .

 Plain indeed . I thought the taste was insipid with a yuck factor . I had to stop using it . I am sure it works fine if used .
 The description does not tell you that this product also contains ZINC . If your like me and can not have anything `` extra '' in your pedialyte , this caused me to buy an entire case that I can not use . If your going to add ZINC , then at least put it in the description .
 The comb works great but where the blade is inserted , the clip holding it in falls out and allows the blade to fall out of the comb ... DANGEROUS ! It did this the first time I used it and unless I get out the duct tape , I will not be using it again ! DO NOT BUY !!!

 I ordered a glycerite . I am gluten free and can not take extract as it would make me very sick . What arrived was extract not glycerite . It is irresponsible and dangerous to sell herbs and supplements if you do n't know the product . If you do n't know the difference from a glycerite and and extract you should be selling costume jewelry . They gave me a link to re-order the product which was the same link that I ordered from in the first place.Herb Pharm has great products , `` Nature and Herbs '' the seller did a terrible job on this order . Going forward I will only order directly from the manufacturer .
 This product is a fine product , unless you actually want to use it . The top thumb nut is capable of sliding up and down the bolt making it impossible to use as intended . I will not make the purchase again .
 Its junk ! , its made so cheap , the metal is to thin , I would rather paid more money and got something of a better quality.With the cost of the shipping I really feel it was a Bad ... Buy .
 This product did not come sealed . When I tried to return it through to the Therapy Connection , they refused to return the product due to the fact that it is n't sealed . Well , how can I use it when it did not come sealed ? Just as the company is not allowing me to return it for sanitary reasons I ca n't use it for sanitary reasons . Unless you do n't mind a product of this type being opened and possibly used , buy from another seller and ask whether or not it comes sealed .
 these might stop water but they dont stop a lot of sound . . bought these to help with sleep at night ... but can hear a lot of sounds while wearing these .
 4 emails to this company trying to find the status of my order . I have cancelled the order and will never do business with them again .
 Back in the 80 's my mom and aunt used a home electrolyis machine religiously , without much by way of results . A few months ago my aunt found her ancient machine , which she passed along to me ... I used it a few times and it did n't really seem to work , but it prompted me to head online and see what kind of newer , presumably better , home electrolysis kits were on the market . After reading some positive reviews I was hopeful that this electrolysis machine would be my ticket to getting rid of unwanted facial hair . I was shocked when I opened the box and found THE EXACT SAME MACHINE that my aunt purchased way back in 1982 . I popped in the battery and fired it up , setting aside an hour a day for a month to work on hair removal . The results
 I bought this item and tried it at home around my eyebrow area . How it works is you 're supposed to touch this salty water with one hand and then use the machine on yourself . Stick the machine 's needle into the pore from which the hair grows and wait -LRB- tearing up from the slight stinging pain -RRB- while a little white bubbly mess starts forming around the pore . Then you 're theoretically supposed to pull out the hair easily.Ok , and the reality is that I do n't recommend people to buy and use this product . Let a professional do it if you must , TRUST ME . It is very hard to get the little needle to go properly into the pore ... you end up damaging skin on the surface of your skin and under it as well . Also , the needle gets bent pretty easily . My eyebrow area ended up looking pretty mangled up after my attempt -- there were small red craters in various places between and around my eyebrows.Oh , and the hairs grew back anyway because the settlings do n't go high enough.The needle is too weak to work on the really dark hairs , like those on my underarms . I killed a needle that way and I still could n't not get the hair out easily . I also tried it on a few light hairs on my forearm too , which was easier to work with since I have a clear view of my arm , but I honestly do n't think that made a difference either long term . Oh , and short term I left some small scars on my arm as well.This machine is not very expensive , so I thought I would give it a try , but honestly just save your money and save your cabinet space as well .
 I am highly pain tolerant and have used a home electrolysis pen in the past . I tried this and really can not tell that anything is happening turned all the way up to 10 the first time . As other users have said , the needle retracts so you find you are only touching the surface . The pen I used in the past definitely had current , this one does not . I wish I could find something that worked but almost everything has negative reviews . Do n't buy this .
 I returned this product after 3-4 attempts at using it . The pain was awful and I did n't like that `` your pores may emit a discharge . '' In other words , I was damaging my skin ! Will NOT try another product like this again .
 The site states that the product is a `` Set of 6 of the most commonly used frequencies contains the following forks
 This product is mesrepresented . I ordered this thinking I was getting a set of tuning forks to teach my child about sound and sound waves . I only got one fork .
 They show an image of the tunning forks with case and then sell you one tunning fork which is inferior to any product I have every receieved . Do n't buy from them if you can help it !
 Unfortunately I was in a rush to buy a Christmas present for my child 's teacher . We came up with the idea of a `` set '' of tuning forks for the Sound Unit he was teaching . We saw the price , we saw the product picture , and we ordered it . Usually I scroll down and read reviews before purchasing , but I did n't this time and I am sorry I did n't . As previous people stated , I was annoyed that I received only one fork when thinking I was getting a set . Now I am stuck because it will cost me money if I return it and I would be out a fork and shipping . Amazon needs to revamp this product description and picture because it is misleading . The set is actually in the 50 dollar range not 5 dollars . So if you were to order , READ CAREFULLY to ensure that you are purchasing EXACTLY what you think you are ordering . This is the first time I have ever been dissatified with a purchase through Amazon .
 The product description state that it is a set of tuning forks . I just received one tuning fork . As a teacher , I need a set of tuning forks to teach my 4th graders about sound . This is disappointing and would have though amazon would have taken care of any issue with the seller after so many bad reviews .
 The description clearly states that you are purchasing a `` set '' . All you get is a single tuning fork . Perhaps the $ 60 package will include a full set .
 Product DescriptionEvaluate hearing and vibratory sensation . Set of 6 of the most commonly used frequencies contains the following tuning forks -LRB- 128 , 256 , 512 , 1024 , 2048 , 4095 cps -RRB- . This is description of what I should have been sent . Instead I was sent 1 small unweighted tuning forl . . I will not be ordering from this place again . And wlll complain to amason itself to allowing this continue going on from this seller.sKim
 I need to pay attention to the fine print and reviews . I , too , am a teacher , and did not realize I was ordering just ONE tuning fork , when the image clearly shows a boxed set . I am not even sure what `` 512 cps weighted '' means . I hope I can use this tuning fork for its intendend purpose . I wish the company would have been more clear with its advertising and description .
 When I received the tuning fork it was broken ! If you are looking for a tuning fork and actually need it to work , DO NOT buy it from them . They are super cheap for a reason . Guess I learned my lesson .
 I received the 450mg tablets which is extra strength instead of 300mg . I did some research online to find the 300mg tablets and it seems no one else has them so I assume they do n't sell them in that dose . I tried taking half , but the pill itself it hard to swallow and tastes absolutely awful . Not happy with this purchase and will need to buy a different brand .
 This creme has a fragrance which is known to be toxic to humans.It also has a preservative that is highly toxic . Stick to UNSCENTED NO PRESERVATIVE CREAMS AND OILS TO BE SAFEI HAD A REACTION TO BIOTONEWhat are the reactions to iodopropynyl butylcarbamate allergy?Typical allergic contact dermatitis may occur . It may take several days after exposure to the allergen for symptoms to appear . Typical symptoms include redness , swelling , itching , and fluid-filled blisters . Patients commonly present with a scattered generalized dermatitis or dermatitis affecting hands and arms.Another concern of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate is that it may have adverse effects on the immune system . It is also suspected to be an environmental toxin . Further research into these areas is necessary .
 I love the creme and the smell . The price and the shape of the container not so much . It 's only 16 oz and the container is a short and fat . . I have to carry it around the table with me because it does n't fit in my handy dandy massage belt . Your better off buying 68 ounces for $ 46 then 16 ounces for $ 20 . 16 ounces x 4 containers = 64 ounces for $ 80 . Just buy the 68 ounces for $ 46 you wont be mad about it ! Now I just have to work on not using so much at a time . I like to glide working my way into a deeper massage once the creme has been absorbed abit .
 I have used this product -LRB- 4 bottles -RRB- over the course of the last 8 weeks , following the directions explicitly . I chose two areas that I wanted to see hair inhibited , my private area , and my upper back . I used it twice a day for the first week , and twice a day about half the time the following week , using it once a day all the other days , every single day . Nothing has changed . I 've cut the hair back repeatedly during those weeks to keep it short , but it continues to grow back thick and full.If you like spraying a fruity smelling water solution on yourself , then go for it . There does n't seem to be any irritation or stink -LRB- except the fruity smell -RRB- later in the day . But it did n't do anything to inhibit hair growth .
 I followed the directions ; however , it did not work . Hair kept growing at the same ol' rate . This product is definately overpriced . The spray pump nozzle even did n't work . It kept sticking in the down position .
 One or two swipes with this broom and the handle starts unscrewing and twirls the broom all over the place . Then you have to stop sweeping and screw the handle back on . Now do this a dozen times before you 've finished sweeping the kitchen and you 'll be ready to throw this useless piece of junk out .
 I purchased the Oster Fast Speed Clipper through Amazon after much research & many reviews.My husband has very short hair & trims it perhaps every three weeks or so . The first time he used the clipper , the 1/4 inch guide snapped in two ! Thinking that it was just one of those things & probably a fluke , I purchsed this set . Again , he used the 1/4 inch guide -LRB- twice this time -RRB- & it snapped in two ! Unbelievable.In retrospect , we should have just got an `` off-the shelf '' trimmer at Wal-Mart . The clipper seems like a fine product , but the quides are just plain flimsy !
 I ordered a Standers CarCaddie for my newly partially paralyzed mother for Christmas , and instead they sent me a Standers HandyBar instead . Thankfully , for my purposes the HandyBar should work fine , but that is still not what I ordered , and for many people who are expecting to get a CarCaddie the situation might not be as flexible . Standers , you need to correct your shipping process !! I was n't notified that it would be different either . I was still charged the CarCaddie price -LRB- which was thankfully the cheaper of the two -RRB- but received a different product . I 'm sure both are great , but you need to fix this ! Buyers beware .
 i purchased this product to help my elderly father get out of his car , but as you pull on the handle , the door closes in on your legs . i am returning it .
 Product was of very little help for assisting my Dad in/out of the car . When you pull on the car caddie to help get you out of the car it closes the door . You are not able to get the leverage needed to assist getting a person in and out of the car .
 Great idea . But this company could spend a few cents more to put a good no-slip slider buckle on the strap where it adjusts . A few cents more . A touch of thought and quality where it counts . Nope . Shame . I hope to use it , but will always worry about pulling the strap through . I have other items with the proper buckle , and they work fine , no slip under most any condition . Hoping it holds when I need it .
 I found that the item was totally unsuable when entering my vehicle . I was unable to hoist myself up from the item hagning from an open door.I only receivedd a partial refund for a useless device . I was penalized by saying `` I could not use it . ''
 This tasted so disgusting I could only use it twice . I tried using half a scoop but it the taste was so strong that it still made me gag . It might me great but for me it 's unusable .
 Do not buy this product . It contains lead as do several other Davinci labs product . Read the ingredient carefully . I would have given this product zero stars if that was an option .
 find it at your local grocery store for almost two-thirds to half the price here . You 'll still save money even driving a gas guzzler to just go out and pick this up at a local store .
 I was so excited to use this product on our stainless steel dishwasher . It is only a couple of years old but has begun to smell like mold inside . I used this product as directed and I am not amazed with the results . The smell is the same and My dishwasher does look shiney but it never looked filmy in the first place and that was not my intended purpose for this product . .
 Was having issues suddenly with the dishwasher not rinsing properly , so I picked this up and used it . Now I get white powder residue dried on all my dishes , even now MONTHS later ! I can not get rid of it !
 I have the top of the line Whirlpool dishwasher . It says on the -LRB- Summit -RRB- instructions to put the Dishwasher Magic upside down in the cutlery rack . Apparently it has a wax plug that melts that dumps magic into your machine . It might work fine if you can get it to stand up upside down in your machine . I just propped it up the best I could on the top rack . The seal did melt and the Magic poured out into my dishwasher . Besides being awkward , I noticed no difference in cleanliness .
 Same problem as Finish Dishwasher Cleaner . 2 cycles at very hot temps and the wax plug never melted . Purchased locally , but would have bought it again here at Amazon if it had worked
 Our year old dishwasher was showing white scale and the top rack was sticking when pulling it out . Used this product and now top rack slides smoothly and white scale is gone . I will definitely use this product regularly , but , will buy it at Walmart for $ 3.98 for same size bottle - $ 2.98 less ! Even with added .065 tax and the gas to get there , Amazon does not compete . I love Amazon , but , unfortunately , this time it 's not practical . The one star rating is only because of Amazon 's price .
 This did not work for us at all , not even a little bit . Maybe it works for others and that 's great but for me it was a waste of money.It would n't be so bad if it had even half way cleaned our dishwasher but it did n't even do that . Next on the list is trying the FinishDishwasher cleaner , hope I get better results because I 'm sick of white chalky residue on my black cooking utensils .
 I may need to use this a few more times before I can give a good review but as of now I 'm not impressed with it . It did not clean my dish washer at all . I love in a housing facility though with a very old washer that I 'm sure has never been cleaned and we have terrible water , we 're not even allowed to drink it . So like I said maybe a few more uses and I can change my review .
 Our dishwasher had a lot of soap buildup to the point that the main dispenser does n't open up when it should and our dishes are n't getting very clean . I 've looked online and tried a few methods -LRB- tang , vinegar , etc. . . -RRB- to no avail . So , I found a couple cleaners online and thought we would give them a try . I stared with Dishwasher Magic and had high hopes . When the cycle finished the bottle was empty but the inside of the washer had n't changed . The detergent build up was still there . Moving on to the next one ...
 This did not work but vinegar did and vinegar costs a fraction of the price that this does . I am not sure what is in it but it did n't do anything for our dishwasher .
 Even if it does I do n't believe the effect lasts too much - my dishes still need to bethoroughly rinsed before I load them.I can tell you however that my dishwasher -LRB- GE Model # GDWT368VSS -RRB- is very likely the WORST in the world . -LRB- Rest assured , you can always go wrong with a GE dishwasher.Yes , it is also an admission of sub-par intelligence since I bought another dishwasher from GE despite the terrible experiences with my previous dishwasher - from GE !! -RRB-
 I have four problems with this product.A -RRB- Product quality : My previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.B -RRB- Usability : The handles are entirely different shape and contour between models.Many do not come with a tray to hold extra blades.Many do not fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.C -RRB- Customer Service : I reported the problem to Shick , which is `` Energizer Personal Care '' .2 weeks later , they responded with apology , and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle .5 weeks after that email , I received the coupon in the mail.D -RRB- The blades clog . If I have stubble only , then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor . It ca n't be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer . If I have a couple of week 's worth of growth , the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.Overall , this product shows a lack of usability study , poor customer service , etc.Go back to Gillette . They are worth the 15 % more cost for the 3000 % better product .
 I bought this for sore muscles . Does not do a thing , like putting on regular hand lotion and works about the same on sore muscles . Did not do as advertised . I would not waste another dime on this product . I have tried other products that actually work , so I know the difference . Do yourself a favor , buy something else . Only good thing about this product is no one knows your using it due to lack of menthol smell .
 I ordered the small based on the recommended neck measurements . What the description does n't tell you is that there is a velcro strip approx 4-5 inches long that will scratch your neck if it is n't covered by the other side of the collar , so order with that in mind ! Otherwise it 's fine , your basic cervical collar ...
 My wife and I have been purchasing various items from Amazon for years , and we have never been disappointed until now . The issue is not about the cost of the item , it is about the seller NOT specifying that the item could not be returned . The collar does not fit me . Therefore I can not use it . I would suggest that all Amazon customers make purchases of items offered by Amazon ONLY !! That is what our family is going to do from now on .
 This thing has NO rigidity or stiffness . As you bring the unit up to your eye and press it against the eye orbit it collapses , and the tip of the eye drop bottle can make contact with the surface of the eye . How this ever got into production is a mystery .
 The item that you receive is Huracan energy drink . It seems to be the same contents but a different packaging . It looks like Iron Energy is going after the mexican market .
 The description says `` slipcover zips off for easy cleaning '' , but the product did not come with a slipcover . The pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern . Now I have to find a slipcover that wo n't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath .
 I have tried both the vanilla and the cookies and cream flavors and love them . I am a fan of peanut butter and chocolate mixes so I expected this to be great . It was n't . The smell of the powder alone made me cringe . The other two powders smelled wonderful to me and tasted the same so I suspected it would be bad . I mixed half a scoop with half a cup of skim milk and tried it . Gross . It does n't taste like chocolate or pb . All I can taste is the spirulina and vitamins . This flavor is a miss . I will continue to mix my chocolate whey protein powder with pb2 powdered peanut butter to fill my chocolate and peanut butter cravings .
 While they are very complete there are too many negatives to make them worth to me . First you need to take them twice a day now while this may not be a problem for some people this proved to be too much of a hassle for me I 'd always forget my morning dose . Second , they are VERY fishy ! Even hours after I 'd take them I could still taste the fish oil . With my already queasy stomach I just could n't bear to do it anymore . I am now taking prescription Natelle Plus with DHA and much prefer those .
 I think it 's the alfalfae in it that makes them smell/taste so bad , and i get this nasty aftertaste i burp up all day long with them . I only take one a day . -LRB- It says on the bottle to take more than that a day . . eww -RRB- The pills are pretty big too.Won ' t be buying again .
 DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT ! Terrible design
 I 'm a 62 year old male , 6 ' tall , weighing 250lbs . Just had my right hip replaced and am swollen . I purchased this seat based on the `` Extra-Wide '' in the product name . In reality it is not any wider than a seat I already had w/o support legs , that cost half as much . I can not sit comfortably on the seat . my hips press against the arms on both sides , and since my stitches are there , it 's painful . Also due to tight space , I 'm unable to get another body part down between my legs . Construction and ease of assembly are good , size is my complaint .
 I just rec 'd this and attempted installation . This definitely was not made to fit my Kohler Cimmaron elevated toilet . This must be designed for older model toilets that are of normal height only . First , my toilet does not have an opening between the seat and the toilet bowl -- there is a plastic plate there -- so the bracket for installation can not slip in between the toilet seat and the bowl . So , we had to remove the bracket -LRB- against the recommendation of the installation instructions -RRB- . Then , as MANY reviews on the internet state ... the legs wobble and do not sit flush on the floor -- especially if you are trying to install it on an ADA height toilet -LRB- 16 inches or greater -RRB- . So , we removed one of the padded cushions on each arm which allowed the legs to be extended to the floor -- it barely sits on the floor now . There is quite a bit of the seat that fits into the toilet bowl , so it should not come up when rising off the seat to get up after use . BUT , my elderly , overweight mother has not used it yet , so we will see . BUYER BEWARE
 We paid the premium for the steel frame because we are big 300 + lb folks . Well it is plenty strong . Problem is that the arms are to close together . After we squeeze onto the seat there is no way to wipe ! We had much better luck with an armless model and installing a safety bar out in front .
 This product fits in an elongated toilet . However , it can freely move a few inches back and forth , leading to instability when sitting down or standing , especially for people with impaired mobility . That 's because the size of the part that sits inside the toilet bowl is a few inches shorter in the front-to-back dimension than the opening in an elongated toilet bowl.I came up with a solution , using a bungee cord strapped to the two back legs and stretched around the back of the toilet , which prevents the seat from moving resulting in a much safer configuration . However , it would have been far superior if this product were available in a second version for elongated toilets with an insert designed for them .
 This toilet was extremely low and could never hold 400 lbs ... My boss almost got stuck on the toilet with this seat ... Very dangerous ... I need to return this product ASAP and would appreciate any information on how to do this ... Again the legs were cheap and could n't hold weight and the height on this chair was ridiculously low ... Thank YouGina Crespo
 This brace was recommended to me by a physical therapist when I was having problems with the tendons on the bottom of my foot . This helped give me better support while the tendons healed . As other reviewers have said it is difficult to get off and on but for me this was a small price to pay to ensure that my foot healed properly.I am very disappointed in the material . I had n't used the brace for a couple years . My foot started bothering me again so I tried to put it on and I discovered that the material that wraps around the front of the foot had degraded . It has some sort of rubber/stretchy material and it has turned into a gooey mess . I am disappointed that the brace now has to be thrown away .
 I had a severe sprain from playing hoops and was unable to walk for 2 weeks and I am still suffering 3 months later . Doctor said 1 more month of therapy . I was hoping this brace would reduce the pain as compared to my aircast and allow me to do more . I do n't think that is the purpose of the brace -LRB- reducing pain when moving -RRB- . To me it seems a mild way to brace up ankle and prevent rollovers -- Next time i would want something with a much tighter wrap around the ankle .
 do n't even try ... it 's a piece of junknot sturdy enough to support your anklematerial feels cheap and flimsy
 This whitening cream uses hydroquinone which can have some bad side effects . I broke out overnight as soon as I tried it.It was awful ! The breakout did not clear up for six months ! It also gave me a bad chemical burn which made my skin flake and peel for a few weeks . I think I may be allergic to hydroquinone as some people are . Even if you are n't there are still some very bad side effects which is why it is banned -LRB- hydroquinone -RRB- as an otc ingredient from some countries . I have been hearing great things about another closely related ingredient named alpha-arbutin . It is supposed to deliver the same results but without the nasty side effects ! There is a product named Meladerm which uses alpha-arbutin that is supposed to be very good but pricey ! I 'd rather pay that than risk another six month long pimple fest though ! I think I 'm going to give it a try .
 I was able to use this product for about a week before I had to give up due to the excruciating headaches it gave me . I only used a little bit on a brown spot on my nose , but that was enough to really affect me . About a week later , I did see that it had faded my brown spot , so it does work , I just could n't deal with the headaches . It must be very toxic in some way . I would steer clear of it . An old doctor boyfriend told me that his mother used this stuff long term and got skin cancers where she had used it , but I thought it would be okay for short term use . I guess I was wrong . I am trying the Niacin products now , and so far , no headaches or anything alarming .
 I have been using the Ambi Fade Cream for about a month now . I apply it in the morning and again at night before bed . . So far I have not seen any change in the age spots I have on my face . . Maybe if I use it longer but not any changes at this time ... I was hoping it would lighten my dark age spots that are on my face . So far have not found any product that has lighten these spots . .
 I have used almost a whold tube ... wish I could say it has worked , but has n't . I will not buy again .
 I dont know how but this product actually made me darker.And my face broke out like crazy . But I 'm not allergic to any of the ingredients.I 'll Just have to buy a natural product one WITHOUT hydroquinone .
 I brought this and used it for about two weeks morning and night just on the spots on my face and now I have white/light spots on my face . Not worth it ! Better off just having the acne scars than white/lights spots ! Beware
 This product did not work on my skin . I have fair skin with dark spots in some areas . I applied it twice a day -LRB- morning and night -RRB- . After a few weeks I began to notice that this cream was actually making the spots darker . I do n't understand why . I am not using any other creams for it to react with and I applied exactly how the directions said . Needless to say , I discontinued use and am highly disappointed . I wish I could get my money back .
 I have used this product for over a month now and I 'm not seeing any improvements . I will give it a try for another month .
 I used this product , but did not notice a difference in skin correction . I may have given up too soon . I am fairly conservative on facial products .
 Bought this based on reviews but I do not see the slightest change . It does not work very well on me .
 Worked one time on handsHasnt really worked since on hands or on forehead.No noticeable change in dark brown spots .
 Starting using 3 months ago ... . on just 2 dark spots on my face ... have not seen much improvement.Its thick and I dont like the way it makes my face feel ... -LRB- my age 62 -RRB- I am medium complexion .
 We have been a fan of the BodySox for several years . It is an excellent idea developed by a movement therapist who actually makes a living from selling them . Therapy Express has knocked off the BodySox as have others who try to get away with it by spelling it differently-BodySock . But these are not the original product . . do n't be fooled by the stolen name which by the way is trademarked . Amazon should not support this kind of behavior .
 This brace was recommended to me by a physical therapist when I was having problems with the tendons on the bottom of my foot . This helped give me better support while the tendons healed . As other reviewers have said it is difficult to get off and on but for me this was a small price to pay to ensure that my foot healed properly.I am very disappointed in the material . I had n't used the brace for a couple years . My foot started bothering me again so I tried to put it on and I discovered that the material that wraps around the front of the foot had degraded . It has some sort of rubber/stretchy material and it has turned into a gooey mess . I am disappointed that the brace now has to be thrown away .
 I had a severe sprain from playing hoops and was unable to walk for 2 weeks and I am still suffering 3 months later . Doctor said 1 more month of therapy . I was hoping this brace would reduce the pain as compared to my aircast and allow me to do more . I do n't think that is the purpose of the brace -LRB- reducing pain when moving -RRB- . To me it seems a mild way to brace up ankle and prevent rollovers -- Next time i would want something with a much tighter wrap around the ankle .

 I usually use Systane , but I was out of it . I was shopping at Whole Food , and this homeopathic product was the only dry eye product in the store , so I purchased it . I suppose it 's better than nothing - after squeezing multiple drops a few times I finally felt some relief . But the dropper is poorly designed , and it takes too long , and too much product , to get any results . Putting in my Amazon order for Systane now !
 I got the Dry Eye Relief , anticipating relief . Unfortunately the liquid only dribbled from the applicator in very small amounts . I checked the hole in the applicator and attempted to enlarge it but to no avail . What little of the product that actually got in my eyes seemed harmless enough - I did not get enough to tell if it would have provided any significant relief .
 The drip mechanism would not work . Worthless since the drops would not come out . Got mad and threw it away . Nevermind the refund , certainly not the replacement .
 Wish I could give this zero stars . This is a homeopathic product . If you do n't know what that means look it up . There 's nothing useful in it and they do give you a clue to that affect where they say it `` contains no harsh chemicals '' . I did n't catch this little detail when I ordered it . Probaby the biggest scam of the modern era . And people keep buying this stuff !
 I wanted to stop using viscine for redness relief and although this product is good for dry eyes , it did not help with redness at all . Very upsetting since it says on the label that it `` clears redness '' . Very frustrating .
 unlike the other reviewer these drops do nothing for my itchy and watery eyes . Back to Visine for me ...
 Did not work for me . Have to say my experience did not correspond to the other reviews on here . After use , my eyes felt a bit tingly and stung for a while . Eyes stayed red and only got a bit drier . Never any relief or lubricating sensation .

 This zipper pull is nothing but a little string with a hook on the end . The hook will not stay in the hole on a zipper tab , so that makes this zipper pull useless . If you are expecting something that works , I am afraid you may be disappointed . I purchased this item through Amazon .
 Broke on first use , would not buy this product . Purchased two different types because I had my doubts about this one .
 We still have not figured out what the little rings do . It is very much overpriced . It is made of poor quality materials .
 This product was a big disappointment . If you are trying to pull up a typical dress zipper that runs from the butt all the way to the neck , then do n't buy this . Its not long enough . Its also cheaply made . I have a disabling injury to my right arm and hand and bought it because it looked so easy to use . You still have to use two hands , one to hold the dress together and the other to pull the zipper . Otherwise , the you ca n't pull the zipper up .

 I ordered this product , but I have read in more than one book that these drops have been proved ineffective . The control group was given water and it worked just as well . It makes you feel so much better as a parent to be doing something ... but check out the studies . Unfortunately this product does not work.The saline drops sold by the same company are good , however .
 I tried these gas relief drops on my son numerous times . These did absolutely nothing for his gas-except when he 'd swollow them he 'd not scream for maybe a couple seconds.The pediatrician also mentioned that there have been no studies on these types of products that prove they even do anything for babies . Sometimes it will work , but if you do n't see a significant difference you should stop using them all together .

 I bought this stuff because my wife hates stinky men 's products and the can said it was `` fragrance-neutral '' . Silly me . I figured `` fragrance-neutral '' meant that it was lightly-scented or not scented at all . I could n't have been more wrong . If you 're the kind of guy who likes to slap on about a quart of Brut before you walk out the door in the morning , this stuff will fit right in . Otherwise , avoid it . The effect is like smearing a big dab of cologne right under your nostrils and then having to live with the persistent stink for the rest of the day . I got a great shave from this stuff , but the fragrance was too strong , and it does n't go away . A full day and a couple of face washes later , and I can still smell it .
 I bought this product and used it twice before tossing it out . The cream dried my skin and the shave was anything but smooth . . Use neutrogena instead ... Or for an ultimate shave . Use Lab Series Shave Cream available in Macy 's and Kaufmanns stores . Its expenisve but unlike any other product .
 I ordered the small based on the recommended neck measurements . What the description does n't tell you is that there is a velcro strip approx 4-5 inches long that will scratch your neck if it is n't covered by the other side of the collar , so order with that in mind ! Otherwise it 's fine , your basic cervical collar ...
 My wife and I have been purchasing various items from Amazon for years , and we have never been disappointed until now . The issue is not about the cost of the item , it is about the seller NOT specifying that the item could not be returned . The collar does not fit me . Therefore I can not use it . I would suggest that all Amazon customers make purchases of items offered by Amazon ONLY !! That is what our family is going to do from now on .
 The label on the bottle instructs to take 15 drops directly into mouth twice a day before meals . I did and now roof of my mouth is waxed over plus tongue is black and waxed over . The bad taste is sealed in and I have tried heating water to get rid of the wax but it would n't come off . Also other ingredient is ethyl alcohol and I am surely not in favor of using that internally . Maybe if you want to seal off an external wound and do n't mind the staining it might be good for that use . But for taking internally , do yourself a great favor and just order the UniFlora Propolis Extract -LRB- alcohol free -RRB- . It does n't taste good either , but at least you can rinse and swallow the rest of it down quickly . I was trying to save a little money . I have used 2 bottles of the UniFlora brand and it is excellent . Also guess you need to always be sure it says `` no wax '' !
 This is a traditionat Make of Diaphragm but you should indicate sizes at the shopping moment , since many sizes exist .
 I have a slightly wider than average foot for a woman , and that affected my ability to wear this splint . Although the splint is nicely padded and has nice straps to hold a foot securely , it does n't leave enough space at the ball of the foot . I traded in plantar fascitis for pain at the ball of the foot . After several nights of waking up with what might be called bunion pain -LRB- but I do n't have bunions -RRB- , I gave up on this splint .
 The stuff inside seems to work great , but after the heavy smooth jar slipped from my damp fingers -LRB- hey , it 's an after shave ? -RRB- hit my sink on it 's tumble to the floor , each impact producing a thin , sharp , sliver , one of which I found the hard way , I have to say that the marketing genius who designed this bottle ought to be dope slapped with a cow liver.This is the first glass jar product I ever bought from Nivea , and I guess my last , at least for an after shave .
 The Nivea face wash , face scrub , and protective face lotion all have a mild scent . This mild version of the balm has a strong , overpowering scent that reminded me of Old Spice or Speed Stick deodorant . I now have a bottle that has been used once , and wo n't be touched again.The subdued scent of the other Nivea for Men products is not a problem . I 'm tempted to try the sensitive skin unscented version of the balm .
 Noni juice has a LOT of claims , but this is not unusual for a lot of `` miracle cures '' and even jokingly claims to have cured cancer.It smells like foul toilet water , and tastes very bad , but not as bad as caster oil.I have allergy problems , and it made claims it does wonders for inflammation/allergies . I 'm not a beliver in any kind of medication unless it actually works , so placebos have no power to affect me . I took it everyday for a week , and I noticed no change . I feel just the same . One time I caught a bad cold and started on noni juice . Nothing.My own experience is that you have to believe it works to make it work . Some people have this notion if it tastes bad it got ta work . It also costs about ONE DOLLAR AN OUNCE -LRB- that 's the recommended dosage on the bottle -RRB- . That 's part of the placebo -- it costs a lot so it has to do something.So I wasted about $ 17 on something that looks , smells , and probably tastes like foul toilet water.How much of this is placebo ? Or getting better even without taking anything?Most people who make these outright claims are the ... distributors.Be aware that I read two people -LRB- on medical journals -RRB- had liver failure from what is linked to Noni juice , taking the standard dosage of 1 ounce a day -LRB- actually one woman took 2 liters over 3 months -RRB- . -LRB- 30 mL daily developing liver failure in about 3 months -- about Liters ... 30 mL daily for 90 days = 2700 mL . This is 2.7 Liters , so she took less than one ounce a day . -RRB- Both had no prior history of liver problems.Though this liver failure/toxicity is rare , it STILL happened.How does it interact with other medications ? I do n't know . I would n't want to be the guinae pig that finds out either.Just be careful when you deal with herbal cures . The miracle claims are no different than thousands of other snake oil treatments , and mostly from the distributors . The FDA does NOT regulate herbal cures , so their toxicity , effectiveness , etc. , etc. are unknown.Don ' t say I did n't warn you .
 In October 2010 I purchased Source Naturals L-Tryptophan . It was recommended to help me with light insomnia . One hour after taking only two 500mg capsules I became desperately ill and my health has continued to decline to this day to the point I am now housebound and can not stand for more than a few minutes due to terrible pain . My experiences led me to write two books about what had happened , the horrors myself and my young family have had to endure because I took only two Source Naturals L-Tryptophan capsules . Before and after writing the books my research turned up some very alarming information about this so called `` natural '' company . They produced L-Tryptophan in the 1980s which caused the disease I have now to endure , EMS , or Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome . They were litigated to be held accountable to the victims killed or disabled for life . Tryptophan was then banned for a period of more than a decade . And now ? Source `` naturals '' think it acceptable to buy their Tryptophan from China , where it is usually made from duck feathers , -LRB- diseased or not -RRB- . They do not tell you this on the label , the label on the bottle states `` made in the USA '' which is a lie . The Tryptophan is imported from China and merely put into capsules in the USA , then sold to an ignorant public . Legally it is a disgrace , although they are permitted to act in this manner by current legislation . So why should you care ? Why should you stop buying Source Naturals ? For one reason . They are a firm which does NOT have the consumers interests at heart . They are interested mainly in profit , as there are sources of ethically produced Tryptophan around -LRB- plenty of them -RRB- , but Source Naturals consider it more profitable to buy in bulk from the one country we have all heard so many horror stories about when it comes to foods and supplementation - China . If you wish to keep buying Source Naturals products I wish you well , and I hope and pray that you do not contract a horrible disease from their products as a result of their greed , as I have done . Think for a moment before you press that buy button - the Source Natural product you are about to buy may well have an ingredient from a VERY un-natural source .
 I bought this product thinking it would work as an antihistimine for allergies and it did n't work at all .
 Although this particular item is listed as a 1g dosage , it is not . It is 1g per serving with a serving size of three tablets . So the dosage per pill is more like 350mg .
 I bought this thinking it would work like an antihistimine for allergies and it did n't . It did n't seem to work at all .
 This product did not work for me and also gave me a minor stomach ache . I stopped taking it after almost finishing the first bottle .
 Probably not a good choice for me
 I would have to say this product was probably an awesome item for women who need a large instrument . This barely made it inside my girlfriend and almost did n't make it back out . Avoid it if you are built small down there .
 Double yikes ; this thing is huge ! I could n't even get it near me , and the vibrations are n't really that strong . 2 stars because it 's pink and soft , but I wo n't be using it again !
 I laughed when I saw this thing in person but I wasnt suprised due to the price I paid for it . The current price is way to high for the level of quality your getting . I 've yet to take this in the shower because I do n't think it will survive . At least I can still use it externally for some stimulation.Pros :1 . Silicone
 The best thing to say is that I like the color . It is like trying to start a fire with a wet match .
 I do n't see any real benefit to this . I was using this with toothpaste and my teeth did get a shade or two browner -LRB- as opposed to using electric tooth brush from sonicare -RRB- . Also , sometimes , if I angle the brush the wrong way , it irritates my gums.I feel much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush . Maybe there is something to this ionic technology , but its not ENOUGH to whiten teeth and help prevent cavities -LRB- a small cavity I had got slightly bigger -RRB- . I 'm keeping this brush exclusively for dry brushing ONLY . This is worth less as a main cleaning tool .
 I am a practicing dental hygienist -LRB- for the past 9 years -RRB- . One of my patients asked my oppinion on ionic toothbrush , so i decided to try it . I red all reviews , it sounded good enough , so i purchased it . It sucks . What a waist of $ 25 . It does n't do anything . Even a manual toothbrush does a better job . If you want great results , use Oral-B or Sonicare . Yes it is more money , but so worth it .
 I did try to believe that by just placing my wet finger over the little metal plate on the brush handle magic ions would clean my teeth and make them all better . I really did try . Finally though the silliness of it all just got to me and I got a Sonicare . Now I do n't have to pretend and it is doing wonders for my teeth and gums . Seriously . If I could give it 0 stars I would .
 My Oral-B Professional toothbrush was growing weak after four years of use , so I began searching for a replacement . Dr. Tung 's Ionic Toothbrush looked intriguing and promotional material claimed to back up its efficacy with clinical studies , so I ordered one.The Japanese-made toothbrush is approximately the size and weight of a normal , high quality manual toothbrush . The styling recalls American made clinical instruments of the sixties.The bristle arrangement is unusual , with interspersed long , soft nylon strands standing over shorter , sturdier bristles . The brush head can be replaced . The toothbrush comes with one spare brush head and one already mounted on the toothbrush.The Ionic Toothbrush has a 3V battery embedded in the handle . The battery is not replaceable but is supposed to last several years . The battery level can be checked by depressing a button on the handle which will light up a red LED if the battery is still charged.The handle is wrapped with a metal band that is connected to the positive pole of the battery . The toothbrush head is not charged . Rather , a small hole exists in the stem close to the brush head . This hole exposes the metal mounting rod for the brush head . The rod is connected to the negative pole of the 3V battery.There is a resistance of approximately 1 million ohms between my wet hand and my mouth . A 3-volt potential difference across this load will result in a current of only 3 microamps for a power consumption rate of a mere 9 microwatts.However , this assumes direct contact from my mouth with the negatively charged metal rod , which never occurs . Instead , electricity has to flow through saliva for a distance of several millimeters to reach mouth tissue . This imposes a resistance of several more million ohms , bringing the total brushing current down to well under one microamp and the electric power to under one microwatt . In comparison , there are about three microwatts of power impinging upon every square meter of the Earth 's surface from cosmic microwave background radiation left over from the Big Bang . A quartz wristwatch consumes about one microwatt of power . A typical wireless router signal carries over 70,000 times more power . An ordinary LED pocket flashlight uses several million times more electrical power than Dr. Tung 's Ionic Toothbrush delivers for cleaning.Given the exceedingly low voltage -LRB- electrostatic voltages that cause paper to cling to a balloon are on the order of thousands of volts -RRB- and the minuscule electric power delivery , it is difficult to see any potential for efficacy . Indeed , if you study some of the research backing the Ionic Toothbrush , you will find issues . For instance , one study reported no benefit from using the Ionic Toothbrush for users who already had good oral hygiene.Despite my growing skepticism , I brushed my teeth with Dr. Tung 's Ionic Toothbrush for a period of ten days . Almost immediately I could detect that my teeth were not being cleaned nearly as well as with electric toothbrushes -LRB- including brushes from Interplak , Oral-B , Waterpik and Sonicare -RRB- . After a week using Dr. Tung 's Ionic Toothbrush , by simply running my tongue against my teeth I could easily feel significant amounts of plaque that had accumulated on them in that short time.Consequently , I ordered from Amazon theOral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush . With rebate , this outstanding toothbrush only cost me about $ 50 and delivers far better cleaning for my teeth than did Dr. Tung 's Ionic Toothbrush.In summary , I detected no better performance from Dr. Tung 's Ionic Toothbrush than what one would expect from a normal , manual toothbrush costing far less . Moreover , while the principle of electrostatic manipulation of plaque might indeed lead to better cleaning , the science behind its implementation in the Ionic Toothbrush is specious . For me , Dr. Tung 's Ionic Toothbrush failed to clean my teeth nearly as well as good electric toothbrushes from Interplak , Oral-B , Waterpik or Sonicare .
 I 'd like to warn those with sensitive teeth that this toothbrush , despite having extra soft bristles , exacerbates the problem of sensitive teeth . After using it twice a day for several days , my teeth , which are usually not too sensitive thanks to Sensodyne toothpaste , suddenly became extremely sensitive to hot and cold . Brushing also became unbearably painful , all of which subsided as soon as I went back to using my regular toothbrush . The company unfortunately would not issue a refund . If there had been a warning on the packaging regarding this issue , I would not have purchased the product . Buyer beware .
 I have n't tried any others to compare , but I am having trouble consuming this product so I ca n't review if it good for the health or not . The taste is very strong .
 This stuff tastes nasty . It youre going to get this product , be prepared to gag when trying to swallow . Not entirely sure how bee pollen should taste , but from descriptions of other bee pollen types , im sure it 's supposed to taste better than this . lol !
 This review is about ear candles in general . My wife and I both tried these candles as instructed . When done , we excitedly cut open the candles and saw copious amounts of what looked like ear wax . Days later I reconsidered the ear candles and could n't convince myself of the results , despite seeing what I assumed must be ear wax in the dissected candle.I bought another candle and conducted an experiment . I lit the candle on one end and placed the other end -LRB- which would normally go into your ear -RRB- into a section of vinyl tubing . Soon , smoke was pouring out of the tubing . Thinking that an open tube did n't accurately simulate the human ear canal , I bent off the tubing thereby sealing it . Once the candle had burned down I cut it open . Sure enough , the contents of the candle with tubing at the end was identical to the candle I had held to my ear ; there was an ashy powder along with tough , brown chunks of wax . Since the contents of the candle without an ear attached to it matched the contents of the candle placed into an actual ear I can only conclude that the `` ear wax '' found in the cut-open candle does not come from your ear . It probably comes from the candle itself , but that 's just a guess.Here 's another similar -LRB- but more medically tested -RRB- story
 I saw that others spoke of the bad taste , but ignored them thinking I could handle it ... . seriously folks , PLEASE . Its disgustingly vile and would work best as a vomit inducing agent .
 I was able to get it down , finally mixing with coffee . It tasted like the water must taste in the back of an air conditioner . Indescribable , half-organic , half chemical , reminded me of the smell on the Jersey Turnpike around the refineries and garbage dumps . Worse . It did give energy which might have been the famous arterial dilation effect . A friend of mine , a nurse with strong stomach , finally returned what I loaned her to try , saying it just non-consumable . I switched to Swanson 's Arginine-AKG lemon-flavored powder , which I can easily drink .
 I 've started taking l-arginine as part of Dr. Louis Ignarro 's `` NO more heart disease '' program . This product is a good cost performer for l-arginine . The main drawback is the taste . This is the nastiest , most vile tasting substance I 've ever consumed . I first tried mixing 2 tsp with a glass of water . Absolutely disgusting . Next day I tried mixing it with my morning protein shake , which in theory should have 16 oz of fluid + protein powder + berries masking the flavor . No dice . The l-arginine powder flavor dominated every other flavor and I had 16 oz of it to drink instead of 8 . Then I tried mixing it with orange juice and could n't even taste the orange juice . The past few days I 've been `` straight shotting '' it . I mix 2 tsp of powder into a small dixie cup with about 2 oz of water and then chug it . Then I follow it with a shot of espresso or orange juice . That gets the flavor out of my mouth quickly , but it 's still disgusting.The product has a strong `` barnyard '' taste -- 1/2 rotting meat and 1/2 `` barn floor , '' if you know what I mean . My daughter said penicillin was the worst thing she 'd ever tasted . I 'd rather take penicillin than this.I 've ordered the pills , which are more expensive and I 'll have to take 5 of them , but hopefully they 'll go down easier .
 Honestly , I ignored other ppl comments in regards to the taste . I 've taken many supplements , and I think -LRB- most -RRB- people are just fussy when they say they dont ' like the tasts of stuff such as gu energy gel or whey protien . Well , this stuff is horrible ! I sipped some and almost puked all over my desk at work ! You can mask it with lemon juice.I ca n't say much about the results since I just started taking it - but from the research I looked into , this can benefit . I mean , lots of protein and water is 95 % of diet ... so I doubt I 'll be buying this stuff again . I 'll be lucky to finish this order since it tastes so bad .
 This tasted like fish and was not effective . I forced myself to drink it.But could tell it was not working and tossed it.Went back to GNC
 i love NOW brand but cmon people just get some BCAA if you want aminos . arginine does jack for a pump . NO supplements do n't work , they havent been proven to even.it smells like a load and its pretty hard to take with water .
 It smells like semen . Tastes like dirty bath water . I 've tried everything mentioned here to mix with it . Best thing i 've found is Orange Juice and just shoot it down and chase it . DO NOT SMELL IT BEFORE TAKING IT . Seriously . I 'm not joking . Smells terrible . Overpowers my protien shakes when I tried to mix it with it . I love the value here but when i 'm done with it -LRB- I refuse to waste it -RRB- i 'll probably pay more to get a flavored L-Arginine
 Not a review of the product itself , but the safety film on the top of the container was already torn off , so I must have gotten a previous return or something . Into the trash it goes . First time I have had a problem like this on Amazon .
 Frankly this product did n't even deserve a one star . Less than one star ! The taste and smell was the absolute worst ! I tried it in juice also in hopes of making it drinkable but to no avail . This product should honestly be taken off the shelves !
 So if I could get past the nastiness of the taste , this might be okay . But bottom line is it is the worst tasting thing I have ever had ... EVER ! Remember back when you were a kid and you said a cuss word and your mom shoved that piece of soap in your mouth ? After tasting this I have to call my Mom and ask for the soap ! It is seriously that bad . If you do n't have taste buds this is a great product ! If you are a Raccoon and eat garbage , Again a great Product ! And finally to all of you ogre 's out there that swim and eat from their own filth this would be perfect for you !
 I can eat pretty much anything , I just do n't care too much about the taste , however this one is beyond just a bad taste , it is much worse than just disgusting . When I opened the can it smelled very bad , similar to rotten fish mixed with spoiled eggs.I still tried it . I had to hold myself from vomiting it . It stayed down . I put the can in the fridge , and it tasted slightly better next time but the taste returned after about a week . I threw this in garbage where it belongs . I tried several other products by `` NOW '' which were great by the way , they just need to fix a taste on this one .
 I have also tried Super B anti - stress complex , 5000 mg b-12 , 5000 mg vitamin c , co - Q10 , saw palmetto , Ginza-plus , testo-rex , D3 , vitamin A , Bee Pollen , royal jelly , wheat grass juice , several teas , tested for low iron / diabetes , iron , niacin , vibe energy , emerin-c energy , soy energy drinks , multi-vitamins , magnesium , alot of teas , adrenal , nothing has worked . any suggestions ...
 This is the worst tasting stuff I have ever had . I have been taking L-Arginine for about 10 years in various forms and brands . It does not always taste great , but never this bad . I had to go buy another brand , this stuff is a wast of my money and a throw away .
 Good quaility filter but a pain to assemble . Every time I replace it I have to try to remember how to put it together . They could make the thing better for easier assembly .
 I 've been taking two tablets a night for a couple of weeks now and I have n't really noticed any difference in my sleep . I find better results when I just take a valerian tablet . I like that it has magnesium in it , which I 'm usually deficient in . It 's replaced my calcium-magnesium supplement at night , but that 's cheaper than this . I love their Life Force vitamins , but the NutraSleep is just pretty much meh .
 I do n't think this product works very well . Then again , I have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies . So maybe it is just me . I found these to be mildly relaxing but not necessarily sleep inducing . Also you have to take several -- four -- and the pills are large . I would n't buy again .
 I bought this a while back and recently started taking it again . . OMG . . Just read a review on B-12 ... Happened to mention the ingredients and what to look for and what to avoid . . I guess I should have noticed the word cyan -LRB- close to cyanide ! -RRB- might be a indicator of what it contains . . SeeCyanocobalamin is a cheap , synthetic chemical made in a laboratory . It 's virtually impossible for you to find this form in nature . Low-end vitamin manufacturers use it because it can be bought in bulk and added to products with claims that they `` contain vitamin B-12 ! '' What they do n't tell you is that the vitamin is bound to a toxic , poisonous cyanide molecule that must then be removed from your body by your liver . Cyanocobalamin is also up to 100 times cheaper than the higher quality methylcobalamin which we 'll talk about below.As Wikipedia explains
 really bad , leaked the first time i used it real bad workmanship hated it wish i had return it , i would not buy anything from this company again
 I ordered this item because I could get it included with the free super saver shipping . Also , I generally like yerba prima products . This one , however , really plugged me up . After the 1st week of the `` gentle '' cleanse I was constipated so I decided to apply the heavier cleanse -LRB- doubleing the dose -RRB- . This really plugged me up so after another 7-8 days or so I threw the remainder of the capsules out and went back to the psyllium husks + colon care formula and was regular in 2-3 days . This may work for some people but not for me !
 I bought this lighter for use as a torch for soldering and other such uses . I do n't smoke . The description above tells you that it has a lock to keep it on for continuous flame . What it does NOT tell you is that the directions say `` Do Not use continuous flame for more than 30 seconds . '' I have ruined a few nice lighters before by keeping them on too long . I bought this lighter specifically because I thought it would n't have this limitation . Needless to say , I 'm disappointed.Futhermore , the lighter I received was damaged in shipping . It was sent in a padded envelope rather than a box . It appears that someone may have dropped something heavy on it and cracked the plastic fuel tank . As a result , it leaks badly and ca n't be used . I have n't bothered trying to get it replaced as it is not a manufacturing defect and so wo n't be covered by warranty . Besides , it does n't serve my purposes anyway.I gave it 2 stars anyway because if you wanted to light a cigar and got a lighter that was undamaged , it would probably do nicely . However it is a bit on the bulky side for carrying in your pocket.Update . I superglued the crack in the tank and it seems to hold gas fine , though I do n't entirely trust it . The lighter does work well but there 's no way I would carry it in my pocket with the suspect tank.I just discovered that you can find torches on Amazon by searching `` soldering torch '' . Curiously , there are a number of torches that look very similar to this lighter that claim to be suitable for soldering . I 'm not sure how much I trust them now .
 I 've only been using this off and on for two weeks so it seems to be doing okay . I will update it as I try it more consistently and for a longer period of time.EDIT
 I purchased a bottle 100 Vcaps , and the vitamin E was in the form of d-alpha tocopherol succinate , a pure ALPHA form and NOT the much superior mixed forms of vitamin E . The various products listed here are NOT all the same.Look at the zoomed labels for each before you buy . I am a college professor who teaches an upper level nutrition course , and I PERSONALLY feel the evidence to date suggests that the only the MIXED should be used as a supplement . The Dr. Weil brand is one such product , as are SOME of these options on this page . Order with care ! Amazon , check into this .
 Had to stop taking it . Taking w/food did n't help either ! I felt like my stomach was bleeding , the pain was so bad !
 I did n't see any improvement neither in my skin nor in my circulatory system ... I guess it 's one of those products whose benefits are not easy to spot ... so , do n't waste your money
 Sorry for me . This product did not work . It actually made my condition worse . I was encouraged by the reviews so felt secure in purchasing this product . Buyer beware .
 We ended up not using this product after all . We got it for excema but it burned when applied so it was n't used again . It 'll probably make a good regular moisturer for something else . Maybe I 'll use it after a pedicure .
 I bought this to help my stomach make a thicker mucous lining to help heal a stomach ulcer . This product helped my ulcer pain slightly . I think it would work better if it did n't have additional ingredients that are stomach irritants . I switched to dried licorice root and it worked tremendously better . The dried root still has the DGL so I had to monitor my blood pressure . If you have high blood pressure the DGL licorice is the way to go , but I would try a different brand than this . I 'm not a doctor and I 'm not offering this information as medical advice .
 This DGL is as far from chewable as a pill comes . This tablet sits on my tongue like a dirty rock . I bought a twistable pill crusher to try to pulverize it before chewing it . Fifteen minutes of `` crushing '' later more than half of it is still solid . This is the only vegan DGL chewable I could find . The flavor is not too bad . It tastes like it was licorice at one time but with a sandy feel . I 've tried sucking on it also , after about fifteen minutes I end up just swallowing it . The reason I am still using it is because I am having chemo therapy treatments right now and my ND recommend the chewable to help with oral erosion . So , I 'm stuck with it . If you do n't need chewable vegan DGL , then do yourself a favor and try something else .
 I was really hoping this product would work in my closet ; however , I am sadly disappointed . My closet smelled fresher for the first day or so , but by the 3rd or 4th day , any scent was long gone . My closet does not smell fresh and it definitely does not smell `` ocean-air fresh ! '' The clothes hanging in that closet are not stinky ; they are just rarely worn and I wanted something to keep them smelling fresh . On the plus side , I did not spend very much for them - they come in packets of 2 . Perhaps they would work better in a much smaller closet . The closet they were hanging in was a normal sized , bedroom closet . I will not be purchasing these again , but I will continue to look for a product that addresses my needs .
 This product is not worth purchasing , even though it is sold at a very cheap price . Now I understand why . This item barely has a scent . When placed in closet , I did not notice any difference . I defintely will not purchase this item again . SAVE YOUR MONEY & TIME .
 This thing is heavy which makes it a bit difficult to use when cutting your own hair especially holding a mirror with one hand . The 20.00 cutter at Rite Aid is easier to handle.Also , the smallest length attachment does n't line up with the metal cutters and it has some burrs on it which tend to scrape the scalp a bit.Buy the cheap model and replace the whole shaver when dull .
 This product did not meet my expectations . It does cut thick hair easily , but it gets hot pretty fast -LRB- Andis cool care did nothing ! -RRB- and its pretty heavy . This is not a good clipper if your cutting your own hair . I 've messed up many hair cuts using this clipper . i would n't recommend this clipper , especially at the price it sells at .
 Poorly manufactured product ! Im a stylist and have heavy use , but only after two weeks they broke on me . On the up side they are pretty lol .
 I bought this item because the price was right , it looked really cozy and my feet are always cold . After receiving it though , I can only give it two stars though because first of all , it does n't get very warm very quickly . You almost have to stand on the unit -LRB- at least apply pressure -RRB- to feel the warmth , which is difficult when you are sitting . Also , I frankly found the massage portion annoying , it just vibrates and it also cycles through two different speeds -LRB- It does n't have two different speeds , it just switches back and forth occasionally while it 's on -RRB- . Most of the time I do n't even turn it on . It does work as advertised , just do n't expect too much .
 I bought this item to warm my chronically cold feet . I can barely feel the heat , even after an hour or so . I get better results with regular socks . The massage portion is worthless . All it involves is a strong vibration .
 They wont hold a charge after about 6 months . I wouldnt recomend this item . their cheap but they show that they are too !
 The small digital clock worked but the face clock did n't work . The second hand did n't move at all . You get what you pay for . The clock is cheap in all aspects . The company was good about accepting a return . Unfortuantely my blind friend will get her gift that I exchanged for after Christmas .
 I ordered the Concord Sodium Bicarbonate , they sent me Rugby Sodium Bicarbonate , yet the invoice read CONCORD . Rugby Sodium Bicarbonate is n't have as good as Concord Sodium Bicarbonate . Concord desolves perfectly , taste unnoticable , Rugy taste like fish water and is graining in the glass . I 'm a big user of Concord Sodium Bicarbonate and miss not being able to get it here on Amazon.SincerelyBill in Las Vegas ; - -LRB-
 The Sodium Bicarbonate tablets were obviously old . They had crystallized and had an `` old '' taste .
 This is the worst thermometer . I can take my temp 6 times and get 6 different temps . The instructions are clear but it just is n't dependable . Why bother ? And I just discovered I ca n't return it to Amazon.com . Do n't waist your money .
 This never gave a normal reading when I tested it , gave mostly low readings , and when I did have a fever-checked with a mouth thermometer-it read low . From reviews , it looks like there 's no quality control at all . After a parent depends on this thing and then discovers her child has been running a 103 temperature , we 'll see the first product liability lawsuit-also naming Amazon-on this thing . Then Amazon will take it off the shelf .
 This thing worked for maybe the first month . It has now stopped workign properly . It reads out temps of 65 . Boy , I hope my son 's temp isnt running that low . We had to end up buying a different brand .
 I normally do n't write reviews , but feel a need to as this effects the health of your and my baby . I bought this inJanuary and have used it multiple times over the last few months . Followed the instructions to a T , even worked with a nurse to make sure we were not using this incorrectly.It is consistent . . for sure . . consistently inaccurate to the tune of more than a degree , sometimes even two . Yes it is fast , but whats the use of a fast read when it can not be relied upon?I spoke to their customer service and even they would not stand behind their product . They say they can not guarantee the accuracy and offered to issue me a coupon for some other product from their website . I wish I had read a clear review when I bought this , hopefully this will help some of you make up your minds .
 We both tried different positioning in our ears to get an accurate readout on this thing , probably tried it 50 times each . Never got similar readings and never higher than 96-something , which is n't possible . Coulnd ' t return this thing because the time limit is 30 days from date of purchase . Waste on money and time .
 This thermometer worked with accurate readings the first time my daughter was sick . Then a few months later when she was sick again it did not give accurate readings -LRB- kept saying her temperature was 94-95 degrees -RRB- . Then it just completely stopped working at all . Very cheap . Not worth it .
 I have n't gotten this thermometer to hit 98.6 yet . I do n't think I 've seen it get to 98.0 . I have established baseline temperatures for my child and myself so I will know if we are running a fever . That does n't help me much to determine our exact temperature . I 'm not sure if the thermometer is defective or if this is just the way they work . I am dissapointed with this purchase , but I 'm not going to return it . Too much of a hassle .
 the product was here fast but there was something weird about it.the bottle is just like the ones i have bought before around town.but it does not taste the same way -LRB- compared to the others -RRB- . maybe its just my imagination but it just taste like bottled water.is there a bottle water like herbalife aloe product?i am sorry for the review if i am wrong .
 I bought this to use for my child . I had wanted to try the ear type thermometer for a while . The first two reading seemed to be correct but after that it was horrible . The readings were all over the place on multiple uses , and were not reliable at all . It is also hard to tell if the probe is positioned in the childs ear correctly . The batteries did not last long either . I do not like or trust this thermometer and am must happier and confident with the plain old stick thermometer . I do NOT recommend this product .
 I tried putting it in my ear every which way I could imagine , but never registered anywhere near 98.6 . More like 93.6 , 94.3 , 95.2 , 96 , 97 ? I am not going to risk an exchange . I just bought a forehead LCD model for $ 2.00 . I expect accuracy when paying close to $ 40 for a Thermometer .
 Peppermint was suggested to me by my gastroenterologist and I 'd searched for them in local pharmacy and grocery but did n't find them . I knew could probably get them at a vitamin store but did n't want to make a special trip so ordered off Amazon -LRB- my preference for online ordering -RRB- . Pills arrived on time and packaged well ... thing is they are too big for me to swallow . Nothing against the seller , my throat is too sore to swallow large pills and I forgot to check if they were capsules , they were not they are solid pill and too large for me . I did n't send them back but will never take them ... someday they will wind up in the trash . If you have problem swallowing pills , do n't get these . -LRB- They are blue and have a strange odor too -RRB- .
 I took this because it was recommended for SIBO - made it worse . I had stomach pain from taking this - stopped waste of $ !!
 I bought this thinking that being a HoMedics product I could be fairly assured of quality . It doesnt work very well . It is hard to get into the proper mode -LRB- fahrenheit versus celcius -RRB- and does n't seem to wait long enough for a true temperature before stopping.I would n't recommend it .
 I need my money back ... because until now I did n't got this product ... I waiting so long time to got this product
 This doent work at all ! Would n't recommend ! Smelly like fish oil and doesnt knumb anything no matter how much you use
 Stud 100 does not work at all atleast for my Husband . He used it and it didnt do what it was ment to do
 This product did n't work for me . I felt no difference in the sensitivity after applying it .
 its the worst i try never ever not working may be with another people work better its burn too some times
 Never received this product . Took my money and ran with it . If it was sent it was n't sent to me . I rated it a 1 but should be 0 .
 Just like the Stallion , it does n't work.Doesn ' t do a darn thing to make you last longer . That 's probably why it comes in a package of 3 , with no option to buy just one . They know that you will not be a return customer , so get as much money as they can the 1st time .
 This stuff is absolutley worthless . It does the opposite of what it intends to do . It claims that it will prolong your climax and boy oh boy did it lie . After using it and spraying it on myself I found it impossible to keep an errection . It ended my night with my date before it began . Instead of going at it for 2 hours and adding an extra hour with this product we had to reschedule because I was completely numb and never got started . Do not buy products like this because they are worthless .
 Not much to say about this product . It does desensitize but you really have to put alot on , not the 3 pumps like they say .
 This product , when applied , created a somewhat burning/tingly sensation that was supposed to act as a numbing agent . It became more a distraction which also left the penis skin with a strange dry texture . Overall , it did not numb as it said it would . Would not buy it again . Threw it out after the first session .
 In addition to desensitization , I also feel heat - but not of the good , welcoming kind , more of a chemical burn . It 's also definitely not something to be used without a condom , as your partner will feel unpleasant effects as well . Another product I 've tried does not produce that sensation . Wo n't buy this again .
 Do yourself a favor . Do n't waste your hard earned money on this crap ! Product is so inferior compared to Indian God spray lotion !!
 This item is not as good as it saids . I spray 6 times and it only last for 15 min .
 I did not find this item to be of any help in what it claims to be of help I hope a different product is better
 I did not like it it did not work for me . I only use the suggested amount maybe if i apply more it may work . It just was not what i expected .
 This mirror is large , light , and distortion free - and the stand idea works . But as for the lighting ... it was downright laughable ! It is two tiny dim flashlight spots . It does n't light the mirror surface AT ALL . This would possibly get 3 stars from anyone just wanting it for a magnifying mirror , if it did n't claim that it was a lighted mirror . It is NOT a lighted mirror - it is a mirror with a lighted handle !
 I ordered one of these mirrors for my mom and one for me . After much prodding , she admitted that she could n't see with the mirror , the lights did n't shine on the viewing area . The next time I visited , I checked the mirror and sure enough , the lights were dim . I ordered another one for her and tried to return the first . The price had gone up $ 5 and there is a return fee . I just ordered another one , it did n't work either . Out of three mirrors , one worked sporadically . I boxed up the other two and sent them back with a letter . I was never reimbursed , did n't get the mirrors back and did n't hear from the company.Crappy mirrors , crappy service .
 Bought this for my husband and he hates it and says it is uncomfortable and the pad slips up and down . He tried to use it on a chair , but you 'd be hard pressed to find a comfortable chair , ie recliner , which this would fit on . It 's being sold in our next yard sale . Maybe someone else would like it . In my opinian it 's a piece of junk .
 When I had my baby 3 years ago I wanted really good quality products , and after research I picked California Baby products . Their diaper cream is wonderful and I loved most their products.The bubble bath was great , so much that I did not mind ordering it shipped to Canada and paying all the duty to have it shipped from the states.My most recent order was a real disappointment though . The bubble baths have been watered down . They run like water . They used to be very thick and last a long time . It is almost impossible to make bubbles now it is so thin.We liked a lot of the scents . The cold & flu was particularly helpful when my daughter was stuffed up . Unfortunately this last batch -LRB- I ordered a bottle of just about all the scents -RRB- had also changed in that you could barely smell the scent anymore.HOpefully they go back to their original quality .
 I read on one of the hair forums that this was supposed to relax your curl pattern and make your hair less kinky , but after 2 months of taking one capsule per day , I saw no difference .
 You may want to do the math before you get suckered into buying the `` new and improved '' Areds2 version of this vitamin . The only difference between the original `` Lutein '' formula and the new Areds2 formula is the addition of 1000 mg of Omega 3 . However , you now need to take 4 -LRB- four -RRB- Areds2 tables daily instead of only 2 -LRB- two -RRB- tablets of the original Lutein formula . OK , so it the Lutein formula does n't have fish oil . Fish oil is cheap.Here are some # 's for you
 I have been taking this for a long time but my eye doctor at UCLA changed me to Maxivision . Its been getting rave reviews and my mother who has had AMD for 3 years now has had her vision stable since she has been taking Maxivision . I think its a better formula .
 Product was recommended by my eye doctor . I really have no way of knowing if it is helping , but will continue taking it as long as my doctor recommends it .
 When I read the daily doses on the box , I decided that I was not going to take these pills : Vit A 572 % DV ; Vit C 745 % DV ; Vit E 1334 % DV ; Zinc 464 % DV ; Copper 80 % DV . This was way overdosing except for the copper . I already have a healthful diet which gives me some of the vitamins and minerals included in this medicine and take lutein/zeaxanthin for my eyes .
 My husband ordered these on the advice of his eye doctor -- saw no change , one way or the other , so stopped taking them .
 I only took the 2 sample pills in 2 days , and found them too strong and they made me feel lethargic and increased the urgnecy to urinate .
 It 's okay , but not worth the price . It tends to slip and slide on floor or carpet . Not very stable .
 After searching for a long time for a natural deodorant to replace my toms deodorant I decided to try weleda wild rose . I used this product only once and will have to give it away.The smell was really overwhelming which made me nauseous.I really had high expectations for this product , but i was a total waste of money .
 I typically use the chemical deodorant and have been looking to make the switch to natural . Regular deodorant -LRB- not clinical strength -RRB- works just great for me , and I do n't actually sweat much so I do n't think I 'm a `` hard case '' in the deodorant department . Anyway , I 've tried this deodorant for a few days and it lasts about 4 hours before the underarm smell begins to break through . Once that happens , reapplication does n't really help . Since I am looking for an all-day natural deodorant , I am forced to say that this deodorant is a failure .
 I have been searching for years for a natural deodorant that works . I have bought just about every natural one on the market , including the crystals , and even made my own deodorant , which worked , but was messy . So I decided to give this one a shot given the positive feedback.Pros
 I bought this product thinking that I could return it if I did n't like it . -LRB- Usually Amazon is great about this . -RRB- Wrong.Apparently , this is due to it being a liquid and so it 's considered hazardous and not returnable . So , either buy this from a local store or be super sure you want it before you purchase .
 I purchased this because I 've had good results from Weleda 's products and decided to try this deodorant.Well , it keeps you from smelling bad for a day . That 's about it.If you like the fragrance of roses , however , and are looking for a natural deodorant with this essence , you will be disappointed . The rose smell is mixed with lemon and the result is comparable to a supermarket furniture polish.If you are looking for a gentle floral , I suggest Aubrey Organics Calendula . If you like citrus , Weleda makes a nice citrus deodorant . This product just seems to miss the mark .
 Do not buy this product , at least not until you find it in a store and try the fragrance . The smell is VERY strong and overwhelming . Contains a lot of alcohol and fragrance ; not just natural ingredients . On top of it all , you can not return it because it is classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases and can not be returned to Amazon.com .
 I purchased this product as I am looking for a more natural deodorant . This product did n't work for me . It might be okay as a body spray . . but not as a deodorant . I had my hubby asking me why I smell like rubbing alcohol -LRB- not good -RRB- . It also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving .
 Lately I 've learned not to assume that a product is safe just because it 's sold in a health food store . I recently discovered the Skin Deep Database , where you can look up products and ingredients to find out if they contain toxins . I 'd used this deodorant for two years . Even though it only kept me smelling fresh for a few hours , I figured it was better/safer than the drugstore brand I had been using . Wrong ! When I looked it up on the Skin Deep Database , I found out that this deodorant rates a 4 on the toxin scale , which is the `` caution '' range . I switched to Lafe 's spray deodorant , which is a 0 on the toxin scale , and it works MUCH better without any toxins . Lafe 's keeps me and my husband smelling good from morning to bed time .
 I THINK THIS DEODORANT IS PRETTY STINKY AND COULD HAVE BEEN MADE A LITTLE BETTER SMELL . I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE IT JUST WREAKED AND HAD NO PLEASANT SMELL TO IT : -LRB-
 I had high hopes for this after reading a number of good reviews on here . The other reviewers must have low expectations . Seriously . This does not stop odor . It is just a really strong smelling body spray . Even after discovering that it did n't work I might have used it as a body spray except for the fact that it smells like a 90 year old lady 's perfume . Very strong floral/baby powderish smell . It gave me a headache . I suggest avalon organics grapefruit and geranium spray if you are looking for something effective -LRB- you may have to reapply it once or twice if it is warm weather or if you are a heavy sweater but at least it does work -RRB- . That is what I will be going back to . I tried this because I just wanted to try something different and there were glowing reviews . Big old waste of money : -LRB-
 I am not sure about the other varieties , but I do not like how Wild Rose smells , it does have a sort of baby powder/alchohol smell to it However , it does seem to work . I think I will try another scent .
 I have had System Jo products in the past that have been hit or miss . This one is a miss for me . It wears off quickly and leaves a sticky film everywhere . The biggest thing that annoys me is the fact that I could not find the ingredient list before purchasing . I am pretty strict about what I buy according to the ingredients . So for everyone out there , here is a list of INGREDIENTS
 Do n't waste your money , this stuff is a bad joke . It 's supposed to be natural , but it 's just irritating , and not very lubricating . Wears off quickly too .
 I read that B1 can build up in your system to prevent bites . I took this faithfully for 4 weeks and saw no improvement . The product itself seemed fine , no complaints about the smell or taste but I am left wondering if a different brand would be more potent and help . I am extra attractive to mosquitoes .
 Customer service is good , as expected , timely , would do business with them again . The product is very messy and stains - would look for an alternative and use this as a last resort .
 It 's hard to comment on the effectiveness of the product because I only used it once on my finger nail . It stained my nail so much it looked worse then the infection . I suppose I should give it a chance , but it 's hard to walk around with a dark purple nail and explain it to people who ask ! If you want to try it just be aware that it really stains !
 I ordered the small based on the recommended neck measurements . What the description does n't tell you is that there is a velcro strip approx 4-5 inches long that will scratch your neck if it is n't covered by the other side of the collar , so order with that in mind ! Otherwise it 's fine , your basic cervical collar ...
 My wife and I have been purchasing various items from Amazon for years , and we have never been disappointed until now . The issue is not about the cost of the item , it is about the seller NOT specifying that the item could not be returned . The collar does not fit me . Therefore I can not use it . I would suggest that all Amazon customers make purchases of items offered by Amazon ONLY !! That is what our family is going to do from now on .
 Overall this trimmer did not work as I had expected . I went over the same area maybe 5 or 6 times and it did not look or feel any smoother than it did before I started trimming . I do not recommend this product . I almost think that buying a men 's electric razor would work better .
 The product delivered was not a Pro-Tec brand but instead a Swede-O . The stirrups are not made of Dupont Surlyn , but of an unknown plastic -LRB- If you 're going to advertise the material a product is made from , it should actually be that -RRB- . I am not sure if the Pro-Tec would be any more rigid , but I can easily flex the SWEDE-O brace from side to side in my hands with little pressure . If I can do that with my hands , how will the stirrups offer any added protection from rolling my ankle while running?I will be returning this .
 I ordered this brace because I have just gotten off crutches after a serious sprain . I was thrilled when it was delivered a mere 2 days after I ordered it . The brace I was sent was manufactured by a company called Swede-O . My fault with this product is that I trust the Pro-Tec company name and order their brand of protective gear and have never been unsatisfied with the quality.I do not like being misled and not being given the product I ordered .
 This seemed to make my foot even colder . But that is probably an unfair assessment , since it was so uncomfortable that I could n't wear it for more than ten minutes . It simply added `` and clammy '' to the description of my `` very cold '' feet . My foot might have warmed up later , there in that little straight jacket for feet . I have permacold feet due to chemotherapy , but hand warmers placed between layers of socks are far more comfortable than this . It was also a little annoying to find that I had indeed ordered a `` foot '' warmer , and not `` feet '' warmers . For that price , I kind of expected there would be two . -LRB- But of course , it does say one foot warmer , so that is really my mistake , not Thermoskin 's -RRB- . I like the idea of a specialty item to really warm up cold feet . For me at least , this was not it .
 I have neuropathy due to chemotherapy and my feet always feel cold . I thought these would be a blessing but they really do n't do much better than a good pair of socks and slippers .

 According to the FDA web site Federal Marshals seized Wyldewood Cellars ' elderberry juice because of mislabeling and unfounded health claims . The press release was dated June 3 , 2011 .
 The formula listed and the product description are different.The active ingredients are 500mg and 400 mg respectively.You have it listed as 1500 and 1200 . Does this mean that 3 tablets gives the 1500 and 1200 . What gives here.Is this done purposely ??? Cosamin DS-Double Strength Glucosamine Formula , 230ct
 I tried this Irish Spring bar soap and personally I thought the scent was too strong and I agree with the reviewer that this is probably better for a man to use . Personally as a girl I prefer my soap to have a more feminine scent like some of the flower or fruity scents . I would recommend this soap for men but not for women who prefer a more dainty feminine scented soap and I think the only reason I even used this soap was because I ran out of my soap and the only thing available in the bathroom cabinet was a package of this soap .
 It 's a pleasant fragrance but it 's not close to the original.Recently , my wife bought me a pair of Irish Spring Body Wash liquid containers . My love affair for Irish Spring was born again . It left me fresh for many hours with that rich fragrance . Those are virtually gone except for a small dispenser I tote with me when on a road trip . It was time to get more.This time , however , I opted for that pack of 3 bars of Original Irish Spring . Yes , I 'm being frugal as much of that precious liquid escaped to the shower floor.However , the fragrance of the bar soap is not the Irish Spring Original . Not even close . Yes , it 's the same striations of various green hues . And it 's a pleasant fragrance which I really do n't know how to describe.My suspicion ? Colgate-Palmolive got their perfume batch from one of their other products mixed in with the Irish Spring .
 I ran out of my soap and I had to use this Irish Spring bar soap which was the only soap available in the bathroom cabinet and to be honest the scent was just too strong and overpowering ! It may be a fine soap for guys but personally it 's a bit strong for girls , at least it is for me . I would only recommend this soap to people who like their soap to have a strong potent scent !
 I tried this soap once and I did n't care for the scent . It was too strong .
 The item description says 32 ounces and the picture says 90 grams -LRB- 3 ounces -RRB- . Which is it ?
 I only have two things to say ... One , this grape flavor was disgusting . Second , the cleanse was n't very pleasent in my experience . I guess thats why it 's half the cost than at the store . . Not my best investment on this site .
 This seemed to make my foot even colder . But that is probably an unfair assessment , since it was so uncomfortable that I could n't wear it for more than ten minutes . It simply added `` and clammy '' to the description of my `` very cold '' feet . My foot might have warmed up later , there in that little straight jacket for feet . I have permacold feet due to chemotherapy , but hand warmers placed between layers of socks are far more comfortable than this . It was also a little annoying to find that I had indeed ordered a `` foot '' warmer , and not `` feet '' warmers . For that price , I kind of expected there would be two . -LRB- But of course , it does say one foot warmer , so that is really my mistake , not Thermoskin 's -RRB- . I like the idea of a specialty item to really warm up cold feet . For me at least , this was not it .
 I have neuropathy due to chemotherapy and my feet always feel cold . I thought these would be a blessing but they really do n't do much better than a good pair of socks and slippers .

 Reviewing the Peach , Passionfruit , and Mango Flavor
 I bought this after I read reviews about how wonderful it tastes . Well , it did n't taste that great to me . It did n't taste like berries . I was using Chewable Vitamin C by NOW products and that orange taste was like drinking a glass of Tang.The tablets are HUGE ! It was a little hard to just pop in your mouth and chew . I wo n't be buying this anymore . No one in my family likes it and I am stuck chewing all of this !
 The plus to these is that they are naturally flavored and colored . The down side is the taste . Nasty ! My kids wo n't take them , I wo n't take them ... wasted $ .
 This bottle smells so good , I thought these would taste even better than the Nature Made orange flavored C tablets we usually take . Boy was I wrong . Colored with red cabbage ????? Did they think the flavor would n't get in there too ? Who needs color in their vitamins , artificial or natural ? I wish I had read reviews before purchasing.I understand why some people awarded stars for `` quality '' . But I do n't see what 's so hard about making pure , natural vitamin C tablets , so I 'm being a toughie and 1 star it is . I 'm so cheap I 'll probably end up using them . Doubt my husband will touch them.Edit
 Straws were covered with a hazy film , I have to wipe and rinse each straw before using . I do not recommend them .
 I am not new to creatine usage . I 've used Jack 3d for almost a year now for atleaste 5 times a week . Never had any side effects and always feel very energetic when it starts kicking in . On top of that , they have a taste that everyone can handle.However , I can not say the same for this Universal product . The taste is just awful , it taste just like the powders in pills . . VERY bitter . Also , I 've tried 3,2 , and 1 scoops , I felt no energy and it leaves me nauseated . I had a very hard time working out with it because me really makes me to NOT want to workout at all.Its just a bad product . Sure you get more for your money , but whats the point when this product does n't even work and sets you back ? Very disappointed .

 I bought this when Amazon was selling 3 for $ 15 . . a pretty good deal . I should 've known better since I 've never seen this in the store . I have sensitive eyes and this stuff BURNS . It feels like I just put jalapenos in my eye . No matter how long I leave it in I still need to rinse it with another saline . Opti Replenish is much better .
 Bought this for hubby when he had major surgery , to help him get his socks on when I was not home to help him . It is soooo big around , to get your sock around it , would stretch your socks out . Hubby said `` heck no ! '' Gave it to my father . Have no idea if he has used it or not .
 this scock aid the sewing came undone after 2 weeks and has become unuseableI have had other scock aids thet have lasted for more than 2 -LRB- TWO -RRB- years I want a replacement or my money BACK
 I have been using a `` Stocking Aid '' -LRB- an item that is difficult to find -RRB- for about 20 years due to Rheumatoid Arthritis . Some have been excellent This one , however , is literally unusable . A stocking aid needs to be flexible ; this one is extremely rigid . Not only is it impossible to place a sock over it -LRB- not enough `` stretch '' in the sock -RRB- , but it does not allow your foot to `` slide '' down the aid into the sock . My recommendation ? Do not purchase . There are ones available that work amazingly well .
 I had a simular item to this one , I got while in hospital and it lasted about 3 years before plastic broke . I made a mistake I ordered 3 of the Maddack Deluxe flexible Sock and Stocking aid ; white and the White material around one is raveling very bad . I have not opened one of the remaining 2 . I had planed to use one for a gift , but this changed my mind . I do not recommend this item .
 I do not recommend this product . The straps fell off in three weeks . Buy something different if at all possible .
 Perhaps the reason I did n't like this item is because I really do n't need it yet.I tried it and discovered that it was much easier to put my socks on by hand .
 This device will not make you happy if your need it to overcome a limitation . Frankly , to get the sock on with this thing , you need to be able to get the device onto your foot -- if you can do this , you 'd not need the device at all . The same limitations that keep you from putting on a sock will frustrate you with this device . You will break a sweat trying to get your toes in far enough as you wiggle your foot and the device . It is not the answer . In fact , it is the wrong item to buy for someone struggling to get dreessed . Then should you get your foot in it , you have to muscle it up your foot . The sock will not gently glide up onto your shoe . I would think this a great Aprils Fools Day toy at best , but at worst it is not something even worth trying .
 My sock aid I used daily for five years cracked just before I was leaving for vacation . I ordered this one because of the ability to get it fast . The type I use is a similar one but is solid -LRB- not the three finger design -RRB- . Unfortunately it was not available for Amazon Prime shipping . It was free shipping but would take 5 days to get to me . Expedited shipping cost way more than the unit cost.This unit is poorly constructed . After 2 weeks of use , the blue material is separating from the white . When you put the sock on the unit , the thing collapses at the bottom where only a child could get it on easily . I have a size 7 woman 's foot and had trouble getting it into the sock . The pull straps are also fraying and coming apart from the main unit.Save your money and order Mecanaids found at this Amazon URL
 The Deluxe Sock Aid is not designed as easy as it looks . My mother found it to be cumbersome and ackward .
 not very good for someone who has trouble squeezing . The sock appliance is too stiff - he can not fold it to insert it into the sock .
 If have strong hands , socks with large easy opening and want this to be hard without bending - that is what this is.But if any hand troubles or just want easy flexible inserting for sock - this is NOT it . I bought this thinking it was the same as what I had , but definitely not . -LRB- I have size 8 feet -RRB- I guess hardness helps keep the opening very large but makes it impossible to get sock on due to hand difficulty . And I do n't need an opening anywhere that large.Recommend instead : Carex Sock AidGood flexibility and still large enough opening for my 8 size feet .
 My husband recently developed severe osteoarthritis knee pain , making it impossible to bend his knee enough to put on his sock . Suddenly , he was no longer independent , but had to rely upon me for many things , but especially to help him get dressed in the morning.While I love my husband , it is n't good for any of us to have to count on someone else , and this was a very frustrating period for us.Then , amazingly , a friend who had hip surgery introduced us to the `` Sock Aid . '' Hers was similar to this , and she happily demonstrated . We have Prime , so the next day , our Sock Aid arrived.We chose it because it had the flexible opening on the end , which makes it easier to put the sock on - hers was a firm end . The inside makes it easy for the foot to slide , and the terrycloth exterior easily pulled up the sock . It has a firm plastic interior , which holds it open for slipping your foot into it . Even more , it says it is washable . It works so great , I might buy one for myself ; - -RRB- Anyway , Hubby is happy and independent again , and I am happy that he can be free from my `` mothering . `` Edited - Within 2 weeks , this wonderful aid began to unravel and come apart . I am now purchasing another brand to replace it ... I have changed my stars from 5 to 1 , since it should NOT come apart . -LRB- Note , it was never washed , it simply came apart from pulling socks onto the foot.Edit ... We tried theCarex Sock Aid , however the size ran small , and it did n't fit my husband 's foot.Edit ... After several different tries , we finally settled onEssential Medical Supply Everyday Essentials Deluxe Hard Plastic Sock Aid . It was n't perfect , with the handle , it kept ending up on the wrong side of the foot - so my husband cut the handle ... and now it works perfectly . :--RRB- Finally , problem permanently solved -LRB- I hope -RRB- .
 I purchased this product because I have ALS -LRB- Lou Gehrig 's Disease -RRB- and I have difficulty putting on socks among other things . I was hoping that it would help make it easier . Unfortunately , I ca n't even begin to load the sock onto the device so it 's basically worthless to me . If you have any difficulty with your hands , this item is not for you . If hand strength is n't the issue , it will probably be a worthwhile purchase .
 After struggling for 20 or 30 minutes was able to get socks on but they were damaged do n't recommend this product
 I tried to use with compression stockings . This device was made for regular stockings . My mistake ordering this product . However I do n't recall any indication as to the type of stockings that could be used .
 This device has a terry cloth covering which makes it nearly impossible to easily slip into the opening of socks . It is also shorter in length than other models , which means long socks simply can not be pulled onto the leg at all . I found it very difficult to use , and not at all helpful .
 I orderd and received on time but they where not made by Ableware as stated in ad . It was made by G4 medical . Very poorly made and on first use started to tear wear strap is attached to terry cloth and nylon sleeve
 Perhaps I did not use it correctly but after about 6 or 8 uses the straps began to tear . After a few more uses the whole thing came apart .
 I found the concept good , but the quality of this item was very poor . The terry cloth cover quickly began to ravel and after 2 weeks the pull handles tore off .
 If you are using support hose , the product is not very friendly . It simply may be that this product was made for regular socks or stocking .
 I was very sorry I bought this product . After having a complete knee replacement I tried to put my support socks on ... ouch ... painful ... Next time I will get one without hard plastic in it
 We were so disappointed and sent it back . Impossible to use on support hose . I guess some people can use it for putting on their sox , but it was of absolutely no help to us . It is especially difficult if you have arthritis .
 I bought this item to replace what appeared to be an identical one that my 91 year old father had been using for about four years . Within a week , the terry portion began to unravel causing him no end of trouble . Now , I have to hit the medical supply stores to find one that will hold up for the few more years he has left . I do n't buy many things from Amazon that are not quality . This was an exception .
 Unless your foot and leg are equal to or less than the diameter of the compession stocking -LRB- which would defeat the purpose of compression stockings and provide no compression -RRB- do not purchase this item . The stocking is stronger than the stocking aid and shrinks the opening to the smallest diameter of the stocking opening , making it impossible to slip your foot into the opening , let alone insert your lower leg . If you can insert your foot , pulling the stocking aid results in the removal of the aid without pulling up the stocking . Exhausting work and not returnable . The label says
 I bought this item for my husband . He has a difficult time putting on his socks . It did NOT work for him . Perhaps it may for someone else . Gave it to Goodwill .
 It is TO STIFF not flexible ca n't bend it enough to fit into stocking or sock especially not good if you have the least bit of arthritis in your hands
 This product looked like a good solution to my problems
 This tape was way too wide for me . I have very close contacts between some of my teeth and I could n't get this between them . It became stuck and I had to go buy other floss to get the ripped piece out . Maybe I got a bad batch but all the other reviewers talk about it being very wide as well . I always buy tape instead of regular floss because I can actually use it . This one was totally different than any other tape I 've bought .
 I floss my teeth every night using tape-type floss . I had tried the regular Glide and really hated it . This is better because it was thicker , but I still did n't like it nearly as much as my regular brand . The two primary things I disliked about it were
 The item pictured and advertised as a genuine Johnson & Johnson product was not a JNJ product.Amazon should not advertise it as Johnson & Johnson.The original product was superior to the product that is being sent to customers who answer the Johnson & Johnson ad .
 This product was formerly produced in the US . It now comes from China and it has a rather nasty aftertaste and collapses easily .
 This seemed to make my foot even colder . But that is probably an unfair assessment , since it was so uncomfortable that I could n't wear it for more than ten minutes .

 be careful when you buy this and realize that this ONLY comes with the pin wheel , instead of the entire set like the picture implys , i had selected a differetn pinwheel , when at the bottom of the screen it did that `` buy this and this '' and get a discout thing ... well ... i did and didnt quite pay as much attention as i should have ... . and i over payed for my pinwheel ... otherwise ... . pinwheel seems to be great quality
 I 've used Right Guard Unscented for years and loved it . The product shown was not what shipped . It 's not really the sellers fault , it 's Right Guard . What shipped was the `` New '' unscented . It 's called unscented , but it 's certainly NOT unscented .
 Only gets one star because the review wo n't go through unless I give a star.THIS ITEM IS SIMPLY PUT ... NOT UNSCENTED ANYMORE.The old unscented product was awesome . No scent and stopped the stink.Don ' t be fooled by the pic . The new `` unscented '' STINKS something awful.Just a damn disgrace how they discontinued this product . Just made absolutely no sense ...
 The one thing I really liked about this product is that it went on very dry for a product that 's a liquid anti-perspirant . I often forgot to shake the bottle before applying it . Unfortunately , it was poorly effective as an anti-perspirant if it was n't well shaken .
 My fiance and i bought this to spice up our love life . It was a sex trivia game basically not anything engaging or exciting .
 This went on very dry . I do n't feel that it kept me as dry as other brands . Also , the smell was distasteful . I do n't like the lingering aerosol fumes . I 'd probably not recommend this to my friends or family . I think that the solid form of it may work .
 I did n't particularly like this deodorant . It did n't seem to last all day and I had a hard time telling if I had enough on because it goes on clear . It does stay clear all day so you can wear tank tops without having your armpits all white . That 's the only advantage I saw though . I would n't recommend this to my friends and family .
 I bought this stuff hoping that it would be just as good as what I used to use . For a short time Degree made a spray anti-perspirant that was called Powerc -LRB- same can , different name -RRB- . I have been unable to find this anymore in a spray can , so I bought this Sport brand instead . I HATE this stuff . This stuff has stained my shirts , and has done nothing for perspiration . I do n't know how something can be labeled anti-perspirant when it does nothing to that effect . I am not going to use this stuff anymore , if I can not find the Power spray I will most likely give up all together on Degree !
 I ordered a Hummingbird flosser to try it as a replacement for the Reach Access Power Flosser I currently use , and it 's not even close to be a good alternative.The vibration is considerably weaker than on the Reach model , making it harder to insert between tight teeth . Unlike the Reach , which stays on when turned on , you have to continually press the button on the Oral B to keep it running . Finally , the handle is just too tiny , making it uncomfortable to use , especially when you have to keep pressing the darn button.The description is misleading
 Purchased thinking it would be supperior to manual flossing and it is actually worse ! Not worth the time , effort and definetly money .
 We bought the hummingbird flosser , I took the head off of it and used it . Works fine that way , it 's good for reaching the back teeth compared to regular dental floss . But I will not buy again . I will just stretch the fingers with regular floss for now on . I am not sure why anyone would say it hurts though it hardly moves .
 This is one of the worst oral hygene products I have ever used . They try to make it cute and stuff with the minty picks and protective cover and all . I really regret buying this product .
 After using this I found out from the dentist it was making my gums red and sore . He told me to stop using it , and get a water pik instead . If you are sore after using this stop using it , the pressure is too strong .
 This product is somewhat of a waste of time depending on your teeth . Unless your teeth are perfectly straight you can hardly get the floss/pick in between your teeth and once you do get it in between your teeth you can hardly move the floss up and down or left to right because there is no power in just holding the device with one hand . Also , I think that even if your teeth are perfectly straight -LRB- which I doubt everyones is -RRB- I doubt you still will be able to use this product properly because of just how weak the floss and your control over the product is .
 If you are considering the Hummingbird flosser , do n't ! I tried it , and it practically pulled a crown out . The floss tips are too tight , and the tiny flosser is a nightmare to hold.On the other hand , the Reach flosser is about the size of an electric toothbrush , and very easy to hold . Moreover , the Hummingbird floss-head refills cost almost twice as much as the Reach refills .
 It 's attractive , it has a great name and it 's backed by an extraordinary brand . Once you get beyond that , it 's just hype . My mother loves hummingbirds and I hate flossing , so I thought this would be a fun gadget to use . Unfortunately , the vibrations do n't do as much as proper manual flossing action to clean the spaces between teeth . And if you need/prefer tape-style floss , you 're out of luck with this product , which just uses string . It sat on my shelf for months and was used only 3 or 4 times before I gave up . Now I use OralB silk tape or Tom 's of Maine tape . Easy , fast , inexpensive and far more effective . Sorry guys ; you usually do a good job , but not this time .
 The Oral B Hummingbird is completely useless as a floss or toothpick replacement . The picks and flosser heads are better used without the hummingbird if anything . If you purchase this item you will simply be recieve a device with a `` cute '' appearance that vibrates like a pager but does nothing to help clean your teeth . Honestly , I do not recommend anyone purchasing this product unless they want to use it as a display item on your desk .
 While the flossing part is good , the machine itself vibrates a great deal . It hurts my hand .
 I bought this to fill a purchase requirement for Oral B products . The ultasonic toothbrush is outstanding , but this thing is a joke . Unless you have gaps in your teeth big enough to allow eating corn on the cob through a tennis racket , the tips stick and pull off .
 I bought this Hummingbird Flosser kit thinking that it could do the same work that my tired and circulation restricted fingers do . It failed in getting between even my not-so-tightly spaced teeth . I guess I 'll stick with Oral B Ultra Floss since it works . If your teeth are very tight/close together , I would suggest that you not buy the Hummingbird flosser .
 I bought one for me and one for my wife . We both feel it is too hard to get in between the teeth ... the floss is just too wide . The floss is probably twice the thickness of the reach flosser or even string floss . Also , you have to hold the button down the entire time to use it .
 I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB so I thought I would like this too . However , it just does n't work . The cartridges they have set up do n't work because as soon as you tug on them at all , the floss becomes loose and therefore wo n't vibrate - it only vibrates if it 's taut . But because of the way they have the cartridges set up , there is no way to make it taut again . It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed , but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges.This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges , but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use . So ... forget it .
 I floss twice a day and was hoping this would make it easier to do . No such luck , it 's very awkward . The floss it uses is crappy . And at twice a day , it would cost me a fortune to keep buying refills for it.What a huge waste of money ... do n't bother .
 I hate flossing , and this little device is very good . It is easy to use -LRB- yes , pressing and holding that button is a pain but you 'll get use to it -RRB- , and it fits nicely between my tight teeth.BUT , and this is one big but , I have go through at least 6-8 of them in the last year . It somehow stops working after about 1 or 2 months . I use to think it 's the moisture as it may not be totally waterproof . But now , with the latest one , I just think it 's a bad design . Still , I am hostage to this device as this is the only flosser that I would use.I am experimenting with other ones ... Hopefully the Reach is at least as good and more durable .
 When I ordered this item , I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use . Actually , each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it , to be used once and discarded . Let me see
 I did not like this product . The handle for this flosser short . I threw this away without even using the refills and went back to using my Reach flosser.Reach Access FlosserReach Access Flosser Refill Pack Disposable Snap-on Heads , Unflavored 28-count Packages -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- Reach Access Flosser Cleanpaste Refill Disposable Snap-on Heads , 28-count Packages -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- I also recently tried Glide disposable flossers and the floss broke too easily on those . I had to use up to 3 a day . I have found the Reach flosser to be the best so far as I have found .
 I bought this thinking it would be easier to use than a manual flosser , do a better job , or both . Was I disappointed . The floss is too loose to snap between your teeth , you have to constantly press the button to activate the motion -LRB- no true on/off switch -RRB- , and it is too short . You have to have your hand in your mouth to use it on molars . I tried several times thinking I would eventually get the hang of it . Finally I gave up and went back to my manual Reach flosser . It 's a much better product for half the price.Reach Access Daily Flosser Family Pack With 14 Refill Heads - 1 Each
 I generally wore these while driving long distances and not while I was doing other activities . I wore them regularly after purchasing them and found that they did not seem to help with the pain in my hands any better than regular driving gloves . Also , they made my hands sweat which caused the skin between my fingers to become irritated . Since the objective was to keep my hands warm to soothe the arthritic discomfort , I have gone back to wearing regular driving gloves .
 I did n't like them , no good and they have a strong rubber smell . I 'm not using this gloves . It was a waste of money
 While the gloves do offer the perfect amount of pressure , which in turn offers a comforting feel for my sore hands and fingers , the outside fabric is so rough and irritating that it negates any value the gloves could have . And even though they are somewhat helpful in propelling my wheelchair due to their tackiness , I can not understand why they need to have the tacky -LRB- and therefore scratchy and rough -RRB- material on the entire back of the hands!I had very high hopes for the gloves based on the great reviews that they have but in this instance I am extremely disappointed . If the idea of scratchy , irritating fabric does not matter to you I think you will appreciate the gentle ` squeezing ' . But if the idea of it even slightly concerns you , pass on this pair and keep searching .
 The item is too stiff and does n't move for daily activity . It also has a funny feel to the material . And it has a funny odor .
 Does n't seem to work as advertised . I have arthritis on two fingers and wearing this thermoskin overnight does n't help to relieve the pain . Return it to the merchant .
 I bought these for my husband , who 's experiencing arthritis in his hands . He plays the drums and sometimes he 's in so much pain and ca n't hold the drum sticks . I thought that these gloves would help , but they were very stiff and uncomfortable to wear .
 The gloves , once I finally got a pair that fit , keep my hands a little warm . But as far as helping with R.A. pain and stiffness , I am finding very little difference . In fact , I almost think my left hand is worse off for wearing them , but I 'm still not totally decided on that.The sizing chart , at least for me , was n't anywhere near accurate . According to it , I should have ordered a small pair . I did n't see how that could possibly be right , so I initially ordered a medium pair . They were so tight they cut off circulation to my fingers altogether and I could barely get them off . Luckily I ordered them through the Amazon fulfillment program , so sending them back and getting a large pair was n't too big of a pain . The large pair still seem a little tighter than I 'd like , they 're more than `` snug '' , but I 've got to think the next size up would be way too big.All in all , I 'm still wearing them for a few hours a day to give them a fair trial , but I think in the end they 're going to end up being a waste of money .
 I do n't like the texture - very rough and annoying . Also , the fingers were too loose - no support for the knuckle joints . I returned them .
 This product did n't work as it was advertised.I tried using this product for Raynaud 's Disease but what it was advertised to do it did n't therefore I left as if it was a waste of my money .
 They did not work to my hope I use an insulated hunting glove and it works better.not really wort it .
 The thermoskin material is wonderful for compression needed , but the gloves do not fit across the hand very well to give compression all over , were it 's needed . I cut all the fingers off , and use them that way . The fingers also work on the toes . I would not buy them again , due to the fact they are to expensive !!! Customer service is horrible ! I would NOT recommend buying these
 I am a paraplegic . As such my hands and wrists get strained and sore often . I do not have arthritis.I noticed some heat but nothing to write home about . I do have the correct size but the compression aggravates my condition . I think just a decent set of warm gloves or a muffler works much better for me.I never have been a fan of fingerless gloves but you will need the feature if you get these . They have enough compression that getting them on and especially off is not easy . You will be wearing them while you do things . Even if it is just punching a remote , writing or handling small items . I 'm left to wonder how the reviewer that likes theirs gets them on and off as it takes dexterity and a good pinch grip to get your fingers to release . I can do it but I imagine someone elderly with arthritis having quite a time . Maybe the other reviewer has assistance.If you ca n't pinch and pull very well you will probably need help getting them off . But if compression aids in pain relief you may like them . I have good circulation and did not notice much warmth at all . Maybe only those with `` cold hands '' will notice a benefit.If possible find someplace local to try out first . Good LuckOne last thing . These are made of a neoprene like material and all the seams are sewn to stick out . So the gloves are like wearing something inside out but with stiff seams sticking out around the fingers . I found it agravating when using my fingers and hands . You may be able to see in picture . just be aware of this . they 're made to be smooth againt the skin but are a bit rough on the outside what with all the seams sticking up .
 The velcro closure frayed the sleeves of my PJ 's and the cuffs on a couple of shirts . I removed the velcro closure with box cutters -LRB- not easy to do with arthritic hands ! -RRB- and now the gloves work reasonably well . Other than that I have ruined a couple of garments , I 'm satisfied .
 I am not sure what the product was supposed to do , but it did nothing to relieve arthritis or neuropathy .
 The only reason I bought this product is because of finger joint pain , yet there 's hardly any finger support . The fingers are too loose , yet I ca n't get a smaller glove because it would n't fit over my hand . It helps somewhat , I suppose ...
 My husband loves the gloves , but the finger openings are starting to fray , and he is unhappy that the price paid and the fabric threads are getting fuzzy after 6 days . He does not wear them to jobs around the house , as he is afraid they will get worse . Do not know if they can be returned or not after being worn for a certain time period . The support he gets is good if the finger seams come apart , I will have to find another vendor . Star review should have been a five for the price . He has large wrists and they have a hard time fastening properly .
 These gloves are much thicker than expected . In spite of abiding by the measuring guidelines , they did not fit me well -LRB- although I have large hands , the guide said I did not need an extra large -RRB- . I considered going to a larger size but felt they would simply no do what I needed them to.Two very irritating features :1 . The gloves simply do n't breathe - consequently I had to peel them off about once an hour . Because they do n't breathe they also do n't dry very quickly2 . The fingers extend literally to the base of your fingertips - essentially leaving just the ball of your fingers exposed.From other reviews , these gloves have helped some ; however , they are just not for me .
 I purchased these gloves to help reduce swelling in my hands . Unfortunately , they make my hands hot and the swelling gets worse ! Then I ca n't get the gloves off my hands by myself . I thought I 'd have to cut them off the last time I tried to wear them . They are not to small when I first put them on , and I measured according to the manufacturer 's website for a proper fit.I found another pair on Amazon.com that I love that are made of a stretchy Lycra like material . Much more helpful for me with compression for pain relief !
 I returned this item because the fabric was too stiff and caught on my clothing and was scratchy against my skin
 I ordered a blade replacement for my WAHL clipper and never received the item . I emailed this seller regarding the issue and never received a response . Therefore , I 'm seeking a refund from Amazon and will not buy from this seller again .
 I read through all the reviews from other customers before I decided to buy this product . From others ' comments , I had an impression that this is the most amazing product that can resolve women 's hassle about shaving ! I also learned that it does n't hurt too much , and hair does n't grow back too fast . I even went to Braun 's website to check the this product 's overview and did research on other websites to evaluate whether it was worth to buy this product . Well , the opinions contributed by others here really gave me confidence that I would n't need to worry about my hairy body once I owned this product.So I went ahead and bought it . After it arrived , I was eager to use it . When I first time turned it on to speed 1 -LRB- I was afraid to try speed 2 because some people said that it hurts more with speed 2 -RRB- , I got shocked by the sound the machine makes when it turns ... I hesitated if I really wanted to put this against my skin for few minutes ... . Well , I thought that if I did n't try it , it would be a waste of money and time to buy and research about it online . So I tried it , and it HURT !!! The sound of the machine was extremely loud , even at speed 1 !! However , I still went all the way through both of my legs.The result was just okay . Even now I have been using it for 10 + times , I still always feel that it does n't pull my hair out completely , because I can see the very short part of the hair still sticks on my legs . The machine just does n't pick on the hair that is as short as 0.05 cm as the company claims , and this product does n't give my legs a clean look . Just imagine when you see lots lots of this kind of broken hair that does n't get pull out on your legs -LRB- I have run the machine 3-4 times over and the product still does n't pick on the broken short hair as it claims to do -RRB- , it is really ugly and nasty-looking . Those broken hair on my legs are also spiky , so the touch of my legs after shaving is just rough . I do n't want to touch my legs after shaving.Though the machine is not satisfactory , I still use it , because I do n't know about other machines . I seriously consider doing a laser surgery to remove my hair on my legs .
 It only got about 60 % of the hairs , even after I went over an area many many times . And many of the hairs just broke off and did n't get pulled , leaving stubble . So I tried an experiment
 I 've used this product twice since buying it , and am pretty disappointed . I got used to the pain , but it took hours just to do -LRB- most of -RRB- my legs , because you have to go so slow . Additionally , I noticed that both times I had stubble the next day , which indicates that it is merely breaking some of the hair off at the skin , not taking out the bulb . So it takes a comparatively huge amount of time and is less effective than shaving or waxing . I would recommend waxing , and then using the epilator to get the hairs that waxing missed .
 its ok but not my favorite item ... it is very time consuming and very painful -LRB- i know i have no pain tolerance but still -RRB- . furthermore it gives me terrible in grown hair . i bought it a year ago and ive pretty much stopped using it
 To confirm other reviews , this works quite well . But no quality of hair removal is worth this pain . It is truly incredible . Consider I am a guy and I used it on my face . It works well in removing all the hair but it hurts so ungodly horrible that I 'd never recommend it to anyone . So the results are great , but the ends do not justify the means . Go get a really powerful cream , wax , something besides this product . I 'll be sending it back .
 Used it several times and compared to the other brands iv used this tastes nasty in anything . Id never buy it again !
 Contacted seller regarding refund and telling them that I had n't received the item . I also filed a claim when I did n't get a response from the seller.I have yet to have this problem rectified .
 Did n't receive the toothpick style . . just the floss type . Went to the oral-b web site hoping to find it there and they do n't sell the toothpick type . No explanation given . So no one should advertise it as that style is obsolete since I believe only the floss style is now available .
 The product is what I wanted . Bu I ordered multiple packs , but received only one . Thus the shipping cost was excessive for what I got .
 The Hummingbird product is , basically , a cell phone vibration mechanism with a plastic toothpick attached . These replacement attachments do not hold any value for a person that has a serious investment in their teeth . A regular toothpick provides more rigid action while being less cumbersome.I promise you that the free toothpicks at any place you eat will beat this gimmicky Hummingbird product , hands down .
 $ .16 PER OUNCE RIGHT ? So 2.7 onces equals what ? Pretty sure nowhere close to what they are charging.Are all the prices this free of reality based math ?
 This product contains a masking fragrance , so it 's NOT unscented . People who are looking for fragrance-free products may want to look at Sure , Secret , Mitchum , Ban or any of the other major products .
 I just got one of these chairs -LRB- AG-3001 -RRB- . It seems to be well made , and is decent looking for the price . I think the massaging action could be very relaxing.However , I have a major problem with the chair . I am maybe slightly above average height for a man -LRB- 6 ' 0 '' tall , 32 '' inseam -RRB- . When I recline in the chair , the end of the footrest barely reaches past my knees . My feet just sort of hang down putting uncomfortable pressure on the back of my upper calves . I have sat in several other recliners , and never had this problem.Also , when the power is turned off so that the shiatsu mechanism is no longer running , the mechanism comes to rest in your upper back . The little balls still stick out into your back . It 's not unbearable , but it seems like they should come to rest in an unobtrusive position so that this chair could be more comfortable for normal seating.Update
 I agree that the chair is very comfortable for people smaller than average people , and does give the feeling of being weightless . However , the chair I owned had defective welds , which caused the frame to break within a month of purchase . I was fortunate enough to purchase my chair at a place where I could inspect the remaining stock , and several of the chairs they were selling also had defective welds . I would not purchase this chair unless it was from a place that allowed me to carefully inspect the item before buying . One other caveat
 I have this chair and it 's very uncomfortable . There is a bar at the leg rest that presses against the back of my legs , making them uncomfortable and the back of the chair hurts my back and that 's without the massage system even turned on . My chair is brand new and I would sell it for half price in a minute !!!!
 POOR design has no padding on the tracks that support the massage mechanism . This actually makes the chair PAINFUL to sit in . Locks are poorly designed , causing the chair to lurch suddenly.the plastic tracks supporting the mechanism broke within 9 months . Spend a little more money and get a REAL massage chair ! It literally fell apart.DON ' T WASTE YOUR MONEY !
 If you like dirty dishes , then this detergent is for you . I truly am not exaggerating when I say that my dishes came out dirtier than when they went in . This leaves a yucky film on all the dishes . No actual food removing occurred with the use of this product . I tried and tried for two weeks - now I 've given up and purchased Cascade Complete . My dishes sparkle again , and more important , they are CLEAN . I have tried all of the `` natural '' detergents I can find . Until one actually works , I 'll have to stay with the tried and true .
 This mask does a good job of keeping light out , but is not for people who like to sleep on their side . The mask is so thick that you ca n't find a comfortable position .
 Although Speedstick is a trusted brand it has given me severe rashes everytime I use it . I thought musk was a safe sent to use and for a while my body could handle that specific formula but when I changed to a different scent of deoderant my skin became discolored , irritated and broken . Even when the slightest amount is applied it stings my skin . I no longer use this product for such reason .
 I bought a couple sticks of the regular scent because it was really cheap at walmart . Never again ... It really irritates my armpits . But because I 'm cheap and insane , and must use up everything I buy , I will be having irritated armpits for a while .
 I bought this deodorant having seen all the great reviews . It was also a great value for cost per ounce . The smell is unique that is for sure . I can see why some people would love it . The problem I have is that it does not last . By lunch time I am smelling pretty ripe . Another problem with that musk smell is that it is not a perfumy smell so it does not cover up BO all that well . If anything it only enhances the BO . If you dont have problems with BO or perspiration then I can see this working for you . Otherwise , avoid .
 $ 1.00 more than Walmart per stick . Dummy me did n't check first . Alas ... Live and learn . But I like it and have been using it for at least 25 years . Great scent .
 I used to love the old Speed Stick mens deodorants . They were effective in warm & humid weather but not too heavily perfumed - the way it should be , in my opinion . The new & allegedly ` improved ' products are identical in name only - no more effectiveness but lots of strong perfume.This is why
 Speed Stick changed their product and it no longer works more than a few hours.Useless .
 This invisible solid is not invisible as it leaves marks on my shirts as putting them on . Also does not do it 's job I would not waste my money on this product . Wrote the company and I got no response . I do not like to be ignored .
 Purchased from Walmart , when I tried opening the tube , the plastic top would not release . Then , when I finally did get it free , the vacuum inside sucked the nozzled top up with it . This led to some of the contents being drawn out as well . Now , when I turn the knob to lift the deodorant through the nozzle , it does not work well . I get too much deodorant . Any `` body '' else having this problem ? And ... . how can i reach P&G ; to get a refund?Jack
 I TRIED THIS DEODORANT FOR 2 WEEKS AND IT PEELED OF MY SKIN . STAY AWAY !
 First of all I 'm not sure they even shipped the right product . I received sticks with completely different designs on the front , and it says `` Original High Endurance '' , with no mention of `` classic . `` Anyway , the scent is n't bad , its just extremely strong . . you should n't be able to smell a deodorant from across the room , yet with this you can . With all the good reviews I 've seen I expected this to be fairly good and ordered 6 sticks to save on shipping . Instead I wasted $ 28 on something I 'll never use . Maybe I can give them as gifts to people I do n't really care about ?
 This stuff is HORRIBLE ! It separated and constantly had to be shaken and was lumpy . It also had a kind of funky smell.Also , I had it stored in my attic for about 4 months , and 2 bottles and turned into a solid clump and was useless reconstituted .
 This wax did n't melt very well , even when following the directions , which made it very difficult -LRB- and even painful -RRB- to spread on the areas to be waxed . I tried to wax my bikini area and found it virtually impossible to pull the strip in the opposite direction of growth , since the hair grows in many different directions . Consequently , the hair was painfully pulled -- but not pulled out . I even experienced some bleeding . They provided plenty of cloth and the wax would presumably last through several waxings . Also , it washes off with warm water , as advertised , and there are good directions in the package , and I did n't experience extended discomfort after pulling off the cloth . However , I would n't recommend this product , because it 's difficult and painful to use .
 This is the first waxing product I 've tried , and I found that it hurt a lot more than I expected . It 's also sticky and messy . I found that it even hurt to apply the wax . Personally , I think I 'll stick to shaving .
 I would not personally recommend this product to anyone . It was very messy and cold , and the baby powder scent was too overpowering . I had to wait for it to dry before getting dressed . It also seemed that too much came out of the container -- more than one would really need . It was generally inconvenient .
 I 've been having misadventures in the wild and woolly world of waxing , lately . The other day , I went to a salon and had my crotch deforested , and then I biked home . Here 's a word of advice
 After using this product I 've decided to stick with shaving . It was somewhat painful to remove the wax strips and I experienced some redness and irritation afterwards . Perhaps some of the other Nair products work better but this one 's not for me .
 I excitedly received my product and read all the directions for proper use . I planned on removing hair from my legs and bikini area . I 'd never waxed before -- I shaved . So in anticipation of using it , my first question was whether there was enough to do my legs in one box . The answer was yes . I read the proper techniques and after creating a VERY sticky mess on my legs , I removed only three hairs . Convinced I 'd done something wrong , I tried the other leg . Same results . The sticky goo is hard to clean off skin as well as anything else it comes into contact with . The wax remover provided in the kit worked well and removed the wax from my legs but I decided it was easier to shave
 I had high hopes for the Nair Cold Wax strips . Unfortunately , my hopes were dashed once I tried it . It was messy , ineffective , and literally a pain . I have used other Nair products with great success , so this is , hopefully , a rare occurrence .
 No thanks ! I 'll stick with my razor . The Nair itched and stung while it was on , did n't take the hair off very well , and my legs were all red afterward . Shaving is quicker , less irritating , and works better .
 This product was very disappointing . Even though I showered right before using Nair 3 in 1 to soften the hair , it still worked poorly . My legs were n't as smooth as with shaving , and they became irritated . I used the product three times in one week and the only difference between that and shaving is that the Nair moisturized my legs . That one benefit is not worth me sitting for 10-15 minutes to wait for the product to work . I feel the package needs to be clearer , as well . I had to read the tiny print of the '' `` warning '' '' to learn where on my body I could and could n't use it . I wo n't be purchasing this product for myself , and certainly wo n't recommend it to anyone . Just keep your razor .
 These cones have a huge seam on one side that causes the henna to come out in a flat ribbon instead of a round strand . I asked for a return and they said to try cutting off more of the tip -LRB- but I wanted a thin strand so that would n't work -RRB- or taping the seam down . I tried the tape and it was better but still did n't come out in a nice round shape . For example , I could n't make nice round dots with it . Then they said I could return it , but I had to pay the postage . Do n't buy these .
 I 've had GERD for about 25 years . I 've been on every prescription med available and am currently taking Aciphex which barely helps . I tried this because of the favorable reviews and because I 'd done some on-line research and found that the active ingredient in `` Heartburn Free '' has been subjected to scientific testing and found to be beneficial to sufferers of GERD.It has not helped me . The recommendation is to take one pill every other day . When I do I get very painful flare up about one half hour after taking . I have been taking , and continue to take , a probiotic supplement . The probiotic did not work , either - alone or with this product . I will discontinue both once the supply runs out.As other sufferer 's have gotten relief , I hope that I am in the minority and that you will get relief , too .
 I tried two packages of this and did not get any heartburn relief What I did get was burping concentrated orange flavor . Fore it did not help but tried it on a recommendation from a person who swore.by it
 Perhaps this product works for others but it did not work for me . I took it according to instructions and there was no difference in the intensity or frequency of heartburn .
 This is the worst , it does nothing but increase the pain you have . I do not reccomend this product for heartburn relief .
 I have had heartburn since I was 13 . This is a family thing . I wanted to get off the proton pump inhibitor because of the side effects . Unfortunately , Heartburn Free did not work for me , I had hoped it would . Perhaps it would work for someone who has not had heartburn for a very long time .
 This product does n't work ! I have suffered with heartburn for a long time and decided to try a natural approach , it did nothing to relieve my hearburn . Buy Pepto Bismol instead it works great !!!!
 This is a horrible product . It leaves your glasses greasy and DOES NOT clean them at all . The shipping is slow as well . Do not buy this product . It 's a waste of money .
 Bought one case with bleach and one without . BOTH arrives leaking badly . My UPS guy pretends he does n't notice and leaves them at my door then leaves as fast as he can ! I try to flag him down but he does n't see me . Anyway , the boxes were n't damaged , I just think it was the heat on the UPS truck . There is a temperature limit on the box . I guess shipping to Florida in the summer via UPS is enough heat to make them pop open or something . Same must be true for Arizona and a lot of places . Aside from leaving a HUGE MESS in my entranceway and aside from the general inconvenience and disappointment ... THIS IS A HAZARD ! My child slipped and I almost slipped also ! This stuff is so concentrated that getting spills up requires a lot of work . I 'm still afraid that there may be residue and drips in front of my house , the driveway , etc that may become very slick in the rain . I probably am going to have to hose or pressure wash EVERYTHING out there ! Amazon is neglegent for attempting this sale . UPS is neglegent for making my home hazardous . -LRB- You ca n't tell me the delivery guy did n't see and feel and smell the leakage -RRB- . Obviously I will only buy liquid detergents locally from now on .
 I love this product but will not buy it again since I bought the last two they both have broken off at the top and every time I have used it the top keeps breaking off . I ca n't afford the product any more .
 I 'm hoping to get a refund from Mitchum . This product is made with a strange ingredient and does n't work at all . Other Mitchum products have worked for me in the past . Not this one . Very disappointing .
 Rarely am I this against a beauty product . The problem with this is n't that it did n't work , but it made all of the skin on my underarms crack . A friend and I both decided to give this deodorant a try as we thought that a 48 hour deodorant must offer quite a lot of protection . But after about a week of using it I realized that this massive gash was going across the middle of my arm pit which was really painful and looked just awful ! I was really shocked and assumed it must have been my bra or something . But then I found that my friend who had also bought the deodorant had the same thing happening on her underarms . I understand that this was my personal reaction to Mitchum and therefore this review does not stand for everyone , I just think that the fact it happened to both me and my friend means that it must be a relatively common complaint .
 I can not eat soybean oil or other soy products . I reviewed several online products , and this one did not mention soybean in the ingredients at least that I saw . But in fact , when it arrived and I read all of the ingredients it did in fact contain soybean . So I had to mail it back . I wish I could obtain a CoQ10 product without soybean.Pat Gladden
 I ordered this product after carefully reviewing many products because I am allergic to soy . This one clearly states , `` Contains no yeast , wheat , corn , milk , egg , soy , glutens , or sugar '' , but when I received it the first of the ` other ' ingredients is Soybean Oil . I did n't give it one star because I could n't try it and rightfully say I hated it , I just do n't like the fact of the soy . For others it probably is a great deal .
 The ad for these CoQ10 softgels specifically says that they are soy free , which is why I putchased them . Unfortunately , it was only after getting them , opening them that I read the label which says they have soy as an ingredient . For someone who can not have soy , this was a true eye opener . Never , ever go by what you read about a product listed on Amazon . Make sure to check the label .
 This item is not as pictured . As the item title states `` Benefiber Pwdr 4gm Pkt -LRB- Case -RRB- '' , it is Benefiber in individual 4g -LRB- single serving -RRB- packets with 75 packets to a case -LRB- or box ? -RRB- . `` Product Features '' describes it as `` Boxes Per Case 75 '' which is actually 75 packets per case . This is a confusing description and misleading photo.Benefiber is a great product but it is difficult to find a bulk quantity if you plan , as I do , to use it for a long time .
 I expected SOME heat , but feeling no heat at all . Applied to Rt. ankle/calf as directed , an hour later still nothing , only felt like I had rubbed ` ointment ' on . Tested another product -LRB- T.Balm Ultra -RRB- on Lft ankle/calf , felt right away . Complete waste of money , returning product . The other product does n't heat up enough for me , so that is why I tried Cramer Red Hot , stating it was the hottest . Maybe a bad batch , but no heat at all , should be concerning to consumers . Recommend you try another product , if you are needed heat relief .
 Really badly engineered . Okay for a light beard trim . But totallyuseless with no charge . I 'm off Philips/Norelco for life .
 They have a nice scent , but do n't last very long . Would not buy again .
 The product was n't exactly as pictured in the photo posted by an Amazon customer . If the picture was of the product I actually received , I would n't have made the purchase . If you 're in need of bandages with adhesive on all four sides of the gauze , do n't get these .
 Feels like rubbing mint on you body feels cold and gross . Like eucalyptus lotion with cooling/hot sensation.This is more like massage oil not for the lower region at all ... Not reccomending this for intended use .
 Decided to try this stuff out because my gf thought it would help increase our fun . I do n't even know what this stuff is supposed to do really . I heard stories about it burning folks to giving a good sensation . We did n't experience any of that . Matter of fact I do n't even know what it did really . This stuff is slippery and it smells kind of strange . Smells like olives or some kind of plant not to mention the color of the bottle we received was green and not blue like in the picture . I mean the gel/liquid stuff inside the bottle was greenish clear . As lube I guess it 's fine if you need it but we brought it for the supposed effects it offers . Only effect I found was the money deducted from my account for the purchase of this stuff . It stinks literally and it does n't provide any sensation , and the bottle looks like some kind of weird sex toy .
 nothing exciting about this stuff . . it 's lube . and it smells . that 's about it . forgot i even ordered it until i saw i did n't write a review of it . i do n't even know what i did with it . maybe threw it away . it 's been a while since i ordered it . i remember it smelling bad .
 When I was piping the henna on it seemed fine but it started cracking and drying very quickly even though I kept putting lemon juice on it . After around 4 hours I got a very light stain that is now fading after only a few days ! I would n't buy this brand again :-LRB- I have a lot left so perhaps adding some lemon juice or some kind of oil to the paste before applying it will help the end results . There was n't a problem with shipping or charging so thats not the issue just the actual henna itself -LRB- imagine that ! -RRB- . So I recommend not buying this paste .
 i think it sucks i never had suck a poor stain in my life really bad i was hoping for a dark stain instead it gave me like and orange type color very bad .
 the product was great ! the only thing i 'm giving it 1star because of the price is higher than what i saw in walmart .
 I was looking for a comfortable brace with a good velcro and received one out of the two . The velcro on this thing rocks . BUT , the brace is uncomfortable and this thing is super bulky . It minimally helps with the pain . I would not get this brace again .
 After wearing this product for 30 minutes I was in pain . It ca n't be returned so it is going in the trash . It may be a size issue -- too small . However , I have had a similar product , which worked well , made by Ace that was size small/medium . This Thermoskin brace is a Medium . Very disappointing . A total loss .
 This may work They are supposed to dissolve in water , but do n't you have to smash them first andeven then it 's hard to and they go flying
 Is anyone concerned about the active ingredient - Belladonna ? I 've read that it is a toxin .
 I am upset becuase i am trying to find the best natural safe remedy for my baby but i also want one that is EFFECTIVE . these pellets do not dissolve very easily , annd they did not work at all . . it was a pain to give it to him , and was EXACTLY LIKE I WAS GIVING HIM WATER ! I think cold water would have worked better . . BUT I ran out of camilia teething relief -LRB- which seems to work better and does not have coffee or sugar in it -RRB- so i have melted 2 pellets in each ice cube and hopefulle will get better results since it will be on his gums while he sucks on it for a while . . hope it works and isnt just a waste of money . .
 If you are like me and have a kid working on his molars , you are desperate to have anything that resembles Hyland 's Teething tablets . I remember those good old days of Hyland 's ! Well , this product was not a good replacement for us.To begin with , you actually have to dissolve the little suckers and rub this liquid directly on the gums of your screaming infant . My child is not very cooperative when he is in his teething mode . It was virtually impossible to get this stuff rubbed onto his gums . And when I do , eh ... this , too , shall pass , right ??? I 've taken to adding the pellets to a nice warm bottle of milk , but this is not the intended use , so I do n't think it is really working . It 's more of a panacea for me , I think.I will keep looking . I am sooooooooooooo regretful that I did not hoard Hyland 's when the recall thing started up . I understand people want to protect their children , but really , how much damage could they have done ? And such an effective product , too ...
 The Humphreys Teething Pellets are not super user friendly . It was a pain to dissolve the pellets in 1/2 tsp . of water -LRB- with an inpatient infant near by -RRB- and then trying to put it on my baby 's gums was n't really easy either because it was like rubbing water on them . I would have hoped for more of a pastey solution or at least something with substance . After `` applying '' , there was no noticeable difference in my baby 's pain . I should have listened to some of the other reviews . What a waste of money .

 The scent was too mild and certainly did not provide the aroma that I expected through the reeds . I was disappointed and will not buy this product again .

However , I have had a similar product , which worked well , made by Ace that was size small/medium . This Thermoskin brace is a Medium . Very disappointing . A total loss .

 After wearing not more than 10 times the toe is tearing . I am very disappointed because I have had other brands last years for me . The company Med Life strung me along and did not call me back , then said I had to send them back for evaluation to see if I was responsible for the tear . I would have to pay shipping .

 these plates are extremely thin , and would not hold anything besides a few pieces of fruit - the feel and look cheap in my opinion though their priceis not on the lower end . I returned mine to amazon and had to find other plates for my event .
 It is a great disappoitment . This product provoqued me a serious constipation for two days !!! Of course I could n't take it anymore . It was a waste of my money . You do a great advertising but I did not get the chance to confirm the greatness of it due to the poor quality of your product . Please DO NO BUY IT !!!!
 I purchased this for my son in december 2009 . It stopped working in July of 2010 because the condensor blew . Not worth the money at all . It should have lasted a lot longer considering it is rarely used to begin with .
 It seems too good to be true . The device seems great on the surface but looking close it does not offer a significant degree of water resistance.The FR2 or Zoll AED are units that are a bit better . But for a home unit where there is no chance of accidental exposure to water -LRB- swimming pool , rain or snow -RRB- ; it is a good unit.jim bock , Pres.Survivors Foundationaedsurvivors.org
 I am a RN , PALS and BLS Instructor Trainer , PHTLS , Trauma AIMS and EMT instructor . I work as a Hospital Educator . I believe that it is wrong to sell this device to anyone who does not have a Rx from a physician and recieved training to the level of BLS Instructor . The greatest risk with AEDs is to the rescuer . If an individual needs one of these at home , why have they not been fitted with an implantable?This is a very dangerous device when used by the untrained .
 I am an EMT and retired Hospital Administrator.Like the first reviewer I view marketing this without the proper training to be irresponsible.If the person has a Myocardial Infarction , resulting in a true `` flat line '' ECG a Defibrillator is useless without the proper drugs which have to be given intraveniously or injected directly into the heart to start random heart activity.Only then can a defibrillator shock the heart into proper pumping action.The most important thing a layman can do is learn CPR . If you can keep OXYGEN going into the lungs and then circulate that oxygen to the brain and heart -LRB- PUMPING -RRB- you have done the ONLY really important thing . If people use this for a Myocardial Infarction , INSTEAD of IMMEDIATELY starting effective CPR , the TIME Philips causes them to waste deprives the brain of oxygen and dooms the patient.I 've defibed scores of patients but NEVER successfully unless two people had already done CPR until we could get the drugs injected first.The gentleman with the implanted device does not have a Myocardial Infarction ... just an electrical arrythmia which the little battery in his device can sense and `` retime '' the heart ... thats a whole different thing.For an MI learn to do CPR properly . If you can get oxygen to the brain you can keep the person in a salvagable state until properly trained persons with ALL the tools , heart stimulants , bicarbonate to return the blood to it 's proper Ph etc can arrive and the defibrillation have a chance of working.Phillips can market this thing only because it has a computer which keeps it from working when it should n't so the FDA figured it 's harmless . BUT IF IT WASTES TIME in starting CPR , it 's NOT harmless.Buy the RED CROSS First Aid Manual
 I have used this product for years , buying it from different health food stores as well as online . I was very surprised and disappointed with purchase . Although the expiration date was in 2014 the vitamins smelled awful and had to be thrown out .
 I agree with the other reviewers in that this product used to have a light , wonderful lavender scent . Now it has more of a Pine-Sol cleaning smell scent to it , and it smells more like Rosemary than Lavender . : -LRB-
 This was a household standby for easily ten years . Recently , I purchased 5 bottles only to find that the scent has changed from a natural , lovely fragrance of lavender to a pungent , chemically odor . I would never recommend this product to anyone again unless they have no sense of smell .
 I have ordered this product for years and this is the first time the product was rotten . I do n't know if the natural lavender botanicals were spoiled , but the shower gel smelled only of chemicals - and a disgusting combination of those . I could n't use the product and threw away large quantities of it . I will never order it again .
 This bath & shower `` gel '' was completely watered down . I estimate that it was 25-50 % original gel and 50-75 % water . I should have known when I saw that this came from a 3rd party vendor instead of the actual manufacturers with Amazon Prime guarantee . When I invert the bottle , the contents squirt out all over the place and do not have a gelatinous consistency as I -LRB- and most people -RRB- would expect . This a complete rip off , and I will never purchase from them again !
 Well , I have been fooled a few times by reviews on Amazon and this happened to be another . The reviews mention a good citrus scent , good cleaning and hydrating power with an economical price . Upon getting the bottle , I opened it up to try the stuff and was unpleasantly surprised . First off , the citrus smell is more a floral vomit citrus smell . I decided to push through it but five days later I found that the smell went from that to a very rancid version of it . I could not believe it , how could this go from bad to worse ? Well , it did . Stay away !
 I am not kidding . It smells so bad it makes me wonder what bad stuff is in it . I will finish this bottle but will not buy again .
 I 've been buying the Citrus for years . I tried the Honey Mango and almost vomited from the chemicals in it . I could n't wash off the stench for an entire day . I believe they must have outsourced to China and are now poisoning this population with chemicals . I will never buy any Alba products again -- and I 've spent many hundreds over the years .
 I have used other Alba products and have really enjoyed them but this was nowhere near as good as the others . It does n't lather and it does n't smell like lavender ... If you want a better lavender scent , try avalon organics .
 I did not have a good experience with this product . It smells good but I used it -LRB- sparingly -RRB- in the bath and experienced sensitivity/irritation from it -LRB- feminine region -RRB- . I ca n't use drugstore brands like Olay , Softsoap , etc. . . I normally use Body Shop , Neutrogena , and Bath & Body Works and never have problems . I incorrectly assumed Alba products would be more along those lines . Beware if you have sensitivity issues with bath & shower gel and body wash .
 I have been using the Lavender Sheet and Clothing Spray from the Good Home Company for years and loved it . Recently when I was running low , I ordered 2 more bottles . When I reived them I noticed the bottle design and cap were slightly different but did n't think any more about it . I opened the first of the two yesterday and it was such a disappointment . It barely smells like lavender anymore , instead there is a strong scent that burns my nose and gives me an instant headache . One reviewer pointed out that it -LRB- the old formula -RRB- was not overly synthetic , but now I guess that is what you would call it . Even my husband noticed it last night when we went to bed and commented that I should go back to what I was using - he was surprised when I told him I had not made any changes - we did , however , have to get up and change the sheets because the scent of the new formulation is horrible . I guess they did something to it to make it cheaper to manufacture - too bad . I will never buy again . Have to search for another alternative .
 I liked the individual packaging , but that 's all . The product was too wet and after a short amount of time it attracted more dust to the lenses .
 I did not receive the product so I gave it a 1 star but customer service will resend me a new shipment so Custer Service gets 5 stars .
 I wish I had n't purchased this . They do n't really clean my glasses . All that they 've done so far , is spread the dirt/oil and leave a streaky film that has to wiped off . Complete and utter waste .
 I am very disappointed with this product . It consistently smears the lenses on my husband 's glasses . In fact , after using them the lenses are worse than when dirty . Little beads of moisture are left after using the tissues and take a while to dry . I 've repeatedly tried to reclean them to get rid of the smears , but using the towelettes does n't do the trick . I 've personally used a little hand soap and hot water for over 25 years for my glasses and gently dry them with a clean , fluffy towel . It works every time for spotlessly clean lenses .
 We are not very pleased with this particular brand and will probably purchase something else . They keep the glasses too wet for too long and seem to dry with a film that we then have to wipe off with a tissue .
 This is a big dissappointment . Most of the tissues were totally dried out as soon as I opened the package . Even the `` moist '' ones are not great . I have to use two or three tissues to clean one pair of glasses/sunglasses .
 Found the Suppository Inserter by Ableware to be totally useless . The handle is not secured so it is impossible to control . This is a rip-off that takes advantage of people with a serious medical need .
 The bandages worked fairly well but I did n't really find them terrific in the water-block area . I 've used other brands of waterproof bandages that I believe resisted water better . They lasted through several hand washings , but later on in the day I had trouble with them staying on . They were good at not sticking together while putting one on . They were also good at going on parts of the body other than the hands .
 It does n't do the job too good like it 's suppose to . I Ordered it and it 's good when you drink it but it 's not too much of a good cleaner . It gets you gassy , thats all .
 I mistakenly bought this item thinking it was whole psyllium husk . Even though if I knew it was powder , I didnt think there was a difference between the two . they 're both psyllium husks no matter what , right ? Nope , not for me . I HATE the powdered version.The whole version works beautifully for me
 First of all , I usually love Now Foods products , and there are not too many foods or supplements that I will not eat if they are good for you , but this stuff taste like pure dirt - actually worse ! It works very well , so I took it for about two weeks , but finally got tired of trying to choke it down.For me , there are better sources of fiber that do n't taste so bad .
 psyllium husk powder mixes very poorly in water compared to whole husk . in the future I wll only purchase whole husks psyllium .
 this is hands down the absolute worst psyllium husk product I have ever bought . Okay , I know it is supposed to thicken , but it was so god-awful lumpy even after stirring it forever I found it nearly impossible to get down and keep down . Never again . It ended up in the trash and I bought some Yerba Prima instead . On the plus side , Amazon did give me a full refund when I requested to return it .
 A good friend of mine said he did n't like this product because it was clumpy -LRB- when mixed with a liquid -RRB- and had the tast and texture of sand . I buy alot of NOW products so thought I 'd try it anyway . He was right . I used it twice and threw it out . I followed instructions and mixed 1 tablespoon with liquid -LRB- water -RRB- , stirred and drank . Floating clumps of &#34; sand &#34; is what it resembled . No thanks . He 's found another product that he absolutely loves , and I 'll listen to him this time and try that instead . Do n't waste your money .
 The rating is partially for my inattention to detail when ordering this product . I thought that I was ordering the `` Whole Husk '' version of this psyllium , but ordered the `` Powder '' instead . We love the whole husk for our protein drink in the morning , which keeps us right and regular . The powder does not provide a very good consistency compared to the whole husk . The powder makes it get too thick and barely drinkable . I would recommend to anyone to try the whole husk as opposed to this powder stuff .
 * update * I 've now tried adding water the the supplement , supplement to the water , mixing with fork , spoon , wisk , different temp water , and it just does n't mix that easily . I imagine a hand mixer -LRB- like I used for protein shakes -RRB- might work OK but I 'm not really excited about having to clean a mixer every time I take some psyllium so I 'm dropping the rating from 3 to 2 stars . * original * I 've tried the orange stuff -LRB- sugar-free and regular -RRB- and psyllium husks from one or two of the `` big box '' pharmacies , and the `` Now Foods '' version . Overall I like the sugar free orange stuff best , and the Now Foods least . It does n't mix well in cold water -LRB- the pharmacy stuff mixes better -RRB- and both the pharmacy stuff and Now Foods , being unflavored , have a texture and taste that is somewhat unpleasant . While the orange stuff does have some additives that I 'm not so excited about , the vastly improved taste and texture mean that I 'm apt to use it much more regularly -LRB- haha ! -RRB- . I 'm giving it three stars because it is cost effective .
 This cream does not remove rough skin in any way . What it does is moistrize feet and elbows . The name of the product is so misleading .
 The pictured product above says `` Triple-Action Weight Control '' and the one I received only says `` Liquid Soft-gel Weight Control . '' I looked everywhere on the box and found no mention of any `` action '' that this product is supposed to do . The product description on the back basically encourages you to follow the enclosed diet program and says that the pills are supposed to give the energy you need to follow it ... Oh , really ?! How fantastic ! I took the pills anyway , they did absolutely nothing for me , not even the energy I did n't ask for . Maybe they found out that the product is useless and changed the packaging to avoid getting sued ? Who knows ... Amazon should change the misleading image above , so people would know what they 're buying .
 It was my mistake to order the vitamins that contain iron . There are others of this brand that say &#34; No Iron &#34; on the label . My body 's reaction after I began taking them caused me to check the label and discover the iron . I thought I could use them up by taking 1/2 tablet once per day ; but I do not like the way my body reacts ; so have stopped taking them . I do not know how I would like them if they did not contain iron .
 Extremely overrated . Way too expensive . had I known that I had to utilize 3 to 6 pills per day , I would not have purchased it at all.No difference , no change compared to other a lot less expensive vitamins I had used.Going back to old faithful for less than half the price and same results if not better.Again , over marketed and over rated . Not a customer at all .
 In October 2010 I purchased Source Naturals L-Tryptophan . It was recommended to help me with light insomnia . One hour after taking only two 500mg capsules I became desperately ill and my health has continued to decline to this day to the point I am now housebound and can not stand for more than a few minutes due to terrible pain . My experiences led me to write two books about what had happened , the horrors myself and my young family have had to endure because I took only two Source Naturals L-Tryptophan capsules . Before and after writing the books my research turned up some very alarming information about this so called `` natural '' company . They produced L-Tryptophan in the 1980s which caused the disease I have now to endure , EMS , or Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome . They were litigated to be held accountable to the victims killed or disabled for life . Tryptophan was then banned for a period of more than a decade . And now ? Source `` naturals '' think it acceptable to buy their Tryptophan from China , where it is usually made from duck feathers , -LRB- diseased or not -RRB- . They do not tell you this on the label , the label on the bottle states `` made in the USA '' which is a lie . The Tryptophan is imported from China and merely put into capsules in the USA , then sold to an ignorant public . Legally it is a disgrace , although they are permitted to act in this manner by current legislation . So why should you care ? Why should you stop buying Source Naturals ? For one reason . They are a firm which does NOT have the consumers interests at heart . They are interested mainly in profit , as there are sources of ethically produced Tryptophan around -LRB- plenty of them -RRB- , but Source Naturals consider it more profitable to buy in bulk from the one country we have all heard so many horror stories about when it comes to foods and supplementation - China . If you wish to keep buying Source Naturals products I wish you well , and I hope and pray that you do not contract a horrible disease from their products as a result of their greed , as I have done . Think for a moment before you press that buy button - the Source Natural product you are about to buy may well have an ingredient from a VERY un-natural source .
 I bought this vitamin after seeing several good reviews . I used Rainbow Light Womens Organic , and loved them but this one was spoken highly of so I thought I 'd give it a try . HORRIBLE ! As soon as I opened the bottle I literally gagged ... they smelled just like urine ... an old nasty outhouse . I took 2 and got sharp headaches off and on all day -LRB- I 'm not a headache sufferer -RRB- . If i could return them for a refund I would . I 'll stick with what I know works from now on .
 I bought this based on the name - Combi - and the fact that I have a travel system of theirs which I absolutely love . Unfortunately , their expertise does not extend to wipe warmers . Conceptually , this would be a great product for any changing table - my baby loves the warm wipes -LRB- I know this because she literally jumps when we 're out and about and the wipes I used are n't warmed - and she 's not happy when she jumps like that ! -RRB- . But the design of this unit leads to several problems . The design is as follows : - To open the unit , you press the yellow button on the top front , and the lid pops open . This lid holds the heater , so the top wipe in the stack is the warmest . - When the lid opens , the next piece you see is a plastic second lid with a hole in it - basically this holds down the wipes , which are on a spring-loaded base at the bottom of the unit . You pull the wipes through that hole one wipe at a time . And they are definitely warmed ! - To load wipes into the unit , you squeeze together two pieces of plastic which are attached to this second lid . They unlatch and allow you access to the wipes holder , the base of which is spring-loaded . You push that spring-loaded base down , load in the wipes refill , push down the latches on the second lid , and push down the first lid . The attachment of the first lid engages the springs , so the next time you open the lid , the wipes are pushed up to the heater.Unfortunately , the major design flaw here is the latches on the second lid , which ca n't compensate for the springs . They are n't strong enough for multiple wipe loadings , and have weakened over time.So let 's say you 've got a middle-of-the-night changing happening . You quietly put your baby on the changing pad , get out the new diaper , remove the old one , push the yellow button on this warmer unit lid ... and suddenly the springs release , popping all the wipes up , the second lid hits the first , and you 've got a wide-awake child on your hands ! -LRB- This happened to us several times before I decided to throw in the towel on this unit . -RRB- Another problem mentioned by other reviewers is the sudden appearance of water underneath the unit . This is true and is a major electrical hazard - based on how much water we found under this unit one night , I havea to admit , I 'm surprised this has n't been recalled yet . We mitigated this somewhat by placing a waterproof vinyl pad under the unit , but really we should have just chucked this thing a long time ago . I 'm in search of another unit now , but wanted to warn all parents about the dangers of this unit .
 After reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice . I was VERY wrong . When I first plugged it in I could not believe how quickly the wipes heated . I thought it was great . I did think they were way too hot after they were in a while ... but a quick shake after I pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe . Then a few days later I was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open ... and kept popping open with every change . THEN when I lifed the unit to put new wipes in ... my $ 700 changing table / dresser was flooded and warped ! -LRB- I had it replaced !! -RRB- I had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table , too . Same problems kept happening . So I called Combi ... Customer Service told me the Instruction Manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging . She said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging . Of course I could not measure the amount of fluid ... but I am not exaggerating when I say CUPS ! Even if it did hold the CUPS of water . . so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes , it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it ???? And although it is stated ... a -RRB- there should be a warning to NEVER use wipes not in a package and b -RRB- WHY ! I bought a large `` bag '' of Huggies wipes . . there is no package to pop in.Second ... she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time . . and that this too , is in the Manual . So I lookeed at that , too . Not in the `` Usage '' part . . but on the back under `` Cautions '' it states this
 It worked great for a few days , then as I got to the bottom of the batch of wipes , they were totally dry . Also , the whole thing flooded my changing table , not sure why , but I am returning this unit .
 In addition to the weak design that makes this unit more noisey than it should be in terms of caring for babies , and in addition to the weak design that causes water to collect inside the unit , ours ' has heated to the point that the plastic on the lid has warped and the unit will no longer close - after only one week of use . I am calling the company and demanding that they take it back and refund my money .
 The epilator heads work well BUT there is a HUGE design flaw
 I bought this product roughly a year ago . And for the first few months , it was great . It worked just the way I thought it would , and I used it nearly twice a week because I felt more comfortable the more I used it . I hate hair , my family make fun of me because I seem to have an obsession with always being completely hairless on my legs and armpits . Well , after about 3 months , I noticed that it was becoming less reliable . It was picking up less hair , and I would have to go over the same spots over and over again . Later , the spinning twizzer wheels would constantly get jammed and would just stop until I turned it off and readjusted them . At first , it would happen maybe once every time I epilated . After a few weeks , I had to thrown it out because it would get jammed after every 10 seconds and I 'd have to constantly readjust it . Believe me , this is n't the first time I 've had trouble with Emjoi products . I 've used two different types of epilator products from them before , and I should have known better to buy this one in the first place , because both those others had similar problems . But I figured since this one was so highly reviewed , by now they would have worked all the kinks out . Nope , I was wrong . But you do n't have to be . I purchased the Braun Silk-epil Xelle Body System , Model 5270 right after I threw away the Optima ... and so far , no problems ! I 'm completely in love with it -- it works so much better than the Optima and I recommend it highly to anyone .
 Optima epilator cuts more than it removes hairs . Plus it did n't catch all hairs . Awful , stay away ...
 I think I will just start shaving with a machete . This son-of-a-beach hurts . I know some people are into pain -LRB- you dirty little sadists ! -RRB- so you will probably like this thing . I , on the other hand , have sensitive skin to go along with my sensitive soul and could n't tolerate this devil devise . Be warned , friends ... be warned .
 Well , I was dumb enough to try this epilator again . Lo and behold , after a few months , the crazy thing stopped working ... already . My friend purchased a Emjoi facial product six months ago which sounds like it is on its last leg as well . We definitely wo n't make the Emjoi mistake again , and we wo n't be lured into Emjoi again with discount coupon deals . There is a reason that manufacturers offer seemingly nice discount coupons , and the Emjoi reason is that their products just do n't last . As other people have posted , Emjoi products die early deaths . It certainly is disappointing to waste so much money .
 I bought this epilator about 3 months ago and here are my thoughts on it.Pros - saves money on razors - good on large areas - entertaining if you 're boredCons - no matter how many times you use it , the pain does not go away -LRB- you have to be drunk to use it on your bilini and use tranquilizers to use on your armpits -RRB- - ingrown hair can be a problem -LRB- especially in the bikini area -RRB- - hair does n't grow back that much slower than shaving -LRB- after two day you have to shave anyway to be smooth -RRB- - the epilator does n't pick up fine hair - if it does , it just rips it .
 I have read many of the reviews but none specifically mention the chin . Can you use it on the chin/face ? Is it effective on the coarse black hairs ?
 I 've being using Emjoi for the past 7 years and they work great at the beginning but for some reason they start loosing speed until they die completely . This is probably the reason why they only give a one year warranty .
 I bought my Emjoi epilator two years ago , and I hardly use it . I was really thrilled about getting one at the time , but I did n't find it practical enough for me to use it on a regular basis . Other reviewers have commented on it 's poor ergonomics , and they are right . I can never grip it comfortably . I do not have problems with the tweezing being too painful , but I do have to go over the same area multiple times for it to pluck all of the hairs . Sometimes I just find it easier to use my handy no frills tweezer . This is n't a product that I 'd recommend to anyone .
 So , six months later I decided I should update my review . I have n't used this in about 5 months and I would no longer recommend it . First of all , I started getting ingrown hairs that were an extreme annoyance and did n't look attractive . I also decided that the pain of using this was n't worth it as it never got better , even after multiple uses . Most importantly , every time I used this product I would also have to shave the areas that the epilator missed . Shaving just became a bigger deal than just using a razor in the shower . Do n't waist your money ... you may love it at first but after time it wo n't be worth the money.Here was my original review 6 months ago : I love this product ! Prior to buying the Emjoi AP99 Optima Epilator I was either shaving every day or walking around like a Wooley Mammoth . :O -RRB- I have thicker hair on my lower legs and very fine hair on my knees and upper legs . I tried this product a week ago and my hair is still gone ! I 'm amazed . For the people who are worried that it will hurt , you 'll be fine . Trust me , the little annoyance is worth it . Due to the different types of hair I have , I went over my legs at both speeds to get all hairs . The first time I epilated it took about an hour . I have recommended this to all of my friends .
 After reading the reviews here I felt that I had something to contribute so decided to post my own experience after 3 years of use with this product .1 -RRB- I am on my third broken unit . The units last less than one year . The company is not responsive when the unit fails and will not sell you replacement heads . The gears are made of nylon and the inherent weakness results in the gears stripping . The unit plugs quickly and is difficult to clean . When it heats up it is less effective because the gears no longer grab as well .2 -RRB- The unit is fairly slow overall . Much slower than shaving . If you are doing your full legs for the first time expect a couple of hours worth of work . I have dark hair and a lot of it , so perhaps less time for others . . but it is SLOW . Prohibitively slow .3 -RRB- The unit is a little awkwardly shaped which makes it difficult to get into the nooks and crannies .4 -RRB- This unit is comparatively very expensive and the durability makes it not worth the investment .5 -RRB- The shaver attachment is worthless and the brush that comes with it for cleaning the head loses its stiffness and no longer effectively cleans out the head.The positive is that this is a dual head system and it is effective at pulling even very short hairs or very course hairs . I would continue using it if the product was more durable and perhaps faster .
 I found that the optima generally broke off the hair on my legs more often than it removed it from the root . This results in a need to either shave or use the epilator again within a short period of time . I also found that it would n't even pick up some hairs despite my going over the area repeatedly . Overall I had hoped that this would replace shaving which it has n't so it was generally just a waste of money .
 While I found the device to be somewhat effective in removing hair -LRB- I did eventually grow accustomed to the sensation and it did indeed become much less painful than the first experience -RRB- , I found that the rotating tweezers would break down and stop spinning after just a few months . I foolishly thought I would give it another try , so I bought another one and the same problem occurred . I might add that I noticed that the best results would occur when the product was new , and that it actually seemed to gradually spin more and more slowly over the course of use , until it actually just stopped working just a few months later . Perhaps my experience is unique , but I will certainly not buy the Optima again .
 I 've used a few other `` epilators '' and I liked this one least for several reasons . I found the tweezing plates revolving in 2 directions , as opposed to one , rather uncomfortable . Also , the plastic pieces at ends -LRB- bordering the tweezers -RRB- were sharp and often scratched my skin . The biggest reason that I do n't care for this product is it 's size and shape . It 's small and thick and difficult to hold comfortably , often grazing my fingers during use . While this was n't painful it was certainly annoying . Of the products commonly found on the market , I prefer the emjoi `` Gold Caress . '' It 's easier to hold and use , and it 's less expensive . -LRB- The Gold Caress , however , does n't include a shaving head . -RRB- With this model you also have the choice of AC or rechargeable . Hope this helps .
 When my Emjoi Gently Gold Caress broke -LRB- after years of use - I whole-heartedly give it five stars -RRB- , I bought this , thinking more expensive means better . This was unfortunately a bad assumption and I really wish I 'd just bought another Gold Caress.The Optima does n't fit well in my hand and the cord often comes out while I 'm using it on my legs since my hand is brushing up against the spot where the cord is attached to the epilator -LRB- if you 're going to make a non-cordless epilator , make the cord permanently attached !!! -RRB- . Also , because it 's a bit uncomfortable to hold , I am not always able to hold the skin of my underarm taut and the skin gets pinched -LRB- one time it drew blood -RRB- . In the end , I do still use it and it is better than the Braun I bought in between the two , but I wish I had the Gold Caress instead . It fit well in my hand and because it is cordless I could use it without an outlet nearby .
 I am a 24 year old male in great shape -LRB- just so you all know im no wimp -RRB- . When I used the trimmer on my Arms the pain was so bad I about passed out -LRB- not joking -RRB- . This may work out better for womens legs because their legs are used to being shaved so the skin is much tougher . It will irritate your skin -LRB- similar to when you get waxed
 This product may be exactly what it is supposed to be , however I used it for aproximately 2 minutes and could not stand it any longer . Despite the fact that I followed the directions given for maximum efficiency and for least amount of pain , it was extremely painful . The amount of hair that was removed was almost unnoticable and I was bleeding to the point that it was on the epilator . If more hair had been removed I might have suffered through but it was clear it would have taken at least an hour or more to complete the process . I was unwillingly to endure the pain for that long . My hair was not extremely long and so this could not have been the problem.Again , the product may be a good one , maybe it is supposed to hurt this much . My pain tolerance is fairly good . I have had several surgeries and managed high pain levels with minimal pain meds . I can not imagine anyone enduring the epilator process though . Waxing never sounded so good .
 First time user , just ca n't stand the pain ! So thank goodness it comes with an electric razor head , to bad it does not work real well . I would of been happier with a good electric razor for the money ! If you can stand the pain it does pull those hairs right out , if not try somthing you will enjoy for awhile !
 Total waste of money . Sorry , I had such High hopes , but this just hurts .
 25May2008Paula here in Phoenix . Do n't buy the Emjoi AP99 or the Emjoi AP98 . Sadly , the tweezer head gears break too soon in both units . In just 5 months I went through 3 AP99 tweezer heads , and one AP98 head with a second about to go . They work great when they work . I 'm trying the Braun units , next . They have a better reputation.Paula
 This item arrived DOA -- did n't even get to the 6-month death that other reviewers speak of . What a waste of time.Emjoi products truly are cheap . AVOID !
 I 've used epilators , almost exclusively , for the past 10 years . It just is n't worth the hassle of shaving everyday . I 've used the Braun silk-epil the last couple times and since I 've had to replace it twice now because it simply stopped working , I thought I would try another product that I hoped would have a better lifespan . I also figured that since I was getting a new product , I may as well try to fix some of the other flaws I 've found with the Braun product - hair grows back too quickly , hair is n't removed fast enough , it is extremely loud , it sometimes simply does not pick up hair . So I tried the emjoi optima.Huge mistake.Some reviews had mentioned the ergonomics are not ideal . I have small hands but I am a grown woman -LRB- albeit , 5 foot 2 -RRB- and after about a minute of holding this my hand was cramping up in pain - it was the same pain I experienced after writing by hand for about 3 hours straight . Thus I would say it is not that the ergonomics are not ideal , they are so terrible that it is difficult to use the product . For me , impossible.The design of the head is also off . The blades are only in the middle of the device and they depress and need to touch the skin in order for it to work . the plastic parts next to the blades do not depress . So if you have parts of your body that have , say , bones , it is very difficult to get the epilator to remove hair without taking off slices of skin -LRB- a most unpleasant experience , and one I have never had with any other epilator -RRB- . There are two speeds , which would make sense , except that the device is not designed for the user to be able to guide the device to the necessary areas and still hold onto the epilator - the motor power sends all the energy into the head , which means that if you depress at 90 degrees as you are meant to do , all the pressure of a modulating motor is on the skin and in order to keep the epilator in place , you have to push it and hold it in place like you 're doing a serious exercise.On top of all of this , it simply does n't remove hair . It leaves all kinds of stubble , not massive stubble but there 's no point to going through all of this if you ca n't then slide your hand along your leg and have it be smooth . And it takes forever because you have to repeat areas endlessly to get the same result you would get on one round with the Braun device.I horribly regret having purchased this device and wish some of the reviews would have been more explicit about what a terrible product it is .
 This is , as it claims to be , a novelty item . After the first use , the metallic finish was visibly chipping off . Although the vibrator worked fine , there is not a wide range of possibilities . It also requires 2 size `` N '' batteries -LRB- included -RRB- which I have no idea where to buy from after these run out . I wish I had read the fine print !
 I got this via the Gold Box offer and I was able to use this two , maybe three times , before it stopped working altogether . And when it `` did work , '' it DID N'T ! I got no curl in my lashes and I was EXTREMELY disappointed . Unfortunately , I 'm now stuck with it , although I 'm considering sending it back to the manufacturer to try to get it replaced under the warranty . Who knows ... maybe it really is a dud , and they 'll send me one that really works . But if you 're skeptical to begin with , do n't bother buying this . Stick to the typical manual curler .
 I have really long eyelashes . And besides lipgloss and eyeliner , my other essential item is my eyelash curler . I thought this product sounded like a great little invention . HEAT of course should set and curl your lashes all day . But after opening the package and using it , it did n't work at all . It did a good job of separating my eyelashes , but nothing else . I say go for your old fashion eyelash curler . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS KNICK KNACK .
 I too purchased this item from my gold box . I 've used it a half dozen times and it takes TOOOOO long and I never get a real ` curl ' . I 've since reverted back to my handy dandy original eylash crimper .
 I was very excited to read the other reviews and so I purchased the eyelash curler when it was offered through the `` gold box '' specials . Fortunately , I did n't spend a lot on this item because it did n't work at all . The red strips that are suppose to turn white when it 's ready and warm never happened . It would have cost more to return the item than it was worth so I plan to put it in the trash .
 I bought this item because it was one of my gold box offers and it had a couple good reviews . I do n't think it works at all . My lashes did n't look any different after using it . I would not recommend this item .
 Never got the hang of it , there is no grip for the curler to go on the lashes . Very UN user friendly . Hot Lashes is much better , it ios the only one that works .
 Bought this item since it was in my Gold Box . Have tried it on 4 different occasions and my lashes looked no -- NO -- different . Passed it on to a friend thinking that maybe it was just me , but she threw it in the trash a few weeks later I can only surmise that the many positive reviews on this site were written by Emjoi employees ... Do n't waste your money .
 These are terrible . The blades are the cheapest things imaginable -- so blunt that they leave nails ragged , making it even more likely that your baby will accidentally scrape himself with his nails . And the rounded edges make it nearly impossible to use them on the tiniest nails . And they are larger than regular adult nail scissors , which I now use on my baby instead of these.Don ' t be fooled as I was by the fact that they 're marketed as baby nail scissors . Nothing about these scissors suggests they were actually designed to be the safest thing to use on a baby 's delicate , small nails . The only thing about them that says `` baby '' is the -LRB- admittedly cute -RRB- butterfly design . If all you care about is how they look in your medicine cabinet , these will do fine . If you actually want to use the scissors , definitely get something else .
 I do n't know if it 's bc i 'm left-handed but most scissors work just fine , not these . I ca n't cut anything with them . They are dull metal parts that should be sharp do n't even touch .
 The scissors are not a toy , and I was asked to review them as a toy . Hence , my rating may be of no value . I was a bit disappointed as they do n't work very well to trim an infants nails .
 I could n't use these clippers on my daughter 's fingers . I could n't see what I was doing !! It 's a cute but terrible design . I bought a summer infant set -LRB- home and travel clippers -RRB- and am very happy with it .
 This mouthwash is too strong , burns mouth , no taste . My son uses it and it has the same effect.Try other flavors instead .
 I was not paying much attention when I ordered this , but with shipping it cost me $ 26 . This is more than a liter of whiskey costs . So be careful of shipping .
 The various components are good quality
 It feels good to stretch the plantar muscle ... this did n't help me feel better . the night splint finally helped
 This is a pretty simple review
 I have a bedroom with blinds , but there 's a light on in the courtyard of my apartment complex that shines right onto them all night ! I purchased this sleep mark instead of spending a lot of money on drapes , etc. . When I first put the mask on , I was very impressed ! No light came in around or under the edges and it was pitch black . It was also extremely comfortable . The issue came when I tried to sleep with it on -- I sleep on my sides . The mask is too thick , and sleeping on my side caused a `` lump '' where the thickness of the mask came into play . I was up all night readjusting the thing because the band also has a tendency to work its way up . What 's more , all night I kept feeling `` tickling '' from what I thought was a stray hair but turned out to be the bottom of the mask already fraying and a string was the tickle . It 's not going to last very long and I 've only used it 4 times ! $ 19.99 wasted .
 Be careful with this product . After using it I was n't able to speak normally for two days because my throat was so raw . I had a fan on -- but that did n't seem to help . I would use a mask if I use it again .
 I got this for my wife to use and she was less than pleased with the product . The conditioner did n't leave her hair feeling any better ; in fact ; she thought it actually made her hair more dry and frizzy . Thinking it may be a reaction with the shampoo she was using , she even switched shampoo and did n't get the results she was expecting from this conditioner . I do n't think this product lives up to its advertising claims , and we wo n't be purchasing it in our household .
 This conditioner was okay . It was comparable to the other brands that I use -LRB- Clairol , Finesse , Pantene , etc. -RRB- There was nothing to special about it and the smell was kind of funny . I would n't recommend this product .
 been taking this for a month and a half with no positive results as of this posting , supplements are not necessary ?
 My ear doctor told me this stuff might help stop the ringing in my ears so I gave it a shot . After taking it twice a day for a month , it does n't seem to have helped much at all .
 I bought this ottoman for my mom for her birthday and I am returning it because the massager is a joke . It vibrates the whole floor -LRB- she has wooden floors -RRB- and even if you put it on a rug , I could feel the vibration from the couch next to her ! The ottoman itself is decent , but has no storage space because of the `` massager '' . The massager does n't do anything really , other than tickle your feet and make a loud noise . Do n't bother with this ottoman , it 's awful .
 These are n't Jolly Ranchers . If you 're looking for something that tastes like Watermelon Jolly ranches , these are n't for you . they have a sickening oily sweet taste to them . Waaaay too sweet . Stick to the Halls Citrus instead .
 This item did not have a good description and was way bigger than I wanted .
 This iten is to large for any one I would think and it is way to soft it was n't what I thought it would be
 I was not happy with this item and was extremely shocked when I had to go to the post office to retrieve the item . If using as an adult toy , keep in mind , the item is somewhat heavy , limp or flimsy . The girth/width is alittle on the larger side . There was a bad odor to the product when it came out of the package . I was not impressed and this was n't what I expected or ordered !
 This item smells ... and I dont mean just an odd oder , I mean it really smells . The smell remains anywhere this item has been . I have washed the sheets , the towels , the sofa cover , and the smell is still there ! I came home from work and the whole house smelled ! It is really bad . I do not recommend that anyone buys this product . I threw it in the trash .
 Recently bought it ... too soft , too big , too smelly and ca n't return it so better stay away from it.so Journey of this rubber starts from Amazon warehouse to post office to my home to garbage can ... God knows where it ends next . . There goes my $ 17 ... Could have bought plenty of unripped banana for $ 17 and it comes all sizes and shapes ... ; - -RRB-
 Positive
 I have used this product for years and now for some unknown reason , the frangrance that was in this product is no longer there . The product is not the same .
 I really wanted this to work . In fact I took it faithfully for 2 years waiting for it to work . Unfortunately it never took my BP down at all . In fact I wound up in the hospital with a blood pressure of 300/120 . Let 's just say I 'm on 5 blood pressure meds now and I promised my doctor I 'd throw this stuff out.I 'm not saying this wo n't work on some people . I imagine it does . But if you 're having hypertensive numbers consistently consult your doctor and take care of yourself .
 I received this dildo as a gift from My Wish List . I would n't have added it to My Wish List had I known how nasty the thing smells ! I washed it well with soap and water after opening the package . It smelled so badly that I decided to leave it sitting on My counter to air it out . It 's been 4 days now , checked it every day and it still stinks really gross ! This material might be latex free but I 'm not sure I 'd want to use it when it stinks so badly!Now I find out this item can NOT be returned . Hate being stuck with products I do n't want !! I do NOT recommend this product when there 's so many similar dildoes that do n't smell so badly !
 Product was packed well , however , plastic case for razor was open when received . Simply put , my criticism is harsh for this product , it did n't work at all for me , and my beard and mustache are n't all that thick . New blade on razor was too dull . Do n't waste your money on this razor . I also bought a pack of extra razor refills for the handle , and still found the blades too dull and useless . I should have been given the option to give zero stars for this product .
 I have four problems with this product.A -RRB- Product quality : I bought this as a replacement , because my previous handle came apart after 24 shaves.B -RRB- Usability : This handle is entirely different shape and contour that prior models.This does n't come with a tray to hold extra blades.This does n't fit in existing trays to hold extra blades.C -RRB- Customer Service : I reported the problem to Shick , which is `` Energizer Personal Care '' .2 weeks later , they responded with apology , and committment to send me a coupon to replace the handle .5 weeks after that email , I received the coupon in the mail.D -RRB- The blades clog . If I have stubble only , then the shaving goo and stubble bits pack into the razor . It ca n't be rinsed out except maybe by a pressure-washer . If I have a couple of week 's worth of growth , the hairs all get stuck in the safety wires they put over the blades to keep them from cutting you.Overall , this product shows a lack of usability study , poor customer service , etc.Go back to Gillette . They are worth the 15 % more cost for the 3000 % better product .
 This was , without a doubt , the grossest shake I 've ever tried . I used their shaker , and after nearly five minutes of vigorous shaking it STILL had chunks in it . Do n't even think of trying to drink it out of the shaker 's drinking spout ... it 's so thick it wo n't move ... and not in a good way , in a like-the-stuff-you-clean-out-of-the-tub-drain way . To add insult to injury ? It 's GREEN ! I 'm not even kidding ... it 's a chunky , bubbly , thick mess of green that is totally gross . Waste of money .
 Hmmm . My Mother drinks these so I thought I would try it . However there is no way I could drink these every day .
 ** I could not be more disappointed with this purchase . ** I started losing weight in mid-September and was steadily losing two lbs a week . For reference , I cut my calories down to 1200 and started on the elliptical . I decided to buy this shake mix since it does n't have high fructose corn syrup like the cans and I wanted a drink for breakfasts -LRB- solid foods early in the day make me feel sick for a few hours , I was hoping this would be a great way to get around that . -RRB- I started drinking it every morning starting November 1st , while adjusting my solid food intake to about 1000 calories , and I immediately plateaued . I even GAINED a pound and had to work really hard to burn it off.Most people gave this stuff 5 stars ?? REALLY !?!?!?! It seriously makes me hate advertisers who use product reviews to sling their junk . I 'm trying to lose literally half my body weight while battling severe back problems , I do not need this . I stopped the Slim Fast breakfasts at the last day of November and BAM ! by December 2 I 'm down 4 lbs . This is ridiculous . It should have helped me instead of making things more difficult . I do n't know if it 's the sugar content or what , but I will never be buying this shit again .
 SLIM FAST DOES NOT NOT NOT I REPEAT NOT MAKE YOU SLIM ... . THIS IS FULL OF SUGAR AND FAT ... SLIM FAST WILL MAKE YOU FAT ...
 Shipping charge is $ 8.19 for a $ 16.00 product that weighs less than 2 pounds . This vendor should be avoided .
 I wanted to use this as a breakfast replacement , but I ca n't get over the chemical taste of it . Something that tastes so synthetic ca n't be good for you , can it ?
 I purchased this to help supplement my weight loss efforts as I 'm really terrible at making/preparing breakfast for myself everyday . I used this faithfully for one week , and felt pretty good . However , during the second and third consecutive weeks of using this in the morning -LRB- and eating balanced meals for the remainder of the day -RRB- I started to notice it was not being tolerated by my stomach . I would get ridiculously gassy and would have stomach pains . I tried different types of liquids -LRB- water , soy milk , 1 % milk , etc -RRB- and got the same results with each . Unfortunately , I had to stop using this . Once I stopped , the stomach pains immediately went away . I still use it once in a while , but the stomach pains return more often than not so I 've decided it 's best just to throw it out.The good thing is that if this is something that you 've been able to use and tolerate in the past , the 31 ounce canister is a great value through Amazon . This product would have definitely lasted a long time if I had decided to continue using it .
 Even fresh out of the package , these blades are n't as sharp as Fiskars or Olfa blades , and both of the blades in the package I purchased developed mysterious dings and dull spots literally within minutes of their first use on a clean cutting mat free of pins or anything else that would have damaged the blades . I 'm not buying these again .
 The Answer One Step Ovulation Test has some drawbacks . First of all , if you do n't have a fairly regular cycle the five tests wo n't be enough to determine when you 'll ovulate . Also , the test itself should be marked at the window indicating the test line . This would avoid confusion about which line you 're actually reading , without having to refer to the picture to make sure that you 're holding it correctly for an accurate reading .
 Maybe I am not applying this product right but it doe NOT seem to do MY beard any good before I shave .
 I purchased the 3 pack and used them one day after another . The first time I got an evaporation line , the second one , I received a dark , very thin , blue positive line right away , and the third was a faint line within the 10 minute timing window . During the time of these Clearblue test , I was also using some of the wondfo and a dollar store test and they all came up negative . I read many many reviews stating how clearblue has a lot of false positives . So disappointing and a waste of money , not to mention heartbreak.My opinion is ... go get a First Response or a dollar store test . I gave it one star only because that is the minimum you can put .
 I get so many false positives with these . They leave evaporation lines that can drive you up a tree if you scrutinize these things . Do n't bother with them . Use First Response orWondfo Pregnancy Test Strips
 I ca n't see what all the hype is about these razors . I bought a large quantity thinking they would blow my old razor -LRB- Gillette Venus -RRB- out of the water . Big mistake . To me these are no different then cheap bics . Initially I was cutting myself constantly , which was never a problem with the Venus . Then the razor burn which was so unbearable that I had to slather my legs in aloe for relief . The irony is that I suffered this for no reason - they did n't even give me a smooth shave and after a months usage I found myself WAY more susceptible to nasty ingrown hairs . So I do n't know if I just got bad batch of cartridges or what , but I think for people who have really sensitive skin this is a total waste of money ! Back to Venus !
 These are the same great blades that I used for 25 years . I stayed with them for two reasons
 The glasses are waaaaaay to small for a man . I thought they would be good since the description says for both men and woman , but it is in no way big enough for a man . Very disappointed .
 The lens quality was VERY good , but the quality was bad tube , opened alone . And that is not highly recommended .
 Have three pair of these . Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces . All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case . The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart . On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right . Wish I could find something better in this style .
 The clip on the case of this product broke the first time I used it . The reason I purchased the product was because of the case and clip . Would not recommend .
 This personal touch razor was designed in the 1970 's and they never changed the original formula for making the razor/blades . The blades are brittle and the `` safety '' strip can break with as little pressure as it takes to shave your legs , leaving you subject to injury from a straight razor blade . This happened to me , and i had 27 stiches 18 external and 9 internal to hold the wound shut which was about 6 inches long , and an inch deep . I have a permanent scar on my calf . This was all proven in a court of law ... i won a lawsuit against Schick . Please be careful if you insist on using this razor , and i am horrified that they are still available at all , as i know i was not the only person this happened to .
 turned on clipper for the 1st time it was noisy , adjusted the power screw same problem , it just wud not work
 Do not buy this ! It does not cut close at all ... I had better results with a $ 12 cheap-o no name . Please do n't waste your money .
 At first when I got the product I was like `` whoa , this is heavy and seems pretty heavy duty '' unfortunately the cutting is not so great.On the plus side it comes with a bunch of accessories that are great but not worth the money to get some scissors and such .
 IT WAS A MISTAKE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT . O.K. I TAKE THE BLAME.I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING SIMILAR IN MARSHALL OR IN ROSS , BUT I DECIDED TO TAKE THIS WAHL 79524 BY THINKING IN THE BRAND AND THE PRESENTATION , BUT I HAVE USED IT JUST FOR THREE OR FOUR TIMES , AND IT HAS LOST THE EDGE . MACHINE not include all the attachments that ANNOUNCED
 The clipper made a horrible noise when it worked under swiss power supply . I am not sure if it is because of the difference between american power and swiss power . Noise was attenuated when I turn down the power screw on the clipper but it still somewhat strong .
 Unfortunately , this is the absolutel worst shaver I have ever owned and operated . I have been cutting my own hair for about 10 years , and have been through several shavers , including Wahl products , but this is the worst . Ironically , it is the most I have paid for one before . This shaver vibrates uncontrollably while you are trying to use it , the only question is whether your hand goes numb first or you cut your head numerous times . The only good thing about it is that it does get a close shave ; however , at the expense of feeling like your hair is being plucked from your head and scraping your head . I am a Marine so I have been shaving my head for years , so this was not a matter of just never shaving before ; the product was a complete disappointment , and if I were not in Iraq I would take steps to try to get a refund but it is too inconvenient at this point .
 It 's not worth of buying this JUNK peice ... Its so big , cant handle oursleves . I do n't feel like using it anymore .
 These clippers kind of worked the first time , but not really that well . And the more I use them , the worse they become . They will cut some pieces of your hair , but you have to go over the same spot several times before it looks decent , and even then there are some pieces that do n't get cut . I would have expected more out of a Wahl , but I was greatly disappointed it how the clippers cut .
 I bought this to replace a Conair clipper . I shave my head once every other week , and just need a basic clipper that does the job.My problem is this
 Product obviously had a good motor with the way it violently shook my hand when I tried to use it , but the blades did n't cut my hair . It simply tugged on my hair every few seconds , causing it to take me an hour just to shave my head , including a few nicks on my neck . It is possible that it could have just been damaged during shipping , but I would n't try this clipper ever again .
 First impression
 I bought these for my fiance for Christmas and returned them the next day . He has been shaving his head for almost two years now and these are by far the worst clippers either one of us have seen ! Not only did the clippers NOT cut close enough on the second or third pass , they also left large patches of uncut hair no matter how many times you went over it . We were previously using a set of Andis Pet Clippers bought at PetSmart for the same price and will be going back there for a new pair ! If you have thick , coarse hair these clippers are definitely NOT for you .
 Have three pair of these . Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces . All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case . The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart . On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right . Wish I could find something better in this style .
 The clip on the case of this product broke the first time I used it . The reason I purchased the product was because of the case and clip . Would not recommend .
 The glasses are waaaaaay to small for a man . I thought they would be good since the description says for both men and woman , but it is in no way big enough for a man . Very disappointed .
 The lens quality was VERY good , but the quality was bad tube , opened alone . And that is not highly recommended .
 I bought this product thinking of my 12 year old son who has a terrible posture . I always say to him that he looks like the hunchback of Notre Dame.It could be that he is very thin and tall , but this band did nothing . It should have gradual hooks to adjust to different types of bodies . It was too loose and did n't do what it was supposed to do.I tried it , but found it extremely unconftable after a couple of hours.I will not recommend this Posture Band .
 It does help with holding my shoulders back however , it really hurts my underarms so I ca n't wear it for long periods of time . Also , you do have to be careful with what you wear ... it 's not too thick but depending on the shirt you are wearing it does show through .
 It is suppose to be one size fits all ... NO Way is that the case .
 this product really didnt help me with my posture . it hurt my arm pits , it was diffucult to get on and off and you can see it through clothing . I dont reccomend it to anybody who isnt very thin .
 Previous product reviews stated that the device was uncomfortable to wear even over clothing to prevent chafing . I thought I would be able to modify the item but I was wrong . One size does not fit all and my attempt to add commercial bra extenders was not successful . Perhaps someone of slight size might be able to use the support brace . I could not . The picture is accurate and should be looked at carefully .
 This has to be the most uncomfortable back and shoulder support I have ever purchased . Do n't waste your money !
 I ordered one of these to help my posture . It definitely pulls your shoulders back which does , in fact , help your posture . The problem is that the straps cut off the blood flow to your arms . Your arms start tingling and that 's just the start of its uncomfortableness . After a while , the straps bruised my arms . My posture was corrected wearing it but the price on my physical comfortableness was too high to pay .
 This works but it cuts into you runderarms as there is no padding on the straps . also I found myself adjusting it quite often as it would find itself traveling up my back .
 Needed something to pull the shoulder blades back - have developed `` wings '' over the years of poor posture ! The design is very poor in practical wearing . The fabric under the arms resembles velcro and very irritating & tight , without any adjustment for the armpit area . The center fastener does not stay in place - level with the shoulder blades - which further irritates the armpits by continuing to creep up toward the neck . Agree with another poster , this would be much more effective with a front adjustable band/strap to keep in proper position . Wearing does make me more aware of my posture which reminds me to correct the `` wing thing '' by standing with shoulders back . BTW I am 5 ' 5 '' & 120 pounds , so I can not imagine how uncomfortable this would be on someone taller or with developed shoulders , arm muscles , etc. .
 First this band was really difficult to put on . Then after wearing it a short while I could feel the bloodflow to my arms being cut right from the armpits . I couldn 'd wear it .
 I could not wear it for very long or on successive days . I put it up and forgot it since it was hard to put on as well . It is in the drawer unused .
 I only bought this because I spend a lot of my time leaning over and slouching when I am at my drawing board or computer for several hours , so I wanted something to support my back , and align it into a healthy posture , and this looked the least awkward looking device.I expected it to be uncomfortable at first , until I get used to it ; but this is treatment by torture.Since this comes with no instructions what so ever , I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers who said you should wear it OVER a T-shirt , so I put it on and headed to the library for a test drive.After 10 minutes I started feeling numbness in my forearms and tingling in my fingers -LRB- although It was on the lowest possible pressure and I am a relatively thin person -RRB- it was pressing so hard it cut off the circulation to my arms and hands , My shoulder was sore for 2 days after that incidence.I decided to give it another chance so I wore it under the T-shirt in direct contact with the skin , this time it actually fitted , and I did n't get a the numbness again.However , I think there is something wrong with the design , it is supposed to straighten your back by pulling your scapulas back and down , this means that the elastic pulling material should be between your shoulder blades ; instead , the elastics here are the rings surrounding the shoulders -LRB- if you look at the product photo on this page you 'll see what I mean -RRB- so all the pressure and pull is concentrated in this area , which explains the sore armpits you get after wearing it for even a short time.And since there is nothing supporting it from the opposite direction , whenever you move your arms it begins to ride up your neck , and begins to pull your shoulders upward.It is a real shame , because this product is small and could have been a great thing with a few minor adjustments , like padding the shoulder straps -LRB- they feel like rubber bands under your arm pits -RRB- and having a frontal strap to align it and prevent is from riding.In conclusion , it only works by painfully reminding you to '' ... Straighten your back and do n't slouch ! '' you get the same effect by staying at your mothers ' !
 The arm straps are very tight and press hard upwards against your armpits . It feels like it 's cutting off circulation to your arm . The material is also kind of rough so there 's a burning feeling wherever there 's pressure/contact . It leaves marks on your skin after wearing it for only a few minutes.It 's also very hard to wear it like the picture . The band wants to crawl upwards to your neck , which in turn would pull your neck down , and hurt your posture!I 'm just a average built guy , but I tend to slouch . So I think most people would experience the same difficulty with this as I did . The only reason I bought this was because I was intrigued after seeing it on a Sky Mall Catalog . I could n't find any customer reviews for it , so I took a chance and bought one -LRB- for under $ 10 -RRB- . I guess the lesson is
 I think this is the kind of thing that is only effective in that , because you are aware that it is there , you may learn to keep your shoulders back . Why are you aware that it 's there ? Because it 's uncomfortable!Also , it rides up in back so that it ceases to be as effective as when you first put it on .
 I purchased this item for my daughter as she is quite the sloucher ; I was sick of poking my finger between her shoulder blades to get her to stand up straight.This product lasted one day on her . She had major chafing in her underarm area , and it was constantly `` riding up '' since the elastic did n't seem to pull back . The other reviews are correct in that the product did not come with any instructions ; just tossed in a plastic baggie and shipped off . Heck , I did n't even know there was a `` this end up '' until I read another review.At least it was n't a major expense .
 I 'm sorry , but this item is a joke . There is absolutely nothing to this piece of elastic . The view is of the back and that is all there is , there is no front . Take a piece of elastic and put a rubber band at each end and there you have the `` Posture Perfect Band , Back Support Brace '' HA ! Not worth returning , postage is more than the product . I would n't even rate this product with a -0 , but I had to fill in all blanks and 1 star was as low as I could go .
 This product , even though rated one size fits all , did not fit me at all . This product is most likely for slender petite women .
 As the sating goes '' you get what you pay for '' : -LRB- The strap is one size firs all but it doesnt fit normal size women . Its very large which defeats the purpose of it.I would say pay the extra money and buy a supportive one that works
 Underworks posture perfect band ... This was ok , but not what I was expecting . I wanted something to hold my shoulders back so I would n't be slouched all the time . This does not to the trick ; it 's too big for one -LRB- 5 `` 7 , female , broader than most -RRB- and it lets me slouch in it . I am trying to find something else .
 This band did n't really do anything but cut into my underarms . And I 'm not a very big person , so I do n't know what someone of average stature would do with it . Very uncomfortable and ineffective .
 Does not support your posture at all because it rises to the point that it nearly touches your neck and it is very uncomfortable . the makers need to go back to the drawing board with this one .
 I tried this product though I found it a bit uncomfortable under the arms . I was n't able to wear it all day but will try again .
 The strap slides up the longer u wear it until it rubs at the base of your neck ... very annoying . I tried wearing it just while sleeping and the bands just dug into my skin .
 This product is to small broad shouldered people . It does not state the maximum expansion . Be leery of this product .
 The brace only served as a reminder to hold my shoulders back because if I did n't , it hurt worse than it did when I let them slouch . Very uncomfortable . Only wore it for about a week .
 This item just shipped today , and I could n't wait to try it . Totally uncomfortable ! Very revealing under clothes . The left arm strap was actually constructed twisted which made the left side even more uncomfortable than the right . The straps roll into a cord regardless of an undershirt or near the skin , and the the section that attaches the hooks to the actual straps is n't as wide as the photo shown . I feel if I had received that one I might be happier with the product . I did give it one star because it did pull my shoulders back and improved my posture . Totally not worth the pain .
 This product did not help me at all and was too inexpensive to bother to return . It ended up going to Goodwill .
 I could n't stand to wear this . It rubbed the front of my shoulder and my underarms raw . Would NOT recommend this at all .
 You can adjust the band smaller or bigger but it was n't right for me.I wore it for one day but i would not wear itfor an other minute.it 's hurting your armpits ...
 I purchased this because of its price , and I would have to argue that that is the best thing about it . I have a slight posture problem that I was hoping this project would help , but I do n't have much faith in its efficacy . For one thing , there is little to no literature explaining how to best use the product . I received it in the mail and immediately put it on , but I was uncertain as to how tight it was supposed to be to get the best results and if there is a method to using the device , like starting looser and then tightening as your posture `` improves '' . Other than a soreness under my arms and in my shoulders , I had no way of telling if the band was `` working '' . I used it consistently for work during the first 2 weeks I owned it and have since discontinued use . I would recommend purchasing some other device , maybe not necessarily for design issues but more so for instruction that will allow you to use the device properly . If that costs more , I am now of the opinion that those few more dollars are worth the wasted space in my sock drawer where this band now resides .
 I really felt this did n't provide enough aid as I was looking for . The bands are too stretchy that it really did n't help hold my shoulders back .
 I think this product would work , but one size does not fit all . I am small , but not so small that a general one size should not fit me , especially since it has an adjustable back . I had this closed all on the smallest hooks and it still was sagging on me . I think it would work , but you must have broad shoulders and a broad back . Do n't trust the picture , I do n't know how they made it fit that woman .
 I found that this did nothing to help my posture and is extremely uncomfortable . It hardly keeps your shoulders back . If you slouch , you might be better off with something that has more lower back support .
 There is n't much to this item . It is flimsy and supplies no structural stability to improving posture . Be leery of cheap items in the future and those that prey on those who choose cheaply .
 I bought the stap for my daughter who is big busted for a small framed teen . I could see her starting to hunch her back alot so I decided to try it . She says its not uncomfortable , but it does look bulky under her shirts .
 This posture band is a joke . It does not hold your shoulders back and after wearing for an hour the back strap had ridden all the way up to my neck and was showing out from under the back of my shirt . Talk about embarrassing .
 This product is not tight enough to force you to stand up straight . It 's just an added hassel . And the other reviews were correct ; it hurts your armpits .
 It did nothing for my posture . The material is stretchy so it gives too much and does not help hold my shoulders back . It also has nothing to go around in front under the chest so it just keeps sliding up and forward and the next thing you know the back of it is up on the back of your neck and your shoulders are slumped forward again . Hate to say it , but it did n't work at all for me .
 This is a good idea , and did hold my shoulders back . The problem was , it cuts in under my armpits and after a few hours it was unbearable . I 'm considering trying to work up to wearing it longer , but the discomfort is holding me back -- for now
 I purchased a similar device about 2 years ago . It fit and worked well . This one did not . I am still looking for the previous manufacturer as their unit fit well and lasted several years . If you weigh more than 100 lbs , do not expect this product to fit .
 After wearing this brace for 20 minutes on the tightest setting , it stretched out and did not pull my shoulders back like it is designed to . It also started to ride up my back towards my neck which made it entirely useless . I guess you do get what you pay for ... the shipping was as much as the product !
 First of all , one size fits all is not the case for this product ! I am a 32/34 band size and it was far too big for me . I would n't suggest even trying this product unless you are at least a 36/38 band size . It did absolutely nothing for my posture ! It does n't straighten your back up and correct posture , all I would think that it 'd do -LRB- for people that it fits -RRB- is pull your shoulder back a tiny bit , but it would n't make you stand up straight . Not worth my money at all . Being returned asap !
 I should have believed the other reviews of the product . It just slipped right up my back as soon as a moved my arms and was then completely useless .
 this product really hurt my shoulder when I put it on , it 's useless to me and not worth the shipping and handling to return
 This did n't even have resistance on the tightest level . It did n't hurt at all but it did n't help either . I 'm an average size person , not real large but not a fitness freak either . so maybe its for larger people
 This product does hold your shoulders back thus improving posture . It is however terribly uncomfortable . It is perhaps the most uncomfortable thing I 've ever worn . It slips constantly and shows when it does . It caused chaffing in the armpits .
 This band did nothing for my posture ! It gave me scars on my shoulders and arms from rubbing on it all day . It is also not very discreet . You can see it if you wear a shirt that is cut low in the back or on the sides . I like The Cincher much better .
 This product is far too small to be one size fits all . I usually wear a small or medium and it is tight on me under the arms . The strange thing is it is very loose in the shoulders right where it shouldbe tight . It falls out of place very easily . It isnt a functional design .
 Have three pair of these . Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces . All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case . The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart . On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right . Wish I could find something better in this style .
 The clip on the case of this product broke the first time I used it . The reason I purchased the product was because of the case and clip . Would not recommend .
 The glasses are waaaaaay to small for a man . I thought they would be good since the description says for both men and woman , but it is in no way big enough for a man . Very disappointed .
 The lens quality was VERY good , but the quality was bad tube , opened alone . And that is not highly recommended .
 I ordered this massager because I had read great reviews about it . To my surprise , when I received it , it was a different model . I paid $ 20 extra for this model because I wanted something of quality for my girlfriend . The model they actually sent me I could have got for $ 20 cheaper from EBay . I feel cheated and like I was ripped off . I contacted the vender and when I told them of this they simply cut off communication and no longer answered my emails .
 motor was strong and has infra-red LEDS that warm , however the dual head does not

 The battery I received was dated 2005 also . I hope this was just the label date , and not when the battery was made .
 I 'm not sure if these had been improperly stored or if they were old , or fake . However , it failed within 2 weeks of use .
 Bottle leaked in the carton even though the plastic was around the cap . Product says ` refrigerate after opening ' but apparently it has already been open and leaking for some time ... so the freshness has been compromised already . Do n't buy until they find a way to seal the product .
 I 'm amazed no one has mentioned how incredibly bitter this stuff is . It 's not sweet at all . It 's very tart and bitter . You need a lot of sugar to hide the bitterness . Wo n't be buying it again .
 I had to stop using it . It made me more constipated . I never do well with high fiber products .

 I guess everyone 's body is different . I kept breaking out with really bad rash on my knuckles and ankles after the second-third week . I gave the bottle away to my friend ; gave him the warning .
 First of all , I am a very frequent shopper on amazon.com ; however I did not purchase this product here . I logged on here to find information after my purchase.When ordering I did not see any reference at all for shellfish . I always look , as I would have a severe allergic reaction if I consumed it in any form or amount . Then the product arrived and , as always , I read the label . Down at the bottom , `` CONTAINS SHELLFISH -LRB- SHRIMP , CRAB -RRB- INGREDIENTS.I went back to review the information online to double check and see if it was my oversight . Apparently not . Just since my order date of March 8 , the store I bought from has discontinued the product . So have several other sites . On the few that are still carrying Optimum Nutrition Glucosamine Plus CSA Super Strength , NONE discloses there is shellfish content - including here . This is a real problem for people with allergic reaction . If I could give this product a worse rating that 1 star , I surely would .
 I was n't impressed with the Gillette Shaving Cream , Aloe and Allantoin . It did n't adhere to my skin well at all , and I also greatly disliked the scent . My wife used it for her legs and said that it was acceptable , but I will stick with my Barbasol .
 I did n't like this product very much . I 'm not sure if it was the shaving gel or not , but when I used this product , I nicked myself several times . I would n't recommend this product to my friends or family . It did however , leave my skin feeling very smooth .
 I 've never used any kind of shaving cream before . This product is very foamy . A little goes a very long way . After shaving , my legs definitely felt softer than when I shaved using soap . I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it to friends .

 You know , it 's the year 2011 . I went through puberty , and subsequently began shaving , 25 years ago . In all this time , with all the technological advances made to date , I can not believe that they still have not fixed the problem with shaving cream cans and the rust stains they leave on surfaces . Why , oh why , is this still a problem ? You use the shaving cream once , and the next time you get into the shower and pick up the can , there is a stain on the porcelain -LRB- or fiberglass , because BATH technology has advanced , even if shaving foam cans have not -RRB- . Why should I have to paint clear nail polish onto the bottom of my shaving foam cans to prevent this ? Why are n't THEY taking care of that problem themselves ? Shaving cream in a can is a solution to the problem of getting a close shave without razor burn , but what use is a solution that only creates other problems ? I will not be buying shaving foam in a can again until someone wakes up and deals with this issue . This is ridiculous .
 Flossing the old-fashioned way -LRB- floss around the fingers -RRB- uses less floss and is less of a hassle . I gave it 2 stars because I could see how maybe if you had bad arthritis or something that prevented flexibility in the fingers it might be of use . For a healthy-handed person , it made the flossing experience clunky and used about three times as much floss .
 Initially I was very pleased with the item . I ordered it Jan. 31 , 2011 and received it the first week in February . I used it nightly , unfortunately it broke last night . The seller offered no help beyond referring me to the manufacturer . A 7 week life span is pretty short .
 irresponsible vendor ; takes absolutely no responsibility over lost items ; will not recommend purchasing anything from this ghost vendor with no proper contact info .
 I purchased the Flossaid Dental Floss Holder from teethnthings.com through Amazon . The plastic `` y '' snapped in half after about six months . I am not a vigorous flosser , but this instrument was n't up to the job . And the shipping cost essentially doubled the price ! No more `` flossaid '' for me .
 I wish the pictures were better . This particular flosser is about as long as a toothbrush , and the prongs are about 1-1/2 '' apart . There 's a little button where the prongs meet where you wind the floss around -- this is held in place by a brass tack/rivet kind of thing . The prongs are angled , and at the end of each one is a shallow groove , which holds the floss in place . The handle is a bit less than 1/4 '' thick.Anyway , this feels really flimsy because the material just is n't robust enough . If I really pushed it , I 'm pretty sure it would snap -- it would be much better if it were made of steel or something . There 's a lot of `` give '' when I 'm moving it around in my mouth , and so that plus the design of the prongs -LRB- you can see they 're at an angle , which really restricts your movements -RRB- , makes the whole thing really awkward to maneuver.Disposables are much easier to use , but if you 're convinced you want a refillable flosser , search around a bit and see if you can find the `` Ezy Floss '' which feels a lot more like a disposable .
 These floss devices need to be able to rotate the floss around so you are n't using the same small section of floss for your entire mouth . It 's quite an ordeal and waste of floss to set this thing up . Also , the holder is not as stiff as I 'd like .
 It is way too big and wastes a lot of line . Plus too time consuming for very little return if any !
 The device does not allow the tape to move , you need to use the same part over and over , and it takes a long time to adjust the tape on the stupid device .
 No matter how many times I wrap floss around this holder and how tight I screw the knob at the bottom , the floss manages to slip . I ca n't even return this because it 's more expensive to ship it back than to just keep it . Better to use your fingers .
 After only 4 months my flossaid snapped by the brass rivet , I did write to the manufacturer to complain and I sent them a photo of the broken flossaid but they did not reply . I expected an item that is made in the USA by a an American manufacturer to have some type of gurantee but I was wrong .
 This toothpaste tastes awful . my son tried it and did n't like it . So I tried it and had to spit it out . It did n't taste like bubble gum . Waste of money .

 My husband is very picky about shave gels , primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin . My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack , even though the price was under $ 3 a can with super saver shipping . He is not happy with this product . He 's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products , namely , Gillette Fusion , which he prefers . Also , insofar as use on his sensitive skin , the gel is only so-so . The fragrance is okay with him . However , what he particularly does n't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide . Now we have about four cans left , which he will grudgingly use , unless I can find him a deal on Fusion . He 's encouraging me to find one ... soon .
 So far one can out of the pack was dead on arrival - nothing would come out . Second can is fine . Do n't know about the others .
 I was a little disappointed with this product . My skin is pretty sensitive , and this gel tends to be a little harsh when using it to shave your legs . I 'd consider using it more if I ran out of my usual choice in shaving creams , but I do n't think so otherwise .
 I have taken Barefoot Coral Calcium capsules in the past , but for a couple years have not been able to purchase the product in retail stores -LRB- ie

 I purchased the Bed Desk for use with my laptop . The first thing I noticed was that it was to high to use in bed . The second thing was that when you put the top of the desk at an angle , there is a wood stop that keeps the laptop from sliding forward . That lip is to high and it digs into your wrists and also the screws on the hinge were sticking out and gave my 2 year old laptop it 's first scratches ! It may work out ok as a serving tray or magazine/book rack for use in your bed but thats about it . Even as a lap tray when your sitting in a chair , the all wood underneath is hard on your legs . Not the best designed thing and am returning it .
 It is a great idea but could use some tweaking . The legs are non-adjustable and are a little too high for use in bed , creating poor working ergonomics . Yes , you have the option to ship it back and have them saw the legs down to your desired height - but who wants to do that !? The legs also fold in easily and do not secure outward , creating instability on a mattress . Also , If you want to do homework on it , there is no way you can fit a book and a notebook on its surface . Not really worth the 80 bucks you pay after S&H .
 Please be aware that this product is also sold at thebeddesk.com and there is an unwritten `` no return no refund '' policy . I purchased a bed desk for my father , who unfortunately passed away before it was received . Mr David Drake , the inventor and president of the company refuses to refund my money despite my having returned the desk untouched in it 's original packaging . Buy at your own risk unless you can afford to lose the $ 50 + cost of the product .
 I bought these for Flu shots , opening 500 bandaids needs to be easy ... these are not easy to open . Tears a bit at times .
 It was listed under &#34; teak oils &#34; There is nothing to indicate this is safe for use on indoor teak furniture pieces .
 I 'm not sure how this rec 'd so many good reviews . This product is way too oily for anything but maybe Oak furniture . It seems to me that Oak -LRB- or equiv -RRB- would absorb the oil . For me ... it was a huge waste of money .
 I dont recommend it at all , dont waste your money and time . I tought why not and try it , but dont do anything at all . They dont work .
 Nifty idea , but breaks too easily . I purchased this item due to my back problem and it worked great for a while until the grip fell off . I thought it was just a manufacturing defect and therefore purchased another one . Same problem again . Will not buy again . A typical As Seen on TV item , poorly constructed .
 After using the Goepher a few times the screw came out of the left rubber cup and the cup came off . I tried to put it together but it would not hold . I have to scrap it because the tiny screw failed . I guess I got what I paid for . An inferior product . No one to contact for a replacement screw .
 When I first received the Ontel Products GOPMO2 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool Set , it worked fine , but over time it `` sprung '' the screws and the tips wore down . I am allergic to latex and I searched and found a US made product called EZ Reacher - Standard , with blue silicone tips . Found rave reviews at arcmate dot com . Please , check it out . I am ordering today ...
 I already have an Ontel Gopher and bought this one as a gift . It turned about while they have the pictures of the original Gopher listed in item description they you get has nothing to do with it . You will get a `` JMK Pickup & Reaching Tool '' which is very really cheap looking and has nothing to do with the Ontel Gopher ! Do n't waste your money .
 My 3rd Gopher just broke . ALL 3 have broken after a short time with light use in the exact same way ; The suction cups fall off of the screws because the plastic inserts crack.I am a foster/adoptive mom . My hands are full , as well as my minivan ! I needed a grabber so when I have all the kids in the van , I can pick up dropped items , hand things to the kids in the back row with ease , etc. I purchased the Gopher because it was easily accessible at Wal-Mart . In hindsight , it seems that all I may have done is waste more than $ 30 of our hard-earned money.I contacted the manufacturer , Ontel , right after the last one broke . This was their response , `` We will send you a 1-time complimentary set of the SUCTION CUPS W/SCREWS and directions on how to reattach , we will also include an order form so that you can order more whenever needed . You will receive in 3 business days . `` I still need a grabber , so in a few weeks when the latest set of suction cups break -LRB- and they will -RRB- I will invest in one from a totally different manufacturer . I will buy one that has the highest customer reviews and that will last me a good long time!This is how I would sum up my review : Fool me once ... Well , I 'll gave it 1 extra chance because the 1st one may have been defective.Fool me twice , shame on Ontel.Fool me three times ... OKAY , THAT 'S IT ... shame on me .
 Broke WAY too easily !! Did n't lift anything more than a few ounces . I have another one , from a different company , and like it very much ... wish I could remember where I bought it .
 When I first started buying gophers 10 years ago they were a precision instrument . I could pick up toothpicks , grains of rice and even needles from a carpet or any other surface . The last few I bought had the cups misaligned . The current and last one I will ever buy is assembled with the jaws at a 90 degree angle . From now on I will pay a little more and get something of better quality.As the song goes
 I own five of these . Why , if not that good ? Unfortunately , it 's the best I 've found so far . I 've been unable to walk for the last two years and have these all over the house . First , the gripping is n't very strong , and my arms are . However , compared to so many out there that do n't even have rubber contact surfaces , it grips much better . Plus , at least most of it is aluminum . I 've had several of the flimsy plastic ones self-destruct just picking up things like socks . Second , the folding joint is silly and very poorly made . These will indeed break in short order . Just do like I 've done-take a piece of metal cut to the proper size , put one on each side of the joint , and tape the sucker up . They work like a charm after that . Third , there is a locking switch on the handle that is supposed to lock the device in the grip position . It is not trustworthy enough to really use , but it is very easy to trip it exactly when one does n't want to use it . I have n't figured out a way to permanently defeat it . Fourth , the little rubber suction cups are only held on with plastic rings . These will also break in short order . You can rig a better bolt and washer through each suction cup.Again , I 'd happily pay three times the cost of each of these to have one that is truly made for daily use . Just beware buying some of the cheaper , all plastic ones . They 're even worse !
 If you want a strong tool this is NOT for you . The folding joint broke within 3 or 4 weeks under normal household use . The rubber cups easily pull off metal studs . There is no place to get repairs . While the Gopher is really cheap , I now need to buy another one because it only lasted a month ! I found the original version of this product called the ArcMate EZ Reacher and it 's guaranteed forever ! The price is twice the Gopher but the durability and guarantee make it a better bargain . The Gopher product seems to be a cheap knock-off of the more durable ArcMate reachers .
 The Gopher is a useful tool idea that can use some product enhancement . It is nice that it folds for easier storage . It allows you to reach for items in hard-to-reach places . Small items can be retrieved from high shelves with ease . It is rated to lift five pounds , but I do n't trust it that much . The heavier the item , the more strain on your wrist and on the Gopher.I tried using the Gopher to replace a light bulb . Seems like this would be the ideal tool to grab the bulb from a ceiling fixture and replace it . Not so . The locking mechanism does n't grip tightly enough . You can loosen the bulb , but as the bulb loosens , so does the Gopher 's grip . I was also unable to tighten the replacement bulb sufficiently . The locking grip did n't hold and it was too difficult rotating the Gopher while maintaining pressure on the pistol grip.The bottom line for me , the Gopher is a handy tool for reaching small , light , non-fragile items . It is a definite boon for people who are forced to be sedentary . It does not do the trick , however , for heavy items or items requiring a tight grip .
 This product would be the answer to our wishes if only the suction cups did n't dry out and fall off after a few months!I would n't buy another Gopher if they were 50 cents each ! It is disappointing to find such a well designed tool , only to have this most important part fail to hold up ! Perhaps the rubber is not of good quality or the screws are not the best way to fasten to the prongs ... to keep gluing cups back on is not an option for older people .
 I recieved aOntel Products GOPMO2 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool Setfor Christmas of 2009 and it broke in July of 2010 . My Mom has owned 3 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools in a 2 year period . I even tried to fix one of her Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools that had a suction cup on the end that kept falling off , that the 30 day warranty was up on . I used a bit longer screw since the other one flew into the unknown when it broke and to try to get a better connection . I also used super glue with the longer screw and it broke again 3 days later . I would NOT reccomend this Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool . There are better Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools out there to purchase . The Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool seems to always break after the 30 day warranty has expired . Amazon.com has much better grabbers for sale .
 The grabber only lasted a couple of weeks . I only used it for papers or other small objects on the floor . For heavier things I use my lawn dust pan with a handle on it . First the rubber tip fell off . Then a few days later I picked it up and the screw had fallen off . This is the second one I have bought . Next time I will buy another brand.It seems like the screws strip and the rubber tip and the screw falls out .
 My first gopher lost a suction cup while getting a sack of sugar of a grocery store shelf . I have not been able to find replacement suction cups anywhere . Apparently it will not handle five pound loads as advertised.My second gopher -LRB- needed after the first lost an irreplacable suction cup -RRB- lost both suction cups while trying to pick up a wrench from a rough concrete floor.I will not buy another gopher until Ontel provides replacement suction cups -LRB- preferably free since I 've bought two of them and they both failed in the same manner -RRB- . It seems Ontel 's opinion is what do you expect for ten bucks . I expect it to work as advertised and last more than six months . I can not afford a new one every six months so will try to find a competitor who will stand behind his product .
 I have bought 2 `` Gophers '' . Both broke down after 3-4 uses . The two `` sucker caps '' at the ends of the grip come off making the tool useless . It is non-repairable . Do n't waste your money .
 I ACTUALLY LOVED THIS WHEN I FIRST GOT IT . THE LOCKING FEATURE WAS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE.I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS , AT THE END OF FEB. . IT FELL APART . THE SUCTION CUPS FELL OF AND THE SCREWS WENT FLYING - COULD N'T FIND THEM . I TRIED SUPER GLUING THE PCS BACK TOGETHER - NO HELP . I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE IN MAY OF THIS YEAR AT WALGREENS AND A MONTH LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THAT ONE . THEY NEED TO BE MADE STRONGER !!!!!!! PLEASE REDESIGN AND TRY AGAIN.THANKS , VIRGINIA SALTER
 Got this for my parents . Plan to return it . It looks flimsy . Could not fold w/out probably breaking it . Had to use two hands to old tight enough to get small box from the upper shelf of pantry . A neighbor of my parents had similar tool they were raving about , but it obviously was NOT this one ! Not impressed .
 Item was shipped broken ... would not recommend . But Amazon 's return policy was quick and painless .
 I bought this as a gift for Christmas , and I 'm almost embarassed to give it . I do n't know how it can be called deluxe , when it 's just thin pieces of aluminum that look like they will bend with use . Of course I ca n't try it out to see if it works , because it 's a gift . And it 's advertised as a 2-pack , buy one & get one free . Well , I only received one . I do hope it works ...
 Hard to keep handle locked . Grasper mechanism Breaks very easily - suction cups break off . Seems like a good idea but insufficiently robust execution , Solid grabbers with magnets at end and with the operational tool made from a hinged hook attached to pull cord would be a better choice , e.g. Duromed aluminum reacher with magnetic tip
 Great idea , poorly executed . Works just for a bit and I do mean just a bit . Suction cups loosen , break off and THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE HAD !!! REPEAT THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE HAD ! CAVEAT EMPTOR ! My one star rating was a gift . If zero stars were available I would have rate it that .
 I 've had two of these and will not buy another . I bought them at a store near me.The first one lasted a couple of years so I bought another.The suction cups did ' t stay on either one and I had to constantly screw or glue them back on.Then one day while decorating for Xmas one cup came off of the last one and I still ca n't find it to this day which renders the tool unusable.I only had the last one two or three months.A cheap price for cheap tool . In this instance I did get what I paid for.Won ' t buy this again .
 Since I have to be careful bending and stooping I was happy to purchase the Gopher to help me . However , after back surgery I was using this tool often and the rubber tips came off . I tried using a bigger screw but it did n't work and then I glued it but that only helped a few days . I am very disappointed and wo n't waste my money on this company 's products anymore !
 Got two of these . In neither case do the jaws open more than an inch , and there is no grasping power . Folding would be convenient , if it only worked .
 Needed a grabber after hip surgery in order to reach items on high shelves . I loved it while it worked , all of a week . The screw holding the suction cups broke off rendering them irreparable . Flimsy !
 When I saw the tv ads for the Gopher I knew it was just what I needed and my husband ordered the deluxe set for me . I used them constantly to reach and grab things as I have a herniated disk in my lower back and am not supposed to bend over or reach above my head . I gave one to my grandfather and used the other one until the cable snapped about a year later -LRB- the locking mechanism broke first -RRB- . Just like others have shared here , this product is not able to pick up 5 lbs . and the suction cups are always coming unscrewed . We replaced both -LRB- so I can have one upstairs and down -RRB- , only buying 1 Gopher . I recently accidentally stepped on the Gopher and broke one of the suction cups and am disappointed there is no replacement part available . I will try gluing it back on as I do n't feel like investing in another one at this time or buying another EZ Reacher by Arcoa -LRB- at $ 20 -RRB- since they are not as convenient . I bought the EZ Reacher from the local hardware store when I could n't find any Gophers and I liked it 's heavy-duty capability . The suction cups are bolted on and there is no inner cable that can break . However , it does not have a locking mechanism and ca n't be folded . Finally , it would be nice for such a useful tool as the Gopher -LRB- or any of its counterparts -RRB- to be better designed and more reliable , but I guess that 's asking too much of a `` bargain '' tool .
 IT SAID I WAS BUYING DELUXE GOPHER , WHAT I GOT WAS A CHEAP NO NAME IMITATION WHICH WAS NO WAY AS STURDY AND STRONG AS THE REAL DELUXE GOPHER PICKUP TOOL . . I WENT TO AMAZON BECAUSE I TRUSTED YOUR SELLERS I LEARNED MY LESSON .
 I had back surgery recently and I felt this was a must . For the next 6 months I can not bend or twist so the JUNKPHER was going to be my helper . In 8 weeks I have gone through 3 of them for $ 20 a pop . The plastic is cheap and breaks easily ! The screws come out of the suction cup on the ends , have they not heard of lock tight . Either way if you have a choice DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL REGRET IT !!!!!!!
 After a few days of heavy use one of the suction cups on the end fell off . I screwed it back on but it fell off again a few hours later . The plastic hole that the screw fit into was cracked -LRB- it is not a metal nut and bolt , it is just a metal screw into plastic -RRB- and not usable anymore.These things are very cheaply made . I was talking to my mother and she said exactly the same thing happened to her.You will be tempted to buy these things because they are really cheap . But if you are stuck at home , unable to bend over or reach for things , and if this is your only reacher -- and it suddenly stops working -- then you are really , really stuck . -LRB- I am recovering from hip surgery . Fortunately I have some other reachers . -LRB- Another one I have is called EZ-Grabber -- it is almost as cheaply made as the Gopher but it uses metal nuts and bolts . -RRB-
 The gopher grabber is extremely useful to my ailing back . My only complaint is that they do n't hold up AT ALL . I have been through 4 in the past 9 months and that is under normal household use . It 's not like I even used them everyday . The same thing happened with all of them . One of the suction cups came off , the screw went flying , and the inside hole was stripped out , leaving me with a useless piece of junk .
 the constuction is very poorthe pickup pads both fell off after several weeks
 The seller gave me a refund on the broken item . I decided not to order another one .
 When I ordered this product , it was said to be 24pcs in the order . When only 1pc was delivered for the price , I was really upset . Guess that you have to lie in order to sell your product . Geeze !
 I recently purchased Surf after seeing it in a store for the first time in years . I thought it had been discontinued but was surprised to see it at a national chain retailer for only $ 12 for a 120 load box . I figured you ca n't beat the price so I bought it and I 'm really sorry I wasted my money . The first thing that hit me when I opened the box was the sickeningly strong fragrance . The scent is called Spring Burst but it smells more like overly perfumed detergent . If you have any sensitivity to fragrance , STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT !!! Not only was the smell unbearable but the detergent does not get out stains . Not even new stains . Apparently this product has a large fan base in the UK and Australia but do n't ask me why . Sometimes the saying `` You get what you pay for '' is true , and Surf is no exception .
 I was n't happy with this product at all . The package claimed that they were more absorbent than other brands but this brand leaked on one of my lighter flow days , which I 've never had happen before . I was also very uncomfortable with the fact that there was no applicator . It just does n't seem sanitary to me and I could never get them positioned correctly . Based on my experience , I would n't recommend this product to my family or friends and I 'm sticking with my regular brand .
 The tampons were too big and not pretty . Also , I prefer tampons with an applicator of some sort . I think if you were going to buy this brand of tampons , it 'd be the same as buying a bag of cotton to insert . This is a really bad product .
 I can not rate this product BECAUSE I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT.Have not been able to find a venue to report this !!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON BECAUSE YOU ARE UNABLE TO CONTACT THEM AFTER THE PURCHASE ...
 This product smells bad , is very runny , and does n't work ! I have very sensitive skin and this product did not keep my irritation down whatsoever . I highly DO NOT recommend this product .
 I wanted a proxabrush holder that was strong and would last a long time , like my last one did . It was still working great after years of use -- I just wanted a newer one . The Butler Gum Proxabrush Handle is really flimsy and has a poor design . It does n't even close tightly to hold the proxabrush in place , so I have to hold the closure while I 'm using it . It 's so flimsy , I think it will be bent out of shape before long . I did wonder why they sent six , since all you need is one good handle -- now I know . It is hard to find a good handle but it 's worth looking around more . I do n't recommend this one .
 I have used this product for several years and loved it prior to their `` New Formulation '' . It previously had a pleasant , slightly sweet , natural vanilla flavor - I drank it in water and actually enjoyed the flavor . Now the flavor is a nauseating artificial caramel flavor - even though it still says natural vanilla flavor . I ca n't really taste any vanilla at all and it is sickeningly sweet . The old formula also dissolved quickly and perfectly , now it dissolves into stringy lumps . And probably the biggest disappointment - they have added soy . I have a soy intolerance - which causes abdominal pain and nausea -LRB- originally diagnosed as IBS -RRB- . I did not think to read the ingredient label since I have been using the product for so many years , but when the abdominal pain returned , I started reviewing everything I was consuming and found the newly added soy . I am so disappointed to lose a long loved product . And now I am stuck with two very expensive 32 oz cans . I do n't understand why you fix something that is not broken . Solgar needs to realize that people who take this product are generally healthy people who are not hooked on cheap sugary artificial products . So , be aware that the majority of the high ratings are from before the `` New Formulation '' . Now the search begins for another protein powder that is soy free .
 I am incredibly disappointed in Solgar and they have lost my business all together for their poor decision to add soy to this WHEY protein . I started buying Whey to Go 7.5 years ago after my previous whey protein started adding soy without any warning . That addition caused me to have a major reaction and land in the ER because I am highly allergic to soy . It 's nearly impossible to find a good protein powder without soy . So , I found Whey to Go . I have been drinking at least three servings a day for nearly 8 years and have been dependent on this product to be one of my few options without soy . For many of us , soy is deadly and we NEED whey protein as a safe alternative . I ca n't believe Solgar started adding soy to this protein ! It makes no sense . I could n't find my usual 32 oz container in the stores for a while , then noticed that the smaller container said `` new and improved . '' That is never a good sign , so I read the ingredients . Sure enough , there was soy . I checked the Solgar site and ALL of their whey proteins now have soy . If I wanted a soy protein , I 'd buy a soy protein . But no , I want a pure WHEY protein , and Whey to Go is no longer safe for me.I am currently pregnant , so protein is more important than ever . I 'm bummed that I have to go searching and experimenting with new proteins to find a product that wo n't kill me . What a terrible move to put soy in your whey protein Solgar ! I was spending nearly $ 100 a month on this stuff , but never again will I support Solgar .
 i have used this protein powder in the past because it was made from whey not soy . now soy is listed as well which , if not organic , is almost definitely genetically engineered-a cheap protein source . whey to go is not cheap and solgar should get rid of the GE soy and use only whey . in addition fructose is the second ingredient . i am now looking for a quality whey protein powder with less sugar .
 I bought this because of glowing reviews and supposedly the lack of bad chemicals . Everyone kept touting the flavor so imagine my surprise when i had to gag to get it down . This stuff is foul plain and simple . The chocolate is slightly more palatable but not by much . I finally mixed i with another powder brand to cover up the gross taste . Its simply not palatable . Disgusting to say the least ! I have a tin staring at me i fear ...
 Why is there Soy and Fructose in this ? Soy is much less expensive than whey isolate or the like . I was about to purchase this and noticed some of the other reviews . I noticed this product due to the Consumer Reports article . I guess I will be going back to ON whey , but this time the platinum I suppose . Was looking for the safest alternative but also dont want to spend extra money on inexpensive soy product . I read the ingredients list and it says '' + + contains whey and soy '' on the `` whey '' ingredient . Ok , its one ingredient , how can a single item on an ingredient list be two things ? List it seperately so we know what amount is in there . Solgar please respond .

 I love Solgar products , but this just tastes chemical-ly and bad . I usually like vanilla too , but this one is terrible . I tried mixing it with so many things , but it did n't help . The chocolate is much much better
 This stuff is awful ! I read most of the reviews beforehand and when I opened the canister -LRB- I have the vanilla flavor -RRB- , it smells wonderful . I 'd almost equate the smell to vanilla bean ice cream . But I 've mixed it with water and milk and it always tastes SOUR . It 's disgusting and impossible to choke down and now I ca n't return it as it has already been opened . Do n't buy !

 I was very disappointed because Gaia Herbs claims that the product is designed to support healthy thyroid functioning . But they fail to mention that it 's only for those who have hypothyroidism . Since I have hyperthyroidism I experienced a very bad case of diarrhea , heart palpitations and anxiety attacks . It took me over a week to realize that all these symptoms were related to the supplement .
 I started taking this product in the middle of August 2011 . At the first time that I took 1 capsule , I got really sick . My body started to get chilled , and I noticed that I was feeling dizzy and nauseac . I spent a day in a bed . I deceided that I would n't take it unless my symptons were very bad with my hypothyroid . Strangely enough , one day in early September , I was very chilled and depressed when I woke up . I had a feeling that this herb maght be a help to recover from the condition . I took one capsule . Then , I started to feel that my body temperature was getting higher although I usually have low temperature . 60 % of my depression had gone after taking one capsule . After that , I took one or two in the morning every 2-3 days . Sometimes , I feel much more ill , and sometimes , I feel better - but never like when I was healthy before I had hypothyroid . I called Gaia for advice . I was told that this herb would n't work for me since I was Japanese born . According to her , Japanese already take a lot of seaweeds . I left Japan 26 years ago , and seldom have Japanese food . I can not take this herb everyday in taking a risk of getting worse with my condition . It makes me sick in some points while I feel better in different points . It is not wholly and consistantly working . I am wondering which ingredient -LRB- s -RRB- is/are causing me sick . I miss my period this month , although it may have nothing to do with this product . I will take the rest of the capsules and will write a full review again . It is impossible and scary for me to take this capsule every day . Currently my stomach is hurting . Without stomach hurt , maca and bee pollon are firmly and steadly working for me better .
 Purchased Thyroid Support first part of January . It did help with mood , hair fallout , etc. . However I developed acne followed by a severe case of acne rosacea , possibly due to side effects from ashwaganda and other herbs in the formula . I would love to keep taking it but am afraid to as it seems to have cost me a trip to a dermatologist at $ 175 plus a long future course of antibiotics . Any suggestions would be appreciated .
 I 've been taking this product for about 3 weeks and can honestly say that I do n't feel any difference . I 've been borderline hypothyroid for several years and my doctor told me to try one of the supplements on the market to see if they would help . I guess I 'll move on to the next one .
 I 'm disappointed with the items because the spray system not working in both bottles of deodorant.Simply can not use them and waste my money.Not recommended for anyone !!!!!
 This was a total waste of money ! Smells NOTHING like the fleur d'eau I know and love . In fact it smells like absolutely nothIng ! I was so excited to find this online as it is no longer available in stores ... But boy have learned my lesson ! Jamais plus ! Am only giving it a 1 star rating coz you have to select something to submit a review . It really deserves naught !!!! This was the first time I was ever disappointed with an amazon purchase ! Dont do it !
 I never have trouble swallowing pillls , I usually swallow five at once but the shape and texture of these pills cause me to gag even when swallowing only one .
 I have n't tried it yet . Title & 15 more words required . Title & 15 more words required . Title & 15 more words required .
 This product was horrible . It made me so ILL. . I was irritable , stressed , anxious , nauseous and jittery on this product at this review for four solid hours . And when I wanted the feeling to end after taking it - it just kept going and going and going . BEWARE of using this on a work night . I 'm serious . I 've never said `` Oh God , please help me ! '' this many times , in utter dismay , in my life ! I am returning my unused product to the store . Celsius Drink is not for everyone and your physician should be consulted before taking something that so significantly alters your body chemistry for such extended periods of time . I will never do this to myself again . Scary stuff . Be afraid and drink at your own peril .
 this stuff is supposed to help you lose weight . If vomiting is what they hope you 'll do to lose the weight , then the taste of this stuff might just do the trick . If you buy this , I would recommend mixing it with about 25 parts of orange juice to 1 part celsius and hold nose while drinking .
 This item is false . It says in the title that it is COMPACT HEAD , so I ordered 10 , as compact head toothbrushes are hard to find . Shipping is very expensive . When I received the toothbrushes , they were NOT compact head , instead they are standard head . I can not use these toothbrushes . Because this is a MARKETPLACE seller , I have to pay the return shipping if I return them , making these the most expensive toothbrushes ever . American RX is a very unreliable company . I would avoid doing business with them . A deceitful Amazon page
 I did n't really like this toothbrush . I usually get a medium toothbrush in my usual brand , but medium was much too harsh in the Oral-B . I also thought the angle made it awkward to use . I would n't recommend this toothbrush in medium , but maybe the soft bristles would be better .
 I 'd recommend this product only to people who have dental appliances . It 's NOT a good floss for regular teeth . It has a thick part for flossing around things like braces and bridges , and a thin part that 's SUPPOSED to be like normal floss . It is n't . It 's too thick and not waxed enough , so it does n't easily glide between teeth . But again , for people with dental appliances , it probably works really well .
 The Oral-B super floss was impossible to insert between some of my bridges . Apparently the spacing between my teeth is too narrow . Now I am using the Crest Glide Threader Floss which works great . Just hope I can continue to buy the Threader Floss from Crest .
 Flossing is hard , and unfortunately , this product does n't make it any easier . First , the floss sections are too short . After wrapping each end around two fingers on each hand I had only about eight inches left . Second , it broke pretty easily . I needed to use three or four to get through all my teeth . Last , the wider section is a good idea , but when you pull on both ends of the floss -LRB- which you have to do to get it through your teeth -RRB- it disappears !
 this was a not a good buy ... i thought i was probably buying two cases and instead got two packages with two refills in each . the two cost over $ 65 . . a big ripoff . i will go to ebay next time ...
 I decided to take up yoga and really knew nothing about what I needed , except that I needed a mat . I bought this after looking at a few other offerings . I 've used it for about 3 months now and this is my review.When I first took the mat to class I found it to be a little slippery . My instructor said that this is common with new mats and suggested I soak it in a soapy water filled bathtub overnight . She said that they sometimes have a coating on them from the manufacturing process . I actually put it in my side loading clothes washer and used the `` hand wash '' cycle . -LRB- do n't try this in a top loader , it will probably destroy the mat -RRB- . The washer did the trick and the slipperiness went away . The mat is thin , but not thinner than most others I see in class . When we do poses that require us to put pressure on the knees , sometime I put a towel under my knee . The matt itself does n't provide a lot cushion . However , I read that thicker mats can make it more difficult to balance on , for example when you are doing one-legged poses.The blocks are very light and work well . If you are just starting out in yoga , and not very flexible , you really want to have blocks . Invest in a set if you do not buy a `` kit '' like this . They allow you to do some poses that you might not be able to do otherwise.I have n't used the strap yet , but I 'm not sure how much you can say about a simple strap . I 'm sure it works.The case -LRB- bag -RRB- can hold the mat and both blocks . However the material is very thin . After a couple of weeks , the stitching started to separate on mine . I need to either re-sew it before it completely comes apart or buy a sturdier one.Overall , other than the problems with the case , I 'm satisfied with my purchase . It has everything you need to start out in yoga , at a very reasonable price.UPDATE - When my bag stitching started to rip I thought that I had must received a poorly made one . However , my daughter bought the same set , and the stitching on her bag is starting to come apart as well , after a couple of weeks of use . While I still think the mat and blocks are OK , the bag , in my opinion , is poorly made . I have change my rating from 4 stars to 2 based on the issues we had with the bag .
 I bought this Valeo Yoga Kit almost two years ago . At the time I purchased it , it was significantly cheaper price than it is now . That still did n't make it a good deal , however.Where to start ? The mat of course comes with a slippery Chinese manufacturing goo that smells terrible and has to be washed off . I 'm betting this residue is toxic , and exactly the opposite of what you want from yoga . The manufacturer should consider the use of the product when making this stuff . Anyway , even after washing the mat by hand , it continued to smell like a combination of cat urine and acrid sweat for the remainder of its life.The next problem with the mat is that it 's of terrible quality . It 's ridiculously thin and , compared to other mats of similar construction , not durable at all . This mat is basically the lowest density neoprene available , and it tears or shears anytime something rubs against it . Even my perfectly-trimmed toenails gouge chunks out of this mat in Downward Dog . Sliding a hand across it causes abrasion . It 's cheap junk , and if you 're on a hard floor , this mat will not be enough padding at all.Lastly , the mat carrying bag is made to last perhaps a week , if that . It 's a bag in name only , if you can call some pieces of fabric stitched together a `` bag . `` Anyway , buy theYogaAccessories 1/4 '' Extra Thick Deluxe Yoga Matand get some blocks on the side . Together they 're cheaper , and you can figure out some way to carry the stuff around that 's going to last longer than the junk bag in this Valeo Yoga Kit .
 After the 4th time using the mat it started to fall apart . Very disappointed . However , the blocks are still in great shape . Would get something different .
 I guess if you buy a product that is ` all in one ' you pay the price by lacking quality within the package .
 Update 1/18/12
 I bought this kit to do yoga at home , since I 've been with an instructor for a while . I wanted something with blocks and strap for modifications , plus a mat to keep at home . This kit looked like everything I wanted in one go.The blocks are nice , great size and texture , the strap is basic but nice , heavy duty . The only problem is the mat itself.The mat is smelly , which will probably wear off with use , and it 's a bit narrow . But the worst part is that it 's not sticky . It 's SLIPPERY . Imagine my surprise when I moved into downward-dog pose and almost fell flat on my face because I could n't get my hands or feet to stop slipping !! I ended up throwing the mat to the side and finishing my practice without it.Now I have to run to the store and buy a $ 15 Gaiam mat . I would never recommend this brand of mat . Stick to Gaiam .
 I discovered after receiving this item that the sticky mat is made of 90 % PVC -LRB- polyvinyl chloride -RRB- by contacting Valeo re the product . PVC is dangerous to our health and environment from start to finish - in the factory , at home , and in the trash - releasing poisonous chemicals linked to cancer and birth defects . -LRB- I should have checked this prior to purchasing it , that was my error . -RRB- My hope is to make other shoppers aware that there are numerous healthy and eco friendly alternatives out there . -LRB- Gaiam , Enviromat , Prana , & so many more . -RRB- If you are doing yoga for your health and well being than it only makes sense that you are doing it on a material that supports that goal -LRB- as well as honoring our planet - PVC is so incongruent with the practice of yoga -RRB- . Perhaps Valeo will phase it out if enough consumers let them know why they did n't choose their product .
 I bought this kit thinking it was a good deal , but that turned out to not be the case . The mat after just a few weeks of use is no longer sticky and it came with a few nicks in it . I fixed the nicks with tape and I thought oh that 's not so bad , but then I slid down the mat doing downward dog and hurt my shoulder , ouch ! I would say buy everything separate and save yourself the pain . The blocks and the strap are good just not the mat . My old mat I had for 10 years before it finally lost it 's stickiness . It cost me $ 20 . What a deal .
 At first , I was very excited to receive this kit but then , the smell just didnt go away ! I asked my neighbor about it and he said that the outgassing of the plastic materials was what was causing the smell ; and that it probably wasnt health to breathe . I ended up throwing it out .
 I used the carrying case with the blocks and mat . However , if the case gets wet -LRB- when it is raining -RRB- it stains the mat . I have not be able to remove the stain with soap , oxyclean or grease remover.Valeo Yoga Kit
 I only received the mat , and none of the other `` kit '' materials . The mat is a little bulkier than other yoga mats as well . I do not feel like packing it up and returning it , but I am so irritated that I did n't receive the blocks or anything else . Buyer beware !!!!
 I got this mat to practice prenatal yoga at home , it was fine for that purpose for the months I used it while I was pregnant . Recently I started using the mat again for a power yoga class at my gym , it didnt take long for me to realize how terrible this mat really is . On my carpet at home I didnt notice how thin the mat is but on the hard gym floor it barely feels like there is anything under me . Apparently the sticky wore off during my prenatal practice because now my hands slip so badly downward dog is impossible to hold for more then a few seconds . I had to stop using the mat because it is completely ineffective and could actually cause harm because I slip so badly on it . It was fine for about 4 months at home , the block and strap are fine , the bag is pretty ugly , but it works for storage . I would never recommend this item .
 Strong chemical smell from the mat causes my nose to run . I hope that wears off , or I can wash it away , otherwise it the mat will be useless . The bag is quite thin and will likely wear out quickly , the blocks and belt appear to be very durable and may be worth the money for the whole kit.Time will tell
 This mat does stick well to the floor but also sticks well to your body , especially when you are sweaty which you will be during yoga . So that is very very annoying . Also at certain location where there is deep impact/contact with the foot especially , during the downward/upward dog positions , the mat tends to crack and the material starts peeling off creating potholes in the mat ! For its price its ok but not the best product.The blocks are good . I have not yet felt the need for the strap so can not comment on that .
 I was disappointed with the mat quality . I used it on a wooden floor in my living room and the mat seemed to slip a little and the thickness of the mat just wasnt there . I used the mat for diff purposes apart from Yoga -LRB- like Push ups -RRB- and one cant rest ones palms on the mat for long -LRB- especially once they are a little sweaty in the middle of the workout -RRB- as the mat doest provide a very good grip.Okayish for its price , I would recommend you put in $ 10-15 more and research for a better product .
 Mat is too slippery to do anything on . I ca n't even hold a semi decent downward facing dog on it . Only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because the blocks , belt and case are usable . Spend a little more for a better mat .
 I 've been using this toothpaste for about 5 years now . I began to use it because Consumer Reports said that it was actually the one whitening toothpaste that worked . In that case , I guess I should give it a higher rating , although I 'm not sure my teeth are any whiter . With whitening pastes there is a price to pay in that they tend to be abrasive and wear down the enamal , and I believe that is my problem . I am now making the connection that since using this product , I have been to dentists -LRB- general , endontists and periodontists -RRB- more times than I can remember for broken teeth , root canals , root extracts and crown restorations . I have spent a fortune ! I am going to stop using this product immediately and switch to something that is better for enamel strengthening .
 I used the paste day and night and it did nothing . I do n't drink coffee or smoke cigarettes neither do I eat foods that stain your teeth . This is probably only food people that have teeth-staining habits such as the above . I just did n't see a different after about 2 weeks of use . If you want a whitening paste , try a better quality brand .
 My biggest complaint about was that the flavor was awful . It was almost like a rotten cherry-mint flavor . I just about choked the first time I used it . After repeated use , the flavor became more tolerable -- however , another flavor would be a plus . I did n't notice any whitening effect . But to be fair , more than a week 's use is probably required . Other than the above comments , this was average toothpaste .
 Both my son and I LOVE the paste . It whitens and brightens beautifully , and he is a smoker . The Gel however did not work at all . Now that we know this we are searching for the Paste and can not locate it , not even on line . PLEASE someone sell the PASTE !
 The first time I brushed my teeth with Colgate with Baking Soda & Peroxide I did n't care for it - especially the taste . However , with each use , I changed my mind . I kept thinking of the benefits from the added baking soda and peroxide , which should help with fresh breath and whitening of the teeth . While it is n't my favorite toothpaste , I 'd recommend it to my family and friends .
 I used this tooth paste and though I usually think that Colgate makse some of the better tasting toothpastes I do n't like the taste of this baking soda whitening variety and I think the taste is too bland and tastes like mint gum after you have chewed on it for several minutes and it has lost it 's flavor and while I like other Colgate tooth paste varities I wo n't be using this particular one again and I would n't recommend it to anyone unless they happen to actually like the flavor of gum when it 's lost it 's flavor !
 I had been anxious to try a '' `` whitening '' '' toothpaste , and had high hopes . However , I did n't feel this product lived up to my expectations . While my teeth felt clean , I did n't experience any noticeable difference in their coloring . This product also did n't leave my mouth as '' `` fresh '' '' as other Aquafresh products that I 've used in the past . In fact , my husband even commented that it seemed almost '' `` salty . '' '' I did see a commercial that said they 've come out with a new '' `` fresher '' '' version . I would probably not purchase this product again .
 This is the worst toothpaste I have ever used in my life , my teeth look worse than they ever have and I 'm not doing anything different except using this product . Do n't get your hopes up if you buy this , regular toothpaste keeps your teeth whiter than this stuff does ! I figured the word ` ultimate ' would at least ensure that it helped or at least kept my teeth the same . I 'm almost done with this tube and I 'm going back to my trusty Crest .
 Aquafresh toothpaste features fluoride . I heard that fluoride is the main ingredient in fighting cavities , and that it hardens the outer enamel of teeth , which makes them less susceptible to decay .
 this has the smallest seat cut out ever ! if you are a male its impossible to sit down and go number 1 you will end up going on the floor . its nice and sturdy and came already assembled and you can adjust the legs to fit over your toilet but like i said it only works for women or going number 2 . i like that it came pre assembled but we end up not using it because my dad couldnt use it .
 I was testing with them from 9dpo and on well at 12 dpo I took an answer test to get my bfp because these just kept coming up negative so I thought ... just turns out the line is so faint you need a flash light to see it . The line was even very faint three days after my period still needed flash light to see it.It is very frustrating that the line is so faint and looks negative even when you are pregnant . Would not recommend to ttc experts and poas addicts .
 Do n't buy anything branded Telemergency ! I bought a telemergency 700 for my mother , who is nearly 80 years old . Seems well made , appears to function correctly , although the owner 's manual could be improved a LOT.The problem is , NO RESPONSE to my concerns . My mother damaged the pendant with water . It no longer functions . There is no information about ordering a replacement pendant on their web site . I emailed them THREE times and never even got so much as a form letter response . Not a thing!Absolutely zero customer support . Not even a rude , `` ca n't help you ''
 I have used Spray N Wash in the aerosol can since , I believe , the sixties . I could depend on it to remove any and most all stains . In recent years I could get it at Wal-Mart only . Now it is gone and has been replaced -LRB- ? -RRB- by a pump spray w / resolve . The liquid spray is not nearly as good ... is this a part of going green ? I know this wo n't do any good , but I feel better venting my opinion . There is nothing like Spray N Wash in the aerosol can.Not a Happy Camper ... Joanne
 This stuff destroyed my comforter . I was trying to remove pale yellow stains from a cat barfing on my comforter . Instead of removing stains , this product left large dark green stains on every spot I sprayed it on my comforter . Yes , I followed the directions exactly . I called the 800 number on the bottle and was offered a refund on the product but nothing for the ruined comforter . Wish I could rate this product lower .
 I bought this to my Son but it was a disappointment , when you heat it as instruction it get wet , small was bad and the heat did n't hold too long .
 I receieved the Valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym , after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous . I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems . I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull-up , and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in . My advice , this product is poorly made and cheap . A complete waste of money . Go with something better , and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric .
 Maybe my wrists are small -LRB- ~ 6 1/2 '' around -RRB- , but the positioning of the padding on these straps prevents them from properly tightening around my wrist , so I ca n't really use them properly or comfortably . Do n't bother buying these unless your wrists are at least an inch larger around than mine .
 These straps are cotton so they stretch during a heavy lift and transfer a lot of the weight back to your hands . It 's difficult to get a good grip on heavy weight because of this . Also , the pad is too long so the strap ca n't be properly tightened around the bar because the loop hits on the pad . I would suggest non-cotton straps with a better pad design -LRB- e.g. the Harbinger nylon straps -RRB- for advanced lifting .
 I switched to this product because of good reviews , i was hoping it would be the answer to my dreams , namely a Gel which feels good on the skin , smells good and works great when shaving , unfortunately i have found this product less than ideal for my sensitive skin type , it makes my skin itch after using it , it also does not give the close shave i was hoping for , therefore i would advise people to check carefully before they buy , if their skin is sensitive they might wish to consider another product .
 I did not like the taste of the shells and cheese . Way too salty and just did n't taste quite right . Very disappointing .
 This item has hidden MSG , an excitotoxin that kills brain cells . It is hidden in the calcium caseinate . Do your homework ... the information is out there .
 Everyone has different tastes so you may like this but I hated it . The taste was very processed and bitter .
 #I am disappointed that anyone would ever even consider buying this product after reading a little about it . If you are sure you 're going to buy it and you just want more confirmation that you should , then you are a true believer in this sort of scam product and you need not , and probably should not , read further.But if you are looking for a factual , reasoned review of Gaia Herbs Quick Defense so you can make a rational decision whether to buy it and use it , then do keep reading . -LRB- I can tell from the nature of the several Amazon ratings and reviews of Gaia Herbs Quick Defense so far that I will probably not get many positive ratings of this very review , but I have to tell the truth . And unlike many of my previous reviews , in this one I will not exaggerate or make stuff up or try to be entertaining . -RRB- This product claims it '' -LSB- m -RSB- aintains a healthy inflammatory response '' and that it can `` rapidly support the body 's response to immune stressors '' and that it can `` initiate a healthy inflammatory and immune response when the body is challenged '' and that it is an '' -LSB- e -RSB- ffective synergistic formula . '' All of those claims are so vague as to be meaningless . They are , when challenged , entirely devoid of any assertion of fact that can be tested . Unless the manufacturer can point to properly designed experiments in which legitimate scientists have conducted double-blind studies that prove this product is especially effective at `` maintaining a healthy inflammatory response '' or any of the other nebulous claims it makes , this product 's effectiveness relies on the placebo effect , cherry-picking results , success bias , almost completely useless anecdotes , and other logical problems . In short , it relies on true believers , people who eschew real evidence and prefer to believe believe believe that this product and all the thousands of similar scam products over the year really do what they claim , whatever that is . This is snake oil in a capsule . Well , 20 capsules!Speaking of which , the members of Gaia Herb 's `` Scientific Advisory Board '' are all said to Doctors of Naturopathy , and they even have the designation N.D. after their names and call themselves `` doctor , '' and they take money for diagnosing and treating people -- people who might really have a disease that real doctors could treat -- using ludicrous beliefs that flatly contradict science . Oh , except one member of Gaia 's Scientific Advisory Board , who just happens to be the `` CEO/President/Founder '' of Gaia Herbs , Inc. of Brevard , North Carolina , named Richard Scalzo , who has only an honorary doctorate in naturopathy . That 's like having a fake decoder ring from the bottom of a cereal box , except that at least along with the fake decoder ring you get some cereal.You do n't have to take my word for it that this product is worthless . The manufacturer is required by law to tell you that the following statements they make `` have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration '' : -- `` Rapid immune response at onset * '' -- `` Quick Defense supports the body 's rapid response to immune stressors . Made with certified organic Echinacea , Black Elderberry , and Ginger extracts , plus wild-harvested Andrographis , Quick Defense is highly effective when taken at onset . It has a high concentration of Echinacea Alkylamides - the constituents most effective at initiating an immune response . * '' -- `` Normalizes the immune response * '' -- `` Support for respiratory defenses * '' * The asterisks all refer to the very statement that the very statements are untested and unreliable.As I say , it is impossible to test whether the product really does maintain a healthy inflammatory response or support respiratory defenses , because no one knows what those terms mean . The claims the manufacturer makes have not been evaluated by the FDA because there 's nothing there for the FDA to test . The claims are just borderless air , just blurry buzz words to lure the true believers in.Here 's another reason you do n't have to take my word for it that this product is worthless . The manufacturer itself says so . Gaia Herbs of Brevard , North Carolina , makes this explicit statement with regard to Gaia Herbs Quick Defense : THIS PRODUCT IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE , TREAT , CURE , OR PREVENT ANY DISEASE.Now , understand that Gaia Herbs of Brevard , North Carolina , wishes it did n't have to admit to that in capital letters . But they do , by law . They are required to tell you , the potential purchaser of this product , that IT DOES NOT WORK . Let 's examine the first and third of those four first.It 's perfectly fine that the product does not DIAGNOSE , because no one expects it to , not even the true believers . And it 's OK that the product does not CURE , as in getting antibiotics for gonorrhea , because I will charitably assume Gaia Herbs never made such a claim.But that leaves the second and fourth reasons the manufacturer admits the product does n't work , and they are exactly what these capsules -LRB- seem to -RRB- claim.The manufacturer specifically states that the product does not TREAT or PREVENT ANY DISEASE , which would include colds and the flu at one end and ALS and lung cancer at the other.Read that again . The very maker of the product under review specifically states that it does not TREAT or PREVENT ANY DISEASE . If you take the product at the `` onset '' as they recommend , it will not treat ANY disease . Not only that , it will not PREVENT any disease.But wait , there 's more . It gets worse for the true believers , the ones who do n't want to consider even the most obvious , in-your-face evidence , which is a written admission of failure by the very maker of the product . Not only does Gaia Herbs , Inc. have to admit their product does n't do anything medically useful , they have to admit they NEVER INTENDED IT TO . Read that again , in case you 're considering the possibility you 're a true believer who should n't be.Gaia Herbs of Brevard , North Carolina , specifically and in no uncertain terms confesses that this product was never even MEANT to treat or prevent disease of any kind.You are now allowed to wonder what they DID intend it for , what effect it is supposed to have , why it exists . The answer to all three is simple
 As luck would have it , the day I got this bottle of Quite Defense , I was starting Day 1 of the flu . I took it as directed , but I did n't get better any quicker than I normally do .
 You ca n't help but be impressed by Quick Defense . There 's a unique code on each box that you can punch in on Gaia 's website that gives you detailed information on every single ingredient , down to the names of the technicians who ran the tests for heavy metal contamination . The future of herbal supplements is here!The only thing that would impress me more would be if Quick Defense actually worked . The scientific evidence that any of the ingredients does anything whatsoever is spotty at best , so Gaia tries to make up for in quantity what these herbs lack in efficacy
 One dose = one bottle . 5x2 pills for two days . With the caveat on the label
 Every time I get a cold , the first thing that relatives tell me is to take echinacea -LRB- and/or zinc -RRB- to prevent its onset . I have tried zinc , which in the end proved to give me severe migranes and make me sicker than the cold itself.But , I 'm always willing to give natural cures a second try . I thought this was the perfect opportunity to try out the Gaia Herbs 20-capsule Quick Defense that I received recently.The Gaia Quick Defense has Echinacea , Ginger Root and Elderberry . Supposedly , echinacea is supposed to be good at boosting the immune system , especially when fighting colds.But it did n't work for me . Unfortunately , when I took this at the onset of a cold , it did not stop my cold from developing . In fact , I ended up losing my voice for a few days.Sadly , my search for a better , more natural way to cure a cold continues . Until then , I 'll stick with my Dayquil and Nyquil .
 I was starting to get a runny nose and started taking this as directed . It did not seem to make a difference , and I was sick for about a week . I do not normally take anything other than a multivitamin , so I do n't know if that makes a difference . Everyone reacts differently , and I do n't know if I had a virus -LRB- I want to be fair to the product -RRB- . It is fairly costly , as this is a one treatment box ! Also , there seem to be too many contraindications for my liking , and they recommend consulting your physician before taking . I would n't use this again , nor can I recommend it .
 I take airborne and lots a vitamin C when I get colds . Thought what the heck , why not give Gaia Herbs Quick Defense a shot . I did n't realize you take 2 pills 5x a day . Wow that was difficult . I have a hard enough time swallowing 1 pill one time a day . I tried it & have to say I did n't notice any difference . I did end up with a horrible cold . Lasted 2 weeks . I have to say though I started it on the night of the second day . Maybe that had something to do with it . Not sure , although probably wo n't try it again unless they come out with a better dosing instruction with less pills to take daily .
 I 'm not a fan of nutritional supplements that needlessly price gouge customers . Holistic companies like to criticize the medical community , in part , for their expensive drugs . Yet here 's another supplement company playing by the same game . There 's NO reason for these pills to be as expensive as they are . Particularly given the mediocre results . Companies like this prey on the fact that most anyone would willingly pay through the nose just to not get sick.I was saving these , hoping I would never need them . But my hubby and I were both coming down with a cold , and grabbed this bottle hoping to find some relief and avoid becoming full-blown sick . That 's when we noticed this bottle is only a 2 day supply for ONE person . So we went to the local vitamin store and picked up an additional bottle of 40 for a whopping 32.95 . -LRB- plus tax , over 36 -RRB- We did a 3 day cycle , 1 day over the recommended cycled of 2 days . And guess what -- these expensive supplements did n't do a darn thing to help . Not one iota . If anything , we felt worse for wasting an extra 36.00 for nothing.Bottom Line -- sure , the black capsules look chic and slick , but this is just a newfangled snake-oil . Do n't bother with these . I 'm going to look into Now Foods supplements to see if they have a more affordable alternative that actually works . Now Foods makes great supplements that are reasonably priced . But I 'll never waste money on these Gaia Herbs again , that 's for sure !
 This is not a product I would get again . One bottle is 20 pills and you need to take 2 pills five times a day . That is way too much pill taking for me . If I 'm getting sick , the last thing I want to do is think about taking pills that many times a day . And it only covers you for one time of being sick . I did test it when I felt a cold coming on and it did nothing to defend against it.They do a good job of detailing what is in the product though , I give them that .
 I took at the onset of flu and may have experienced slightly milder outcome ... who knows ? On the other hand , it certainly did n't hurt . I 'll try it again .
 I ordered this product and eagerly awaited the onset of sickness to see if it was effective . Normally , I do not get sick very often , so I thought it might be a while . Surprisingly , I felt the `` onset '' of sickness within a week or two of the product arriving . I normally take vitamin D3 to boost my immune system . I eat a healthy , mostly vegan -LRB- totally vegetarian -RRB- diet with very little refined carbs or processed food . I also tan to get more D3.Well , this product did not help me avoid getting sick . My ex-wife and daughter were ill and through exposure to them , I thought I might get ill . I normally am able to avoid their bugs or at least delay succumbing to them , and I normally recover much earlier . In this case , I took this product , and I did delay onset , but when I got it , I got it bad . I had bronchitis and I could n't shake the resulting cough for more than a month . Perhaps the product helped ; perhaps it did n't . But it definitely did not help me avoid sickness , and with just the one experience , I 'm forced to give it a negative review .
 I took these as directed , and after I finished my dosage , I noticed no change . I was really sick for a week , and could n't get rid of my cough for almost two . Which is usually a lot longer than it usually takes me . There 's a lot of hype over products like these for nothing , IMO .
 All it did is numb my tongue and it barely helped with my sore throat . I 'm seriously disappointed , this was recommended to me by a pharmacologist and I was expecting better result . Even drinking tea had better effect for cheaper.My throat feel a tiny bit better , which is why I do n't give this 1 star , but I still feel like wasting money .
 I bought these for a typical sore throat . No other symptoms , just one of those sore throats where it hurts so bad you are dreading your next swallow.I took one lozenge . The lozenge was very effective at numbing whatever portion of my mouth was sucking on it , but provided little relief where it hurt on my throat . I even tried to direct the saliva as I swallowed so the numbing stuff would coat my throat . This was a little more effective , but not by much.Although it did numb the back of my throat a bit , the relief did n't last very long at all . And my mouth now felt icky and gross and numb.I 'm sticking with oregano and cayenne , because while those may not take the pain away , they actually work !
 Smells great but this product is very small and uses up quickly . I do n't find it worth the $ 20 + shipping price tag .
 I am not going to say that I even like it a little bit . Although it has a somewhat tomato taste , I found the sauce to have a chalky fell to it and I was not even able to have 3 bites . I believe that there are better slim fast products available , that are much more palatable !
 Excellent value for the money but watch out if you have thick/fat legs at the knee . My leg measures 22 inches circumference just below the knee and I found these socks too painful to wear for more than a couple of hours . I suspect they would be just fine for someone whose below-the-knee measurement was 18-19 inches . Otherwise the socks are well made and quite comfortable . I ended up switching to Jobst socks -- pricy , but good for a big guy to wear all day !

 Item was very cheaply built . I returned it immediately and asked for a refund . That was nearly a month ago . Have not received a credit to my account .
 I 've owned a product like this for ever...20-30 years ... After all these years with all the new technology you would expect these people to put on a hi-intensity LED light to assist the viewing ... instead you have the same horrible week flashlight bulb that is all but useless ... in any well lite room ... People it 's 2010 ... put a light on this thing ... It 's not 1953 ... AGGH !!!
 When product arrived light did not work - either bulb burned out or some other problem
 I feel bad posting a less-than-glowing review for this , since so many people love it , but it just did NOT live up to my expectations . First , this balm is waxy and heavy . Not quite as bad as old-school chapstick , but pretty close . It made my lips feel gummy and almost -LRB- but not quite -RRB- sticky . I also find the ingredients list questionable , because the vanilla scent -LRB- `` vanilla extract '' on the label -RRB- is very strong and extremely artificial ; additionally , I felt a mild stinging with repeat applications . I do have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and seborrheic dermatitis , but I 've never reacted to vanilla fragrances or true vanilla -LRB- by which I mean diluted vanilla essential oil -RRB- . This was a dud for me .
 Denny & Kathy 's Superstore cheats , be careful buying from these guys . They advertise 4-pack , $ 0.06 / bag package , and send only 1-pack , $ 0.26 / bag one . They also refused to send an additional ones .
 I ordered 80 bags for $ 20.32 . I only received 20 bags . I would like to receive the additional 60 bags ordered .
 Do n't be fooled , Camco Toilet Tissue may be half the price but it is also half of your expectations . Small rolls and thin paper . If I purchase Marine Tissue over the internet again , I will get a better product .
 This flavor was so terrible that I ended up throwing it away after trying it once . I absolutely love the vanilla ice cream royale and the strawberry banana smoothie flavors of this same product . I bought the chocolate mint flavor based on positive reviews - so maybe it was just me but I really could not stand it !
 This product was represented as very strong . It ripped by the second day of use on my grandmother 's bed . I would not recommend this product unless it is on a very little used guest bed .
 This company sent me the wrong product . Instead of the ZIPPERED enclosed mattress cover for a hospital bed , they sent me some cheap over the mattress cover . When complained , they overnighted me a replacement , supposedly the correct one . I got the same one again , , , so now had 2 wrong ones , and not going in for three . Called the credit card company , , am reversing the charges , and they are gettin both there cheapies back , in one box at their expense . DONE !!! DO NOT DO BUSSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE !!
 I RECEIVED MATTRESS PLASTIC , NOT ZIPPERED . I CAN NOT USE THE SLIP OVER COVERS , I AM VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED . I HAD TO RUN TO MEDICAL STORE AND GET WHAT I NEEDED .
 This was sent to me taped up . I thought it looked used . When I opened it , I looked on the bottom and it had already expired . I never got to use it . The person who sold it had no idea and was willing to correct the problem ASAP .
 After reading all of the glowing reviews of Therabreath products , I wanted to love this one . And I did ... for the one day the product worked . After that , a terribly offensive taste developed in my mouth . My taste buds were altered such that water , tea and many other foods and drinks tasted terrible . This only worsened with continued use . The product literature says something like this may happen and to try sprinkling baking soda on the toothpaste before using it . It also states that this is a temporary effect that will normally last only a couple of days . The baking soda helped a little . However , after a week of this problem continuing I had to give up . Too many foods tasted bad , and it was completely impossible to enjoy a glass of wine . The change was so profound that I was afraid it might be permanent . Happily , after two days of discontinuing use , my taste buds are almost back to normal . My halitosis was n't bad enough to endure these side effects . Ironically , a couple of days into trying this I could n't even tell if there was still any bad breath - all sensations were overtaken by the offensive taste . I will find another product to help .
 The third time I used TheraBreath a horrible taste woke me out of a sound sleep . Now it is impossible to drink coffee due to putrid sourness . Only mints and highly acidic food are barely tolerable . Some say I can continue use when/if these side effects disappear . The intensity of this reaction has rendered me fearful of a possible upset to normal functioning .
 For the size of this item the shipping was way overpriced . I will not order from this company again .
 I did not like the taste and consistency of this ... reminded me of milk of magnesium . Too thick and leaves a bad taste ... easier to take tablets rather than doctoring this ...
 none of the reviews or product info listed how much calcium in a dose , which is important to know . so the suggested dosing is 30ml -LRB- only 16 doses/bottle -RRB- and this contains only 1200mg of calcium . so a reasonable person should be drinking 10ml -LRB- 2 teaspoons -RRB- 3 times a day to maximize the benefit . you body can only maximally absorb up to 500mg of calcium each time.for all of those that mix the 30ml with glass of milk ? you 're wasting all that calcium.and i do n't understand why people said this is good tasting , it 's so chalky & weird , i ca n't stand it.If you do n't like swallowing the horse pills , try using chewables -LRB- tums , or that chocolate looking ones -RRB- . or eat a yogurt.I got these for my kids since they are not a fan of milk , but I ca n't even swallow them , so wo n't put the kids thru this misery . I could only add this when making certain smoothies , and thinking of adding it into popsicles.for adults , i think it 's a waste of money .
 Hi , I bought this because my doctor advise me and my daughter to take Cal , mag , zinc supplement . Plus , I was told that magnesium citrate is better absorbed by the body . Only problem I have is that after taking this my teeth felt super sensitive as if I ate lemons or vinegar . Might try taking it with a straw next time . Has anyone else experience this ?
 I have Multiple Sclerosis , as soon as I started taking this product , I started having flareups . it is the only new thing I added to my diet .
 The box of 12 -LRB- plastic -RRB- bottles of Rinse Aid came with about a third of the bottles leaking/damaged , apparently from either poor packaging , packing or shipment . A replacement order was fulfilled swiftly at no cost -LRB- other than my trip to the post office -RRB- , but seepage all over the packing box , as well as the outer Amazon box , once again forced a return for which I 'm seeking a refund .
 This seems like a good product , but the sprinkle cap that comes with it does not fit it and falls off and then you get a big dose of the seeds in your recipe , instead of a sprinkle . The other thing I had a problem with was that I only intended to buy one jar of these and they sent two , but charged me for two for some reason , not sure why . The product seems fine , may be a little pricy though , I am sure you can find it cheaper elsewhere .
 This whole black seed was no longer available although it did n't say so when I ordered it and they sent me two bottles of the ground instead of one ground and one whole . I am using these to replace cumin in cooking and was upset . The bottles are HUGE . I will not use up even one bottle of the ground before it loses its flavor . The supplier was very accommodating and returned the purchase price for the one bottle of the whole seed I did n't get in the order . Nor did I have to send back one of the bottles of ground black seed . Overall it was a good experience but feel they should remove the whole seed from the web if it is no longer being made .
 I found that just drinking 8-16oz of water alone before a big meal has helped me to lose 10lbs this month alone , and it 's FREE ! I did n't really notice that much of a difference when taking TrimSpa , I really think it 's the water that makes you feel fuller !
 Trimspa does n't do much ... . but it helps a little bit ... I 've used it in conjunction w/slimfast -LRB- because alone it really did n't do anything -RRB- ... . it helped me get from slimfast to slimfast feeling `` hungry '' instead of `` famished . `` The good thing is you do n't get sick or jittery at all . If you need a little help , this might be the trick . If you are looking for more than that , you can either clean out your diet to the max and kick up your work-outs , or find a more effective product -LRB- and post it here so we can all benefit -RRB- .
 I weighed 188-189 pounds and I needed to lose about 8-9 pounds . I was taking other pills , but all they did was make me feel all hyper and gittery , I hated it . Since I started taking TrimSpa about 2 months ago , I am now down to 177 pounds and I feel great . I ca n't say my appetite went away , but I do get fuller more quickly , nor did I feel I had more energy , but I did lose the weight .
 I have been using this now for awhile and have n't seen results . I have n't been AS hungry but definately lost any weight .
 I tried the entire bottle and my stomach was still grumbling . I noticed no difference . I felt like a schmuck buying it in the first place . Anna Nicole 's a liar !
 We have to rewash all the knives , most of the plates , and all plastic cups . Everything gets some sort of a film on it . I really must say , this is the worst dishwashing gel ever . I have yet to run the experiment , but I bet just water would result in cleaner dishes . Its back to Cascade for our family .
 Coming from using the Electrasol Tabs , this detergent leaves many more bits of food stuck to the dishes and seems to be leaving my dishes looking visibly dirtier as time progresses . I find that to get the dishes to come out of the dishwasher looking anywhere close to clean , I have to pre-rinse them to nearly the point of hand-washing which , of course , defeats the purpose of having a dishwasher . Additionally , the increased hand-washing uses much more water which is not environmentally friendly . On the plus side , the scent is great .
 We have soft water in our area and the dishwasher kept overflowing with suds from the Earth Friendly dishwasher gel , cut way back on the amount we put in and it still overflowed.I read about the different ways to cut back on suds , from using vinegar to cooking oil , but thought it was ridicules to have do this every time I wash dishes in the dishwasher.We have since switched over to Ecover dishwasher tablets and problem solved , and the dishes come out sparkling , clean & spotless .
 I have used a few different brands of natural dish detergent and had been happy with all of them until I tried this one . It simply does not wash my dishes . There is food stuck on everything , which is funny since I started scrubbing all the food off my dishes when I realized this stuff does n't work . And no , it 's not my dishwasher disbursing food , it 's brand new , and awesome . Once I 'm done with this stuff I will going back to my favorite brand of natural dish detergent , BioKleen , I highly recommend it .
 I am all for using green products but this stuff does not do the job , I ran one load of dishes through twice , using hot water , there was food on the dishes and the glass pieces were cloudy . I emailed ECOS , they said I need to run vinegar through the dishwasher to change the PH , and then it will work but frankly that is just a little too much work . We also have hard water so maybe that is the issue The person from ECOS said that it works great for her with fine china , antique glass etc , but I guess I am just not willing to experiment , I just want clean dishes . Note , My appliance repair guy said to put a full glass of distilled vinegar upright in the dishwasher , after 10 or 15 times the deposits will go away and the glasses will not be cloudy . Do n't put it in detergent dispenser , it will not work . Kind of off topic but thought I would mention it .
 ... but I never will again . We practically prewash the dishes before we put them in the washer , and they still come out spotty , filmy , and powdery . -LRB- We only use the recommended amount - we 're not overfilling -RRB- . We also purchased their line of laundry detergent and are equally disappointed . Bummer !
 The price alone forced me to be diligent in at least giving it a fair shot . I scraped and rinsed every dish , used the `` pots & pans '' cycle ... even tried running it twice -LRB- undoing the environmental benefit , I 'm sure -RRB- , to no avail . Cloudy , grimy dishes at the end . If you do n't love finding what looks like bird poop adhered to the bottom of your wine glasses , buy another detergent that works .
 This stuff does not work at all . It overflowed my dishwasher and did not get my dishes clean at all . Trader Joes is the best of the environmental dish washer cleaners .
 As some other have indicated , this gel just does n't get the dishes clean . If we wash everything first , then dishes and cutlery were clean , but then what 's the purpose of having a dishwasher ? Certainly , I will not buy this again .
 Bought this because my usual choice -LRB- Method Smarty Dish -RRB- was out of stock . Enormous waste of time and money.Any dish that is n't essentially hand-washed before going in the machine comes out dirty . The tiniest fleck of food will hold on to any surface and must be removed beforehand.The gel also appears to not rinse that cleanly , either . Pretty much everything you eat off of the dishes after using this stuff will taste of lavender . There are certainly worse aromas to have around your food , but I 'd rather have none at all.Avoid .
 This stuff is utterly useless as dishwashing detergent . I suspect that we would have better results if we used nothing at all than with this brand . It leaves a nasty cloudy film on the dishes ... especially the glasses ... that can not only be seen , but also felt . The glasses actually come out looking much worse than when they went in ! It does n't even come off easily when washed by hand afterward . We used if for a while and thought something was wrong with the dishwasher until we tried another brand . Tried it again when we ran out of our preferred brand the other day . We live in a part of the world where water is naturally soft , so we do n't even have hard water to blame it on . Definitely not using this again . Wish I could find some other use for it ... we have 3 bottles of the stuff left and I hate to just throw it out ... but we will definitely never use it again for `` cleaning '' our dishes .
 Other reviews have commented about the ineffective nature of this product , but I feel compelled to add my thoughts . I 've used several environmentally-friendly -LRB- at least purportedly -RRB- dishwasher detergents , and this is by far the absolute worst product I 've encountered . It does , as they claim , clean tea and coffee stains . However , I can use baking soda and a little elbow grease to take care of those . What it does n't do is clean dishes well . You could , of course , rinse dishes so that they 're nearly spotless before placing them into the dishwasher , but that defeats the purpose of using it in the first place . Avoid this stuff completely , unless you enjoy wasting your money .
 I am a fan of green cleaning products . Most of them work well , have tolerable scents , and are generally affordable compared to conventional cleaners . That is why after buying this product I was very disappointed . First time I used it , this product did not even come close to working and that was after carefully pre-rinsing each dish . So I realized I would have to pre-rinse and hand-wash even more , almost to the point of being entirely clean and sanitized already before going into the dishwasher and this soap could be used . Even at that point , it still did a mediocre job . I had to run dishes multiple times to get anything clean . When it was time to unload the dishes , I would have to pull them out individually and scrub them down vigorously and put them back into the wash again to get any decent results with this soap . WHY BOTHER !? By this time , I have already used way more water and used at least twice the amount of energy to heat the water in running it 2-3 times . HOW IS THAT GREEN AND EARTH FRIENDLY ? I 'M SORRY , BUT USE ANOTHER GREEN PRODUCT FOR YOUR DISHES .
 Your dishes will probably get cleaner without using any of this soap at all !! Even after pre-rinsing the dishes and not putting anything in dishwasher that was caked on , my dishes still came out very dirty.To me using a environmentally product on dishes that you then have to hand wash completely negates the ` environmental ' aspect of using it.What a waste of water -LRB- and time ! and money ! -RRB- . Shame on an ` environmentally conscious ' company for creating such a ineffective product that leads to so much water waste.I got much better results with Ecover which proves you can use natural ingredients and still be effective .
 I completely renovated my Kitchen less than a year ago and installed a quality integrated dishwasher . I 've tried several dishwashing detergents and tried this a few months ago because I try to use environmentally friendly products . As soon as I switched to this product my dishes came out with food stuck on them , residue and feeling dirty . Not all dishes/glasses/silverware were unclean but I had to inspect and then re-wash a lot of dishes.Even after pre-rinsing , not overfilling the dishwasher and running the sink faucet on hot for 15 seconds to get the hot water immediately into the dishwasher this product still did not perform.I have never had a product that performed this poorly . Its not earth friendly because I have to waste more water when I re-wash the dishes this product did n't clean properly .
 I do n't think I can even finish the bottle . I got this because they were out of my usual detergent ... big mistake . Next time I will just hand wash until I can get my usual kind . This does not clean the dishes at all , ugh .
 - Does n't get the dishes clean . -LRB- And , I always rinse them before loading the dishwasher . -RRB- - Leaves a residue on the glasses.-Creates way too much suds , which do not drain well , and can damage the motor.OTOH ... hmmm . there is no other hand . Terrible product . Plain hot water would probably work better .
 I just ca n't believe they state on the front label that this product removes coffee and tea stains ! I had guests over , all of whom drink filter coffee , so out of 10 cups that I took out of the dishwasher after using this product , two of them went into the cupboard -LRB- they were probably the cups that I 'd had my very weak tea in -RRB- . The others I had to scrub because of the heavy coffee stains and put back in the dishwasher . I actually checked all the dishes to see if the dishwasher had actually been turned on they were so stained ! Do not recommend this product and will not use it again .
 I now know why this product was on ` clearance ' . Guess what -- it does n't work . It might be better as a bodywash or air freshner . Because it definently does not clean dishes.My first clue should have been that the bottle warns there is some prep-work involved to using the product . Wanting things to come out ` right ' I followed this to the letter.Well , the company might as well not have included it at all . It wastes time . And it does not help the product perform any more efficiently . Nothing was clean when the cycle ended . It looked like I never even ran the dishwasher.I 've not had problems with other organic/natural products . Ecos really does itself a BIG financial disservice through such low-quality .
 Well , I got it at a local store for $ 2 after using a $ 1 coupon , and although I had read the previous reviews , I figured it just could n't be as bad as so many others had claimed . And it 's not ... if you do n't mind oily lip smudges and melted on cheese and random streaks . I agree with the other reviewer who suggested it might be better to use no detergent at all than this stuff . How they ever got away with marketing this is beyond my imagination . If you put the dishes in perfectly clean , they will come out that way , but otherwise you will not want to eat off your own dishes . If I were Amazon , I 'd take this stuff off the site entirely .
 Dishes that would be spot clean prior to trying this product did not clean well . I wanted to do the right thing but no thanks . Going back to Cascade .
 This was on sale at my local high end grocery store so I bought 2 bottles . It 's worthless . I might as well run my dishwasher with no detergent whatsoever . I ca n't count how many times I 've had to rewash things by hand after `` washing '' them.I 've followed the directions , use the hottest water setting , pre-rinsed , used a vinegar rinse , etc. . Nothing will make this stuff work.Save your money and get a different product . You might as well put money in the detergent cup for as effective as this stuff is .
 We 've been using this for 2 weeks and I have come to the conclusion that it just does n't work . All dishes come out with some sort of film on them . Over half of the dishes need rewashed following the dishwasher cycle . In particular , this solution appears incapable of removing peanut butter from knives , anything sticky on a plate -LRB- syrup , refried beans , if it sticks , it stays -RRB- . If the dish is n't already clean , this stuff wo n't make it that way . I think Earth Friendly should just pull this product . It does n't work .
 Used it 4 or 5 times and got the same results - not good . May be organic but if the dishes are not clean and stuck with dried on food , it is not good . Do n't bother
 They say this is safe for the environment . I say this is probably true , given how safe it is for the bits of the environment that are stuck to my plates . You can also easily overflow your dishwasher with suds if you use too much . I experimented with various amounts and could n't find an amount that equated to getting my dishes clean , though I did find some amounts that equated to getting suds on my floor .
 This stuff is great for the environment and it smells great . BUT ... even though I rinse my dishes before I put them in the dishwasher , this stuff just does n't do the job getting them clean . My glasses are all cloudy . Overall , I want to do my part for the environment but I REALLY want clean dishes too . I have to get through this case and then I 'll be looking for something that works better .
 Unfortunately , this product just does n't work . We pre-rinse plates , we 've tried adding more or less detergent , and nothing seems to help . Our dishes are always streaked with a cloudy white film , and our glasses are all cloudy . Our utensils are rarely clean , and are always spotted . I 've thoroughly checked our dishwasher to make sure there are no clogs and to ensure diry water was n't re-circulating . I do n't like the scent of lavender in dish cleaning liquid anyway , I prefer lemon or citrus , but I purchased this hoping it would be an environmentally helpful product.Sadly , it just does n't do the job . I am now stuck with 5 bottles that I am not quite sure how to use - maybe they 'll help cleaning the tub .
 Just spent $ 60 on a repair call to figure out why my dishwasher is not cleaning my dishes anymore . Coffee stains on my cups , food on plates and silverware , film on glasses ... Dishwasher is fine . When I asked if it was at all possible that the problem was the new dishwashing gel , the repairman mentioned exactly what other reviewers have said , that this gel was not good , created ineffective suds and was prone to suds overflowing . He recommended the Cascade balls which are also recommended by Consumer Reports . http://www.amazon.com/Cascade-Complete-Phosphate-48-Count-Container/dp/B002SB95ZK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1288293195&sr=8-1
 Without a doubt the most ineffective dishwasher detergnt I 've ever used . I have a very good Bosch dishwasher and had no problems getting my dishes clean until I used this product . Every knife and cooking utensil has to be rewashed , regardless of how dirty it was to start with . Even butter knives are left with a scummy film . I do n't see how this can be good for the environment if everything needs to be washed twice . Unfortunately , I bought it at Costco so I have to use up several bottles before I can go back to my old brand . Do n't waste your money .
 I 've tried this and other earth friendly dishwasher products here in Nevada . Sadly the water here is pretty bad and I think that is a big reason behind the lack of performance in these products . To anyone looking for a dishwasher detergent that works I say tread carefully as it 'll probably take you a few tries to find one that works and given the price of these products it 's an expensive game . It 's worth it when you find it though !
 I love to keep my house organic and chemical free . This dishwasher soap is horrible . It left the glasses with a film , stuff on plates and the flatware did not even looked like it went through a dishwasher . Horrible stuff .
 Unless you have extra time to inspect and re-clean all your dishes , do n't buy this product . We gave it a try for three loads and each time found numerous dishes with food particles remaining , mugs left with tea stains , and even a white film left across plates . We tried increasing the amount and running the loads again , but the stains still persisted . We ended up needing to hand wash about 1/3 of our dishes . Considering all our extra water usage and extra time to get the dishes clean with Wave , we are immediately going back to conventional dishwashing gel , which always gets our dishes clean without pre-washing . We 'll recycle the Wave plastic bottle , but sadly the contents are going down the drain . It 's a shame that it 's useless and actually created extra waste to buy it .
 This dishwashing detergent does n't wash dishes very well . We 've had to run the dishes through the washer twice ! It 's terrible . The bottle says it 's `` 2X Ultra -- High Performance '' , but I 'd say 1/4X . It does smell really good before you put it in the dishwasher , but no smell after the wash.I 've used ECOVER products and they 're great so far ! They have lots of environmentally friendly cleaning products that work wonderfully.I do n't expect that a cleaning product without harsh ultra-ly processed and petroleum-filled ingredients to clean as well or with as few extra steps as a product with these . However , I do n't like to be lied to on the label . Just tell me , `` use three times as much '' or `` pre-soak for 2 hours prior to attempting using an automatic washer to wash '' . :-RRB- You get the gist ... . Furthermore , I would forgo a nice smelling product for one that works well .
 This is the only product that has ever made my dishwasher leak suds all over the floor . My WOOD floor in our remodeled kitchen . Luckily , we caught it before the floors got too wet . I am returning this and will go back to Cascade !!!
 We use only organic foods and cleaning supplies in our home whenever possible . So , I was delighted to give this dishwasher gel a try . I loved the scent and thought a gel would be clean-rinsing and gentle on dishes.It was n't long before I noticed my dishwasher had started leaving residue on my dishes . I became more diligent about pre-washing and made sure never to run anything through the dishwasher if it had any dried food on it whatsoever . In spite of my best efforts , the dishwasher was actually dirtifying my pre-washed dishes ... depositing residue all over my dishes . I would unload the dishes , soak extensively , re-scrub and re-wash , load the dishwasher again , and run another cycle , only to get the same filthy results . Our water bill increased about 30 % during this time.Frustrated , we were actually seriously considering buying a new $ 800 dishwasher ... but I decided to switch dishwasher detergents first.Suddenly , my dishes were coming out clean and sparkling again ! As happy as that made me , I 'm utterly appalled that a dishwasher detergent would clean so horribly to the point that it 's actually worse than not cleaning at all.While I did give two stars because this dishwasher gel is organic , what good is `` environmentally friendly '' if you 're having to run the same dishes through 3-4 dishwasher cycles every time -LRB- and even then they do n't come out clean -RRB- ?
 I made the mistake of buying two big bottles of this stuff at Costco . When I first used it I though the dishwasher was broken , washed dishes were gross . Lots of food residue , sometimes to the point that it looked like the dishwasher had n't even cycled . Really nasty . Switched back to our normal brands and everything is fine . I 'm going to see if Costco will refund the money on this and make sure they know it is a useless product .
 I usually use the Seventh Generation stuff -LRB- which works well for me -RRB- but took a chance on this gel because it was a little cheaper . It is AWFUL ! It leaves all of my dishes covered in specks of food . It 's almost as if somehow this soap grinds up any food that 's left on the dishes into a powder and fine mists it onto everything . I do use a separate rinse aid but that did n't help . I 'm surprised with all the negative reviews this product has that it 's still selling .
 I tried many brands of diapers on my children -LRB- I have 5 total -RRB- . While these seem good enough and are similar to pampers cruisers in many ways like efficiency , price , availability , what I was n't impressed with were the chemicals used in these diapers . Next to baby skin it did n't seem worth it , there was also and increased incidence of diaper rash and irritation for my children with these . Besides chlorine and the other environmentally damaging chemicals used to produce these diapers , they are loaded with petroleum based absorbers and other irritants . The problem is that the earthy diapers do n't offer the same level of dryness protection , or so I thought . I switched to Natra-care Naty Baby diapers which , believe it or not , actually keep my baby drier than Huggies supreme , are environmentally responsible , and biodegradable . Sorry Huggies.p.s . I do n't work for the Naty baby diaper company . With over 10 million disposable diapers going to landfills daily , I think Huggies needs to step it up and do better . Even their natural brand is misleading and promotion is full of ` greenwashing ' . Too bad !
 I ca n't stand Huggies , when my baby wore them at night she had little gel beads all over her bottom in the mornings from the diaper being too wet . Huggies are also way too thick , they do n't work better than any other diaper that I 've tried and I tried a lot , I think they are worse because other cheaper diapers I 've tried do n't fall apart when really wet ! They are NOT worth the money !! I like White Cloud ... they are very comparable to Huggies Ultratrim but they do n't leave little gel beads on my baby 's butt !
 There are SO many more products out there better than this . I think it tastes like crap and hard to chew/go down . I would n't recommend it at all and I 'm a huge EAS fan .
 I love the EAS Carb Sense Bars - Peanut Butter Choc flavor . I ordered through Amazon because I could n't find them in my local store and the other store I used had melted version of the bars . I ordered from Amazon hoping they would have figured out how to circumvent the texas summer heat . I was wrong . The 3 boxes I order all came melted . I love the product but delivery seems to be a problem in the summer . I 'm not ordering via Amazon until the weather turns in my favor .
 bleck ! these are the worst tasting low carb bars out there - do not taste like peanut butter at all
 First off this bar might be decent if they offered 2 day shipping and sent it some way other than pony express . Not to mention that the post office makes no effort to get in a hurry to deliver anything . Therefore the time that you get the product it is melted and separated and horrible . I cancelled immediately .
 1 . Myoplex Cookie & Cream bar had a incorrect image which says 15 pack , read the contents and other details clearly . . it is 12 bar pack .2 . It is overpriced than other Myoplex Carb Control bars .3 . You can get it for 4 to 5usd less from other retail vendors.The bar is one of the good , but this rating is only for the seller.Please do n't buy from here .
 These are the most crass , foul , bad tasting nutrition bars I 've ever tried ! They taste like death and smell like a gorilla 's foot .
 I bought these for my diet and they literally tasted so bad my stomach turned ... I only had one and am going to give the rest away . . ICK ... THere are other Myoplex lite bars I love , but these are HORRIBLE !
 I originally ordered the Peanut Butter flavor , but had to substitute for the Fudge Brownie flavor when the supplier said they did n't have the Chocolate Peanut Butter bars . The product was dry and seemed old . It took a long time for the bars to be delivered also from the time I originally ordered them .
 For the size of this item the shipping was way overpriced . I will not order from this company again .

 The order was for 6pk but only 3pk were received . Contacted the seller about the missing part immediately . No any response after one week . Called Amazon and wait for a refund . This is the first experience with Brightersmile . Too bad !
 Fragrance is way too strong for me - I put it on before bed and WHEW !! I wanted a different `` refreshing '' fragrance that is no longer made .
 I love the Aveeno Oatmeal lotion and oils , so I was trying this one out because it smelled so good at the store . Unlike the other Aveeno products I used , this lotion just stayed sticky and tacky . I tried it a number of times , in a variety of environments -LRB- putting it on before bed , before work , immediately following a shower -RRB- because I liked the scent so much , but unfortunately , I just felt sticky.So , to summarize , I recommend all the other Aveeno products , but this one , as good as it smells , is no good .
 I do n't like it but it was a gift for someone who really likes this product . I would not buy buy it for myself
 We purchased this for grandparents but the sound of the alarm is so muted and so short , they ca n't use it ! The alarm is very short , 3 beeps once every minute for only 3 minutes , and so muted , imagine a cellphone on lowest sound setting , that it 's impossible to hear even in the same room with TV or radio on . Please read the reviews carefully , -LRB- we did n't -RRB- , this problem was already mentioned before .
 The clock portion of mine has not worked since the time I bought it . I 've tried different batteries , sometimes it works sometimes it does n't . I have taken the clock off and thrown it away . I am now using the pill holders as a pillbox . It 's not very good as a pillbox either it 's hard to get the pills in an out because of the slant of the lid .
 Older and sick folks are the ones who take pills and they are the ones who are likely hard of hearing . This product beeps a quiet beep and or warning once a minute for three minutes only . Then the banner comes across the screen stating missed dose . One has to look close to even pay attention to the display . We need a flashing light -LRB- bathrooms are dark all night -RRB- or alarm that continually sounds off until we reset it . Even the Chinglish is bad . Instead of `` take your pills '' it displays `` take your pilled '' . Folks very lives depend upon their dosage and they can not afford to gamble on Timex 's shoddy product .
 The product did not work from the begining . the display kept flickering and the alarms never sounded . The return for credit was easy but had to pay the return postage so it was an expensive waste of my time .
 Unfortunately , this product is worthless . The voice alarm is not very loud , certainly not loud enough for a person with hearing loss or a person in another room . The alarm only sounds three times at one minute intervals . In other words , only use with people of perfect hearing who carry the pill box with them at all times , including any trips to the bathroom.I was quite disappointed , as I was hoping it would help my elderly mother .
 I have purchased two of these , one being a gift . When I opened mine the battery was already in need for replacement . So , I exchanged it for a new one . The new one also said it was in need for battery replacement . The one I gave as a gift does n't work unless you hold the piece with the screen on it in your hand and push it together . If you do n't , there is nothing on the screen at all . I would like to return both of these items . For the price , there should be a full battery ready for use .
 I do n't like to leave negative reviews , generally ... but here 's one : This razor could come in handy under certain circumstances , but I stopped using it after my fourth or fifth time . I rarely cut myself with the inexpensive -LRB- generic double blade -RRB- razors I usually use , but with the Intuition Razor I 've knicked myself every time , often more than once . Also if your hands are soapy it slips out of grip frequently . That 's very annoying when you 're trying to take care not to cut yourself . -LRB- Did n't they use a focus group who could have clued them in on that ? -RRB- Lastly , after a few uses the soap part wore down substantially .
 This razor is very poor - the razor blades have rusted alomst instantly which I think is very dangerous . Rubbing rusty metal against delicate flesh is not a good idea , particularly if you are not immunized against tetanus . Plus the refills are ridiculously expensive . Do n't waste your money !
 After years of cutting my legs with dollar-store razors , I finally decided to treat myself to a decent razor . I picked the Intuition because I really liked the idea of having the soap and shaver in one.The main `` pro '' of this razor is that , in my opinion , it gives a good , close shave . I also like that it glides along the leg very smoothly . I 've nicked myself occasionally at the ankle and knee , though - go carefully in those spots.Now for the cons . The soap wears down very quickly and unevenly . The soap completely surrounds the blades , but since I shave only in one direction -LRB- using the sharp side of the blades , as I believe most people do -RRB- , the soap on that side wears down much faster that the soap on the other side . In fact , having soap on the dull side of the blade is pretty useless unless you want to wipe your leg with the soap first and then shave , which defeats the purpose of having a `` single step '' product . I 've even had one soap bar pop off the razor completely after only a couple of uses , and there was no way to reattach it - there went one very expensive refill!And yes , the refills are EXPENSIVE ! Way overpriced , if you ask me , especially since they do n't last very long.I find that the average refill lasts in good condition -LRB- with soap on the sharp side of the blades -RRB- for maybe 6 uses ; after that , the only soap is left on the dull side of the blades , where it does n't do any good -LRB- what genius is responsible for that bit of designing ?? -RRB- . I usually use the razor anyway until all the soap is gone - maybe a dozen shaves total , only half of which are as they should be . Poor value for the money there.While the razor itself has some good points , the refills are too expensive for what you get . Think carefully before investing in this system .
 For the size of this item the shipping was way overpriced . I will not order from this company again .
 As soon as I used it I noticed that this is the worst razor I 've ever used . It is not good for the curves on your legs , armpits or bikini area etc. because of the soap head which stands there clumsily . Plus , because of the soap head , you ca n't shave as close as you want . I did n't like it at all , waste of money and time . The first thing next day was to go to market again and to buy a new razor . -LRB- nowadays I adore Wilkinson Quattro for women -RRB-
 I thought this was a dream come true and initially I was convinced . After the first cartridge ran out though I experienced an overwhelming amount of problems :1 -RRB- The soap part around the razor will totally come off ruining its initial purpose and making you need shaving cream . Expect this to happen if you use it in the shower after only a few uses . Oh and you CA N'T use this outside of the shower because it leaves a filthy grime all over your legs .2 -RRB- It does n't give a close shave because the soap part sits above the razors . Also this is a 2 blade not 3 blade razor so expect to go over the same area a few time if you want a good shave .3 -RRB- The head bobbles back and forth creating an exorbitant amount of nicks , scratches and razor burn . AND the cartridge will fall off numerous amounts of times unless you duct tape it.Again my first cartridge did n't have problems 1 or 3 so I thought it would be a good back up razor if I was in a rush . But after experiencing ALL these problems with 4 other cartridges I gave up . Save your money and time trying to make this product work .
 As pointed out by the other reviews the moisturizer around the razor head wears unevenly . During the first use I was required to re-shave all areas of my legs 3 times and still had areas that were not smooth . Shave time was increased and final outcome was a total disappointment . The soap does wear unevenly and because of the size this is a horrible razor for curves , underarms , and the bikini area . Do n't waste you hard earned money on this shoddy product .
 This is probably the most ill-conceived product out there . First of all , as it has been pointed out in another review , this is a VERY poor quality razor . Without it 's soaper , it 's a dollar store item . Secondly , the soaper goes all the way around the blade . I do n't know about you but I generally shave using the sharp edge of the blade only ... so , after the soap wears out on the leading edge -LSB- in about 3 legs-worth of shaving ! -RSB- , it is necessary to give a swipe of the razor in the opposite direction before actually shaving , in order to get any soaping action . This seemed to double my shaving time rather than shorten it . I wish I could express more effectively just how much I hate this product . I also wish I could get that darn song out of my head ... I mean , come on Jewel , it sounded like a jingle the first time I heard it !
 As a college student , I was really excited about this at first . I thought , WOW , I do n't need to spend extra money on shaving cream/gel and it would be a quick shave . However , my excitement over this razor quickly diminished . The moisturizor around the blades wore down unevenly leaving a need to actually use gel/cream . Also , the shave itself is not very close . I am just overall disappointed with this porduct and went back to my Venus razor as soon as I used up the Intuition blades .

 I bought these thinking they were the actual `` Illumination '' brand candles . They are not . They are also small and do not smell good . HUGE waste of money and overnight shipping !!!
 This is the absolute worst razor I have ever used . I am a 35 year old woman who has been shaving for over 20 years . It is usually a rare occasion that I cut myself while shaving . Since using the Intuition razor , I have mutilated both my ankles and both my knees . The shape and bulk of this razor does not allow for precision movements around curved areas . Even on the smooth sections of my legs , the razor catches and skips , and I am stubbly by the end of the day . And forget about using this razor on armpits or bikini line . Even if this razor worked well on my legs , I 'd need a different razor for those delicate areas . I am extremely dissapointed in this product , as are most of my friends who have tried it . And , yes , I did wet both the razor and my skin , and shaved while in the shower , so that is not the problem . What a waste of money . I should have listened to my intition , and left this worthless product on the shelf .
 Wow where do I start ??? Well I 've been a Venus girl since they came out and I went to my Walmart to buy refills and I saw the Intuition so I thought I 'd give it a try because the concept appealed to me . So I go home and try it out . At first , I thought it was great because it was so smooth to run up my legs but then after I shaved my whole leg and felt with my hands where I need to go back over for missed spots , I had to re-do almost my whole leg ! Then I looked really close at the razor ... it 's cheap ! It looked like a cheap disposable razor that you can find at the dollar store . But I decided to keep on trying it for the heck of it . The solid lotion was all gone by my 4th shave . My venus razors last me a month . The Intuition lasted me 1 1/2 weeks . I do n't want to be putting an expensive refill in every week and a half . So , since I had another refill that came with the razor , I thought I 'd just use it up -LRB- I hate wasting things -RRB- . So halfway using the brand new refill , the lotion part completely broke off the razor making it unusable.Lesson learned
 The Schick Intuition shaves well , but the unscented is stinky!I am sensitive to fragrance , so I was thrilled to see `` unscented '' on the package . But soon I realized that the perfume wafting all over my bathroom was coming from my razor . Now I have to keep my razor outside , which is , well , inconvenient.Scent is not necessary in a razor , folks ! Let 's make it truly unscented !
 Nice design of the razor itself . The moisurizer cracks & breaks , though , after 2 or 3 shaves which renders the razor useless.Don ' t waste your money -LRB- and that 's a lot of money for some defective blades ! -RRB-

 This stethoscope is terrible quality . The diaphragm is flimsy , the head is loose , rattles when you move it and would obscure sounds . The unit is very heavy compared to other units .
 Our daughter is unable to sit down without fidgeting and being hyper . We gave BrightSpark a try . The results ? No difference whatsoever . A waste of time and money .
 I am almost finished with both bottles and have not seen an improvement in my 9 year old daughters behavior or attention span . She is very hyper and that has n't changed either . I have been giving her 6 tablets a day and two doses a day of the focus formula nine drops each dose . Anybody have any suggestions ? I know herbal formulas take longer to work so I 'm willing to order one more bottle before I give up .
 This is a pill with no benefits - Read the ingredients and then google them its a placebo should be illegal to sell junk ...
 The product shown here is half the dosage of that found on the Hoodia Rush Web site.I bought this and I am noticing it is not nearly as potent as the 1000MG Hoodia Rush . Even after taking two tablets , it is not as effective.I am having to take 6 tablets per day versus 2 of the tablets on the site.Therefore it actually is costing more for the same effect.I have found true 1000MG Hoodia Rush tablets for $ 42.00 . A much better value .
 I 've used a similarly shaped little round plastic clamshell pill box for years . A couple of them lasted forever , but when the last one got crunched , I looked for something similar . This LOOKS right , but do n't be fooled . It 's useless . Here 's the problem

 Received wrong size , AA instead of AAA . finnaly received the AAA batterys , but they would not charge . I have discarded them .
 This may be a good product for a female or someone with thin hair , but as a man with a thick 5 : o'clock shadow it is not nearly sufficient . I received this in the mail yesterday and hope I can return it . The thing does work and is waterproof . It just works very poorly .
 This razor is inexpensive , but it does n't really cut it when it comes to shaving . My facial hair is not thick nor heavy , but this razor ca n't even do an adequate job . And , it is brutal . When I 'm done shaving , which takes 5 or 10 minutes , my face feels like I have dry shaved it without any shaving cream . So , I would not recommend this razor for shaving . As a plus , the trimmer does work .
 This razor probably would have served me well when I was in my teens and had the whispiest of beards but now that I am grown and have a moderate but not heavy beard , the razor is a joke . Maybe it would work better if I wanted to spend a half hour shaving , running it back and forth , up and down my face but I do n't really have that kind of time . The person who said that it shaves as good as a blade must not have used a blade in a long time because after using the ShavePro , I finished off with a blade and my face is no longer bristled . Do n't waste your money on this unless you want to buy it as a toy for a child who wants to shave like daddy .
 NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR ... IF YOU HAVE NOT REACHED YOUR 16th BIRTHDAY AND WANT TO GET RID OF SOME PEACH FUZZ THIS RAZOR MIGHT WORK !!!!
 I had the Panasonic ES-SA40-K before and loved the shaver . However , it did n't seem to be available anymore so I thought I 'd try this cheaper one out . I saw the good reviews and thought it 's worth a shot . The first time I tried it though , I could n't even use it . It kept pulling my hair and it HURT . I 've never had such an uncomfortable shave before . Had to return instantly . Not sure if anyone else had the problem but wanted to share my own experience .
 Worse electric shaver I have ever used . My face looked like it was cut by a carving knife .
 I got my brother and two of my nephews one of these each and they all complained about how cheap made they are .
 I ordered this product because it advertised that you could use it wet or dry , but now I see why because it could n't cut hot butter much less give you a shave -LRB- lol -RRB- . I called to return the product , and they gave me a credit for the purchase . I am happy with Amazon , but not with the product .
 Pure Instinct does n't attract anything or anyone . I get the same attention and acknowledgement regardless of this product . It does have a nice scent that 's light and a little sweet smelling . Besides that I suggest you save your money ; or buy a different brand .
 Unable to find EZO Denture liners , which I 'd used for years , I tried these -- what a disaster ! In public , hours later , I suddenly had trouble speaking because my mouth was full of sticky slime . I 've tried several things since and have found a solution that works for me and is ridiculously cheap and easy . Tear off a hunk of regular kitchen waxed paper and fold it until you have a pad as thick as you need -- 4-8 thicknesses . If you use the natural width of the paper , you should get about 4 liners across . Lay your denture on the folded paper , draw around it and cut so that the front edge remains on an uncut fold . This gives it some stability . Fit it into the denture , bite down on it for a couple minutes and it fits even better than the flannel/wax EZO liners . I 'm delighted with this , and see no reason why it should n't last as long as I do . It 's not toxic , perfectly safe , and the wax molds to your mounth and denture . It 's worth a try .
 Bought these for my Mom . She says they are not as comfortable as EZO 's , which are no longer manufactured . They just do n't work for her .
 I started taking these pills three days ago . While they were not what I wanted -LRB- I wanted just green tea pills , not a mixature -RRB- , I decided to give them a try . After three restless nights I traced it back to these pills . Each pill has 200 mg of caffeine . And by following the directions , which state to take one pill mid morning followed by a pill and a glass of water . Then to repeat it again in mid afternoon . I was pumping myself full of 400 mg of caffeine . These pills are not worth it .
 That is truly the key to successful weight loss . I decided to take these as a supplement to se if they enhanced my performance -LRB- I exercise regularly and eat healthfully -RRB- . I honestly ca n't tell if they helped , but I can say that after a few months of taking these pills I began to suffer from the most painful pressure headaches that would last anywhere from 2-8 hours . Essentially all this pill has to offer is sleepless nights , painful headaches and minimal if any healthy weight loss . Skip them in favor of a nice brisk walk around the block every day !
 I ordered these pill after seeing a coworker drop a tremendous amount of weight in a short period of time . She claimed all it took was 30 min of excersise each day and these pills so of course I had to try it . I started with one pill mid day like it says in the directions just to see what would happen . I did n't sleep a wink for an entire week ! These pills will not let you rest . By the fourth night I found myself praying for sleep . I discussed this problem with my co worker she suggested taking them first thing in the morning rather than mid day so I did . That corrected my lack of sleep problem rigt away I continued to take one pill a day for another week . During the day , I noticed an increase in energy and a decreased appetite so I lost a little water weight over the course of two weeks but then it happend.I started having the most painful headaches that nothing would cure . At first , I thought it was a migrane that would n't let up then I thought it was due to my blood pressure being elevated . I was on the verge of going to my Doctor thinking that I had developed a major health problem . I did n't connect the pain to the pill . Then I read a review of these pills on Amazon and a few other sites and realized what the problem was . Thank Goodness for a place where consumers can share information on products . I had to write this review to let others know about my experience and to warn you to be very careful with these diet pills . You do n't realize how important sleep is until you ca n't get it anymore .
 Ive been using these for 4 weeks and I look nothing more like a patch work , with itchy reddish brown jag-ged squares all over my body , there are 10 packets of `` stickers '' in the box , and you 're to stick them on different parts of your body with a new one every 3 days , Sticking them on was fun , taking them off was hair raising , they werent like band aids that come with friendly adhesives , I had to rub liquid soap and warm water to take them off and they would leave a mark . They were there no matter how much I exfoliated my skin and when I peeled it off at one go , it left a scar like the first one already did , I just hope the scar will fade off someday.I lost about 3.5 pounds in total , but its a lousy tradeoff for looking like a patchwork.Only my sis was impressed by the effortless weightloss but Im sticking to low carb diets .
 These were a total waste of money . The patches are hard to stick on without having them stick together , and they always came off early . I could tell no difference in my appetite , and I lost no weight in using them . Can anyone tell me how to get my money back ?

 you know those positive reviews are all obviously written by the same person ... they 're in the same exact writing style , saying the same thing ... there are no miracles in fitness . you work hard and get results , or you do n't work hard and there are no results . that 's it !
 The main reason I bought the patch was for appetite suppression . The first day , I did n't feel any different , so I put 2 patches on . I still did n't feel any different , for the exception of an itch on my back for a week after peeling the patch off . The patch will work if you stick it over your mouth . If you want to loose weight , eat less and exercise more . I ca n't believe I fell for this product .
 I tried it for 1 month with no results , It was sticky and pulled hair and skin off my body . Even when I tried to wash it off , it was still marking my back .
 I remember buying this product 3 years ago , being excited that it would work but it never did . The patches are not sticking properly and if you sweat a little , they can come out - and leave some nasty stuff on your skin -LRB- like a chewing gum -RRB- . When it comes to cravings - I personally did not notice any changes in my appetite -LRB- meaning I still wanted to eat :-RRB- , neight I lost any weight . I personally will never buy it again , I have even trashed the rest of the patches .
 I bought this product about 3 years ago from Rite-Aid where I first saw it . I could n't swallow pills at the time so I thought this would be perfect for me . I put my first patch on in the morning after I got up -LRB- 6am -RRB- and by 1pm , I was starting to feel a little weird . My stomach was bothering me and I was hot and cold . A couple hours later , the side effects became really bad . I layed in bed the whole rest of the day because I felt so crappy . I was tired and was so cold that I was covered with 2 comforters and a quilted blanket and still shivering . I lost 6lbs the first day only because I did n't eat anything because of the side effects and was in the bathroom all afternoon with diarrhea . Not worth it ... do n't buy !
 This product has one advantage
 This product is useless and so are the raving 5 star reviews . All I got was square patches of darkened irritated skin after trying this for a month . Three months later I still have dark squares on my back -LRB- no bikinis for me -RRB- . And its not that my skin is sensitive - its as strong as hide , I 've never had a rash/allergic reaction in my life until this !!! Very disappointing!The happy 5 star `` reviewers '' have only ever reviewed one thing - these patches . the ones who give real reviews have reviewed many things over the course of time on amazon . Dont believe all that you read !
 I tried this product for the first three days -LRB- one patch -RRB- and it seemed to work . The problem with its sticking and also the extreme thirst were understandable if not expected , but it caused overall body itching that turned out to be just unbearable ! I emailed customer service to ask about this and they could n't be bothered to reply . Why would they ? They 're getting enough money from clueless first time customers such as myself to a -RRB- acknowledge and research the side effects their product DOES cause , or b -RRB- share the possible causes of the itching in certain people , if they know.Here 's some more things that sucked about the product
 I only gave this product one star because I did n't have the option to leave NO stars ! Not only does this product not work but the only thing that 's thinner on me is the skin where the patch used to be ... and my wallet ! I contacted customer service about the money back guarantee , of course they give you a whole 15 days to receive , use , and ship the product back for your refund . I was given some really valuable advice from customer service to eat right , drink lots of water and work out for 30 minutes everyday and if that does n't work , I should have my thyroid checked . Good to know they employ such knowledgeable people with medical backgrounds . Save your money !!
 They do n't help you lose weight at all . The only thing they did was irritate my skin and waste my money .
 After starting this product I developed a bladder infection , in which I have never had one before and drink plenty of water in a day . I usually do n't drink anything but water in fact . Also it says that there are no allergies to the patch , well I now have a rash in two spots on my back that have not gone away . I am not allergic to adhesives either . The patch also leaves a sticky square where the patch was . I have also gained about 3lbs since using this product !!!!!!! Better luck to who ever tries this , I am off to another product .
 For the size of this item the shipping was way overpriced . I will not order from this company again .
 I usually use the All Free & Clear liquid detergent , but they did n't have that available on Amazon , so I decided to try the powder version of same . It does NOT dissolve well and I now have three extra boxes sitting in my laundry room ! The only time I can use it is when I 'm washing stuff in HOT water and have time to let the water run so it can dissolve before I put the laundry in . I had to go and buy liquid detergent at the store last weekend so I could do laundry !
 I have been using liquid detergent in the past and this is the first time I am trying with powder detergent and I am very disappointed . because many times I would see white spot from the powder stay on the washed cloth . I will switch back with liquid detergent for sure .
 I was surprised to receive a powdered soap product . I thought I 'd be getting liquid soap containers . And the packaging is such that you do n't know it 's powdered soap until the package is opened and too late top return !
 This did n't really do a good job of lifting stains on clothes . Switching back to Tide
 My top loading machine does n't really do the best job dissolving this detergent . I find little white dots of powder residue on almost everything everytime and have to rewash several items . Test this first yourself with a small box instead of the larger purchase .
 I now remember why I have been using liquids . Even in warm water and running the washer for a little while and/or leaving it all day before loading clothes , it still leaves little granules of detergent that stick to the clothes on the bottom of the washer .
 Can someone tell me how reducing the amount of loads you can wash while keeping the price the same make this a better product ? I have been using All Stainlifter Powder Laundry Detergent in the 120-Load Box which weighs 27.8 lbs for two boxes . The `` new '' All only washes 40 loads and weoghs 18.8 lbs for 4 boxes and costs the same amount as two boxes of All Stainlifter . If you buy enough of the `` new '' All to wash 240 loads it would weigh 28.2 lbs but would be in 6 cartons instead of 2 . So I bet that the extra packaging to ship six boxes of the `` new '' All would weigh MORE than shipping two boxes of All Stainlifter , not LESS.So how does changing the formula make this product easier to ship if you have to buy six boxes instead of two when the extra packaging probably makes it HEAVIER to ship?Instead of getting 240 loads out of two boxes of All Stainlifter I would have to buy six boxes of this `` new '' formula and pay 50 % MORE than I was paying before . With `` savings '' like that I will be in the poor house in no time!So I gave this product 2 stars because it really is a good working detergent but the cost per load is 50 % higher than the previous version . So it looks like I will have to look for another brand that gives me more for my money .
 I purchased these at Lowe 's and they did n't even work out of the box . I had returned them , and bought another . They worked for about 20 hours . Do yourself a favor and avoid these .
 I recieved this product late and they are nine months expired . I can not believe this . They were shipped from India so it took forever to get but to be expired are you kidding me .
 I bought two of these . They were both cut , which created a hard line that made my painting project difficult . Not a good , soft sponge that 's nicely full of holes to create a good , natural look . I suggest you keep looking and do n't buy this .
 Ive been using GABA calm for about a year and just switched to this powder because it contained more of the GABA . My 10 y.o. son has asd and we were treating his anxiety and nervous energy with these supplements . Unfortunately , he has now had the worst school year ever with unpredictable behaviors , agression and the like . Staff was asking us if we tried putting him on meds . As an evperiment , we took him off all forms of GABA and what do you know - He has now had the best two weeks of his life . Im not saying this product will not work , just that if you are using it on children be aware it may have the opposite effect .
 The Prolab Pure Whey seems to satisfy everything that an individual is looking for in a protein supplement ... nutrition facts that is . Apart from that , the powder tastes rather chalky . Do n't even think about mixing it in water with a spoon or nything other than a mixer . I have tried almost every brand out there from EAS to Weider , and this is probably the worst thing . Would NOT recommend it to anyone .
 It does n't mixes well as has been claimed in the description and in other reviews ... another problem that i faces is the wierd aftertaste it leaves in my mouth ... i tried to return the product back to amazon but their return policy about food items are not that hassle-free either so ended up with a product that does n't leave a good taste in my mouth .
 This mop head probably works well for dust , as advertised . I needed a mop for wet cleaning and this mop head is so clingy that you can hardly move the mop over the floor when wet . If you need to use a wet mop , buy the mop head designed for that - it works much better .
 If you wear this over your socks , the velco will constantly detach . If you wear this under your socks , make sure the socks go over the wrap on your ankle and you should be ok .
 I ordered this clipper from another vendor , had to send it back as it does not cut anywhere close to the listing 's claims of : `` blade adjusts from Size 000 -LRB- 1/100 inch -RRB- '' instead it will cut at a minimum of 1/25 inch and that only on vertical hairs . Any hairs that do not stand up are cut at closer to 1/8 inch.Compared to a Philips Norelco T980 the stubble is from twice as long on standing hair to four times as long on hair laying flat.Aside from not cutting close enough for my needs I found for general hair clipping the gyroscopic forces from the motor were quite strong and the cord rather stiff .
 The tea has no taste or aroma of jasmine which is the main reason I bought it . I would not buy again .
 I 've had this tea before from a friend . So when I ordered I assumed it would be the same . HA ! I do n't know if the box I got had been sitting around for years but that 's what it tasted like . No flavor . No aroma of jasmine . May as well have been drinking hot water . And I 've yet to recieve a refund or response of my complaint from the vendor or Amazon .
 This company debited my credit card immediately and never shipped the product , nor did they respond when I contacted them 3 TIMES as to what on earth happened . Do n't buy from them , EVER .
 The Jasmine flavor is weak when you make an 8 ounce cup brewed for 3 minutes . Brew longer and it turns bitter . For me , the best Jasmine tea in bags is Jasmine Green , Organic Monkey King by NUMI .
 I was disappointed in this jasmine green tea as I could not detect any jasmine flavor or smell .
 This does n't smell ANYTHING like the Sweet Almond I have smelled before . It smells like rancid olive oil with a hint of eucalyptus . Very disappointing . Do n't waste your time or money .
 These are easily the worst tasting energy bars I 've ever tried . I seriously urge that you avoid wasting money on bulk purchase until you have tried a single bar from a store.There are many good tasting energy bars out there , and this one sure is n't among them .
 I was trying to save money by purchasing the cheapest trimmer . Bad choice . It does n't cut very well at all and it fell apart .
 complete waste of time . not worth any of the pennies spent on it . did not do anything it promises . dont waste your time
 I dont know I could just be using it wrong but I was surprised when it didnt trim a close as it said it would . Fine hairs , forget about it . That was what I got it for , to get the fine hairs that the larger trimmers dont get and to spare myself waxing . Now this product just sits in a storage bin as I wait for something I could use it on . I have had it for going on a year now .
 Got these as overnight protection for our 5 year old Autistic son . He was having leaks with Pampers Goodnights , so we tried these . Not only did they leak just as bad -LRB- if not worse -RRB- , the filling came out to cover him in clear `` crystals '' . The peach mat is not up far enough and / or absorbent enough for a male side sleeper . Very disappointed !
 Came highly recommended by my yoga instructor , so I tried it . Worked a little on my heel spur pain -LRB- for which it does n't seem to be designed -RRB- , but for aching in my finger knuckles , did nothing . I really did want it to work . My yoga instructor said it worked miraculously on what sounded like a trigger finger . So maybe just not for everyone .
 Never received this item . Was told that it was returned as `` undeliverable '' . I have received credit on my credit card . I suspect that the shipper used a wrong address and I do not blame Amazon .
 Total Health Discount had these the cheapest . I ordered them and 13 days later they sent me an email saying that they were out of stock . I got on Amazon to write a bad review and the company still says it has one order still in stock . Do yourself a favor and order from another company . Higher Mind pills are great and worth the trouble finding below the store price .
 I took this supplement a few months , but saw no benefits and it expensive so I wo n't buy again .
 I bought the 2 oz size for $ 18 at Walmart . Tried on my arthritis hands and knees . I did n't get any relief at all .
 I will be very honest -- this cream did absolutely nothing ! I have seen their advertising of this product on television and now believe that to be false advertising . I was very disappointed as I had hope for this product .
 I have osteo arthritis . The dream did not help me whatsoever . It did not relieve any of my pain , and I returned it for their money back guarantee .
 The service was great but the product did nothing for my arthritis . . The price was high and I expected more of it .
 I have osteoarthritis in my left ankle , a result of corticosteroid use for asthma . I have tried practically everything to alleviate the pain , which is now so intense , it causes a limp . The pain-killer pills tend to cause kidney damage . Chondroitin and glucoseamine are not meant for those with shellfish allergies.Australian Dream ointment seemed to be the only alternative . I really wanted some pain relief ; I wanted this product to work . SADLY , IT DID NOT RELIEVE the pain . I applied hot compresses - no relief . Logically , Dream should not work . After all , rubbing pain ointment does n't really reach the intended bones , where the pain resides.I ca n't argue with other glowing reviews . I envy those users . I must look elsewhere for pain relief . Ankle fusion surgery is the prescribed remedy , but the doctors make no promises of success at my age -LRB- 63 -RRB- .
 Not much to report . It does n't work . It 's like using Bengay without the smell . Save your money .
 I have n't used this much since I received it . It feels good when applying it . I might have to update this after I 've used the product longer .
 This is nonsense . Look up the ingredients on medscape . Look up the product . This is a complete scam . Shame on amazon and shame on all of the major drug store chains like Kinneys . I fell for it in my desperation . I hope that You will not . Amazon i thought better of you . I will think twice before I rely on those reviews again .
 yes the bell is so small and ... not bad but really small its fine any way ...
 I was disappointed to discover this product is sweetened with sucralose -LRB- generic name for Splenda -RRB- . It also contains artificial flavors . I prefer to avoid artificial sweeteners , and was surprised to find it in a `` health product '' .
 As my princess loves raspberries , I figured this would be an ideal gift.Alas , her over-enthusiastic use of this product did not produce the expected result - the cheesecake did n't taste of raspberries.Worse , we both felt a little hot and bothered afterwards and needed a long , cold shower to recover .
 When I first bought Glad Rags some years ago , they were fantastic , well-made , well-stitched , and lay flat even after many washings -- and well worth the high price . I would have given them five stars . I still have some of those today that I use as panty liners and they are as good as they ever were . -LRB- I found they were n't irritating like the disposable panty liners . -RRB- However , when I bought a package of Glad Rags recently to replace a couple that the dog ate -LRB- !! -RRB- , I was VERY disappointed . The inserts of the new Glad Rags were narrower than before and so poorly made that every time I washed them they all crinkled up and I had to IRON them before they were usable ! Until the company gets their act together and does a better job of quality control , I suggest you make your own liners for light days or panty liners . It 's easy -- and I 'm not a seamstress ! I used four layers of good cotton flannel -LRB- that I pre-washed in very hot water -RRB- , cut in an oblong shape and double hand stitched and finished around the edges while watching something insipid on television . If you just need panty liners , you can pin your home-made liners through two layers of the flannel into the crotch with a very small safety pin from the outside of the undies . -LRB- Double-check to make sure it 's securely pinned ! -RRB- Saves a lot of money too .
 I used this product for the first time . I cleaned three floor rugs today with this product . Two of the rugs had no pet smell lingering , but the last rug , which was the most smelly , still had a strong pet smell after cleaning it . I will probably have to re-do this last rug because of the high use it receives and since the dogs tend to like to sit on it . The deoderant in the formula needs to be stronger since pet smells are so strong . Also the formula could use more brighteners in it since I do n't see much of a difference after cleaning the rugs .
 The socks do n't go over my ankles & the shipping costs were the same as the price of the socks . Not worth it .
 You may as well just buy a cheap pair of white socks and put some lotion on . Its really the same effect .
 What can I say , these must be a leftover from the cold war.The government must have exported these to China to scare the military.The damn things are not only too tight , the length is also inadequate.They must have struck fear into the poor communist solder not to fool with the big Americans.Can ' t say I would recommend these as the leave indentation marks on my pickle .
 This particular type of condom has an ingredient called benzocane which REALLY numbs your genitals . I found it REALLY difficult to climax after any amount of time . With the extra long time it took , my partner became dry and it was uncomfortable . In fact , if you 're not EXTREMELY excited , it 's very easy to become limp just by putting the stupid thing on . Go with this condom if you 're the type who gets off in under a minute .
 The numbing agent works , yes ; my partner lost all feeling for about an hour . To quote him , `` I could probably hack it off right now and not feel it . '' Obviously , that reduced action to nothing until he regained feeling . The product works well enough to the point where you no longer need a condom ; if you end up with a pack , think about giving it as a gag gift to that macho jock guy at your high school reunion .
 I gave it 2 stars because it does what it says it does , but about as enjoyable as eating a really good steak just after having novocaine injected into your mouth . -LRB- you know it should be great , but your getting no feeling at all -RRB- So if your goal is to brag about how long you can go , then this is the product for you . If you want to have any idea what is going on then look else where . Could not tell if I was in or out , `` at attention '' or limp .
 This thing is ridiculous . After about 1 minute of sex I could n't even tell if it was still in or not . I thought that it was extra small and cut off my blood circulation at first . Trust me , never buy these . I will pitch the other 10 of my 12 pack .
 This version of the Trojan condom was a big loser for us . It numbed too much for pleasure . We could n't feel anything . Throwing the rest away !
 It numbs a lot ! Sex does n't feel as good as using a regular condom . And it breaks easily , it breaks 2 to 3 times even there 's enough lubrication . Luckily , we found out early and my girlfriend 's not pregnant . Thank god ! I 'll never use it again ever .
 After reading the review above , I double checked on the shipping costs , which were over $ 12 !! Which is ridiculous on a $ 20 item . Thanks for the heads up ! -LRB- I cancelled my order -RRB-
 I have original perfume , this one is not not even closed to original smell . I use it but just as something else not Climat .
 These do not stay in the shoes very well unless you commit to the velcro attachment , but then you are stuck only using these for two pairs of flats and have to buy several pairs if you want to keep having supported feet . Also , even with the velcro attachment the insoles do n't stay in place very well : -LRB-
 Very poorly made . Hurt my feet . Would not recommend . Material was of a plastic nature and did not fit in my shoes right .
 My Mom gave me some 3/4 superfeet insoles a few years back and they were awesome . These were not even close to being the same thing . What I received was longer , thinner and less supportive than the 3/4 superfeet I 'd known and loved . These were also more narrow . I do n't have a narrow foot but it 's not crazy wide . My heels come over the edge in these . Tried wearing them for a day and the did n't help at all . In the end they were no better than the cheapo inserts from the grocery store .
 not helpful and expensive for what it is.don ' t waste money on thisThe Super feet flip flop can help .
 I was surprised to find that this arch support is simply hard , molded plastic -- no flexibility or cushion whatsoever . It was n't comfortable , and because the plastic has no grip , it slides around in my shoes . In my opinion , this is not worth the price , I am returning.I 've found that Spenco insoles are a great alternative for half the price .
 I wanted to get a insole to support my flat shoes . it was not what i expected . Its hard plastic insole .
 I have the same complaint as Nortonthedog from 2011 . `` The quick description next to the product photo reads
 The quick description next to the product photo reads
 if you pull the nipple all the way to the sides , out will come a collection of ` things ' from hair to lint to dry milk ... one day while cleaning one of the pacifiers I noticed a piece of hair stuck to the base of the nipple , when I pulled the nipple to the side , the hair still would n't come off , so I pulled it really hard and along with the hair came a string of lint ... I did the same thing to the other 3 pacifiers and it was the same ... since then I kept an eye on these nipples and noticed that even within a few hours of use , it still collected lint and other things ... . I regularly would boil the pacifiers and wash around the base of the nipple , but this is n't enough for these pacifiers ... I am sending these nipples back to the company for my $ $ back ... do n't buy these unless you are willing to constantly keep washing them within a few hours throughout the day ...
 I am troubled that this dietary supplement is being advertised as a treatment for psychological disorders . Any person that needs or would benefit from taking Lithium on a daily basis should have a prescription from a doctor and be monitored with blood tests.This product is not for the treatment of mental disorders as the description claims but instead is a dietary supplement for hypochondriacs . Do not be fooled into thinking this is the same Lithium Bicarbonate that you pickup at the pharmacy .
 We ordered this product to see if it would help my husbands health issues naturally and he did not seem to get any benefit from it . There were no side effects from it , just no benefits either , so we will not be ordering it again in the future , unless his doctor recommends a different type of product .
 I do n't see the big deal in these vitamins . I took them for like a week and I saw no changes in how I felt or my body whatsoever , seriously .
 After the lead in the pencil was used , it was impossible to get new lead to replace it . Returned pencil .
 I thought I had read other reviews that said this product was specially formulated to dissolve easily in liquid -LRB- even water -RRB- and I figured natural flavor would be largely tasteless . I 've tried everything and this stuff is still disgusting ! It does NOT dissolve , no matter now much you blend , shake , let sit , etc. . There will always be clumps . More importantly , you can ALWAYS taste the off-spoiled milk taste of this product . Even in shakes , it makes the shakes extra foamy and is hard to swallow . The ONLY luck I 've had using this is putting it in pancake batter -LRB- beware , as it makes the pancakes burn , as it changes the property of the batter -RRB- . Very disappointing . I feel misled by other users ' product reviews and have no idea what I 'm going to do with the huge tub of this stuff now .
 I purchased these drops after having used Refresh Optive Sensitive -LRB- single use vials -RRB- to recover from LASIK surgery . Unfortunately the preservative in the non-sensitive type did not work out for me , eyes would develop mucus soon after using and blur my vision . Eyes also felt drier and more irritated after using the product than before .
 Thirty years ago my attempt to wear hard contacts ended after months of struggle with my eyes hypersensitive to light and constantly irritated . I was using drops by Allergan , who manufactures these -LRB- not sure if same active ingredient -RRB- and it never occurred to me to suspect the drops as a source of the problem.Yesterday I started on the preservative free individual packets as a run up to Lazik . To my surprise I felt a horribly familiar burning sensation , dryness , and light sensitivity which began after the third use . Without contact lenses.I suspect the effect makes eyes actually drier rather than more moist -- if not careful , someone may think they need * more * drops to relieve the discomfort.Apparently less than 2 % of users get this side effect . I will tell my eye doctor , however . I have switched to a different brand on his approved list with no problems whatever , with a different active ingredient . When I was at the store comparing active ingredients this brand was the only one using it .
 I have no doubt that this product may work well for some people . Unfortunately , I have to echo the negative reviews on here . This product makes my eyes sting , makes them feel sticky , and ultimately worsens my dryness symptoms . I have no problem with other brands such as Blink or Systane - the latter of which works best for me . All eyes are different though , so try to find what works best for you !
 This is just an overpriced version of your drug store house brand , in an ampule that is hard to squeeze . If you are older or have a shakey hand , avoid this product , as some of it will land on your cheek , and you will run through it very quickly.It is a POOR selection for the typical senior with a limited budget who has other other health issues . If you got a sample , you need to understand that your Dr. might recommend the brands on hand , the ones where the sales reps gave his/her office free lunch and samples ! For this product , Quality probably is fine , but it is definitely `` QNS '' - quantity not sufficient !
 this is a perfectly fine water bottle , but I wanted a small baby sized one . This is n't
 This product died my hair red , and not purple , as advertised . I have light brown hair , so if your hair color is similar , stay away from this product , unless you want Ronald McDonald red .
 I was very excited when I first saw this product online and when I received it in the mail . However , my excitement quickly turned to disappointment after using the product . I ordered two boxes and used both on my hair . My hair did NOT look anything like the color shown on the box , it did n't even come close . I would not recommend this hair color if you have dark blonde hair -LRB- one of the recommended hair colors -RRB- as it turns more of a dark red than a nice shade of plum .
 I stopped using them and went back to floss after using it for 6 months and my dentist did not have nice things to say about my gums . -LRB- Run on sentence -RRB- With floss , I am much better
 I use mainly those tips with rubber ends . They get damaged pretty fast and I need to replace them . Unfortunately , Conair only makes the full set of replacement tips . That 's a shame , because I have to discard those tips I do n't use .
 Terrible product . Only lasts for a couple hours . Creates bad body odor . I recommend Polo Blue deodorant instead .
 For some reason , I am not impressed with this product and the smell does n't last , as if it is not real -LRB- authentic -RRB- . I thought about returning it to Amazon , but I was embarrassed to do so and kept it .
 This is my first and last time buying Zegna online . The original product is great and gets a lot of compliments . My bottle does not bare the logo of Zegna on it and the smell is different from what I had before . Just be careful .
 I got the battery and installed it right away but it does not light up the device when I tested it .
 These batteries did not last more than 30 minutes in a red dot , they should have lasted 120 hours . I will not purchase these again .
 I use it to clip some of my kitten hair near the tail area . It did not cut so well even he has short hair . I have to go ove the same spot a few times before it would cut to shorter lenght . I do n't recommend it .
 i recently received the wahl clippers from amazon . started to use them for the first time last week and discovered animal fur on the clipper blades . obviously , the clippers are second-handed . i paid for new clippers , not second handed clippers .
 This highly touted , expensive electric toothbrush was OK while it lasted . Guarantee is for 2 years , & it stops working in the 3rd year . I have had longer lasting disposable electric brushes . Will never buy another one .
 Our family has used the Oral-B power toothbrushes for several years now . The original model lasted a good 3 + years with heavy use . We bought this model as a replacement , but it lasted not much more than a year . It simply stopped working one day . Judging by the moisture that was getting into the LED screen , I suspected that it suffered a short . Thinking that it was just a defective unit , we went out and bought the same model . This time , it came with two of the power toothbrushes . In less than 6 months use , one of the brushes has already died . It suffered the same problem as the first , with moisture getting inside the brush . One would expect a toothbrush to be waterproof . It 's very apparent that these brushes are not . It 's a shame because they do a very effective job of cleaning teeth . I will be looking at alternatives now .
 very excellent design and operation which provides good resultsin cleaning teeth . I am concerned about obtaining replacement brushesfor unit . Would reccomend this to everyone .
 I bought this toothbrush and the battery `` died '' within the warranty period . I took it to the designated repair facility where the toothbrush sat for FIVE WEEKS waiting for repair . After calling Braun , I was told that the toothbrush battery replacement must be `` stuck '' in U.S. Customs . It was very frustrating to get the `` run around '' from Braun . After calling , Braun agreed to send me a refund by check , which arrived yesterday . Of course , the cost of the toothbrush in the meantime has increased . I believe the product is a good product , however , consider yourself warned in case your battery dies , too .
 I got this new Oral B brush after my last one died in Europe -LRB- apparently it was a victim of European voltage differences -RRB- . I was looking for a while and trying to decide between the Oral B and Sonic Care , which my girlfriend had been using for years . I really liked my old Oral B , and had been using it for about 2 years . So when I saw that this new version had come out , and it had a voltage regulator to support voltages around the world , I thought I was set . It was a big disappointment when I first turned it on . It 's got to be one of the loudest toothbrushes out there - sounds like a drill or some other powertool when it 's running . It 's probably 2-3 times louder than my original Oral B . The other problem is that the handle is much thicker and much heavier than the previous model . I have small hands and found it to be cumbersome to hold , not to mention just too heavy . I think the engineers at Oral B went overboard on this model .
 The entire braun pro series DOES NOT OFFER BATTERY REPLACEMENT !!! $ 160 for a toothbrush and you have to throw it out after the battery dies ??? Proctor & Gamble strikes again . Throw it away and buy another one is exactly what braun customer service told me !!! PLEASE CALL BRAUN CS 800-566-5752 ask about battery replacement . this is truly a horrible thing . THrow it away in the landfill after 2 years , with the metal hydride battery -LRB- again in the landfill -RRB- all because P&G ; wants you to buy a new $ 160 toothbrush always instead of a $ 5 battery.DO NOT BUY !!!
 I previously used a Sonicare Elite for several years , on the advice of my dentist . It was wearing out so I wanted to try something new . The reviews for the Oral-B were very good so I bought it . Unfortunately , I was disappointed.I guess I should have realized the Oral-B was a rotating motor type toothbrush , and I was used to the tiny sonic pulses from the Sonicare . BIG DIFFERENCE . With the Oral-B , I felt like my mouth was being drilled upon , and my whole head vibrated . The brush head was very large and cumbersome for me.I ended up going to a local store and buying the Sonicare Flexcare , which is not the cheapest one out there , but returned to the sonic pulses and extremely clean feeling after brushing teeth . No head vibrations ! Smaller brush head with softer bristles , good for sensitive teeth or gums.In defense of the Oral-B , the toothbrush did clean my teeth well . I just did n't like the jarring motion compared to the Sonicare .
 I went online added the item to my cart and when I went to check out I was advised that the price had gone up some $ 10 . This is just rude . I canceled the order and bought it cheaper elsewhere . Would n't recommend them at all .
 1 . It comes packaged so securely as to be nearly impossible to open -LRB- and I should have stopped right there , given how the rest of this experience played out -RRB- .2 . The brush binds up , cuts on and off briefly and unpredictably while brushing . And it does not shut off automatically at the end of the recommended 2-minute brushing period .3 . There 's no way at all to SEE how long you 've been brushing without turning it OFF to look since you can not remove it from your mouth while turned on . There 's a different Oral-B product with a separate timer -LRB- the Oral-B Triumph with SmartGuide Electric Toothbrush -RRB- . But that timer can not be purchased separately .4 . On both low and regular speed this brush shakes my head violently , enough to make me dizzy -LRB- I have to sit down to feel I am brushing safely ... and can watch the clock that way , too , since the brush-based timer is of no use whatever -RRB- .5 . After only 4 uses -LRB- two more than I thought I could stand -RRB- and a consultation with my dentist , it 's back in the original package and replaced with a Phillips Sonicare . More than dismal for a `` $ 139.99 '' toothbrush ! 6 . When I contacted Oral-B -LRB- now Crest , i.e. , Procter and Gamble -RRB- they basically told me to go pound sand - actually what they suggested was since it did n't seem to suit me I should just throw it away , which they based on the production # having been 2 years ago -LRB- as though that had any bearing on its newness -RRB- . In summation , Oral-B may be the recognized leader in toothBRUSHES and know all there is to know about brushes but they do not know the first thing about electronics . I paid for their learning curve . Never again . Too bad NO stars is n't a rating option .
 I paid about 100 dollars for it . I am angry at this toothbrush now , because handle did n't work at all after charging a battery at the beginning after then one month later handle itself ran without an operation until the battery was completely discharged . I could n't stop it . I also tried to remove the battery by the presented instruction . Anyway , I do n't want to buy this product any more , even though it is currently a good reputation .
 I have had my Triumph Professional Care 9000 for less than 2 years -LRB- came with multiple handles -RRB- . This is the second time that one of them stopped working . The first time it broke soon after I purchased and was able to return . Now this time my handle says it 's charging but as soon as I remove it NOTHING !! So , now I have to contact a authorized service provided -- which took a lot of hunting on the web site to find for a phone # , then to only be lead to another web site , with more phone # 's . What happen to customer service?Buyer Beware ... I do love the battery operated toothbrush but you may want to pick another brand .
 The first Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 died after about three months . It showed that the battery was fully charged , but the brush would n't turn on . Then , one night , in the middle of the night the brush just turned on by itself ! There was also a lot of moisture that started building up inside the LCD window - althought I always dried the brush after using it . Since I bought it at Bed , Bath & Beyond they replaced it . The replacement brush died after just 1 month ! It had all the same problems as the first one.Don ' t waste your money .
 This was a great toothbrush while it worked . I 've only had this tooth brush for 4 months and the handle now out of control . It just would n't shut off one day . I finally realized if you put it back in the charger is shuts down . It now wo n't turn back on . I 'm going to try and get a replacement but I do n't have much confidence in the product .
 Amazon sends you a different model from that described in the photo and description . I returned my purchase twice and still received the same incorrect and lesser version . They refunded me 15 % but they really should just be selling the product they advertize , ... not bait and switch ... shame on amazon for that .
 I bought this because a friend recommended it and from searching the web , it seemed like dentists recommend this toothbrush more than the sonicare ones . But after using it for a month or so , I feel like the sonicare was better for my teeth . This brush is pretty rough on your teeth -- it feels like it 's grinding them down when I use it , even though I 'm not really even pressing the brush to my teeth .
 Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power ToothbrushI ordered this item on July 22 , and by August 8 it had stopped holding a charge . It was the weekend , but I tried to contact Oral B anyway . Their customer service was closed . Their web site told me to take it to the nearest service center , but it found none near my zip code . It had no instructions for how to handle warranty issues if there was no service center . On Monday , I called them , delaying the start of my vacation until their service center opened , which was a 9 . We got on the road over an hour late . Speaking with them , I had two choices
 I 'm very disappointed in its longevity -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- . I 'm going to try SonicCare next.Update
 The toothbrush is loud , slow and the round brush head is not as effective as the regular oblong brush . Wish I could return it . The twenty-dollar toothbrush you find in any drugstore is much superior to this brush with bells and whistles and little else ...
 Using this brush made my teeth very sensitive . I figure it erodes the enamel . As you know tooth enamel once lost does not rebuild . I stopped using the toothbrush around a year back , but my teeth are still sensitive . I regret ever buying this brush . In fact I am not going to buy a electric toothbrush ever . Manual brushes are the best .
 This toothbrsh fell way below my expectations ; primarily because it came with no added brushes ; required what seemed to be a simple assembly but proved difficult . Instructions were very poor . I got a wonderful Oral-B , with three additinal brushes , from COSTCO for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- less than this cost . I returned the item to One Stop Shop which shipped the product . To date , this return has not bween reflected on my American WExpress account .
 I am extremely disappointed in the Braun Triumph 9000 . I purchased it on 3/04/2006 and now the battery will not charge . I followed the care instructions and did a discharge every 6 months hoping that the battery would last a little longer , but it still will not charge correctly . I called Braun customer service and explained the problem and was told the handle is no longer good . they said they only last about 5 years . Perhaps Braun should advise the consumer that the unit is going to be disposed of in 5 years . I was offered a $ 10 dollar coupon or a replacement handle that would cost $ 60 . It is very frustrating to have to purchase another handle when the whole unit costs about $ 100 . -LRB- Sam 's club -RRB- I have to really think about purchasing another Braun brush verses another similar product by another manufacturer . Perhaps I will get more than 5 years out of another company .
 I bought this a few weeks ago and tried to use it today on our Bichon Frise mix.Absolutely useless!The DVD shows hair coming off so easily but they do n't really work nearly that well . The DVD was made using a different set of clippers as well.Don ' t waste your money
 This product is a joke . It is a very low quality product . I bought it because of the reviewer who gave it 5 stars . This things shocks the s *** out of you at the lowest setting . It smells like the factory it was manufactured in and is very dangerous . I got my refund . I would n't even give this product a 1 star , its a JOKE !!!
 Extremely watery !! It smells fine but is messy since it has no thickness to it . It did come packaged well .
 i 'm totally disappointed when I get it this morning . first of all , the bottle is not sealed . second , it seems like they just poured some kind of oil in the bottle because since it is not sealed , there is no way for me to know whether it is really grapeseed oil or just some kind of cheap oil . they just hand-wrote the word '' cucumber '' & `` 16 oz '' . I will not recommend anyone to get this product .
 slow to ship it . if you need the battery while you are till alive find another source , this place may not have a stoke or ship once a month .
 First battery did not work , requested another one and they were very good about sending another one right away . However , that one did not work either .
 Totally useless ! It arrived with two cracks running the complete length of the outer hosing.Then it did n't do any of the things it had promised!I was significantly disappointed . Select another product .
 I bought this as a replacement for a Panasonic trimmer I had dropped one too many times . I liked that the Motokata had a vacuum for the loose hair . However , the blades are too far from the tip of the guard so that hair simply does not get cut .
 After reading a number of reviews , I thought that with this trimmer I could do away with the scissors . My experience , though , it that scissors are faster and more efficient . This is the only nose hair trimmer I have tried so I do n't know how it compares to others .
 This is for GAINING weight , so make sure you dont misread or misunderstand what this product says , its not for losing weight .
 I went from soy 95 chocolate from GNC to this . Bleh . There 's a wicked diet soda kind of taste . Nutrisweetish . BLEH ! It came recommended by a guy from work who liked it and to him by a personal trainer who also liked it . It 's got a bunch of stuff in it and whether it 's good for you or not ... who knows . I used different doses and different liquids -LRB- water and milk -RRB- to adjust the flavor . The guy at work uses chocolate milk.I went back to gnc soy 95 and sold the rest to the guy at work .
 I was really hoping to have scored a good deal on these , but unfortunately they do not work . In actuality they make me feel even more anxious . I have tried my fair share of kava kava brands and these are by far not satisfactory . And I seriously have to wonder ... did I get ripped off ? The answer seems to be yes because the usual benefits of even the mildest dosage of kava kava are not present here . Total bummer.Update
 This product actually gave me a panic attack instead of helping my anxiety . I felt worse and had a horrible day for about 12 hours . DO NOT TAKE KAVA .
 The problem with these Kava capsules is that this in not a concentrated extract . The active ingredient , the kavalactones are not in very high quantity based on the recommended serving sizes . I felt NOTHING with 2 capsulesAlso , the genetics behind the Kava root are very , very important . I do n't THINK this is a top strand.The liquid gel caps are superior and you actually feel the effect . The Kalm Down Tonga Kava Powder is fantastic . That will give you the effect you desire .
 I bought this product with the hopes of becoming a bit more relaxed . According to research I had done , including product reviews on this site , this product was the way to go.Unfortunately , the product does absolutely nothing . I 'm not relaxed . If anything , I 'm angry , because the product does n't work . I 'm out $ 8 . Do yourself a favor and keep looking , this ai n't it .
 Did not result in ANY kind relaxation . All it gave me was a really really nasty headache that lasted 24 hours . I felt sick to my stomach . Did not work AT ALL . This stuff is going in the trash can .
 I have purchased this kava product because it 's the cheapest on Amazon . I wasnt expecting much and I received nothing much . I took 4 on an empty stomach with no relaxing effects whatsoever than 9 more on an empty stomach whith NO effects . I 'm not surprised , but even though I did n't expect much I did expect a little from 13 capsules ! If you want good quality kava never buy dietary capsules like these but buy the fresh kava extracts . I always knew this , but i wanted to try them myself , and I sure regret trying . Again , you get what you pay for . I do approve of this compony , because their other products are great . Just never buy dietary pills of kava kava as I said above , because they are usually bad quality and stale usually due to inproper storage atmospheres and age , this goes for all health supplement companys not just this one .
 All I can say is save your money . This stuff is toxic -LRB- they do n't mention that on the web page -RRB- over a two week period . It also does n't really seem to do anything other than kill you and your liver . Why this is sold is beyond me ...
 It did n't work for me , at all . No noticeable effects what so ever . I took 2 on my first day , then 4 the next , then 8 the next . I took 8 for the next few days and still nothing ... If you are looking for a Kava product from which you can actually feel the effects , this is NOT it .
 I could tell nothing with these . I am gon na try 4 instead of 2 tonight , but 2 did zero for me .
 This product does absolutely nothing ! It is just a huge pill that gives you a stomach ache . DO NOT waste your money !
 I bought these to try and help me relax but they did n't work for me . Instead they gave me a nasty headache . The first time I thought it was just a coincidence and I gave the kava another try on a different day but it happened again . I guess it is n't for everyone .
 I bought this product with the intention of getting some benefit from it 's relaxing properties . I took at first two at a time , then four , six eight ... nothing of note happened . I 'm thinking that either the product is complete bogus , or that the chemical properties were altered when it was shipped -LRB- it states to be stored at room temperature , and I have a hard time believing that it was shipped at room temp . -RRB- . Either way , do n't bother with this product .
 I have tried taking the recommended dose of 2 capsules without any results . After doing that for a few days , I tried 4 . I felt slightly tired and one point , and it seemed to cause a slight stomach ache . Did nothing that it claims socially .
 I bought this product two times , from two different vendors on Amazon -LRB- Vitamin Shoppe and House of Nutrition -RRB- , both times hoping to get the Kelp in the photo . Both times I received Kelp with Folic Acid . This is a different product from Solaray and different from what is displayed above.Also , the fine print on the bottle is not shown in the description , but should be . It states : `` This product contains naturally occurring constituents , one or more of which is listed by the State of California as a carcinogen and reproductive toxicant . '' While the listed website does n't state what the toxicant is , it is likely that it is because kelp is often contaminated -LRB- growing near the coasts , where pollution is greatest -RRB- . Mercury is a possible culprit .
 I was taking another fish oil vitamin brand then i changed to vital choice and things went from good to bad
 I purchased this unit as a Christmas present for my father . The battery is charged , the horn works , the brake releases , but the unit is apparently defective and will not budge . Aside from that , the stickers are all curling off either from poor design - they do n't fit well - or a poor adhesive . The box was in fine condition when it arrived so I chalk all these problems up to really bad QA out the door . I will be talking to their tech support ASAP and have to tell my dad he wo n't be getting his present until next year . Hey Invacare QA , have a scroogy Christmas !
 I have not tried this product . I am commenting only to make you aware that there are many 5-star reviews by the same person for this product , who has positively reviewed many other Heritage Products ... in fact , if you look at her reviews , it 's quite possible that she has reviewed EVERY Heritage Product available on Amazon with 5-stars . I can only assume they are directly affiliated with the company . I am against poor business ethics and will not be trying this or any other Heritage Product until her posts are removed .
 I saw the counter post to all the 5-stars and really appreciate pointing that out . After looking at the reviews -LRB- which I normally do anyway -RRB- , I saw the same person spamming the `` SAME '' reviews over and over . Thanks for abusing the system and forcing me to check EVERY product . I 've seen this done before too . Wo n't buy til you get some honest stuff on here !!! Maybe not even THEN !
 I 've had this oil now for a few years and would always mix up small batches with 2 essential oils -LRB- clove bud and tangerine -RRB- . Initially it works fine and everything . A good massage oil.The problem comes later . I 've finally , after a lot of wondering , pinned this smell on the massage oil . Before doing a massage with my partner , we 'd throw down a sheet or something so we would n't get oil all over the bed . After a while the sheet STUNK . Like , just rancid and weird and off and disgusting . Threw the sheet out , used other things , etc. . After a while all of my bedding was destroyed due to residual oils on our skins getting onto the fabric . After a while it would go rancid and cling to the sheets . I would wash and wash and wash and could never get the smell from this oil to come out.It has ruined a lot of bedding for me . Not sure if it 's because the oil is now a bit older -LRB- 3 years though does n't seem like a super long time for a medium sized bottle of oil unless you massage for a living or something -RRB- or if it 's just screwed up.Cannot recommend . Also , what is up with all the spam reviews ? Those did not come from customers , they 're too spinny . I was going to rate 2 stars , but the fake reviews piss me off and so it gets 1 star . And really , if you ca n't let it come in contact with your sheets without ruining them , you ca n't really use it anyhow . Why take the chance ?
 It was difficult to determine from the internet whether this charger was the right charger because model names and numbers of the shavers were not given , just the model number for the charger . It was the wrong charger . I threw it away rather than hassle with a return . Chargers should be easier to purchase over the internet . When purchasing a charger , be careful .
 Had to throw these out . Too much side effect . Aches , sleeplessness , stomach pain and no weight loss .
 I purchase what I thought would be the whole herb Balm of Gilead , to my surpise I received fifty capsule in a baggie with a stick on lable that said Balm of Gilead . Wow do I feel cheated . I spoke with the seller who was nice but did not seem to know how Amazon Market Place operates she state that I could have chose the herb I explained capsules where not mentioned at all in the advertisement , not to argue , I request a refund . from the time I place my order and received it has been about a week now I 'm wondering how long will it take to get my money back -LRB- since I live in the same state -RRB- so that I can buy what I paid for . the advertisment also stated 2.1 oz well I 'll be lucky it it 1/2 oz i 'll be more careful next . I work to hard for my money to be cheat . P.S. . How do I know what in those capsule since it not factory sealed . a baggie for real !!!!!!!!!!!! It ok to give to your family and friend in baggie but when you are paying top dollar a baggie just dont work for the general public . Ms. Galloway .
 Upon receiving this supplement from Vitasprings I noticed that the external safety seal had been broken and there was no internal safety seal . Vitasprings said that the only way they could send a replacement is if I would pay the postage to have the damaged or tampered bottle sent back to the company . Since there is a chance that this product had been tampered with , I told the company that I felt a responsibility to dispose of the product . Heck , for all I knew the product that was sent to me had previously been returned by someone else . Who knows what may have been done to it . Destroying the product was the only responsible thing I could do.They still refused to send a replacement without me paying to have the damaged/tampered product sent back to Vitasprings . That is their right and I understand their position but I also feel an obligation to notify the public of the chances they take when dealing with this company.My recommendation is to find another suppler for your vitamin & supplement purchases . One that wo n't put a bottle of supplements in a box to ship to a customer that has obviously been opened before.This is not a review of the product itself but of the supplier , Vitasprings .
 I recently purchased this shaver and I am less than thrilled . The double sided trimmer blades make it VERY hard to shave without hacking away the hair you are n't intending to shave . It works somewhat okay wet , though it takes a long time to get very good results . Dry , forget it . I must have gone over the same spot fifteen times and with very very little noticable hair shaving.So , save your money and look into another brand . Preferrably one with only one trimmer blade .
 I like the Jeanie Rub massager but these accessories are flimsy and poorly designed . They fit poorly and worst of all , create a loud annoying rattling sound when the massager is used , especially at higher speeds . I returned this item . A note to those considering ordering from Pro Therapy Supplies
 I have used this product in the past and was very pleased with it , but this particular one that I received is in defective packaging . It is in a spray bottle , but the sprayer wo n't spray , so I ca n't use it for what I wanted . Very disappointed .
 The label on this says `` no alcohol , synthetic dyes , artificial flavors or preservatives . '' Sounds good and natural , right ? WRONG ! Imagine my surprise when the ingredient list includes polysorbate 80 , an emulsifier that has been shown to be hazardous on skin contact , inhalation and ingestion . Further , it 's been shown to cause sterility in rats when injected . I was really excited about trying this product , but I can not recommend it under these circumstances . I 'd rather have a brand that you have to shake before using than something that uses chemicals to keep the solution uniform .
 The chair is designed for extremely short people . The cushion has the wrong `` folds '' to fit the chair . And the manual has some amusing , but not very helpful phrases like
 I bought this at the beginning of my third trimester I do n't know if it 's a combo of the third trimester uncomforts or just the sling but my baby hated it . It seemed like he was being smashed or something .
 This is a harness of another sort . You have to put it over your head and hope for the best . The adjustable is by far a better option .
 I was very excited to try this product . This is my second pregnancy , and my first daughter weighed 10 lbs 6 ozs , and I am not a very big woman . This pregnancy has been rough , my body seems to be worn out , and to beat it all , I work at a hospital and am on my feet for 12-13 hours a day . I thought the cradle would help , but it is just a jumble of elastic . It does not support like it claims and I did not even notice ANY difference in having it on . AND , you can see it under your top , I wore mine with my scrub tops and I peeped out of the shoulder area and all day people asked what it was . Not cool :--LRB- Buyer beware ... save your money !!!
 I was suffering with severe groin pain during my pregnancy , so I purchased this belt hoping to find relief . I found this belt to be very uncomfortable . The elastic is so rough , it irritated me all day . Also the straps that go over your shoulders come up so high you are very limited on shirt options without the bands showing . Also , I had seen that it runs small and to order asize up , so I did . The band still cut into my lower ribs around my waist . By the end of the day I could n't wait to take it off ! I wore it once , then found a different support band and am much more comfortable now .
 We had great hopes for this -- because my wife 's belly was hurting toward the end of the day . We waited anxiously for the mail delivery and kicked ourselves for not shipping it overnight.Upon trying it out , the belt was too tight to be comfortable sitting -LRB- even though my wife was in the lower end of the weight range for the size she ordered -RRB- . This presented the problem -- when going out shopping , do you wear it or not ?? It ca n't be easily removed . so we ended up not using it , and wish we never had purchased it . It helped somewhat when standing -- if that is all you do all day . But for the average person , there must be a better designed belt .
 I very much looked forward to the support of this cradle during my twin pregnancy . They do n't seem to be sized for petite women ; rather taller women with long torsos . I tried two different sizes and neither fit appropriately for me . Both fit well through the shoulders but were baggy through the middle , thus not supportive , even in late term . Alas , I returned the cradle for a full refund .
 The mini cradle is MUCH better - you can adjust the strap that goes around your waist/underbelly . This one is the size it is - mine is too loose and does very littls good . : - -LRB-
 I bought this thinking it will help with my back , but it 's very uncomfortable to wear , especially during the summer time .
 A few other reviews mentioned that the height fit them , but the waist did not -LRB- or the other way around -RRB- . I was hoping it would n't be this way for me since most of the reviews were positive , but it was - height was perfect , but the waist was too tight . Oh well . I was already 7 months along when I began using it , so maybe it would have helped more if I had started using it from earlier in the pregnancy ? It aggravated the pain I was trying to alleviate , so I ended up returning it and using a velcro adjustable one .
 Although the idea is good , the prenatal cradle has to be modified in many aspects : This product was not made thinking about fashionable and practical pregnant women.If you live in a hot weather , clothing is light and does not cover all your body , therefore , the prenatal cradle will show up either from one side or the other !!!!!!! -LRB- specially if you are proud of your new body and use low rise pants or short t-shirts -RRB- it also can be seen through your clothing because the cradle is white and made of a thick material . It is one added worry , every time I have to dress up for work , workout or just going out , I have to spend a long time thinking how to cover it . I am dissapointed about this product , it makes me feel frustrated .
 I bought this thinking I would get an easy close shave . That 's not the case.Pros : - Nice Design.-Nice Idea.-No redness or unsightly red bumps after use.Cons : - The charger is poorly designed-The battery life indicator is never accurate . It 'll go from orange to red in 2 seconds after charging to full , but run on the red setting for a long time.-Too much work and a learning curve to actually shave.-Only gives you a close shave half of the time.-Pop-up bikini trimmer does n't work.So in short save your money and buy a better electric shaver .
 i 'm warning everyone , keep your money . it takes too much time to get a shave that is n't close enough . ideally a product should make things easier and better.signed , still using a razor , and out $ 50 . panasonic , go back to the drawing table .
 This is the third Panasonic eletric razor I 've owned . The 1st one broke when I put it in my checked luggage on a 2 hr flight . It got a little shook up I suppose and no longer would charge . The second one I had worked for about a month , and after being charged twice , would no longer hold a charge . The third one I bought just died yesterday . Had it about 3 months , charged it for the second time , and it 's no longer holding a charge . I 've owned other brands of razors and never had a problem with them holding charges , so I 've wasted enough money on these Panasonics .
 The charger is cumbersome and does n't seem to actually charge the razor most times . Many times I set it down securely in the charger and find out the next day it has completely discharged.The popup trimmer keeps ` catching ' the skin and cutting me.The battery life indicator seems as flighty as the weather . One minute it says it is full , the next it claims it needs to be charged.The form of the pivot is nice , but that 's the only plus to this razor . I 'd suggest staying far away from this one .
 I owned this Panasonic shaver for one and half year . Since I 'm very blessed to not have as much hair in my legs , I 've been very seldom using this shaver . Nevertheless , I 've always annoyed with its charger because it takes more than 8-hours of charging . Finally , after one and half year , this shaver has to retired . I do n't really know what went wrong with it , but then it wo n't hold any charge anymore . I only took it on a trip once and it has n't been charging properly ever since .
 For anyone who is informed enough about B-12 to actually order Methylcobalamin in particular -LRB- good job by the way - it 's the active form of B-12 , better quality , and more expensive -RRB- , you really need to know that this is NOT methylcobalamin . Like me , you might be swayed by those gigantic block letters that read `` METHYLCOBALAMIN B-12 5000 '' on the front of the bottle into thinking that this is , well ... Methylcobalamin B-12 5000 . The truth is , it contains perhaps a trace of Methyl-B12 but it is mainly just good old Cyanocobalamin - the cheap , inactive , synthetic B-12 . See , what the Amazon description and images do not tell you -LRB- as of this post -RRB- is what the back of the bottle says : Vitamin B-12 ------------- 5000 mcg * -LRB- as cyanocobalamin , methylcobalamin -RRB- Notice the order of those ingredients on the back label , and also take note that the word cyanocobalamin does not appear on the front of the bottle whatsoever . This is very deceptive and I had to waste my time sending these back.Unless you do n't mind paying for Methyl-B12 but receiving cheap Cyano-B12 , steer clear of this product .
 I used this product twice daily for two months and was still deficient in serum B-12 as confirmed by blood test . I am unconvinced any oral B-12 can work for my serious nutritional deficiency . I will stick to injections . I do wish it had worked .
 This looked bigger in the picture , and it 's only about the size of a keychain , which is hardly worth anything , especially because it runs off those tiny and hard to find watch batteries , so not much power there . Realize how small it is before you buy it . I was highly disappointed .
 this product did n't come sealed , I thought it was the law to seal all drug bottles including supplements . I tired a little of it -LRB- even though I should n't have , but I could n't even drink it because it was so sour tasting . If I die it 's because this product poisoned me . I 'm not happy at all . can not even use it because I 'm too scared to . what a waste of money .
 This product has stevia in it . It is way too sweet . I would prefer to sweeten to taste , but here you have no choice . Yuck .
 The print on this diaper is completly adorable ! However , the diaper itself feels cheap and is n't very adjustable . It also does n't feel much like an AIO .
 I bought a couple of these diapers after reading positive reviews on Amazon , and thinking that All-In-One is a better and more convinient option then cloth diapers with inserts . -LRB- We have twins , so dealing with inserts did not appeal to us :--RRB- -RRB- However , after trying it for a few times , I have to report that it does not hold moisture as well as Bum Genius diaper with inserts . This one looks attractive , and it is easy to put it on , but it does not hold moisture beyond 3 hours of wear -LRB- for 8-mth-old boys -RRB- . That means we could not use it overnight , while Bum Genious diaper worked just fine overnight . Also , after just 3 hours , it was soaking wet inside and my boys had a bit of rash from it . It starts to leak on the sides too . There are more absorbent AIO diapers out there and at a lower price . This one is $ 20 , and Bum Genius is $ 16 . I have not tried the other ones , but this one does not seem to compete as well with Bum Genius .
 When I bought these diapers I was new to cloth diapering . I have had these diapers for about 9 months . At first I really loved them . They seemed really absorbent and seemed very soft when we first got them . I had looked at an organic one size AIO but thought these would be better because the fleece was so soft . Also these were a couple dollars more a peice -LRB- though , at pinstripes and polkadots they give you a discount -- the more you buy the more you save -RRB- . It was very important to me to have a one size and an all in one diaper as this seemed the most economical to me.I read the reviews and most people seemed to like these . I did read one review that said these diapers stink , which I did n't understand . I thought as long as you washed them the correct way it would be fine . So , unfortunately , I put all my eggs into one basket and ordered 15 of these diapers . And like I said they were good at first . But then they started to stink , which I thought was fine , I could simply strip them and get rid of the smell . No such luck . Every time I strip them , the shorter the time in between stripping them gets . And it is SUCH a pain to do this.Lately I have been talking to more and more people about why my diapers stink so much . Apparently , the thing that drew me to the diapers the most -- the microfiber -- is the thing that does these in the most . For some reason because this is a synthetic material it holds on to bacteria and the fact that the pads in it are so thick -LRB- and absorbent -RRB- it traps the bacteria between all the layers of fleece and microfiber . They stink and do not wash clean!Also , if you want that softness of the fleece up against your babies bottom , I understand . This helps to wick away the wetness so babies do n't get rashes . I have two points about the fleece -- if you want it for softness , after you wash them a million times -LRB- as you have to with diapers -RRB- the fleece really wo n't be any softer than the organic material in the other diapers . And in fact the organic material gets SOFTER with washes . The other point is that if you want it there to wick away the moisture from baby 's bottom , you can buy liners or even just purchase some fleece at the fabric store and cut it to shape into baby 's diaper.I do n't usually write reviews -- but I rely upon them so much . If you want a one size AIO diaper go for the bG Organic instead . I totally wish I would have bought these before spending over 300 dollars on these diapers . Do n't get stuck with stinky diapers like I am !
 I bought 4 of these diapers thinking the MF would keep my heavy wetter dry at night . Well they do that , but they also leak badly out the legs and the waistband on my 3 mo. old son . I tried adding bulk under the sewn-in insert , but it did n't help . Customer service never responded to my request for suggestions on the leakage . I regret my purchases and will not buy diapers from Mommy 's Touch again . There may be something I could 've done to fix the leaking for all I know , but we will never know because customer service was completely unresponsive .
 If you have post-herpetic pain from shingles , like me , you will probably try anything . This product did not help me at all and irritated my skin . Web Vitamins does not accept the return of opened products . Knowing the pain and itching , I would not dissuade anyone from trying anything and from the reviews , this product has helped some people . I would , however , try to find a vendor that will accept a return if the product does not help you . The good news is , fortunately , with time , the pain and itching is getting better . Also , a very simple moisturizing cream did help me .
 I read the reviews before purchasing this . I saw that some got relief and some did not . But , I was in such pain , I was willing to try anything.This product did nothing for me . It was n't even as soothing as the lavender oil I had been using . ` Makes me wonder if the people who wrote the positive reviews do n't have something to gain from the sale of this product . It 's unfortunate ... but anyone can write a review.I used the entire 1.4 ounce container in four days . The only relief it provided was the coolness during application . I 'm sure the aloe was somewhat beneficial . Save your money . Buy some lavender oil and some ranunculus bulbosus , which is a homeopathic remedy for shingles.If you 're reading this , you 're probably experiencing a lot of pain from shingles . This product does NOTHING to relieve the pain !
 Peaceful Mountain Shinglederm Rescue , 1.4-Ounce Packages -LRB- Pack of 2 -RRB- I contracted shingles early in July of 2011 . When i saw this product , I felt very hopeful that it would help my PHN . I waited almost two weeks to receive it and was very disappointed with the results . It did n't help at all . Also it 's a very small amount and did n't last very long . Save your money ! Get a prescription from your doctor for a med that will really help .
 I was very disappointed with this product , especially because of the price . It did nothing for the pain for me . I would not recommend this product to anyone seeking relief for pain caused by shingles .
 I was very excited at the prospect of trying this product , based on the advertising for it . I have tried just about everything on the market with little or no success for the itching I haveassociated with the shingles virus . Unfortunately , this product did absolutely nothing to relieveitching . At $ 20.00 a bottle , it was a great disappointment !!!
 The product was of no value in releaving my PHN.But , as an after thought , nothing else has helped . For those looking for releaf from PHN I can only suggest spending their money on something else.Jerry Yoder
 Used it late in the course of my shingles outbreak , after blistering and scabbing . Temporarily relieved some pain but did nothing else to hasten the recovery -- Aspercream has the same effect and is much cheaper , not as greasy and has no odor like this product .
 I have to say that we never actually used this product . I opened up the bottle and was almost sick from the smell . When my son go home from school , I handed him the bottle and did n't say a thing . He went to take one and told me no thanks , no way !
 They taste bad and are hard to swallow . Smell just like hay in the barn . But if they bring up my value at the doctor , they maybe worth it .
 I ordered Vitamin WITH LYCOPENE , but you send me other formula . What happened ? You MUST SEND some one I ordered .
 First of all , I had no idea it was going to be so small and cheaply made . After trying it once , it broke , poof , just like that . No one can figure out how in the world it 's not working , the metal inside looks in perfect condition , the batteries are new . Oh well , we 've trashed it and will definitely not get the same thing again .
 i 'm totally disappointed when I get it this morning . first of all , the bottle is not sealed . second , it seems like they just poured some kind of oil in the bottle because since it is not sealed , there is no way for me to know whether it is really grapeseed oil or just some kind of cheap oil . they just hand-wrote the word '' cucumber '' & `` 16 oz '' . I will not recommend anyone to get this product .
 As I am travelling frequently worldwide , I always favor liquids of 1oz and less which are more convenient.This item has a drawback that may seem of no importance at first but is an issue in every day use . This lens cleaner has NO plastic top that prevents the spray from functioning when , for instance , being squeezed in your toiletry case or in a pocketIt is easy for something to lean on the top , emptying the bottleOne can only wonder about how many pennies are saved by dispensing with the necessary capI would not buy this product again
 Extremely watery !! It smells fine but is messy since it has no thickness to it . It did come packaged well .
 Very disappointed in this product . The ` power ' in the name of this product refers to what ?
 The hoses are very stiff , making it difficult use . Wife found it painful with the slightest suction . Looks much more enjoyable than it turned out to be
 I wanted to give this Item a zero star rating but was n't allowed to do so . I was searching for an item to enlarge my breast and the search engine showed me this product . The product is called Women 's Dual Exerciser Breast Enhancement Pump so I thought it would enhance my boobs ; i was soo wrong . When I recieved the product there was a woman with her breast exposed on the side of the package as well as sexual statements written all over the box . I did n't know it was made by Doc Johnson ; if i known that I would have never brought this product in the first place . If your 're buying this product for sexual satisfaction or for breast enlargement and your breast cup size is an AA/A then this is NOT the product for you . I was warned before buying this product from another unsatisfied buyer and did n't listen ; do not be like me . This product is made up of a very , very hard plastic ; mines snaped and broke before I had the chance to even use it that 's how hard it is . For the last time ... the happy customer is someone who does n't mind hard / tough products on their body , use suction for sexual satisfaction , and whos breast are at least a full B cup and above . Good Luck !!!
 If you take big pills -LRB- ie ... Fish oil -RRB- this is not for you . I have taken prenatal pills , on several occasions -LRB- I have three children , lost three others -RRB- I have no idea how you could fit anything else in this if those are what you are taking ! The two end compartments are bigger , but still not enough to hold my pills ... 2 fish oil , two multi vit , 1 B complex and then the room is full and that is only the two end sections that are bigger . I still have 10 pills more to go ! It will work for keeping some of my kids vitamins and perhaps a few pills to throw in my bag for work in case a shift goes long and I wo n't be home -LRB- that happens a lot with me -RRB- but for everyday ... nah . At least I did n't blow a lot of $ $ $ on it .
 Lost my Apothecary 7-sided pill organizers on vacation . Bought this turtle thing as a replacement . Very disappointed . Difficult to open & close . Ca n't open all the little compartments at once to see the whole week at a glance like I can with other 7 compartment pill boxes . Also this one will not stand on end in the medicine cabinet like the Apothecary 7 sided pill box . The turtle ca n't compare to the 7 sided Apothecary pill organizers for quality , convenience & ease of use .
 I like this pill planner mainly for it 's shape . It 's small enough that I can just stick it in my purse . Unfortunately , it 's kind of cheaply made . When you lift one of the tabs , it will only open up a little bit for you . You ca n't force it open any further because the tab will just break off , which is what happened to me . The plastic `` hinge '' of the tab is just a stiff piece of plastic . It is not very pliable . So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get , or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off . I would have otherwise been happy with the product .
 I bought this for the compact shape , and my pills do fit , but not all of the compartments close snugly . One of the larger end compartments -LRB- Th -RRB- , wo n't latch shut . Some of the other latches seem a bit questionable , too . Just does n't seem well made .
 I have been happily taking this multi-vitamin and mineral supplement because it gave me the energy boost that I badly needed.To be honest , I purchased this product because of the positive reviews and never paid attention to the Daily Value -LRB- DV -RRB- of its content once I received it.Shame on me for not reading the label because it clearly shows the Daily Values are well over the Recommended Daily Allowance . I have been aware of the dangers of overdosing on some vitamins but without knowing the consequences . Research revealed some very important facts.Let me show you a couple of examples.Vitamin A
 I bought a small bottle of Source of Life Liquid to give it a try before buying online . I want a liquid version as the pills are difficult for me to swallow and the chewables are not good for the teeth -LRB- gummies in particular -RRB- . As mentioned in other reviews , it is a dark green , thick liquid -LRB- like Maalox -RRB- and the smell is very strong . It does remind me of a bottle of chewable vitamins though and it tasted like I would imagine a liquid version of the Flintstones vitamins would taste if ground up with a tiny droplet of water -LRB- tart -RRB- . That being said , it is a very strong flavor and the biggest issue I have with it , is the flavor stuck around in my mouth even after drinking water . I kept burping the flavor up too , even 30 minutes after consumption . I do n't want to keep tasting it over and over . :P It also did n't sit well on my stomach . I have issues with indigestion and the citric acid/vitamin c feel like it 's burning a bit in my stomach . Until I find a better replacement , I think I 'll be resorting back to chewables .
 We purchased 2 bottles . One was GREAT ; we like the product very much . 2nd bottle had the seal opened . We tried to exchange it with seller ... not happening . We tried the manufacture , Nature 's Plus . While they have been nice to communicate with -LRB- unlike the seller -RRB- we still have n't been able to exchange the bottle for an unopened one . 4 months and counting . So if the bottle shows up undamaged it 's a great product , otherwise their guarantee is not worth much . Sadly .
 I just purchased a bottle of this today . I went straight home and took the prescribed 2 tablespoons . I have been feeling totally nauseous ever since . My stomach is burning and gurgling . I 'm worried I am going to get diarrhea !! YUCK ! It tastes HORRID . I do n't know if I dare to try it again . Seriously , it is sitting like a rock in my stomach . Blah.Okay , it 's the next day . Today I took half a dose and mixed it with grape juice . It was much better that way . We 'll see how it goes .
 I bought this liquid vitamin for my teenage son who is recovering from jaw surgery and can ingest only liquids for six weeks . When he got a whiff of the contents of this bottle , he almost gagged . -LRB- Not a good thing with a wired jaw ! -RRB- I told him he was overreacting , so I demonstrated how palatable it would be by taking a taste ... I almost gagged ! The product write up talks about the `` tasty '' liquid . No way ! This is nasty stuff ! Might be good for you , but first you have to screw up the courage to drink it ! No thanks !!
 Could not find the advantage of drinking this sluge that taste so bad . It is evidentally healthy but at a price getting it to your stomach .
 This could potentially be a very good vitamin however I could not stand the taste ! It literally tasted like I popped a regular multi-vitamin pill in my mouth and chewed it up ! Add to that the thick green appearance and I simply could not take it ! My husband tried to take it because he did n't want to waste the money however he quickly found that no amount of money could get him to take this stuff ! STAY AWAY ! Buy Centrum Liquid vitamins instead -- still a little gross tasting -LRB- but honestly what vitamin is n't ? -RRB- but at least its palatable and 1/3 of the price !
 I do not like this product at all . If you have any moisture on or near you eye , it washes off making a big black mess .
 Pros
 Used twice and when I went to use for the third time , it did n't work . I heard something rattling inside.It 's also not as powerful as a Wahl .
 I started using this on May 1st . The first week it worked almost as well asNature 's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus , 100 Capsules -LRB- Pack of 4 -RRB- but after the first week , I noticed that both my dogs ' stool became a bit softer than usual . Another two or three days later , my Doberman started to have stool like `` cow pies '' so I switched her back toNature 's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus , 100 Capsules -LRB- Pack of 4 -RRB- and in a day , her stool went back to being `` normal '' again . Then my other dog started to have diarrhea -LRB- she has EPI AND IBS -RRB- and I had to give her antibiotics ANDNature 's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus , 100 Capsules -LRB- Pack of 4 -RRB- . Once both of their stools went back to `` normal '' for a week and a half , I tried this product again -LRB- since I 've got five pounds of it -RRB- and this time in a day , they both had `` cow pie '' kind of stools . Now I 'm `` abandoning '' this product altogether and getting more ofNature 's Bounty Probiotic Acidophilus , 100 Capsules -LRB- Pack of 4 -RRB- . End of story .
 While pro and pre biotics are essential for horses this one has as the second ingredient an aluminum product . Would advise finding one that does not contain this such as Animed Anigest .
 Switched from Fortiflora to this , thinking it 'd be better as it said it had more probiotic cultures , but all it did was make my cats incredibly uncomfortable and made them have a lot of trouble ` going . ' I followed the directions exactly , but I wo n't ever use this product again . Their bm 's were improving to normal on Fortiflora and it 's a shame because this ProBios is so much less expensive , but both of them were meowing loudly , returning to the litter box over and over without being able to eliminate , and laying around with no energy following consuming this stuff . Oh well . Back to Fortiflora it is .
 The Lemon Fantastik I received was not as pictured and did not work as well . The contents left a residue on my bathtub .
 the wraps would not stay straight , constanly rolling , flimsy feeling , stretched so out of place they lost its look , wo n't order again .
 I purchased the Body Wrap Elastic Bandages after receiving a mineral body wrap at a local spa . I figured I could duplicate the treatment at home , not knowing that I would be so frustrated with trying to purchase the supplies necessary for the treatment . The bandages that I ordered were so narrow and flimsy ... they rolled every time I attempted to wrap them . I was very disappointed with the width of these bandages and would like a full refund !!!
 Save your money !! Not only is this messy and time consuming , it does n't work .
 The smell when you open the tub is awesome ... so if you want the best smelling protein this is for you ... now the taste is another matter altogether . I did n't know until I purchased this that it contains no sweeteners at all , at least I do n't see any on the label list/nutrition info , so maybe that is why it has a flat taste . I do n't mind artificial or natural sweeteners in my protein in the name of flavor but this was lacking and had to add my own sweetener to the shake just to tolerate it . If you really like banana flavor I 'd have to recommend theMyofusion Banana Perfection - 5 lb - Powderinstead as it actually tasted of banana and was sweet . So kind of a waste of money as I did not enjoy it but i will finish it just to not let it go to waste but I wo n't purchase another tub of Dymatize unless it 's theDymatize Nutrition Elite12-hour Protein Powder , Blueberry Muffin , 4.4-Pound Tubwhich I do enjoy and contains sucralose , so I do n't see why there is n't any sweetener in this product .
 long time left over product , test was very bad , i bought the same product from vitamin shop and it was much better test and fresh . i m so unhappy for this seller . they must not rip off customer . hope they will do better .
 Shipping was quick arrived before the estimated date.Followed the directions added 1 level scoop to 5-6 ounces of water , turned on the blender , when it was done lifted up the lid and WOW what a smell . This stuff stinks . The smell was so overpowering I could n't drink the shake . I was fighting to keep vomit down .
 Dymatize claim that they have enzymes that make this product easy to digest for people with lactose intolerance . Unfortunately , I did not find this to be the case . I might as well have drank an entire regular milkshake , that 's how sick it made me . If you 're lactose intolerant , I would recommend you try NATURE 'S BEST , ISOPURE CHOC -LRB- LOW CARB -RRB- 3LB instead . I 've been drinking it every day and it gives me absolutely no stomach issues . Not sure if all of the Isopure products are lactose free , but the low carb chocolate one definitely is .
 The taste of the `` gourmet vanilla '' was too extremely offensive for me not to write this review and warn others . I am not someone who is new to artificial sweeteners.I hate to be so proud but I consume the likes of equal , splenda , sweet-n-low etc daily because I avoid sugar at all costs . However , even with my accustomed taste-buds I have a difficult time drinking the very bitter gourmet vanilla . The powder mixes well , so maybe other flavors are ok , but avoid vanilla .
 Reviews were good , but to me this was more of a malted flavor than a regular chocolate and was not at all what I was looking for .
 I was looking so forward to trying the chocolate mint flavour . Unfortunately , it does n't taste very good . The taste is not very strong and very artificial tasting . A true dissapointment from dymatize who are known for having some of the greatest tasting proteins around .
 When buying whey there are two notable criteria to be mindful of
 I found the flavor of this product to be so off-putting that I did n't want to use it . Even when you open the lid , the smell of the dry powder is awful . However , my mother liked it better than the protein powder she was using , so I gave it to her . It could be just a matter of individual taste .
 I 've been a loyal user of the Dymatize Iso 100 . The Elite was a better bargain , so I decided to give it a try . I ordered the Gourmet Vanilla and was shocked how awful this stuff tastes ! The frist few days I had to drink it with my nose squeezed shut just to get it down . I had to go out and buy some low sugar chocolate syrup to add just to make it somewhat tolerable ! I ca n't wait until I finish the 5 pounds so that I can go back to the Iso 100 . Seriously , this may be the worst tasting supplement I 've ever tried .
 I bought this product thinking it would be a decent protein . I was highly dissapointed . It has a very bad taste and unless you are using a blender -LRB- I use a blender bottle -RRB- it is very hard to get the protein to break down and not be chunky . Spend your money on gold standard or syntha 6 . Just as good of proteins with a much better taste and blendabilty .
 Purchased the butter toffee flavor to try something different after a few glasses it got to the point I was almost gagging due to the horrible aftertaste . Not recommended .
 This product taste terrible . There is a lot better ones on the market . The fine print in the back says whey isolate/concentrate .
 after buying the taste makes it almost undrinkable I have been drinking whey protein for years and tried several brands . this is by far the worst tasting crap I have ever consumed !
 I 've had elite whey before , but this is definitely not as tasty as the cafe mocha flavor . : -LRB-
 I 've used this protein for years and just ran out of it . Since I have moved across the country and have n't had time to go look for a GNC/gym that may carry it so I went with Amazon . When it arrived , the first thing that raised a red flag was that the container did not have an expiration date on it ... Second , when I took the top of , the protective seal was completely different than the one I 've always seen in the past , third , when I actually looked inside , the smell and texture were both nothing like what I have seen . Last , and definitely not least , I thought I 'd give it a try anyway and mixed it up after my work out . BAD idea . It tasted HORRIBLE and I was worried that it may not have been protein powder at all . When I called customer service , they acted surprised and said that they purchase these straight from the source/company . hahaha what a joke . Thankfully they are letting me return it , no hassle , but honestly , I think they were hoping that a new customer was buying this in hopes that they could get away with filling it with who knows what . I will never buy ANYTHING from this company again .
 HI EVERYONE I USUALLY GET OPTIMUM WHEY CHOCOLATE IT 'S NOT THE BEST TASTING BUT MANAGEABLE.I TRIED THE ELITE FROM DYMATIZE THE TASTE IS SO HORRIBLE I GOT IT IN CHOCOLATE FLAVOR . MY WIFE TRIED IT ALSO WHICH MADE HER NAUSEOUS . I WENT TO GNC THE LADY TOLD ME PROTEIN DRINK ITS CALLED SEI MAX PROTEIN IN CHOCOLATE ITS SO DELICIOUS ITS ALSO LOW IN CAL AND FAT AND SHE SAID MIX IT WITH ALMOND MILK-COCUNUT YOU CAN GET IT IN WHOLE FOODS ITS LOW FAT ALSO NO SUGAR IN IT.OMG THE TASTE IS SO YUMMY LIKE YOU DRINKING CHOCOLATE MILK I SWEAR THIS WAS REALLY GOOD TASTE FOR A PROTEIN.BUT LIKE I SAID BEFORE OPTIMUM WHEY IS GOOD PROTEIN BUT TASTE IS OK ...
 I bought the Chocolate Mint and the Butter Cream Toffee to use and they could n't be more different . The chocolate mixes effortlessly and tastes delicious , while the Toffee forms clumps and tastes horrible . Another problem I have with the toffee is when mixing in a shaker cup , a thick foam head forms that is gross.As for the results , both products deliver a great blend of Whey and essential BCAA 's . I use it for a post-workout shake and it works well.Definitely will be buying again , but not the Butter Cream Toffee .
 I placed my order on July 20 , 2011 , and I have not heard back from them . I am still waiting for the product . I will never buy from DAB Unlimited again . They should not be a partner with Amazon !!
 I never received this item yet , so it is hard to say how well it works as their other products by dymatize seem good , so hope once we get this new review will be good . Curious Dynmatize does not list them as a supplier or a least that is what they told me when I contact their customer service and apparently they do not care enough to respond to this review which I would be more then happy to redo if I got product for our weight lifting work outs instead have to drive to next town for product apparently as were out almost now .
 The item was suppose to be deliver on the 6th of October and by the 12th I had to contact the seller for then to be told , oops , there was a problem in the wherehouse and we dont have it available ! Thanks for the waist of time !!!
 i make an order for this item on 6th of september with 2 days shipping , till this comment made i did not receive my package yet , and there nor respond from the seller !
 For the last couple years I have been primarily sticking to ON brand proteins . That is the basis for my comparison when I say this tastes very gritty in a shaker cup , and is only slightly better when mixed with a hand blender . Now for the fact that this particular flavor -LRB- cafe mocha -RRB- really tastes like garbage . I 'm actually kind of impressed that they captured the essence of garbage so well that I kind of want to raid the cats litter box to get the taste out of my mouth.I did do my research before I purchased this product . I looked here as well as many other websites , and saw mostly favorable reviews for this . If you look at bodybuilding.com they actually have people rate the taste of products on a 1-10 scale and this was receiving mostly 9s and 10s . Maybe I got a bad batch , but I will never buy this particular product again .
 I opend the box and inserted brand new batteries . It DID NOT WORK ! -LRB- No power or even a light -RRB- . I have tried different batteries from other devices that I know work and it still did not power on ... AND NO , not USER ERROR ! I will be sending this back for a refund.I 'm only giving this a 1 star rating as this opinion survey does not allow you to not post your review without selecting a star rating . I would not even give this a 1 star if I had the option.What a shame !
 While this toy was working , it was GREAT ! However , it did n't last very long - started having to be held in a certain position . Then stopped working . I spliced the wires and it worked a while longer , but I got less than 6 months out of this .
 This product was very faulty ... It started out great but within a day or two the impulse was very slow and even with new batteries stopped vibrating all together .
 This item arrived dead ! There was no damage to the box , this item just did n't work . And Amazon does n't allow exchanges for this item . I called the manufacturer and they told me to return it to the store where I bought it and they would exchange it . Well looks like I 'm stuck with trying to have my bank recover my money from Amazon .
 Supposedly can be recharged 1000s of times . In my case I doubt if I recharged them more than 100 times , before they stopped working . Most rechargeables tend to last for shorter and shorter periods of time . These failed with no warning , fortunately I had another set of batteries for my flash .
 As ` NLee the Engineer ' noted
 Technology Galaxy is a great store and they have great customer service and they do everything they can to make sure you are happy with ur purchase but unfortunately Sony failed them with this item . . Sony needs to stick to TV 's these are the worse batteries every they run out fast the pre-charge after that they never charge up all the way . i dunno if i got a bad batch or what but i would say stay away from sony rechargeables they suck.Sony Cycle Energy AA Ni-MH Rechargeable Batteries -LRB- 4-Pack -RRB-
 I bought 8 of these batteries . They do not hold a charge beyond 3 days . Bought from a reputable dealer , major electronics company , so I assume they are not counterfeits .
 Pads are very small and they do not heat up as hot as thermacare , and the heat barely lasts 4 hours .
 Extremely watery !! It smells fine but is messy since it has no thickness to it . It did come packaged well .
 shaver had broken trimmer on receipt returned to discount jungle on may 3,2010 still no credit received unit returned vis ups tracking # 1zf485700342778433 very poor supplierPaul T Cheponis
 I 've had Remington shavers for many years . This was a replacement for one that lasted 10 years , before it became difficult to find replacement foil/cutter . This new shaver gives a great shave , as good as my last shaver , but the battery will not hold a charge for more than one shave , which means that I must plug it in every night in order to shave the next day . If I forget - no shave that day . I did n't think this would be that bad , so I did n't return the shaver -LRB- which is a pain -RRB- , but this defect has proven to be a major annoyance . I am very disappointed in this product , not what I have come to expect from Remington . Buyer beware .
 I ordered this shaver as a replacement for my husband 's 20 year old Remington that had worn out . Unfortunately , I returned it today because the shaver would not hold a charge . I am hoping for a refund .
 I purchased this product because I have had Remington 's in the past , inexpensive and reliable . However , from the first time I used this razor , the charge only lasts about 20-30 seconds . In that amount of time , I ca n't really accomplish much . This purchase was a complete waste of money and now I am stuck using the old razor I was attempting to replace . Now I am faced with starting from scratch . BUYERS REMORSE !
 My Braun recently died on me after serving me well for a number of years . My wife went out and bought the Remington and while I have no qualms about the shave itself -LRB- it does a decent job -RRB- the battery life is downright horrible . Does not hold a charge for very long and the most disappointing thing is that there is no visual indicator that it is low on charge nor can you shave while it is plugged in ! Going back to Braun . You pay more but I find you get what you pay for .
 This product was described as `` worldwide voltage '' . On looking at the charging lead it said 120V AC . I e-mailed Amazon and my enquiry was forwarded to the supplier who told me to return the shaver and eventually I received a refund less postage .
 I bought this product after reading all the good reviews thinking it would help me also . At first I had the usual bloating that was expected . I took it for about 3 weeks . I only took one scoop a day . I developed a red spotted rash under both eyes with hives ! I was shocked when I saw it in the mirror ! I also purchased their multi for women so I did n't know what was causing it . I stopped the multi first ... no change . Sadly I had to stop the Primal Defense and the next day my rash was half gone . I do n't know what they put in it , but I 'm apparently allergic to it . I 've never had a reaction to probiotics like that . Must be the controversial soil bugs . . maybe we 're not supposed to eat dirt ? I hope this is helpful for anyone who is sensitive to supplements like I am and have this reaction . So far I seem to be the only one who has . I 'm going back to acidophilus !
 On a few occasions over the last 12 years I have used this product because back at the beginning of that time span an ` alternative health '' MD recommended it for some IBS symptoms.In every case I limited my use of the product to one or two tablets total in one day , then waited for the effects to manifest . In most cases , for about a day I felt mildly ill - like a mild case of flu affecting my gut and my overall energy level , with some weakness and achiness in muscles & joints . However , after a day or so the digestive symptoms that caused me to take the product in the first place did seem to improve.Now , however -LSB- late December 2010 -RSB- I took the product - just one caplet - and shortly thereafter had serious cognitive impairment unlike anything I have ever had . Dizziness is quite pronounced , along with mild tinitis -LSB- ears ringing/noises -RSB- and a bit of thinking fog or ` brain fog ' . This all sent me to searching for side effects . On the web you will find some serious doctors questioning the safety of this product and any product containing high concentrations of HSO 's . None of such have been thoroughly tested in humans and the longterm effects of HSO 's in humans may be unpredictable because the organisms persist in the body and morph , adapting genetic material into their cell structure.Also , another reviewer mentioned `` FDA '' action against the company and its principle . I do n't see FDA involvement but there is an action by the FTC to stop deceptive advertising practices for the product . You can find a pdf of this complaint on the web .
 The product states it is gluten free , however it contains barley and oat grass , which can be gluten free , but if there are seeds present it will absolutely contain gluten . This product made me sick for weeks until I finally figured out what I was consuming that contained gluten , after reading other reviews .
 THIS PRODUCT IS MISLABELED.IF YOU HAVE A SENSITIVE STOMACH , BEWARE !! Although the container prominently proclaims the product to be `` Gluten Free '' , it certainly is not.I have tried several probiotic brands before -LRB- 8-10 -RRB- , this is the first one that made me sick . FOR DAYS . Each time I took a pill I felt sick to my stomach and had the same reactions I have when I ingest gluten . But the box says `` gluten free '' so I thought I was having a die-off reaction . Until day after day , I had symptoms that I ONLY have with gluten exposure.I googled `` gluten '' with `` Primal Defense '' , and sure enough tons of gluten sensitive individuals report that they have gotten glutened from this product.Shame on Garden of Life . I spent my hard earned money on your product to try to improve my health . Instead your product has caused damage to my digestive system for weeks.Garden of Life has high quality products , I 've tried others before . Please , please , fix your labels . Do n't make people sick .
 product was as stated , but subscription price was just for first purchase -- then it went up . The fine print says they will ship without telling you that the price has gone up .
 Seller did send product but it was not in the form we ordered . Normally it would not have been an issue except for that the person taking these can not tolerate capsules and needed the caplets we ordered .
 This is my first bad experience with the Garden of Life product line . It 's probably more Amazon.com 's fault for a bad description . The ingredient list on Amazon 's website does not state that this product contains rice maltodextrin , which is a cheap filler that is used in low quality products . Also , these are not capsules . The website uses the ambiguous term `` caplets . '' This product comes in standard tablet/pill form ; it is not in capsules allowing for sprinkling onto food . Caplet is a misleading term . I would not recommend this product or purchase it again .
 Anyone that can package dirt in a tablet and convince people to buy it for $ 40 is a genius.His products are over-hyped marketing at it 's best.This product did n't do anything for me and it does n't say on the label how many live cultures there are in this product.He also ads ingredients to it that actually do harm like Magnesium Stearate.None of his products have ever done anything for me & I wo n't waste my time with his junk ever again.When I first took his junk I was sick and vulnerable but now that my head is clear I can see how he spins hismarketing campaign with fancy words that sound great but do n't mean a darn thing . `` homeostatic '' ? ha-haThat 's a good one . Am I really supposed to believe this guy that bought some online degrees is telling me the truth?The `` credentials '' he has are from schools with no campuses.He is a business man that wants to make money and he does do that.Everything about this product is BS.Now go take your `` dirt pill '' , I 'm sorry , `` homeostatic soil organism pill '' , give me a break!Once I blindly followed some nutritional advice , I drank Kombucha tea , it gave me Crohns.I 'll never do it again and you will be much better off to stick with proven science instead of high pressure , high powered marketing.Try Mercola or one of the other probiotics that state how many live cultures are in it and do n't try and confuse you with made up words .
 look up jordan rubin scam you will see his credential are fake he said he he earned degrees in nutrition but he lied he bought fAKE DEGREES . and his story is a fake made up for money . he cant prove he was sick . and his company cant prove his story , he was fined by the fda over 200.000 thousand go look it up he is no expert he lies like one so becarful in takeing anything he sells or garden of life . so buyer beware

 Received Sea to Shinning Sea and am very disappointed . The first disc the sounds vary greatly . First it loud , then very soft so that you are constantly changing the volume . The quality of the sound is poor . I should have sent it back , but I did n't want to take the time , therefore that is my fault . I would be very very hesitant of buy anything else from Reader 's Digest Music.Cynthia Towslee
 I really ca n't rate these as I have n't seen any difference in myself.I have been eating differently along with this product.I do n't know what they are supposed to make me feel like.Garden of Life Primal Defense HSO Probiotics Formula , Caplets , 180-Count Bottle
 I too spent my hard earned money on this stuff beleiving all Dr Jordan Rubin said , and ended up with worse digestiveproblems like I have never had before in all my 50 years!The bloating and gas were so horrible it caused me to miss work!Does the term `` Swamp gas '' conjure up what I am talking about?so so horrible.Maybe it doesnt do that to everyone , but this was how it affected me andat first I just could n't beleive it was this product . But when I discontinued , it stopped . Then Ithought maybe I should try just one more pill and sure enough ! PAIN ! GAG ! HORROR!DO NOT buy this stuff !! If you do , do n't say I did n't warn you !! I now take bifidis and lactobaccillus and all is well !
 Soil organisms for human consumption have had very little study in the USA and in Europe they are strictly regulated for use only in livestock . I took this product for a few years , and I think it may have contributed to the severe bacterial overgrowth of my small intestine . Do a lot of research before taking any probiotic as not all strains are suitable for everyone . The exception is possibly acidophilus , and even bifidus can become pathogenic in immune compromised people . I feel this product should be pulled until further research is done on it .
 I 've suffered through years of digestive disorders and bought a large ` stockpile ' of this product , believing it would help . I started at one tablet/day and slowly worked my way up to 3 tabs 3x/day . The results ? Absolutely nothing ! It failed to improve anything ! I was pretty shocked/disappointed . For those of you wondering , I stayed on this regime for several months ; I gave it plenty of time to work its magic but to no avail . This is not a cheap supplement either ! A lot of money wasted for nothing!I did discover later that I was low in stomach acid which might explain why it did n't work . Perhaps I was n't even absorbing any of it ; but after being on betaine for quite some time and trying this product again -LRB- I still had 2 bottles left over -RRB- it still made no difference . Perhaps I need to try the ` Ultra ' formula , but at this point I 'm pretty jaded/doubtful it will work.UPDATE
 I had been taking Primal Defense for almost a week , when I started getting nasty symptoms of being glutened . At first I could n't figure out what the trigger was . I 've been gluten-free for 12 years , and I 'm a rigorous label-reader . Then I double-checked this product , the only new addition to my diet . It actually says `` vegetarian , gluten-free '' on the label , so it looks safe . But there 's also this tiny asterisk on the nutrition percentages label that says , `` The culture medium for probiotics is dairy ; bacterial proteases utilize WHEAT , dairy , and soy . Culture mediums are generally consumed during the fermentation process . `` Not good enough , Primal Defense . Fix that label ASAP . Many celiac chat rooms show complaints like mine.So I 'm tossing my bottle . Definitely NOT gluten-free . They may make a great probiotic , but if you are CELIAC , STAY AWAY .
 I researched HSOs and became concerned when I read that they are effective at killing candida etc BUT they colonize your digestive system and then stay there forever ! There are safer ways to address candida , I believe , with non-colonizing organisms or the kinds of organisms that are normally found in balance in our bodies .
 I called Twin Labs to find out if this product is suitable for vegans and they told me that it is made from human hair . I do n't want to eat human hair - do you ? Yuk !
 Do n't bother if you need support for your knee . Falls down after a few steps and offers NO support . Save your money .
 As I said in my title line , this is a well made product . But that 's were it ends for me . First I ordered a 3x size and it was way too large , I returned it and ordered a 2x . The 2x fit tighter -LRB- at least would stay put on my knee -RRB- , but give it a few minutes an it slid down to my ankle . So now I have a second item to return . Frustrating , believe me ! So in conclusion , the measurement instructions are terrible.All I can say is that after years of purchases from Amazon and never returning anything . It is best -LRB- for me at least -RRB- to not order anything that requires a size ! Now I am forced to drive all over the countryside for at least an hour trying to find a proper fitting support.Amazon has a very easy return policy ! Just keep all packing , it will smooth things greatly . I was impressed !
 Whereas Bounty 2-ply is exalted by both Procter & Gamble and everyone that uses it , this product is basically not up to the same par . If you want an excellent 1-ply product buy `` Viva '' . If you are simply looking to pay as little as possible , try something like the `` KROGER PREMIUM BRAND '' , Winn-Dixie 's `` Deep-South '' or the `` SHOP-RITE BRAND '' . To their credit , however , Bounty makes NO GRAND performance claims about this `` Basic Bounty '' 1-ply product . -LSB- I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY -RSB-
 The lights worked well for a week ; then one led failed . Now will use this as a two led lamp . Recommend a 5 led set so if one goes , still have 4 to give enough light . Also if anyone is listening , an off/on switch would help .
 Out of the box did n't work . Would not have givin it a 1 Star review if there was a zero . Now its time to play the refund game .
 Does n't fit all tile surfaces as depends upon tile size and distance between tiles . Heads are large for small tile size and if you get head to fit on one tile the second head lands on grout surface and it ca n't attach . Cost to return was $ 20 UPS - for a $ 30 product - I donated it to an elder facility rather than waste any more money . Product description should be very specific re
 I could not even get this to stick to the BR tile . Very unsafe for someone unsteady on their feet . This product should help not hinder . SCARY .
 The suction cups will not hold unless on very clean , or smooth surfaces . Even on smooth surfaces , one should be careful putting too much weight or pull on the handle because the suction cups could loosen from being attached . It happened to me . Luckily the other end was still attached and I regained balance before it got completely detached . Have to throw it away before any untoward accident happens .
 I ordered this product to find out that it 's for consumption , not cosmetic . It 's main ingredient is water , followed by corn syrup -LRB- hello , not healthy -RRB- . My bad for not asking , ABCs bad for not posting ingredients .
 As far as its intended purpose of household cleaning , this product works fine . But in terms of its primary , advertised virtue , that it is a safe , healthy , all-natural product , it simply does not live up to that claim on two main counts.The first problem is that this product contains fragrance . I was really unhappy to discover that this product is n't solely scented with essential oils , as the product 's advertising leads consumers to believe . Here are the ingredients listed on the product itself
 Before I ordered , I did notice that the ingredient list included `` Fragrance '' , but , sad to say , I fell for the greenwashing and decided it must be a small amount to enhance the essential oils ' scent . -LRB- For those who do n't know , `` fragrance '' in an ingredient list indicates a product is NOT natural . -RRB- The company makes an awfully big deal about how this line is scented with essential oils . That , my friends , is a load of bullhockey . This product contains a nominal amount of natural oils for marketing purposes , and enough artificial fragrance to out-stank Great Aunt Trudy 's dime-store perfume . Twice I 've tried to use a small amount of this product , and both times I 've had to leave the room for some fresh air . The smell seemed to coat my nostrils for at least a half hour later . Gak ! Truly awful . Seemed to clean ok but I could n't really spend a lot of time scrubbing , what with that sickening odor ... And I 'm only very mildly fragrance-sensitive . Want to clean green ? Just use some baking soda or Borax . You 'll save a couple bucks , as well as your sense of smell .
 I ordered this because I really like lavender . I have many other lavender cleaners , oil , candles , etc. . However , this product IS NOT LAVENDER . When I checked the ingredients , fragrance was listed before lavender oil . I could smell the product even before opening the package -LRB- it came in a box -RRB- . When I did open the box , WOW . The smell was very overpowering . Well , I decided to give it a try anyway . But , sorry to say , when I took it into the bathroom , I could n't imagine opening the container in such a small area . I guess others like this smell . But , for those who enjoy a natural lavender smell , do not buy this . That being said , I suffer migraines and can not tolerate many odors that most people do not have a problem with . So , maybe for most this odor will not be a problem . Just be forewarned , THIS IS NOT A NATURAL LAVENDER SMELL .
 I always thought these products looked the part of clean and natural , until they showed up in my house.They are very fragrance heavy , and being a person slightly sensitive to fragrance I started to notice it would make me a bit flushed and headachy . The countertop cleaner really bothered me most of all , because it would be on my food eating and prepping surfaces.The more I was around it the more it bothered me . I would even say it was overwhelming on my table while I ate and the fragrance got into the food when I used it on my butcher block.My wife also got the hand soap and having just used it I found that it too caused me some flushed feeling . So I decided I should share my experience . I have never written a product review before , but I 've decided I find the claim of natural and `` green '' to be a bit misleading . These products truly bother me where most other average products do not , be they green or conventional .
 Smell is way too strong . I have to cover my face with my shirt when I use it or run out of the room . It 's not a natural smell . I do n't like this product at all .
 This tubing was too bulky and cheaply made to hold up and use comfortably . Would return , but not worth the trouble .
 -LRB- 3 -RRB- pieces , each -LRB- 3 -RRB- ft. long were rolled up in a box . When opened all were distorted and crushed because of the packaging . In tim the product will regain about 90 % of it 's memory and will return to it 's original shape , but it 's a very slow process . What 's worse product falls off my toe . I use these to relieve the pressure while running against one of my small toes . The foam tube falls off and ends up under my other toes in the sock , making my outdoor run very uncomfortable . I use to buy a similar product through my foot doctor 's office , and paid a higher price . I went back to my doctor 's office ... this is an example of &#34; you get what you pay for &#34; .
 Even though this does n't get the stink and burn you get from Ben-gay , I rarely find any relief from this product . I have been through two bottles of the stuff just to be fair and think it is basically a waste of money . I do like tiger balm but it is quite expensive for a small amount .
 The product came already opened with no instructions , labeling , or anything . I 've not used it because I do n't know who else may have handled it . I wo n't return it because I 'm embarrassed to call and complain , so this review is all I 've got .
 I went to great lengths to research this product and make sure that it would fit a particular trash can -LRB- Rubbermaid Brut Rollout -RRB- and these bags are not wide enough to actually fit the can . We waited over a month to get them and then they are the wrong size . The bag is heavy and clear/frosted and is very deep but they are tall and narrow at the mouth . They are advertised as 38 '' but that is their diagonal measurement - not the depth or width of the product .
 Unlike the picture on the Amazon website , these bags are NOT clear . They are white frosted bags . The outside of the box that they came shipped in also says they are clear . As a result , these bags can not be used in jurisdictions that require that recycled waste , newspapers , etc. , must be in clear plastic bags . You can not see through these bags . These bags are being returned . This is the second time this has happened , but with a different vendor . I do n't understand how some vendors can market and advertise an item without first examining the item . This results in wasted shipping costs and wasted time .
 I was purchasing this product because it seemed to have a great effect on the Argentine ants that plague us here in Southern Cal.I noticed it did n't do a very good job on the outside upper part of my exhaust fan hood . So naturally I grabbed the bottle of ammoniawhich really works great on grease.I cooked some sausage the other evening and the following morning I lifted the cover to find solidified grease in the pan and on the cover.I sprayed some 4 in 1 on the cover and watched it do absolutely nothing . I moved the grease around with my finger and watched it justbecome a mess . I had to clean up with ammonia and soap . I then tried using Mr. Mean Clean -LRB- real cheap stuff from Walmart -RRB- and noticedit did the same job on the ants as 4 in 1 . I feel like a shmuck buying 4 in 1 three times now .
 Web site showed item as available . Bought for someone that needed this product . It did n't ship right away as indicated on web site and not one form of communication from this company . Poor and unacceptable service . Price is good but if they ca n't supply the product what good are they . Find somewhere else to buy . If you buy here you are just wasting time and energy as you will have to fight to undo the order . Their web site now says the order will ship in 7 - 10 days more so the order ca n't be canceled . How fair is this ... order a product because it is available ... never receive notice that the product wo n't ship ... and then when checking with the Amazon sponsored vendor there is a notice that the order can not be canceled . Poor and unprofessional garage shop operation .
 This item is billed as a tablet splitter/crusher . It may do a good job of crushing pills , I do n't know because I did n't try that . However , as a splitter it is a failure . There is no way to center the tablet , so you can not split it into equal pieces . The blade is too short and does n't reach the entire cutting area , so you may miss the tablet you are trying to split . In addition , it does n't cut cleanly , so you have lots of lost powder and `` shards '' . If you are after a splitter , get a real one .
 This pill splitter does n't split . It 'll make the pills crumble , making it difficult to decide how much of the pill dust you should take.The crusher works , of course . And there is a little compartment to carry a pill or two in.I 'd recommend the pill cutter at epill.com .
 The product simply did nothing for me . I tried the finished off the bottle , took it at recommened amount and also tried larger quantities , absolutely no affect . I would say do n't waste your money on this product but it could work for some allergies better than other . But I can attest it does n't help my allergy which is primarily to ragweed .
 Nine years ago when I had my second child I had the type that went over and under my belly ... which was great but of course I 've since given it away . With this child , I decided to buy this adjustable prenatal cradle and it was okay ... yes , it supported the weight of my belly but did n't give me enough back support that I required and to add to that it was n't really user-friendly -LRB- so to speak -RRB- , meaning it only had 3 choices to choose from to adjust for size ... once you 've outgrown the last eye & hook because you estimate the size you 'll get but do n't expect to exceed that size , it 's useless ... the previous one I had -LRB- 9 yrs ago -RRB- was velcro style which held up wonderfully and I wish I would 've stuck with that same style which would 've saved me some money .
 The small size indicates it fits up to 175 lbs however my daughter weighed 150 when we got this and it was too tight . I would opt for the next size because she is not able to wear it . She is due it January and by the time we return and receive another her pregnancy will be over . She still does not weigh 175 lbs .
 I bought two of these in small and medium hoping that one size would fit me and help take the weight of my belly off and help with round ligament pain.This belt is SO UNCOMFORTABLE !! It is a pain to get into . If you 're pregnant , you 're going to be going to the bathroom a lot and who wants one more thing to wrestle with while doing so ? I could only wear if for an hour before I packed it back up and returned it.I 'm making due without a belt . I wish there was a good product out there but I have n't found it . This is NOT your solution , ladies .
 I bought the prenatal cradle because I had been having problems with SPD during pregnancy . This product does provide some support for the belly , but I 'm not convinced that it makes that much difference . Plus , it 's kind of awkward to climb into and hard to find clothes that cover the shoulder straps . In my opinion , it 's just not worth the money .
 I ca n't tell if these pills are doing what they are supposed to do . I probably wo n't buy again.Nothing wrong with the vendor
 I was 140 pounds at 6 months and decided to get size small as it can supposedly accommodate up to 150 pounds . Well , when it arrived , I had to use the last set of hooks and it was already super tight ! So I gave mine to a friend and ordered the medium.The cradle supports your tummy but for some reason , it also makes the sides of my back sore after a while . It helps , but you wo n't ever `` forget that you 're wearing it '' and as many of the reviewers have mentioned , the straps really do peek out even in conservative necklined-shirts . All in all though , it does help when you 're carrying heavy , like I am with twins.Update : I 'm now 8 months along and discovered a new problem
 Just got it in the mail today , and put it on right away . I 'm 26 weeks with # 3 , and I have big babies , so I was very hopeful . It does seem to help a little , but no more than just the belt , at least at this point . Word of advice
 This product received great reviews , however , when I received it and tried it on , all the bells and whistles carried no support . I felt just as much support without the straps as with the straps . Moreover , they pulled on my shoulders , making my entire back lean forward . The product did not scream `` quality . '' Cheaper fabric and kind of flimzy . Did not work for me at all .
 When I purchased this I was not even in the weight range . I am now 5lbs into the weight range and it is too tight . The other issue is that I am petite and the straps on the side are too long . While it relieves some pressure off my lower back I feel more pain in my upper back . I do n't like it and could not recommend it , especially if you are a petite person . Also you have to safety pin it to your bra so that it is not exposed out of your top . Besides wearing a regular round neck t-shirt there are no other tops/sweaters/blouses you can wear with the cradle unless you pin down the straps .
 This item is not for me . I am a small framed person expecting twins . I also work full time outside the home and was advised to purchase this product to help me make it to my due date and still work . I have been experiencing a lot of pressure in my tail bone and was anxious to receive this item . There were no directions as to how to put it on so I winged it . Once I latched the hooks together it kept sliding over belly and i was constantly pulling it back down . No relief was felt at all with this product and I ended up returning it . It was n't for me .
 Most uncomfortable thing I put on during pregnancy . Did not help my back while I was carrying twins , but instead caused pain in other places . Not recommended at all .
 perhaps I 'm not big enough in the belly yet , but it does n't exclude me from needing some support . I found that my 5 ' 2 '' 36HH short and curvy frame -LRB- size 14 during pregnancy -RRB- did n't get any support from this . the straps around the chest were tight and cut into my chest . the belt itself was too big under my belly even on the tightest settings . Bummer , I was looking forward to a belt with support that also let me sit easily . Also , it pinched my bump in a weird way making it look like a saggy beer belly rather than a kid . :-LRB- Luckily Amazon makes returns easy .
 The straps that go along your ribs and between your breasts were REALLY tight ! The part that fits under your belly did n't fit me until I was 6 months pregnant and I 'm carrying twins . The fit of this thing was really strange to me since I weighed 120 lbs before pregnancy and my upper body is pretty small . The only part of me that seems really big is my belly and that is the part of the prenatal cradle that was loose . My midwife recommended this and I 've heard from other woman that they loved theirs , so maybe it just was n't for me : -RRB-
 I got it and was really excited to use for my back support as I reached 8 months pregnancy . But it 's really annoying to wear it and try to cover it with turtle necked sweater all the time . Otherwise the white belt will show up around my neckline . Not sure if other people have the same issue . Can you imagine If you use it during the summer ? Do n't know how you can hide it !!! Had to take a loss to return it because it 's unbearable !
 When I purchased this item , I thought surely there is at least a T-Shirt I 'd be able to wear on top and not have it show ... well no , the top criss-cross straps are so close to the neck that the white of the straps shows no matter what you have on . They also show under all my summer dresses , many of which follow the same kind of cut . I can not wear this at work . Would only be able to wear it around the house , and even so would be embarrassed should someone come knocking at the door . As a working pregnant person , that does not at all fit my needs . Not until my back is REALLY killing me.I 'm 33weeks , 5 `` 7 and 193lb -LRB- a M before pregnancy -RRB- and the L seems like the right size , though there are only three size settings very far apart -LRB- not velcro , but hooks -RRB- and none fits just right ... So it 's not great on sizing either . The belt area itself is narrower than I expected - about 3 '' all around . -- Edited per comment I received
 I wanted to like this support belt , especially after reading all the positive reviews from others who were pregnant with twins . However , it is terribly uncomfortable . - First of all , it is difficult to adjust and as others have stated , the hooks at the bottom are spaced too far apart . - Secondly , for me , being short and pregnant with twins at 25 weeks , there is no more room under my breasts . I can not even wear a bra with underwire at this point , and the straps on this that go under your breasts are very very uncomfortable . - Thirdly , it did not provide either the back support or the under belly support that I was specifically looking for with this belt . The underbelly band feels too narrow , and I felt like my large belly is just hanging out there.After spending 43 dollars on it , I gave it several chances , and tried every which way to adjust it , but it just does n't work . As this was my 3rd support belt and I am now on my 4th , I wanted to share my experience with the most recent one I got which is working well , just in case there are others like me who have severe back pain and feel miserable and heavy.It is from BabiesRUs and the brand is BabiesRUs . It is this one :[ ... -RSB- It is only 30 dollars , but hey at this point I would have spent 300 if it meant I could get some relief . This belt has both large a large underbelly band and an extralarge back band to give excellent support to your back and your tummy . It is mildly complicated to put on because it has 3 parts , but it 's better than this Prenatal Cradle contraption that made me feel like Houdini every time I tried to get in and out of it . It is soft and does n't snag on clothing . And it 's been great for both sitting and walking around.Good luck !
 I am a waitress and 8 months pregnant . My Dr. recommended this product to relieve back pain and discomfort due to my expanding waistline -LRB- haha -RRB- It looked promising but upon arrival I tried it on and instantly it was itchy and uncomfortable . The next day I tried to wear it to work with a tank top underneath to help with the itchiness . I took it off within the first 10 minutes of work.My two year old now wears it around the house . I do not recommend this product .
 I do n't like this product at all . First of all it is not easy to use and next it is not comfortable . Complete waste of money .
 It 's a little uncomfortable . I guess because I am carrying so low . AND I wish it had more than three adjustable places . I CAN tell a difference after I have worn it . I bought it on my OB/GYN 's recommendation . See what your Dr says before you spend the money .
 Do NOT buy this if you have a short torso . I have had severe PSD with this pregnancy , and this product was recommended by several people including a CNM and an OB . I was well within in the weight/size guidelines for the medium that I purchased . Yet , the lower support band was so stiff and thick that it cut into my skin and was painfully uncomfortable . The straps were way too long and the X that should have crossed in the center of my chest was way up by my collarbone . Even after trying to move everything around so that it was properly positioned , I had no support at all from the product . Somehow the stiffness of the material dug into my skin and still the product was n't snug enough to provide any support . A very bad design in my opinion .
 Product showed up damaged , but the company was impossible to get a hold of to set up a return . Phone call and email fell on deaf ears .
 Be careful if you have allergies - this has a `` lullaby scent '' - not mentioned .
 The product shown is not the product you will receive ! You will receive the new Method Squeaky Clean in the rice milk marshmellow scent ! I am in the process of returning product to sender . I also did not receive this order from Green Cupboard but from DrugStore.com - if I had known that I would not have purchased because I knew DrugStore did not have my product in stock . Hopefully the return process will go smoothly .
 I just went out to Babies R Us and bought two packs of these and boy do I regret it . I only wanted to use them as burp cloths , and was n't even planning to use them for diapering , but I do n't even think they 're suitable for burp cloths . I should have opened one of the packages in the store because then I would have realized that they 're paper thin and you can see right through them . You might as well let the baby spit up on your shirt . Not to mention the fact that the material is so scratchy I would never put my baby 's face against it . I 'm off to return these and find something that 's better quality .
 This diaper becomes fully saturated very quickly . I bought one pack of them and a couple dozen of the more expensive chinese prefold diapers . I used them with the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap cover , which are great . These diapers were retired after my daughter fully saturated the diaper during a nap when she was one month old . I have never had that problem with the chinese prefold diaper and think they are absolutely worth the extra money . The gerber diapers are only good for burp cloths .
 These diapers are terrible ! Most of my cloth diapers were hand me downs - they are thick and soft . These Gerber ones are NOT ! I bought these at Wal-Mart and when my 9 month old wears them , he has to be changed every 30 minutes . If I do n't change him quickly , the diaper can become so soggy that it will literally drip . It 's not worth it . Spend your money on thicker diapers .
 Method changed the formula of the Daily Shower . They called it
 I wish I would have listened to the other more recent reviews about the new formula . I was able to tolerate the smell of ylang ylang with the old formula , it did n't smell too bad to me . At least it kept the shower clean . After starting with a clean shower of course . But this new formula not only smells bad -LRB- like a wet diaper -RRB- but it does n't keep the shower clean . It 's funny because everyday , I spray it on the shower , I 'm hoping that it will smell better today . I gave it two starts because it does keep the silver chrome ? part of the the shower nice and shiny but the rest looks dull and streaky . So disappointing ... I have 7 bottles left . I wish I would have listened to the other reviews .
 I 've never used a daily shower cleaner before - I never wanted to use that much chemicals . So I thought this one , being enivronmentally friendly , would be worth a try . I 'm almost at the end of my first bottle & I ca n't say that my shower stays any cleaner than if I did not use anything at all.A couple of qualifiers on the above statement : - I have a cleaning lady who comes every 2 weeks & I do absolutely nothing to clean the shower in between her visits . I thought that using this between her visits would make a visible difference in cleanliness . I ca n't see any difference . Maybe our shower just does not get dirty enough between thorough cleanings for a daily product to make sense . - My shower had some hard water stains from before the cleaning lady 's time that nothing has been able to get rid of . This product did n't make a dent in them either , but I think that might have been asking too much . - typically my husband showers in the morning & I shower before bed . We only used this daily cleaner after my husband 's shower because the bathroom is next to the master bedroom & the smell is too strong for us to want to smell it all night . Using the cleaner only once daily might have lessened it 's effectiveness.Regarding the smell - it is not unpleasant , just much too strong . Our master bath is upstairs & you can smell it from the front door while the product is still wet . I am extremely sensitive to odors & typically buy unscented products whenever possible , so do n't let my opinion influence your decision too much.Bottom line
 Being a very prodigious Amazon customer , I have bought hundreds of products
 I bought this stuff hoping to love it since it is supposed to be nontoxic and ecofriendly . I love daily shower cleaners but was always worrying about the chemicals . I do not see how something with such an overpowering smell as Method Daily Shower Cleaner can be good for you . Luckily I tried it first in my downstairs bathroom and not in the bathroom which is attached to my bedroom . I have had a headache since using it , have tried running the fan , running the shower and still it smells . I will be returning it and making my own spary as originally planned .
 I bought this product a few years ago from Target , and I am so glad I do n't have 8 bottles around ! The smell is gross to me , and really lingers -LRB- all that hot steam -RRB- , and after a while started to give me a headache . So I used it less and less , but then my shower was harder to clean . Yes , even spraying it every 3 days , and sparsely , helped with soap scum . But , my dog ! that smell :--LRB- For some reason I thought Method was specific to Target , and that this product was the only - not so ! Duh . I found an Arm & Hammer version at Safeway - much better smell -LRB- kinda sweet and candy-like , and not great -RRB- and also works . I think there was another brand on the shelf which I will smell/try when I run out of my A&H . I DO like other Method products !
 Have been using Method Daily shower spray for years and loved it . My last `` subscribe and save '' shipment arrived with new bottle design and a `` new formula '' . This new formula is horrible . It leaves what looks like water streaks on all the surfaces in my shower . I hate it and now have 7 bottles of something that I will not use -- not to mention being out what I paid for this shipment . I can not believe that the company actually thought this was an improvement !! Did they not test it on some real showers ??? Please bring back the old formula !!!!!
 Love how it works . But ca n't use it because the smell is just tooooo sweet . Would love to have the daily shower option in the Eucalyptus Mint Scent . -LRB- Or unscented , or grapefruit ... something less cloying . -RRB-
 I was eager to try this product because it is nontoxic and ecofriendly , but used it only once . My shower had been freshly cleaned , so I do n't know whether it worked or not . I just know that the smell was so bad that I will not try it again . It left me feeling nauseous with a headache which is not how I want to feel fresh out of the shower.If you have even a slight sensitivy to smells , do n't buy this product !
 I generally love Method products , but the smell of this spray is just sickening . The only way I can stand to use it is if I spray the shower area , immediately leave the bathroom and shut the door -LRB- and make sure I 've used the bathroom beforehand so I do n't have to go in it for another couple of hours -RRB- . The spray appears to * work * just fine , but the smell of it should n't be so noxious that I ca n't casually spray it on and do things in the bathroom at the same time .

 Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products . I use the detergents , all purpose cleaners , wood cleaner , tub and shower cleaner . When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I 'll buy the Method brands . The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell . I do n't mind the smell but its WAY too strong . I 'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub . I sprayed the whole tub , turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour . When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out ! The smell was like I had just sprayed it ! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on . Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang . I 'm never spraying this again . I highly recommend other Method products though !
 I have been using this cleaner for a couple of years and loved it until I received my latest order . The bottle shape was different and claims to be a new formula . Terrible ! The odor is awful and the spray is irritating to my nasal passages . The scent which I used to really like is now an overpowering urine smell . The cleaner now leaves streaks on my shower glass . Please go back to the old formula or I will have to find a new product .
 We 've been using this product for a couple of years now and really learned to love it . The ylang-ylang scent took us a while to get used to , but once we did we really liked it . -LRB- It 's a strong scent and it reminded me of a spa we used to go to that used a lot of evergreen scents all around - a nice smell once you get used to it . -RRB- Anyway , we got our last shipment of 8 bottles a week or so ago and this new formula stinks - literally . I think it smells like old fish , my husband thinks it smells more industrial , but whatever it is , it 's not good . I have to agree with the other reviewers that it also does n't work as well . We cancelled our automatic shipments and will now look for something else . Bummer . We love method products in general , but the remaining 7 bottles will just go in the recycle bin .
 I could not get this product to work for me . This product had not impact on soap build up in the shower .
 I do n't really like the smell of this product but I would deal with it as long as the product does a good job . It does n't . Instead of cleaning the shower room -LRB- tiles and the glass door -RRB- , it made the surface sticky and left dirty spots . This was a waste of money . I 'll sticky with my seventh generation products .
 I think it works ok but I could n't stand the smell to try it long enough .
 My husband bought this product by the case . Big mistake . This product does not do a thing to help keep your shower clean . It does have a pleasant aroma , but I can spritz perfume if I just want fragrance .
 I really hoped it would work and be easy , but when somethings are too good to be true , well ... It remained sticky on everything you spray , but the smell is something that no one can stand or should breathe . It did loosen a little , but not enough to scrub off . I was very disappoint .
 It seems like a good idea ... an environmentally-friendly daily shower spray that saves you the work of scrubbing the yuck off of your shower . And maybe -- maybe -- with a less offensive odor this product might be worth it . I 'm not sure if this stuff is what Ylang Ylang really is supposed to smell like , but after enthusiastically spraying my double-shower with Method Daily Shower Spray , what I 've got is a bathroom that now smells like a tank of wet diapers steeped in a cubic yard of rotting gardenias . Unfortunately , this was after giving my daughter a bedtime shower , which means I 'm periodically gagging as I check in on the bathroom to see if the stink has dissipated enough for me to get some sleep . Thank goodness my bathroom has both a window and a fan . I 've also tried running the shower a few minutes to rinse the product away , but it has n't helped yet . If they come out with an unscented version of this product , I 'll give it another try , but this stinky one is going to be returned .
 I ordered this product , but never received it -- do n't know what happened . Ca n't rate the product -- customer service on this product gets `` zero '' .
 THIS PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT GLOW IN THE DARK WHEN ADDED TO WATER , DOESNT CREAT ANY BUBBLES OR FOAM ONLY THE BOTTLE GLOWS BUT THAT 'S IT . IT 'S A WASTE OF MONEY DO N'T BUY IT
 what i thought was a novel idea turned out to be pretty cheesy and never got used . just write your own little notes and save yourself the wasted money .
 The ONLY reason I bought this clipper set is that I am living in eastern Europe for the next 2-3 years , and this is the only dual voltage set I could find . I bought my Wahl set of clippers over 10 years ago and they still work great , just not on the 220v electricity where I am now living.This Conair set came with dull scissors -LRB- my 10 year old , never sharpened scissors that came with my Wahl set are sharper -RRB- and a cape that is as thin as a garbage sack -LRB- I 'm using `` shampoo '' capes that I bought at a beauty supply shop instead -RRB- . The guide combs seem more flimsy than the one 's in my Wahl set . Also with out guide combs and the adjuster in the shortest cut position , there is still hair visible after clipping with the Conair , but not with the Wahl.The Conair has a 5 position blade adjuster , where as the Wahl adjuster does n't have stops so it can be in an infinite number of positions . A couple of years ago I dropped the Wahl and threw the blades out of alignment , with the stoppless blade adjuster I could set it just right to bring the blades back into alignment.Bottom line unless you need dual voltage like I do , buy a Wahl .
 I 'm sure that this is probably a good product . However there are two things to consider when ordering
 This product will not mix in my shaker . Two minutes of vigorous mixing in my Blender Bottle and still large clumps and dry powder stuck to the inside . The taste is OK but not good . This is the worst meal replacement shake I have used .
 This umbrella was so poorly made - it broke the very first day I used it !! NOT A GOOD PURCHASE !!
 This was a waste of money . I have bought Algae before and it really helped me with my appetite . This did nothing . Sorry
 Although the idea is good , the prenatal cradle has to be modified in many aspects : This product was not made thinking about fashionable and practical pregnant women.If you live in a hot weather , clothing is light and does not cover all your body , therefore , the prenatal cradle will show up either from one side or the other !!!!!!! -LRB- specially if you are proud of your new body and use low rise pants or short t-shirts -RRB- it also can be seen through your clothing because the cradle is white and made of a thick material . It is one added worry , every time I have to dress up for work , workout or just going out , I have to spend a long time thinking how to cover it . I am dissapointed about this product , it makes me feel frustrated .
 The mini cradle is MUCH better - you can adjust the strap that goes around your waist/underbelly . This one is the size it is - mine is too loose and does very littls good . : - -LRB-
 I bought this thinking it will help with my back , but it 's very uncomfortable to wear , especially during the summer time .
 A few other reviews mentioned that the height fit them , but the waist did not -LRB- or the other way around -RRB- . I was hoping it would n't be this way for me since most of the reviews were positive , but it was - height was perfect , but the waist was too tight . Oh well . I was already 7 months along when I began using it , so maybe it would have helped more if I had started using it from earlier in the pregnancy ? It aggravated the pain I was trying to alleviate , so I ended up returning it and using a velcro adjustable one .
 I was very excited to try this product . This is my second pregnancy , and my first daughter weighed 10 lbs 6 ozs , and I am not a very big woman . This pregnancy has been rough , my body seems to be worn out , and to beat it all , I work at a hospital and am on my feet for 12-13 hours a day . I thought the cradle would help , but it is just a jumble of elastic . It does not support like it claims and I did not even notice ANY difference in having it on . AND , you can see it under your top , I wore mine with my scrub tops and I peeped out of the shoulder area and all day people asked what it was . Not cool :--LRB- Buyer beware ... save your money !!!
 I was suffering with severe groin pain during my pregnancy , so I purchased this belt hoping to find relief . I found this belt to be very uncomfortable . The elastic is so rough , it irritated me all day . Also the straps that go over your shoulders come up so high you are very limited on shirt options without the bands showing . Also , I had seen that it runs small and to order asize up , so I did . The band still cut into my lower ribs around my waist . By the end of the day I could n't wait to take it off ! I wore it once , then found a different support band and am much more comfortable now .
 We had great hopes for this -- because my wife 's belly was hurting toward the end of the day . We waited anxiously for the mail delivery and kicked ourselves for not shipping it overnight.Upon trying it out , the belt was too tight to be comfortable sitting -LRB- even though my wife was in the lower end of the weight range for the size she ordered -RRB- . This presented the problem -- when going out shopping , do you wear it or not ?? It ca n't be easily removed . so we ended up not using it , and wish we never had purchased it . It helped somewhat when standing -- if that is all you do all day . But for the average person , there must be a better designed belt .
 I very much looked forward to the support of this cradle during my twin pregnancy . They do n't seem to be sized for petite women ; rather taller women with long torsos . I tried two different sizes and neither fit appropriately for me . Both fit well through the shoulders but were baggy through the middle , thus not supportive , even in late term . Alas , I returned the cradle for a full refund .
 I bought this at the beginning of my third trimester I do n't know if it 's a combo of the third trimester uncomforts or just the sling but my baby hated it . It seemed like he was being smashed or something .
 This is a harness of another sort . You have to put it over your head and hope for the best . The adjustable is by far a better option .
 Do not love anything about this product other than the smell and the bottle . The spray does n't wipe up like windex and takes forever to actually dry . Do n't see any impressive results to make the aggravation while cleaning actually worth it . I really wanted to love this because I love that it smells like mint , love the bottle and love method products . But , I am going to keep the bottle and buy the windex refill to use in it . : -RRB-
 I love that this spray is a more natural product than Windex , and I LOVE the way it smells , but that is all . The product leaves lots of streaks no matter how many times I go over it , and simply does not clean glass or mirrors very well at all . I really do n't understand the glowing reviews . Will continue looking for a better product .
 I have tried other Method products and enjoyed them all until now . Smells like peppermint which is nice , but horrible film left on Windows after cleaning . Not worth the price since it does n't do the job . Back to Windex until I find something else .
 On January 22 , 2009 I wrote the following : This is a fabulous product . I had been using the `` name brand '' blue window cleaner and wanted to switch to an eco-friendly product , so I picked Method 's Glass Cleaner . Initially , I sprayed the same amount of cleaner on my windows and glass-topped tables . Way too much ! It appears that I need about 50 % less product to produce crystal clear , steak-free glass . Saving the environment just a bit means saving money with this product . It works better than the name brand and smells great!I have used 48 bottles of Method Window Cleaner since then . The first 40 were fabulous.Then between my order of November 2010 and my next order in May , 2011 Method changed its formulation . Streaks beyond my imagination ! The new formila does not clean ! I bought a bottle of Windex -- my old brand -- and my tables and windows were clean again . Then I found a part bottle of the old formulation in a car and brought it in to clean my glass topped table that was streaking with the new formulation.Clean , streak-free glass again!Whatever Method did in re-formulation has changed this product from 5 star to one star.Until Method goes back to the old formulation , I would avoid this product .
 I hate to buck the prevailing tide ; however , I must be honest . This is NOT one of Method 's great products
 I normally use the Windex Natural Glass & surface Cleaner but this was on sale at my local store so I thought I would give it a try . Well I wish I could be one of the positive reviews on here but my experience was not the same . I had a TON of streaks on everything !! My husband is the one that noticed a few hours later all the streaks on the mirrors and windows AND it took me a lot longer to clean the faucets that normally wipe clean because ever time I wiped another streak would appear . I will say that it smells wonderful ! Very minty and clean but that was about the only pro for me . I did see some of the reviews saying that they used a Microfiber cloth instead of papertowls so I will give it a try so I dont waste $ 5.00 . I will keep my fingers crossed ...
 As many have mentioned before me , this product leaves streak on your stainless steel appliances , hardly cleans any dirt . Stay away .
 I adore Method 's pink grapefruit all purpose cleaner and their tub and tile cleaner , so I tried this . Horrible mistake - left streaks all over my fridge , and I 'm returning it . Get their other stuff ; baking soda and hot water followed by a rinse is fine for nontoxic stainless cleaning and does n't leave streaks .
 This is seriously the worst cleaner I have ever used !! Just hot water and a cloth would work better than spraying this stuff on any stainless steel appliance . It left a film and milky looking streaks all over . Do n't waste your money !!
 This stuff was a total waste of money . It made my appliances streakier than they were before I used it . The best , cheapest solution for stainless appliances is this
 i do n't know why , but days after i used this product to wipe off my stainless steel refrigerator and dishwasher , rust dots began to appear on both appliances . -LRB- i used good ol' bar keeper 's friend to remove the rust . -RRB-
 After repeated tries , this spray left very visible streaks on my dishwasher and refrigerator . Returned for a refund !
 I was looking for a green alternative to Pledge . Greener it may be , but unfortunately this product leaves streaks and has a really strong perfume odor . I 'll have to keep looking .
 My husband and I just bought a new house and therefore several new appliances . I bought this after having positive experiences with other Method products and must admit was extremely disappointed.This product does NOT actually clean the steel . When we had the fridge and hood installed there were tons of fingerprints all over it , and this product only made the already visible smudges even larger . We actually used the Method all-surface cleaner to get the smudges off and polish the stainless steel.The only thing I can that this product does is protect the surface from getting smudges once it is properly cleaned ... . so only about 25 % of the intended use .
 How in the world can Method put huge sticker claiming `` NEW STREAK-FREE FORMULA '' ? I just bought this product at Henry 's to clean my SS refrigerator and it ended up with more streaks than before ... I feel ripped off and am completely disappointed . I will never buy their products again .
 I have purchased these brushes for years ... . by the dozens . I loved them . The maker has for some reason stiffened the bristle to such a degree that the brush is n't really usable . If I wanted a bristle this hard I 'd buy a metal bristled brush ! To really use a brush with a bristle this stiff one would need a much heftier and heaver handle . Way to stiff ... . they 've ruined a wonderful product .
 I used these wipes first to clean my kitchen . About halfway through , however , I kept smelling this gross , slightly nauseating scent . I thought it was our garbage , but after sniffing that , noticing no smell at all , and then taking it out just in case , the smell was still there . As I continued to clean it kept getting stronger and I wondered if a squirrel had gotten in and maybe died in the walls . I then itched my nose with my wrist and got a large whiff of the problem - the stupid wipes.Now , I do n't know if this is a problem with some of them -LRB- like maybe they went bad on the shelf before I got them due to a lack of preservatives or chemicals -RRB- or if they just all smell rancid . But I would definitely go with something else if you want a `` clean '' scent .
 I was thinking that pink grapefruit cleaning wipes would smell wonderful . These do not . I have a hard time using them . They work well , if you do n't mind the smell .
 I tried this product with the fertility cleanse kit . I ca n't say it did anything for me . If you research the individual ingredients from a legitimate source -LRB- e.g. consumer labs or the NIH -RRB- , you wo n't find anything to support the claims of what it is supposed to do for the liver . I also did n't notice any improvements in my cycle which this was supposed to help with .
 We got a few packets of different flavors to try from a local store . Thank goodness we did n't buy a large container . We mixed them with milk and did n't try making a smoothie out of them to mask the flavor . They were absolutely disgusting ! The worst protein drink we 've tried .
 These pads are made of gauze woven of very fine threads which are spaced slightly more than 1mm apart , which leaves 1mm square holes throughout the gauze sheet . When folded on itself in 9 plies , you can still see through the gauze . 12 plies gives more of a visual barrior , but not much of a moisture one . I used a syringe to measure one-tenth of a cc of water . I placed a 2-ply paper towel , folded in half , on a table , put a 2-ply facial tissue on one half of the folded towel and one of the 12-ply gauze pads on the other half of the towel . I dropped the measured water first on the tissue and then the same amount on the gauze pad . The tissue did a better job of absorbing the water . It just dampened the top fold of the towel . The gauze pad held so little water that the fluid soaked through both folds of the towel and left a really wet spot even on the bottom fold of the towel . Any wound that requires a gauze pad will not be helped by these.IN ADDITION , THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA . After recent problems reported in the news , I have to wonder whether they are actually sterile . Do yourself a favor and skip these . You 'd probably have to use at least three of them to get the absorbancy of the ones you can buy off the shelf at a discount pharmacy . Also the gauze is harsh feeling , not soft and comforting . It will cost as much to pack and ship back as I paid for them , so I guess I will toss them or use them to dust the crevices on my computer keyboard or grab several to wipe off my smaller artist paint brushes . Should also work well if you need to make a lot of bridal veils for a bunch of fashion dolls .
 Very flimsy , have to use 3 or 4 at a time for absorbancy , more the size of 2x2 than 3x3 .
 Would not suggest purchasing this item for your medical needs . Better quality at the local dollar store . Please consider other sources for your needs of this item .
 This product simply does not work for me . It makes it MORE work to move the razor across my face . I had good luck with the scentless California North Electric Formula Pre-Shave , also sold by Amazon .
 The scent is mild and agreeable , which is very rare for a pre-electric lotion . Many others use tea tree oil and worse . Why ?? The problem with this lotion is that it does * not * lubricate in any way at all . In fact , I get the impression that after using this lotion , the razor sticks more than without using anything !
 I misunderstood what this product was supposed to do . I was told that it was an appetite suppressor and that was the reason that I purchased it but it did do that for me in the least little bit .
 I like the idea of this product . It was easy to figure out and felt like it would give some support . However , the straps that go between your legs were n't lined up right front to back . The straps ended up being off center and there was no way to correct it . I had to wear spandex underneath the V2 support and they still cut into my legs when I was sitting . Finally , the material used made it sound like you were wearing a diaper when you walk . People would definetly be able to tell you had something on . When it come down to it , it was more uncomfortable to wear than and support I got out of it .
 This brace was uncomfortable for me maybe bec / I am pregnant . When I sit down , it is so wide that it gouges me in the belly . I returned it for the plain V2 supporter w/out the hip brace and that was much better !!!
 I developed varicose veins in my second pregnancy and was able to control them quite well in my legs with compression stockings . When I started to get these veins further `` north '' I did n't know what to do . Going to the bathroom , taking a shower , even standing could be almost unbearable . That is why I was willing to shell out the big bucks for this product . I could not wait for it to arrive in the mail and relieve my discomfort.Unfortunately , when it did arrive I was very disappointed . It was easy enough to put on but all I felt was more discomfort . It did not relieve the pressure at all and the velcro was so stiff that I felt like I could n't walk comfortably . There are two velcro straps that also cut right across the butt cheeks which not only pressed on one of my veins but the sharp velcro dug in and was painful . Since the whole thing is basically just a bunch of velcro is also makes noise when you move . I have also had problems with my hips and SI joint but this thing was too uncomfortable to wear to find out if the hip brace works or not.I thought I would do anything to get rid of the discomfort of my varicose veins but it turns out the one thing I will not do is wear this terrible contraption . I returned it . I do n't know if there are other products that work better but this thing is likely not going to be comfortable for any pregnant woman ... and frankly I just do n't think it really works .
 I have tied to use this product several times and not only it did not remove any hair , but also irritated my skin in the process.It smells worse than Nair , and , unlike Nair , does not work .
 i imagine that my state of mind when buying this product was the same as anyone else . i had seen the TV ad showing the whole spray and wipe idea . Spray some on ... wipe the hair off . Even had the cool little animation of the hair follicle being removed . Well as a body hair inclined man , i sit her today fairly bodyhairless -LRB- in the applied areas -RRB- ... i also have chemical burns all over my upper torso.Before i get to that whole burning part , let me address the hairless part . i probably will not be hairless long as the product does NOT remove the hair follicle it simply destroys the above skin hair and causes the hair to break off at the skin level , leaving pretty much stubble , that is back the next day . after using your skin is exactly like how it would be after shaving . And when i said destroy ... its more like melt ... and i mean that . i am hispanic so my body hair was pretty thick . you could watch the hair pretty much melting.I will say that if you spray in a patch and expect all that hair to be removed you are wrong . you will need multilple application within the same area to remove everything ... which brings me to the chemical burning.now for the record this burning is not just in areas that i had to do multiple applications but also where i did single applications . initially i felt no discomfort at all -LRB- at first application -RRB- in fact after it sitting there for a few minutes i still felt decent though it does begin to irritate . however while wiping it off with the damp cloth as they suggest , you learn something valuable . the active ingedient in this stuff reacts amazingly with water . then you get to feel the joy and pleasure of a chemical burn . First application is honestly not that bad ... however if you decide to reply -LRB- the same day -RRB- in the same area ... just spraying it on will feel like napalm.i will note here that i did thoroughly make sure that i removed all the product from my hairless but pain riddled body . the next day , getting into the shower ... well i have not felt pain like that in a very very long time.i should also point out that though they recommend this for bikini lines ... i would n't ... being a guy i ca n't really compare notes due to certain differences but i can say that i used this on my chest and some of it did get on my nipples ... they proceeded to burn amazingly and develop open sores that did involve a little blood . i would not want to imagine that situation in any of the more delicate parts of the anatomy.next day ? more stubble , still lots of pain . . a hot and uncomfortable rash wherever the product touched ... little scabs where it appears the product caused bleeding in the pores of my skin.i hear there is a product called Kalo that works a lot better ... maybe after i heal i will try it ... till then , my days at home mean wearing no shirt and wishing my skin would grow back a lot faster .
 I was so excited to find this product due to much pressure and discomfort in my third pregnancy . However , I ended up needing to return it . It fit everywhere quite well and had many adjustable straps , except the one strap that goes under your belly . This felt too tight to me and was uncomfortable . I definitely could n't sit down with it on and even when standing it left a visible impression under my baby belly.This may be because I carry very low and have a little extra belly fat , but still if they had only made it adjustable I would have loved to keep this product . Unfortunately now I am still unable to find something that works . My only suggestion would be , if you are a slightly bigger girl , try ordering one size larger than you think . I purposely did not because other reviews suggested to order your exact size . Anyhow , it was worth a try . Now if I can just find something else . This product would likely still work for your average or small sized woman .
 This is one of those rare times when the cheapest option actually turns out to be the best . I will set this up by saying that I carried low and large . I am tall and have a long torso . I had debilitating Pelvic Girdle Pain -LRB- including the pubic joint -RRB- by the end of the first trimester that never went away . I had swelling in my legs and ankles caused by pressure in my pelvis . I had lower and upper back problems and had ongoing chiropractic care through my entire pregnancy . I needed good belly support ! I purchased the Prenatal cradle and the Bellybra on Amazon . I already owned the McDavid waist belt -LRB- also purchased on Amazon -RRB- as I had been using it from time to time for lower back support before I became pregnant.The prenatal cradle was the most expensive option and simply a gawd awful contraption . It was not easy to wear under clothes or over clothes and did not offer relief . I found it to actually add to my discomfort . The elastic was too narrow and cut into my lower belly and sides . The criss crossing chest elastics showed even when wearing under my clothes . The vaginal support attachment was very stiff and dug into the tendons on each side -LRB- inner thighs -RRB- . Going to the bathroom with it was a drawn out spectacle . It was not adjustable enough to fit my dimensions well . I returned it.The bellybra was my second favorite support and is a product I would use again . It was comfortable for part of my second trimester , but by the end of it -LRB- second trimester -RRB- , the elastic was cutting into my belly and rolling / riding up . Though it may appear to offer breast support , I did not find that to be the case . A bra is still needed , but the combination was relatively cool and comfortable -LRB- before I grew out of it -RRB- My favorite was the $ 12 McDavid neoprene waist belt . I wore the McDavid off and on through my entire pregnancy and it was the only support that * never * cut into my belly and was adjustable enough to fit for my entire pregnancy . I loved it so much that I wore out the velcro on the first one and ordered another one . I sometimes clipped a pair of wide suspenders to the McDavid belt for extra support . -LSB- ... -RSB- This combination was adjustable and comfortable through the later parts of my pregnancy and could reasonably be concealed under clothing -LRB- though I would always wear the neoprene over fabric . . like maternity pants or a bellyband -RRB- . Once I put the suspenders on , I did n't have to take them off again and could put it on like slipping on a jacket . Just fasten the velcro in front and go . One additional advantage of the neoprene belt was that it kept the skin on my lower belly supported and moist . Combined with my religious use of Shea butter , I think this helped prevent stretch marks that would have been otherwise extensive.Was this review helpful ?
 I ordered 1 size up but still could n't slip this contraption over my chest . There is no way to open it all the way to put it on - you need to put it on like a shirt , which is completely ridiculous . It needs to work like a vest , especially with the extra curves and lumps of pregnancy . Notice that the woman in their photo is not particularly well-endowed . Unless you look like her , do n't even try to put this one . I was afraid I was going to get trapped in it .
 when youre pregnant and needing to use the bathroom every 30 minutes , the last thing you want to do is unstrap an entire body device . also , i got this for pelvic girdle pain and not varicose veins , but it didnt help with the pelvic pain for anyone who is looking to get it for the same reason .
 We purchased this thinking it would alieviate some back aches and other issues but once we put it on my wife she felt it was too much pressure and almost a digging in sensation . Would not recommend .
 I 'll update this if I change my mind , but overall I 'm disappointed.I bought it because I am having excruciating pelvic bone pain if I walk too much -LRB- a trip to the grocery store = too much -RRB- . I also have some bad ligament pain too , but it is nothing compared to the pelvic pain . Desperate for some relief , I coughed up the 80 bucks and bought this . It finally came today after 6 days of waiting on the couch since I could n't do much of anything else and I used it for the rest of the day . My tummy is now incredibly sore from where the bottom band was cutting into my skin . I did remove the crotch covering part , just to see if it would work without it , so maybe that has something to do with it , but that 's doubtful . It also seemed to make the ligament pain worse , especially when I was sitting down . I thought lifting my belly some would help the ligament stuff -LRB- I thought it was supposed to -RRB- , but the strap pressing around it just seems so strain it more . While I was wearing it , it did mildly help the pelvic pain , but not enough to be worth 80 bucks , even without all the other issues . It 's still painful to put pants on without sitting down , and stepping over things or basically anything that involves spreading my legs apart , hurts . The upper straps also cut into my skin ... and that 's not a place you want straps cutting into you.I will try to keep wearing it for a week to see if it helps my hips at all , but I need to figure out a way to make it stop cutting into my skin first -LRB- fleece patch where it goes against your skin -RRB- ? Some people did say they wanted to remove the crotch part but did n't because of the velco . If you love this product , you could easily get some velco patches from any craft store or craft section of a store and simply put that over it . It did n't really bother me , however.As for fitting , besides the cutting into me , it does fit right . By my pre pregnancy weight , I fell between a petite and a small , leaning towards the petite , but went for the small . At first I felt like it needed to be tighter and more supportive , but obviously with the cutting into my skin deal , it 's definitely tight enough.Oh , and it did n't keep the kid out of my lower pelvis either . I was kind of hoping it 'd keep her from wedging herself in there , but nope ... she 's pretty bound and determined to kick the crap out of my bladder ! : -RRB-
 I ordered Dynarex Triangular Bandages , I received Ever Dixie triangular bandage . I contacted seller he tells me they are Dynarex , I have purchased Dynarex triangular bandages before . Dynarex puts there name on everything they sell , these were just generic in a plastic bag no labeling at all . Unless you knew what they were you would not . Would I buy again NO not only did they lie about the product they charge way to much for shipping
 I bought this product hoping to get the Flake that is made in England , apparently after I got it I find out that the box is identical to the one we have in our country which is the one made in Ireland , and believe me it 's not the as good . it 's made for export to multi regions that 's why it has multi languages and a big Flake title in Arabic on the box.I paid $ 26 plus $ 30 shipping for an item that I could 've got from a near store for less than $ 10
 These flake bars have clearly traveled the world and are a little worse for wear . They 're more than a little beat up and broken and the chocolate has a whitish tint that indicates that it 's been through multiple transitions in temperature . Most of the writing on the bars seems to be in Arabic but I 'm not 100 % certain what language it is.With the foggy country-of-origin and Cadbury 's recent recall of melamine tainted chocolate from world markets , I 'm afraid that the rest of these flakes are destined for the dustbin .
 I 'm afraid that Flake as well as most of the Cadbury 's products I grew up with are no longer the same product , whether purchased in the U.K. / Ireland or elsewhere . Whenever I go back to the Isles I buy approx . 100 or so Euro 's worth of my favourite Cadburys products and sadly to report none of them taste the same as they used to . They are now closer to the awful taste of Hershey 's chocolate than anything else , more sweet and waxy than smooth and silky . There are only two Cadbury 's products still worth purchasing as far as I 'm concerned ; the large bars of plain dairy milk , and the Twirl bar . Twirls are more or less Flakes that are covered or encased in chocolate so they are only Flaky on the inside . Smarties , Flakes , buttons all now taste like American chocolate .
 I also received my order from the Indian food store , the writing on the wrapper is mainly in Arabic . These are low quality , I 've had the real thing on multiple occasions and these had an off taste , different texture and just seemed wrong . Avoid ordering from this company at all costs .
 These were definitely not from England . Arabic written all over it . These are most likely the ones imported from the factory in India . While they tasted good , they were not very fresh . Would not buy from this seller again .
 when sending chocolates thru the mail in the summer they should be sent packaged to keep cool or at least overnightthe pachaging was vary poor . i give it one star . the product would have been 5 if it had n't melted
 Do not be tricked into purchasing this product . The product is NOT the really Cadbury Flake . Please see the other reviews as it will say the same thing . DO NOT BE TRICKED
 The Candy bars are completely Fake Cadbury Flake Bars . They do not come in a case . They are not of the quality that Cadbury makes . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER .
 I purchased this item to monitor my blood pressure easily rather that using my medical blood pressure monitor . -LRB- Incidentally , I am a physician . -RRB- When comparing the automatic blood monitor measurements with my medical monitor I noted a 8-10 mm lower diastolic pressure -LRB- the smaller number -RRB- in the automatic unit . I contacted the mfg. and they promptly replaced it with one that is accurate and consistent with my medical blood pressure unit . My recommendation is that if you purchase this unit , make sure it is accurate by having your blood pressure checked by your physician 's office and comparing it to the automatic unit to insure its accuracy .
 Easy to use , but gave inaccurate readings . Took it to my Dr 's office and reading was 20mg higher than doc 's . At home it said my wife 's BP was 140 , hers has never been over 120 . I returned it for a full refund and would not recommend purchasing since there are many other reviews saying this product has accuracy issues .
 Somehow a good friend had two of these monitors . Two weeks ago I checked my BP on a pharmacy type machine and my BP was getting borderline . I talked to him about it and he said , hey , I 've got a spare , it 's yours.I have been using it and getting worried so I took it to my doctors office today to check the accuracy.Omron HEM-711 159/88Doctor 's BP cuff 142/72 -LRB- nurse also used stethoscope -RRB- This is a highly rated unit and I love it . But no matter , ratings are useless if it is n't accurate . Please check it at your doctors office when you receive it -LRB- they are used to these things being off -RRB- . If it 's not accurate send it back . It 's your choice whether to try again .
 After initial start up , this monitor continued to display blood pressure far above my normal readings 120/80 . The device displayed readings of 190/88 on numerous readings . Concerned that this reading might be correct , I contacted my doctor who measured my BP at 120/80 . Also the amount of force on the arm cuff as so strong that I was reluctant to continue use due to the pain it caused .
 This product sucked . I sent mine back to the company for service and they told me nothing was wrong with it . My doctor disagreed with the machines readings so a year after I bought this machine , I am in the market for it 's replacement . I will never buy anything Omron again .
 I recently purchased an Omron 711 A/C BP monitor and was getting high readings at home . I took it with me to the doctors office and he was baffled to see that readings I took with the machine in his office were 10-20mm higher than when he took the BP . We did it at least 5 times . He had recommended that model and apologized and told me not to use it anymore .
 I purchased the Omron HEM-711 AC Automated blood pressure monitor on 2/22/2010 . From the beginning it gave unreliable readings varying by over 60 points reading to reading . We took it to our primary care physician and was told it only gave a `` close '' reading 1 out of 4 times . I contacted the seller in May 2010 and was advised that the Amazon 30 day warranty had expired , and to contact the Omron . My wife felt we must be doing it wrong based on other reviews but I disagreed . Last week I went to my cardiologist and the monitor was reading too high by over 25 points . Today I contacted Omron and they took the serial number and asked me when I purchased it and if I had purchased it new . I told them I bought it new in Feb of 2010 . They said the serial number told them it was manufactured in 2006 . They walked me through resetting it and taking the pressure correctly . It read 186 over 85 compared to the doctor 's reading last Friday of 122 over 82 . No wonder the seller is offering it at a deep discount-it is 4 years old . Omron is allowing me to return it to them for repair or replacement but this seller appears to be unethical .
 This product came highly recommended from a friend who used it and had accurate results when checked against the readings in a doctor 's office . Not so for me . The systolic readings were 20-30 points high , even after careful reading the instructions , going over it with tech support a couple of times , and crosschecking a few times . The other readings were reasonable , dystolic were 5-6 pts high , and pulse rate maybe 3-5 beats/minute high vs the doctors office readings at the same time . I returned one unit and got another one . Same story , very high against dr measurements . Returned the 2nd one . Too bad it is so inaccurate for me . It is a easy to use unit , good instructions , helpful tech support , and good ergonomics . It also measured 20pts high against the drug store meter , but I did n't trust that as much .
 Purchased for my father . We always have to check it three times , and we do n't even trust the averages anymore because the three blood pressure rates we took are so far spread apart . In a month , I have set the date and time at least five times . It 's going back .
 This does not give an accurate reading , sometimes being of as much as 30 points . Very dangerous to rely on this product . I plan to return it .
 I bought Omron HEM-711AC after reading all the good reviews . My only test if the unit is good is to check the blood pressure in both arms . If you get consistent results most of the time then you can believe the unit . In this case most of the time the reading were not consistent . Even the manafacturer recommends that you average out your last 3 readings.On any rate I returned it after testing it with all of my family memberes .
 We purchased the Omron HEM-711AC based upon recommendation from a leading consumer magazine . The price from Amazon was very attractive . The items itself was very easy to use . However , my wife felt the cuff was uncomfortable at full inflation . Worse , we could not believe the numbers . After several tries over about 5 days , it always measured high for her ; higher than any number she ever got at a doctor 's office or drug store BP monitor . And I got numbers lower for my BP than I am used to seeing . So we had not faith in the accuracy of the numbers , and upon her Dr 's guidance , returned the unit . Not sure what we will do as my Dr. recommended the Omron brand as well .
 With others , I followed the directions exactly and used it under supervision of the nurses at cardiac rehab . Tried everything to make the readings consistent or correct . The readings were wildly higher than BPs taken by professionals . And they were n't even consistent . Systolic varied , diastolic varied . Not a good product and as others have pointed out , outright * dangerous * because doctors and patients make medical decisions on the basis of the readings .
 This is the second omron I sent back in 3 months . If i were to believe the readings 190/60 I would probably be dead . I took it to my doctors office to compare . On that day when he took my bp with his equipment it sas 130/75 when he took it with the omron it was 185/65 the first unit i sent back was just as bad , but I waited over 30 days to return it to Amazon.They told me they would give me a partial refund . This was 2 months ago , and I still have not received a refund .
 I bought this product for my elderly mother , so that she could check her blood pressure at home . She was having a lot of trouble with her blood pressure , and her medications were being adjusted . She followed the directions very carefully . The readings that she got were extremely high and alarmed both her doctor and her . She had to make multiple trips to the office as a result of these readings . She brought the machine with her , to show the doctor how high it was reading , and each time , when he checked it with his machine it was much lower . It is obviously defective , and she contacted the manufacturer several times and got no response . I would recomend not buying this product .
 This product is very easy to use ... however my BP readings were 30 points higher than at my Dr 's office . I took it in to compare to their readings , we took my BP 4 times-twice with the Omron and twice with their cuff , on the same arm , and the Omron readings were much higher both times.I think this is dangerous and I am returning the product .
 This monitor has nice reporting features and a very small AC adapter but was very inaccurate . I compared it to a Samsung home model we have and to professional equipment at a clinic . It consistenly gave both readings 15-20 too high and once indicated irregular heart beat . It seems from the reviews of most of these home grade monitors that a few people get poorly calibrated machines . I have returned it since accuracy is critical .
 UPDATED COMMENTS : As an update to the following original review , I want to soften the below negative comments about error messages in the HEM-711AC . After doing more research and testing , I find that blood pressure measurement is a tricky process that can go wrong for a number of reasons . I now believe that the numerous error messages I was getting were due to not getting the cuff over the brachial artery -LRB- partially based on incorrect customer service advice -RRB- and because of keeping my elbow too low.The brachial artery is on the inside third of the elbow crease on both arms . Customer service told me that it is on the outside of the left arm and on the inside of the right arm . However , my son in medical school , and some gross anatomy dissection photos , indicate that this artery is symetrically located on the inside of both arms.Regarding elbow height , the elbow should be level with your heart -- heart high . If you are tall or are using a low table , put a couple of books under your elbow . Ever since making these two corrections , I have not had any error messages . Although Omron does give a lot of helpful tips , they did not cover my problems and even gave somewhat misleading advice . However , they did diligently inspect and calibrate my unit twice , each time sending it back saying there was nothing wrong with it , but not really helping me understand what the problem could be.ORIGINAL REVIEW : I bought the HEM-711AC four years ago . For four years it worked fine , but now I get unspecified error messages at least 50 % of the time . This morning I got 9 errors on 10 tries . And this is after I have returned the unit TWICE to Omron repair with a detailed log of my readings and error messages . Each time , they sent it back saying it checks out perfectly . Last time they even included a new cuff . The first day back , it gave four good readings , but today , it gave errors nine of ten times . I have noticed that one or two other reviewers of other Omron monitors have mentioned this for some other Omron models . I am mystified because I am a savy user who knows who to position the cuff , etc , and had four years of successful readings , so I do n't think I am the problem . Do n't know where to turn next . Probably should just buy a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope . Discouraged and disappointed with Omron .
 You can check your blood pressure three times in a row and each time you get a wildly different reading . Do n't waste your money !
 One gets the impression from other customer reviews of the HEM-711AC that it 's a fine little machine if you read the instructions and use it properly . I made sure to do so , and was taken aback when my blood pressure readings were considerably higher than they 'd ever been . I called customer service and had a nice chat in which the agent assured me that Omron 's products were carefully checked before being put on the market , but that it was possible they might be damaged in shipping . She sent me instructions for returning the unit to Omron
 I recently purchased this product based on its good reviews . The other day I took it to my cardiologist and found that the Systolic Pressure is way off . Now I can pack it up and send to Omron to get fixed which means I wo n't have it for another 2 weeks . My health issues are very recent and I am trying to cope but something like this does n't help !
 It worked fine for a few years , even though I did n't use it much . Now , all it gives is an error message after acting like it 's really taking my blood pressure , goes through all the steps and then at the end it reads `` E '' for error . I have followed directions , tried it on both arms again and again.I have n't used it enough to warrant having to send it back to Omron even if they 'd take it , which they would n't . I 'd rather get another brand of blood pressure machine which is n't so finicky and easier to deal with.Diane
 Upon the advice of my physician , I purchased an OMRON model , used it hardly and never really liked it as it would give different readings each time we -LRB- my wife and I -RRB- tried it and I always blamed the batteries or the plug not being inserted correctly . After a while , I decided to contact OMRON only to find out that they do not have any servicing within Canada , so sent the unit to USA per their request , paid shipping plus repair cost upfront . They returned the unit saying they checked it . Happily put in new batteries , started like a champ and upon first use , the unit simply died . It would not even start . Did not contact OMRON , did not wake up my wife either , instead , took it into the garage and smashed it with rubber hammer that was in there , it broke like a wine glass . Threw it in the waste bin . I dont care about the C$ 99 plus tax that I paid for it but those make these medical items should be held accountable far more rigidly than any others . The unit was defective from day one . WILL NEVER BUY another OMRON for sure and if you are reading this , please refrain from buying their products in Canada . Deeply regretted buying an OMRON .
 Monitor is all over the place and never agrees with the one in the doctor 's officde .
 I purchased in 2007 since 18 year old son was showing pre-hypertension ... His numbers were extremely high with monitor ... brought to his doctor , and he said machine was off , but I did n't take further action since he went off to school . . we stashed away until recently 2010 . . I took my bp two days ago , and numbers were so high - I went to dr. for recheck . All was normal since I take medication , and monitor was way off ... how many times have people written this same story ... So , now I realize I had a lemon from start and need to return , hoping there will be few problems with return .
 Consumer 's Reports just rated this a top buy -LRB- ranked # 4 -RRB- in automatic BP sensors . I was excited . Came quickly via Amazon , but the readings seemed quite high , over and over . I compared it to my neighbor 's model , which commonly read about 8-11 points lower for each of us -- over and over . I then took it to my doctor 's office and compared it there . Again , it came up about 10-12 points above their readings . I sent it back . I do not recommend this model at all -LRB- HEM 711-AC -RRB- . Not sure what to recommend , but not this model . thx .
 I bought this product based on a Consumer Reports rating . Like other reviewers , I was getting consistently high readings - much higher than my doctor . I called Omron 's customer relations and after several minutes of answering silly questions , I was advised to return it . I went to a store and pulled a new one out of the box . While it was closer , it still gave readings 10 points higher than the instore machine . Omron needs to quickly fix this quality control problem .
 I have to take my BP daily , so after reading reviews that were mostly favorable , I bought this one in May 2008 . From the start the BP ran higher than at my doctors office ... usually 10 to 15 points . Same for my husband , so we started subtracting that amount from our daily readings , and all was well until mid November 2oo8 . Suddenly the readings jumped 20 to 25 points higher than at the doctors office . The first time that happened I panicked , brought the machine in , and had it checked against my BP , which showed the machine reading 25 points higher both diastolic and systolic . I am sending the machine which is under warranty as it is only 6 months old to be repaired or replaced by the manufacture . I hope it will then be accurate in its readings.I just ordered a manual blood pressure machine with a built in steththescope through Amazon , and will have it in 2 days . We will learn to use it for BP readings , and to gauge the accuracy of the repaired or replaced 711 AC . I prefer the ease of the electronic BP machines , but not the hassle of the high readings . This machine has been nothing but trouble from the start . Hopefully once it is returned , I will become a satisfied user . It might be that mine is a lemon , and others work great , but from my experience it is a loser.I DO NOR RECOMMEND IT !!!!! Susan
 I gave this 1 star because this was not what I ordered . Apparently , the one I ordered was no longer in stock and this one was sent to me instead . Of course , I sent it back .
 I did n't received the model which I ordered . My order has been replaced twice , but it still did n't send the corrected one to me.Thank you !
 Product is not accurate when compared to physician 's office mecury level device . Product was compared to two such devices and found to be off by more than 40 points systolic and 20 points diasystolic .
 The monitor consistently reported reading 35-40 points on the systolic scale for both me and my wife . Her BP history has never been above 120 and this monitor reported readings in the mid-150 's on several different days . My cardiologist took readings on this product and his monitor today during an office visit and they were 137 vs 174 , a confirmation of what I already knew to be the facts . As further insult , the company will not refund , only repair or replace but I have to pay the shipping both ways for their crappy product .
 My mother has high blood pressure and her doctor wanted her to have a home monitor . We got this model and it seemed to be too high most of the time . I brought it with us the next time she saw her hypertension specialist . He made six measurements with his equipment and six with the Omron and it was WILDLY inaccurate , reading 30-40 points too high each time . The doctor told my mother never to use it again . When we called Omron , we were told to send it back -LRB- at our expense -RRB- and they would look at it and send it back -LRB- also at our expense -RRB- . Since we had done this once already and it still did n't work , we 're just going to toss it away . So much for their warranty . Omron used to be a good name , but it seems they are now making shoddy equipment .
 This product gave an impossibly high reading , prompting a trip to my doctor . Rather than 230 it was really 160 . I returned the product for a refund .
 I bought this blood pressure monitor 6 months ago and used it according to the directions . Until this week , it worked accurately . Now it gives inaccurate high readings in the stroke or coma range . am now looking for a better automatic blood pressure monitor that is not an Omron brand .
 I purchased an OMRON blood pressure monitor with arm cuff - Model HEM-711AC in 2006 at a cost of $ 104.86 . I have used it fairly often since that time and had no problems with the use of the instrument and its readings . I did not use it routinely , but rather occasionally.However , within the past year , I became aware that the monitor and its case emitted a very smelly odor . The odor resembles that of human body odor.The odor was so strong that an individual who passed through my apartment remarked about it.I believe the situation may be similar to reports that concern certain models of Apple laptops that are known to emit an odor of this sort . There is a fair amount of documentation on the internet about these situations.I placed the unit and its case on my balcony and sought help from the OMRON company . A great deal of my time , via telephone calls and e-mails has been taken up in the past few months trying to get the company to understand the problem . They want me to return the product , something that I do n't plan on doing , since even the instruction book has an extremely foul odor . I ca n't imagine taking everything to UPS or Federal Express for packaging.I would suggest that anyone considering buying this product or a product of a similar nature take this situation into consideration . I furnished the OMRON company with a printout about the various instances where the Apple laptop information was posted , but this idea apparently was not convincing .
 Bought one for my Mom who has moderately high BP . When we tested her BP with this instrument , it showed her BP as 165/80 !! We took her to her Doctor to get a checkup done . Measurement using their Sphygmomanometer showed 132/75 . We were relieved that she was OK but were upset that this instrument would give a reading that was so off.We returned it.If you are a serious user , consider buying a Sphygmomanometer .
 Not happy with customer service from this manufacturer at all . Never knew that I needed a large cuff , so now I will be forced to purchase one for an additional $ 25.00 and pay outrageous shipping charges for a 2lb . box to go 120 miles . $ 17.95 shipping charge is gouging at its best.Performance of the product quality is still at large , calibration at my doctors office was way off the mark , Omron says , `` it is because I do n't have the right cuff . Well I am purchasing the larger cuff to see if that is the problem . If I had good sense I would just return the unit for a refund .
 At least I am relieved to see that others are having the same problem . My Omron was getting alarmingly high readings so I took it into the doctors office and found that it was 13 points too high . I was trying to decide if the nurse could possibly have been reading it wrong but that 's pretty unlikely . Since there are several here with faulty readings there is a good chance mine is wrong too . I 'm going to take it back and try another brand .
 I have had this monitor for approximately one year . Recently , the automatic pressure failed to shut off during cuff inflation . Ever since , the cuff does not totally deflate leaving me wondering what the readings mean . I need to find something else , and this time I 'll be looking at real testing and rating information not company hype . # 1 model sold to suckers who believe their advertisements . This is my third monitor that quit on me in 2 years .
 The hospital provided me with this monitor after my kidney transplant . Right away , readings were 20-30 points too high . Luckily , I did n't pay for it.It gets two stars only because I always assume it 's 20 points too high and subtract .
 Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing ... it 's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff -LRB- fits arms 9 to 13 inches around -RRB- and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff!Don ' t bother calling Omron `` Customer Service '' at 1-800-634-4350 ... just a typical big company voice mail hell ! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece ... My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons `` customer service ''
 Gives consistantly bad -LRB- always high -RRB- data . It was replaced once for the same reason and the result was an equally defective product .
 The blood pressure machine arrived the day after ordering it , which I think was outstanding . Unfortunately , though , the readings I 'm seeing are very high compared to like machines and another blood pressue `` cuff '' I have available . I see others are experiencing the same problem .
 I found the blade to be a poor fit for my Oster A5 clipper . As a result it was noisy and cut poorly . I would not recommend purchase of this product .
 An accurate device but I 'd go for a scale that already had these features . Jody Bissoon
 As hard as I have tried i have been unable to receive the correct product . I ordered the body fat analyzer and was sent the body fat loss product . I need help to get the correct product . Help me Please !!!
 This product must work on averages , because if you are particularly muscular , as are a number of my clients , the BFI rates much too high . I would have sent it back but it was too much trouble .
 I currently get my body fat checked by the staff at the gym every 4-6 weeks using the caliper measurement method . Very consistent , very accurate.I bought this in order to track it myself , knowing it would n't be perfect , but it is too inaccurate and inconsistent to be useful . My first reading came in at 7 % . I 'm actually around 14 % ; a pretty significant difference . I repeated the measurement several times , and over the course of 10 minutes , I had measurements ranging from 7-12 % gripping and standing the same way.I tried re-entering my info as both `` Normal '' and `` Athlete '' with the same incorrect/inconsistent results . I also found that by shifting my grip by as little as a half inch in either direction I could get readings as low as 6 % and as high as 24 % . An overall disappointing purchase , do n't be fooled .
 This product is very easy to use , as the others say . But the results are questionable and unreliable . They have as much to do with your hydration levels as with your fat stores . As someone who is trying to lose fat and not muscle , I find that the results are too variant to rely upon for accuracy . I 've stopped using it . I 'd say save your money .
 I 'll give it one star for being kind of pretty . Oh , and it came with batteries . That 's where the positives stop . I do not believe it measures anything significant . It seems to be table based . I started by being honest with the device . I gave it my height of 6 ' 1 '' , my weight of 170 and my age of 67 , a normal level of activity male . It gave me a reading of 17 % body fat . There is no way I could have that much fat.I waited a few minutes and decided to change a couple of variables . I changed my age to 21 and my level of activity to athlete but kept weight and height the same . This time my body fat was 5.7 % . That number is probably pretty accurate . To get your correct reading how do you know what age and level of activity to enter?If it actually measured % body fat by electrical impedance alone why would it need any information from you?I 'll probably get my money 's worth by making friends think it works and that they they have a high percentage of body fat .
 I was so excited to get this fat analyzer thinking that it would give me accurate information for me and my body size . I input the data regarding my height , weight and age just as it asked , I held on to the handles and it gave me a reading . I agreed with the reading because I know just about where my BMI is for my size . Then I decided to input my ideal height , weight and age as guest # 9 , just for grins and giggles . So I put these figures in and held on to the handles . I was thinking that it would error out , or something , because surely the `` electrical current '' would find me out to be a liar . It did n't . It gave me an ideal BMI and body fat percentage for the data I inputted . This machine is nothing more than a calculator . Do n't waste your money . I saw a BMI/fat analyzer at my local grocery store for $ 7.99 . I bet it 's the same thing as this one , only without handles .
 You 've got to question reviews that claim how this little device is `` accurate . '' How do you know it 's accurate ? Compared to what ? If this is your only device to measure your body fat percentage , how do you know it 's correct ? I know my bathroom scale is accurate because I can compare the results to a medical scale used at my gym or the doctor 's office . What they probably mean is that it 's consistent , not accurate.So unless you have been dunked in water for a body fat test to measure your water displacement or via some other proven method , it 's difficult to say that this device is accurate . With that aside , I can say that this device delivers consistent results if you follow the instructions . It is also very well-made . The instructions are straightforward , it is easy to use , and the display is easy to view . As to the accuracy , I can only say after I have something to compare it to . *** January 2010 Update *** Since my original review , I 've purchased the full-body Omron -LRB- much more expensive -RRB- body fat analyzer that is built into the scale with the foot sensors and attached hand grip sensors . The body fat percentage varies with this unit by 4 % ! I am still seriously questioning the accuracy of these devices . What good are these devices if they are off by 4 % ? This is now a 2-star product .
 I purchased this item last year to aid in my weight loss goals . Of course , I was n't pleased with the readout I was getting since I was overweight . I recently got serious about losing weight and have lost 23 lbs . I only have 10 more pounds to go . The Omron tells me that my body fat is the same as when I started . In fact , some of the readings I get are higher than when I started . I have followed the directions to a tee and am still getting different readings every time I use it . In addition , my BMI has remained unchanged . I think the Omron is easy to use and is somewhat accurate , but obviously not as accurate as I had hoped . I think the only way to get a real idea of your body fat and BMI is at the doctor 's office or at a gym where they have a water tank .
 This product gives me a significantly different body fat reading almost every time I use it . One day , my body fat is 27.5 % , the next day it is 24.2 % . I do n't know what results to believe every time I use it . I 'll use it 3 times continuously , and the numbers will range from 24.5 % to 27 % so I do n't know exactly what my body fat percentage is .
 I am disappointed in this monitor . I have HBF-514 and the numbers are significantly different for body fat percentage . I believe the HBF-514 is more accurate .
 Never gives the same reading twice , readings vary by 2 % from day to day . Worthless , and they 've got some nerve for advertising it as being accurate .
 Nice device , but it stopped working about a year after I got it .
 bought at sports academy . i wieghed 242 Ibs . when i started my body fat was 24.6 lost 52Ibs and now my body fat is 22.0 % . and i have cut abs . and bfi has stayed near the same the whole time . the novelty toy goes off a national average of height and weight . you set at the front and just spits out numbers like a cheap caculator . if i put in there my weight is 130Ibs . it gives you a 11 % body fat . junk
 This is an expensive novelty toy ! I 've followed the instructions to the T and the gadget has yet to give a consistent readout . I wish I could get a full refund for this product .
 I do n't want to disappoint you but I will let you know up front ... you 're not going to get what you want ! I wanted a device that would give me quick accurate readings ever few days , so I could clearly track my progress . THIS IS CLEARLY NOT THE WAY IT WORKS ! -LRB- I know you want to see progress ! I promise you ... you will only see progress over months NOT days or even weeks ! Machine readings fultuate way too much . The mirror is way better . Sorry , Im just telling you how it is .
 It looks good , but it is inaccurate . When comparing to a pro body fat caliper , the Omron does not measure up the same .
 I tried to standardize everything about using this
 It is to silly a concept to buy pre-made , does not work to well , it is to small , etc. .
 I was excited about getting this shaver to shave in the shower . I noticed that dry is was poor and I have a light beard ! In the shower it was much better but took many passes . It would loose charge in one week and there is not a portable charger so you have to take the base with you on longer trips . It is very heavy but very well made . I would have to say I was disappointed . I just bought a Braun refurbished here for $ 50 ... and this is the best shaver by far I have ever had over 35 years of shaving . Quiet , long battery life , quick charge , easy travel cord . Try it instead .
 I recently purchased this razor because of the good deal offered in my gold box . Unfortunately , this shaver was not as good as my ten-year old taped up Norelco . The shaver looks good and seems well built , but it takes a much longer time to shave my one or two day old whiskers . It also leaves a sort of sting that is hard to explain . The manufacturer recommends that you use it with a light coating of shaving gel , but I do n't have time for that in the morning . It was easy to clean with water , but a dry brush works just as well . I should have read the Consumer Reports study first before buying this shaver . I would have saved the cost of shipping it back .
 Using this on my legs feels like electric shocks because of how it pulls and chews . I would n't dare use it on my underarms . Very poor shaver !!!
 Do n't be fooled by this shaver 's cute exterior . This so called `` shaver '' does ok on legs , but stubble comes back the next day . I would not recommend trying it on armpits , it hurts and leaves red marks all over - after that you ca n't even put on deodorant ! It sucks on the bikini area as well . And not to mention the amount of noise this lil ' thing produces . In the shower it works even worse . I dropped it once and the whole thing came apart spilling out the batteries . I am totally dissapointed with it.The only thing that this shaver is good for is if u go somewhere on vacation and u wo n't be near a sink for a while.But for now I 'm going back to shaving with a razor , much closer shave and lasts a LOT longer .
 I returned this product . I was unable to turn the unit on or off once the batteries were installed . The batteries blocked the on/off switch from the internal switch .
 Well I have used Philips LadyShave before , and I regret for making my mind to try this one ... It hardly does shave any hair of my legs and leaves a lot of painful red scars .
 This product does not cut well at all . I have to go over and over mylegs to have the razor cut off all of the leg hair.Other than the cutting , the razor handles quite nicely ...
 I need to check when I purchased this item because I will never use it again and I only used it once . I would like to return it . When I used it to shave under my arms it cut me . It is so harsh you need to use it very gingerly and even so it still knicks the skin .
 You get what you pay for . Does really well the first few months , after that , not so good .
 This shaver is extremely irritating and also rusted almost instantly . Wet-dry ... not ! Buy anything else before this product .
 This shaver shredded my skin and did a fifth-rate job of actually shaving hair on legs . Would not endorse purchasing this shaver .
 My husband bought this shaver for me for christmas and I was all excited to use it because I always wanted an electric shaver . God was this thing horrible ! It pulls my hairs , and does n't shave anything at all and I have to shave over the area like 4 times and it just irritates my skin and pulls my hairs even if they are little stubs . I would not recommend this to anyone . I am getting rid of mine and using my husband 's electric shaver instead .
 Not a good razor : -LRB- I bought it so I would n't have to do a contortionist act to shave in my tiny dorm shower , but in fact it 's easier to balance a leg on a shampoo bottle or hike it on the wall rather than spend 30 + shaving your legs with this inefficient razor . Even after adjusting and cleaning it would leave stubble in it 's path rather than the smooth , silky skin a standard razor produces .
 this product was not quite what i was looking for thought had a chargere this one does notbut does the job .
 well , i 've used it three or four times . then i bought a different razor . could n't get a smooth shave , and how in the world it cuts my skin without cutting the hair above it i really do n't know , but it managed it .
 I 've been using electric shavers for 30 + years , and bought this one to replace my worn-out Norelco triple rotary type device . From day one , this shaver did n't do the job . The instructions say to give it a few weeks so your skin can `` adapt '' to it -LRB- whatever that means - probably more accurate to say that your shaving technique will adapt to it since I do n't think my skin actually went through any sort of transformation ! -RRB- . Unfortunately , it never got better . I have changed the foil a few times over the past year on the assumption that it may be dull , but no matter what , it takes several passes to cut through a day old beard , and even then leaves several stray hairs that can not be cut no matter how many passes or from which angle or direction you make the pass . To get these stray hairs , I usually end up doing a `` touch up '' with a disposible razor blade , which sort of defeats the purpose of owning the electric device .
 Firstly , i had to wait forever to get this shipped . when it finally arrived , i was not very satisfied . been using it for about 2 weeks now , but i think im gon na stop . it doesnt get whole sections , and i end up looking like a moth-eaten dog . i dont know why .
 In the begining there was the disposable bic razor . Men everywhere routinly came to work with huge chunk of their faces missing from the totally counter ergonomic razors . Then they invented the electric razor and men came to work with their faces intact but skin as red and irratated as satans ' eyes after a all nighter of smoking pot , and as stubly as your grandma 's legs . And all was good , the guys with the gashes on their faces minded their business , and the guys with the stubly irratated skin minded theirs.And then there was the mach 3 by Gillette . Man kind no longer had to endure daily mutilation or fire engine red stuble ridden skin . All it took was a $ 2.50 a week cover charge and men 's faces everywhere could be as smooth as the day they were born . All their prayers were answered.But alas some men are never happy with perfection . Some men need to stray from the beaten path and are lured into cheap fixes prommissing to save money or time from the all mighty mach3 . Some men are tricked into buying horrible inneffecctive electric razors from heathen snake oil salesmen . And was one of those men oh yes I was one . I paid 50 plus dollars to look like a total moron at work with my blotchy irritated stubly face for the three weeks the instuctions implored me to wait while my `` skin adjusted '' to being painfully , and badly shaved.But I have repented I have been born again never again will I stray to far from my savior the mach3 yes it is expensive as all good things are , but my face is as smooth as as a baby 's butt dipped in oil . Take it from me my brothers as a man who has walked on the other side do not buy this razor your face will look like hellfire .
 I got this shaver because in the early 90 's I owned a tiny Panasonic travel shaver that worked great . This was my first wet shaver tryout and it became a nightmare ! I used it with shaving foam and had to go over and over my neck until I had a raw mess like hamburger meat ! I waited to try it again because it says to stick with it so your beard/skin get used to it-BAD IDEA ! I actually took pictures of my wrecked neck and sent to Panasonic and asked for the dual foil they sent the 4025 and I hope it 's not more of the same . I will write a review for that one too after I very reluctantly try that one .
 I bought this for my husband . He used it with lather on his face , and it did not remove the hair . He tried to use more pressure , but only succeeded in cutting his skin , not the hair . I also tried it on my dry leg with no effect . Disappointed !
 I purchased this model as a replacement for an older -LRB- comparable -RRB- model.This unit , although it works , and is a newer model however it does not work as well . More vibration of the blades then anything else , especially the side burner piece than actual direct linkage which makes this unit perform poorly . It is also showing signs of rust that are very apparent on the side burn blade . I had never had any shave blade rust on me , not even the disposable type . True it was put back in the medicine cabinet wet with the plastic protective cover in place , but I believe still it should not show signs of rust . I have stored many other shavers wet and have never had this happen . The charger
 I bought this as a replacement when my Panasonic ES762s stopped charging . That was a big mistake because this shaver is on the low end of the quality/comfort scale and is not a replacement for the ES762s . My mistake for thinking it could be . It actually hurts to shave with it . The cheap , lightweight plastic construction should have been my first clue . The blade and foil give nowhere near as fine a cut as the ES762 did . I 've tried a new blade and foil but it feels like it is just pulling my hair out . If you have a tough beard you may not be happy with this product . I 'm trying to find replacement batteries for my old ES762s , and if that fails I 'm going look for something in the high quality range , based on other reviews and recommendations from friends .
 Not happy with this one . My son used it a few times and no matter what he tried it just does n't work well . Waited too long to send it back so we got stuck with it .
 Bought this for my son for Christmas based on the wonderful reviews . He used it for a couple of weeks and tried to adjust to it . But , he looked like he got in a fight with a lawnmower and lost . It just butchered his face and he finally just tossed it in the trash and went back to disposables .
 I bought this shaver for my husband , who had been using a disposable blade shaver since his Norelco died . He was , as he put it , spectacularly unimpressed . No matter how many times he went over the skin , he could still feel stubble , and he ended up with his skin irritated from his efforts . He used the Panasonic for a couple of weeks , then went back to the blade and was shocked at how effortlessly smooth his face was . Not recommended .
 Trims well in detail places without guide.Does poorly with uneven cut on heavy beard.Tines on guide are wide , tend to push beard down instead of combing through.Will not make a heavy cut.OK for travel kit .
 The product does not work . When you turn on the tooth brush the brush head twists off . This is bad design for the product . It starts to brush , the brushes move , but the brush head twists off the toothbrush with the vibration of the toothbrush .

 Tastes indistinctive ... not vanilla , not buttery , not nutty . Also has pasty aftertaste . I remember Glucerna Butter Pecan as tasting rich and buttery . I do n't know what this is , but this is my first and last purchase . I even tried blending with lactose free vanilla ice cream and whipping it up into a frothy shake . LOOKED pretty .
 i hated the taste ! not good at all for me , i literally have the whole box since august !! tastes reaaaally bad !!
 people review these things online way too soon.its the same as any other powered toothbrush with a spinning head.doesnt do anything special ... the head doesnt even spin it just turns back and forth about 10 degrees.the heads were used up within about 2-2 1/2 mothns so i just switched over to a regular electric toothbrush for half the price .
 This barely has any chocolate flavor at all . What it does have , however , is an excessive amount of sweetener . I prefer things not to be very sweet , so your taste may differ , but I find it almost intolerably sweet . I also find that when I make it in a blender with ice as recommended it can be rather unpleasantly thick . Here 's what I do to make it more to my taste
 I was really hoping this personal mosquito repeller would keep me safe from the hungry mosquitos that live in my backyard , but it did n't work . The thirsty little blood suckers continued to attack me .
 I just purchased it and I am not sure whether it will work or not , but the 1st thing I noticed is that it has no power indicator . So how will I know the battery is out ? Until the bugs bite me ?
 The ones I receved were not the one pictured . There was no light .
 This product has FD&C Yellow # 6 Lake in it for those of you trying to live as chemical free as possible .
 I was buying enzymes from GNC that almost worked too well . They left me constipated and were extremely expensive . I saw these at the store and they were much cheaper , I tried them and it was like taking nothing at all . I had some left and gave them to my older dog because she was going loose and they did nothing for her either . I 'm looking for a better brand with a muliti-enzyme foruma . These only have papain in them which helps digest proteins . Some enzymes help digest fats , milk sugars and carbs .
 This item is totally useless . Very weak . Girls , please spend your money on a plug-in and do n't waste it on this !!
 I bought this on a lark ; it was n't that expensive and it would have been great if it had worked -LRB- the spray on bug repellents are messy -RRB- . I later read some web sites that describe how there have been scientific studies to show that devices like this DO NOT WORK . Just do a web search for `` mosquito ultrasonic devices '' and you will see what I mean . Well , at least it was cheap .
 My wife and I both tried this mosquito repeller . Instead ofrepelling I truly think it attracted mosquitos . We got morebites with it than when we turned it off .
 Does n't work against mosquitos - at all . Does not claim to be effective against other biting pests , either.Stick with a DEET-based repellant if you do n't want to wind up as some bug 's lunch.Zero stars .
 I used it on a long weekend in the woods . I did n't get bit much . But it was hard to know when it was on . 2 of the 3 made a high pitch sound when turned on , the 3rd just clicked.I did get bit once and put the device near the mosquito and it never flinched . Found them cheaper at CVS drugstore .
 I do n't know whether it repelled any mosquitoes , but in about half an hour , I got several mosquito bites even after shooing away several of those nasty vermin.It is designed so that you twist the tip to turn it on , but there is no indication , e.g. , LED , to confirm . And since it is ultrasonic there is no movement or sound to indicate it either . So if you do n't twist it fully or the battery runs out , how are you to know?Maybe , no insect repeller is perfect , but I ca n't say that this thing works at all .
 This repeller -LRB- if you can call it that way -RRB- does n't have a led indicator , so you 'll never knows if the battery runs out or even if it is working . And the worst of all
 While wearing one of these items , not only did I find that it did n't repel mosquitos , I could have sworn it attracted them ! Once , in the space of 15 minutes , I ended up with over 20 bites . As for the basics , it was difficult to tell whether it was on , and it also kept falling off.If you 're looking for better mosquito control , try the `` Off ! '' brand 's Mosquito Lamp , a candle-based mosquito repellant . It works best in smaller areas like porches or patios -LRB- 15 ' x 15 ' -RRB- , but I can say that in my experience , as long as I had one of the lamps lit , I got no bites .
 I bought this set of 3 because I 'd lost my original one . These do not work-the package said the output mimics the male mosquito , which repels the biting female . It SO did NOT work ! The old version 's packaging said that it mimics a mosquito predator - I walked under a tree with that one and hundreds of mosquitos fled in a huge cloud ! Happily , I found my good one last night.One other note
 When I turn it on , it emits audible sound . Awful , it should be called human repeller . I 'm sure that nobody would like to stay around it . It definitely can not be used in bedrooms . Do n't buy this one . Worst thing I 've ever seen .
 This product does n't do anything near what it advertises . It does n't repel bugs , frankly , I think it attracts them . While it 's supposed to be quiet , I did hear a high-pitched buzzing/humming noise , distractingly reminiscent of an impending migraine . My husband said it sounded like the ringing that they used as an audio effect in `` The Shining , '' and he was n't far off.The only thing it did repel was the dog , who refused to go anywhere near it while it was on , without howling and whimpering . Exactly what we felt like doing when we got near it too . Save your money , buy some OFF ! . It may stink , but it stinks less than this gizmo .
 I have used it since my older model broke and I could n't find a replacement . Frankly , this model releases a audible sound that banished humans . Its not worth a cent for this junk to keep up your space .
 I buy 4 Mosquito Repellers SB160 in order to use when camping.The good thing is the order is coming as quick as usual.The problem for 4 repellers is hard to put the batteries in . I try very hard , my finger nail -LRB- thumb -RRB- is broken , but I can install only 3 of the repellers.I will not refer the repeller to anyone .
 When I purchased this the picture showed a bottle of NADH 10mg , 30 tablets . What I received was a box stating the same thing - 10mg , 30 tablets . So no big deal , right?The problem is that the back of the box states 2 tablets equal 1 dosage of 10mg . These are 5 MG TABLETS , so if you 're thinking you 'll be able to take 10mg per day for 30 days you 'd be wrong . This package has enough for 15 days-NOT 30 .
 I wanted to rate this item -LRB- purchase -RRB- in the negative , but was unable to do so . I ordered this product on December 15th , 2010 , and it has still not been shipped . I think this is absolutely ridiculous . I have never had an experience like this on Amazon . If this product was not available or whatever the case may be , it should have stated that . I could have gone to my local health food store long ago and purchased this -- I just took advantage of the free shipping because I had another item in my original purchase -- which was long ago received . This is really a bad business practice and I am truly surprised this was an Amazon item , not an item for sell by an outside vendor . Stay away from this !!!!!!!!
 I am very unhappy with the product because the battery is no good . My son checked out the unit , and it is fine . It is the battery which is faulty , and I have been unable to get a replacement . Actually , it 's two batteries together -LRB- PN 37059-7 -RRB- . Can you tell me where to get another , please ? Thank you so much for writing .
 The battery is two 1.2 v. Ni-cad 's . Why did n't they just use two AA ni-cads ? Should be able to find a replacement after some research .
 My wife and I both tried this product and it did nothing for either of us . Do n't waste your money on useless junk !
 I have previously purchased a knee brace for my husband from this seller which worked out Fantastic and I was very pleased . I just recently decided to purchase 2 different ones for my 88 year old mother , which arrived 5 days ago , unfortunately due to arthritis in her hands she is unable to fasten them and now have to return them . Upon reading the return policy they post under returns , it states they are not returnable . I wonder why they do n't post this on the page where you order from . Be assured I will very thoroughtly check out a vendors return policy in the future . I only opened one and have all the original packing so I will wait to see and if anything changes I will update this review , Maryann
 I have a few periods throughout the year when I have difficulty getting to and staying a sleep . I 'm always on the lookout for non-habit forming , effective , non-groggy OTC medications . Some work better than others , but none have ever have the effects of Calms Forte.I took two tablets before bed then read for a bit . After an hour and a half , I was still tossing and turning . Then I began dozing on and off , always waking with terrifying hallucinations including sounds , sights , even smells that were n't there . Once I began sleeping for longer periods , I had some of the most devastating , horrifying dreams I 've ever had . It was very difficult to fall back asleep after such images , but when I finally did , another frightening nightmare would transpire . I gave up at 4:30 after a mere four hours of listless sleep.I 'm usually one who will try a product at least a few times before writing it off , but I can not afford another night of sleeplessness . Calms Forte and I had a terrible one-night stand !
 It does work but unfortunately it gives me a big headache and I can not take even a half dose . Keep in mind that this is a sedative and not a hypnotic .

 Life has my mind on overload right now , so after reading the reviews , I figured an all natural sleep aid might not be a bad idea.Well , let me tell you ... I woke up from the most vidid dream I think I 've ever had ! My heart was pounding and it took me about an hour to get back to sleep ! I 've thrown the pills away . Tonight , it 'll be warm milk .
 I never suffer from Insomnia but I was very tired last night and I wanted to have a good night of sleep , My husband has bought them , took them once and did not do anything to him , so I had one pill last night , only one , and could NOT fall asleep the entire night finally I got up at 3:00 A.M. got a tylenol p.m. and 30 mins . later I was deeply asleep . I wanted something natural but this thing is useless . So instead of helping me I think these pills were the cause of my insomnia , would never try them again .
 Homeopathic remedies like this are nothing more than placebos . Take the active ingredient crush it up , make sure you shake it , that 's important , as you dilute it in a liquid solution as big as Lake Michigan . Then add that dilution that may not even have a single molecule of the original substance to a sugar tablet and you have Calms Forte.I 've taken an entire bottle in front of High School classes to show them how useless this is and never even got tired . If your getting drowsy from this it is all in your mind .
 I ate the entire bottle of this product at 8:30 PM yesterday evening . It is now after 1:30 in the morning and I am still awake -LRB- that is 5 hours for those who do n't want to do the math -RRB- . Why I am still alive and awake after eating the entire bottle of pills ? Because these pills are nothing more than water and other harmless stuff . Homeopathy is quackery at its worst . DO NOT BUY this product or any other homeopathic product . Homeopathy is a scam . If you need help sleeping , see your doctor . He might give you something that works .
 Unfortunately these pills did nothing to help me get to sleep , however I did notice I was calmer after taking them , and that is one of the effects of the pills .
 There is nothing in these pills , not any active ingredients , just a bunch of herbal things that wo n't hurt you if you OD on them . Do n't believe me ? There 's a Youtube video of a woman swallowing an entire bottle of these pills at once and she never gets sleepy or sick . Anyone who thinks this pill is doing something is experiencing a placebo effect . And of course , I took 2 of these before bed and was up all night , they did n't work . I wish I knew they were placebos before I bought them .
 I read the reviews and thought this is just what I need . Sounded harmless but this is seriously placebo pills . They do not work ! I do n't have insomnia , per say but sometimes have trouble falling asleep . This literally makes me more awake . No joke !!! I took 6 pills because the recommended dose did nothing and even 6 pills did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ! One Benadryl can knock me out , I am going to be sticking to that . This is my first review ever and I 'm writing it from half way across the globe . I bought it also to help me during the 20 hr flight but it did nothing . So save your money and get your self something that actually works !!! I wish I did .
 the first time i take 3 before bedtime and did n't help me i do n't even feel sleepy!maybe because i used to take panadol night
 I bought this deodorant at a health food store and loved the smell of it . I was really excited about it ... only to be completely disappointed . I have had to apply it several times per day , so much that the bottle is almost empty and I have only had it for 3 weeks ! At $ 23 , this is too pricey to perform so poorly . I did give it one star because it does smell really good . That would be the only thing it actually does ... smell good . But when you start to sweat , it does not smell good , it 's like you do n't have any deodorant on at all . This product does NOT work . Do not waste your hard earned money . Off to continue my search for a chemical free deodorant ... next I will try one by living libations .
 I have been seeking a natural deodorant that does not contain aluminum nor any of the other toxic ingredients found in most common deodorants or anti-perspirants . I had read and seen many positive reviews of this specific deodorant including Martha Stewart who swears that this is the only natural deodorant that keeps her smelling good . The price is very steep averaging $ 25 , depending where you buy it , but I thought it might be worth it , if it really worked and supposedly lasts a long time and therefore a good value . I rolled it on my underarms and noticed that it makes your armpits very wet without putting much on and it takes a long time to dry . I could deal with that . I noticed that it had a really strong perfume and I actually really liked the smell . It was nice and floral , a little too '' grandma-ish '' but was nice and feminine . After a minute or 2 my armpits started becoming painful , red and swelled up . I had a horrible rash . I decided to wipe the product off but it still did not go away even after washing the area with soap and water . The swelling took a couple hours to go down and the redness was there for 2 days . I know that I tend to be more chemically sensitive then most people , but considering this is a natural product I was not prepared for this at all . The fragrance smelled way too strong to be '' all natural '' and lasted the whole day , that does not happen with essential oils . Essential oils tend to evaporate quickly as opposed to synthetic fragrances that last a long time . After having such a horrible reaction I decided to look up the ingredients to find out what was the culprit of my allergic reaction . When I looked up most ingredients nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary until I looked up the main active ingredient . I do n't have the spelling in front of me but it starts with rice - i-olate or something similar to that . Turns out this ingredient is not natural , but a chemical used in industrial purposes and highly toxic , look it up yourselves . This might explain why this deodorant works better then most of the other natural deodorants . I am very disappointed and hope to be proven wrong , I really would like to find a healthy all natural deodorant that works and of course that I am not allergic to .
 I will have to add this deodorant to my long list of ` non-working natural deodorant ' . I have to reapply it several times along the day and still does nothing for me . Still looking for a natural solution ...
 I love Dr. Hauschka , and I 'd rather not deal with the consequences linked to aluminum antiperspirants . So I decided to give this a try ... 1 . The texture is creamy but dries quickly . No complaints there .2 . It actually seems to work pretty well considering it has no antiperspirant ingredients . I was pretty impressed on this front , actually.So what 's the problem ? -LRB- Besides the high price , that is . -RRB- 3 . THE SMELL , to me , is basically intolerable . It 's not floral at all , more like pepper . And I bought it directly from Dr. Hauscka 's website so I do n't think it 's a problem of getting an old product . Even my mom , not one to hate on hippie scents , found it nauseating.I wanted to like this product , but the smell is a deal-breaker . : -LRB-
 This deodorant does n't do much for me . I have to reapply it 4 times during the day if I want it to even barely work . When will someone make a deodorant without harsh chemicals that actually works ?! I 'm bummed , it was really expensive , and I really wanted it to work , but it just does n't .
 This product works better than some , but still I find I that after using it in the morning , by the time I go to bed , it is necessary to wash the underarm area before putting on clean pajamas at night . It is way way over priced . Should cost in the neighborhood of $ 5.00 instead of $ 22 + . Wo n't be buying it again .
 I feel sorry for all the people who have written positive reviews about this `` deodorant '' because it is so awful . Five minutes after putting a light layer on , I typed some emails , happened to look down , and there was white powder flakes all over my shorts , just from sitting in a chair . The deodorant seems to mask odors and smells decent , but I just ordered this from Iraq in an attempt to use more natural products , and I threw it away after 5 minutes of use.Deodorant should n't engulf you with white powder or flakes . This has damaged my shirts in the past , and is a horrible feeling when you 're wondering if you have flakes on you somewhere out in public . Big disappointment , I logged on so I could put this review in because this product is unsatisfactory . It is apparent that this product was no tested at all . I used Vichy Deodorant before this and it was a clear roll-on with no flakes , highly recommend buying that instead . Happy shopping ! - J
 I did n't like the flavor . Twelve ounces is too small . I use large &#34; therapeutic doses , as recommended by my cardiologist . It might work for someone who takes it as a precautionary supplement , but is n't for me .
 This product did taste fine , easy to consume . Did not notice any difference in my body composition as expected or marketed to do . I would not purchase again or recommend
 I decided to try this after seeing on a talk show - along with several other similar products - but I feel as though these pills are unproven to be effective , as most of them are , and actually made me feel more lethargic than prior to taking them , so I 've stopped and plan to return the unused portion !
 This cereal has a good crunch but a far too fake sweet flavor . It has a strange diet shake after taste also.A small amount of regular cereal would be far better and cheaper . .
 This by far is the worst product I have ever used . The product does not eliminate any odors , however , what it does is leave grease spots all over your floor and walls . The grease spots are hard to remove from the floor . Do not buy this product their are several other products on the market that remove odors .
 I got this product from another store . And it will get rid of odor . But everytime I have used this product I always get headaches and feel dizzy . A couple times I had heart palpitations.I noticed it also leaves a residue on the items . Be very careful with leather products and simulated leather products becausethis product and mix with leather and simulated leather in such a way that will give off toxic fumes ... and when this happens you will have to throw the item away.I had this happen to my simulated leather purse .
 This product does not work on cigarette smoke odor in cars in the miraculous fashion in which it is promoted . We bought a used car that had been a smoker 's car . We used an entire small bottle on the fabric surfaces of the car and let it sit overnight . There was no noticeable change in odor the next morning .
 It covered NO odor in my home , cigarette or sweaty sock smell from my Stepsons room . I have hardwood floors & this product said `` safe to use on hard surfaces '' but the residue left behind from spraying the way I would Frabreeze was awful . I could slide like Tom Cruise in Risky Business across my floors after using this . I ca n't imagine how a product that leaves such a residue behind can be `` Non-Toxic '' The Bottle DOES say `` May become sticky or spotty '' but the advertisers website DID not . Sticky residue or not , the odors it portended to knock out remain . Hate it .
 I noticed nothing when taking this . Maybe the other lithium versions might be helpful like lithium citrate or chloride .
 I prayed hard that this lithium would work . It sounded so unbelievably good to be true . I took 2 tabs daily -LRB- the recommended dose -RRB- for 6 months and it had no effect whatsoever . 3 tabs for 3 months and 4 tabs -LRB- double the recomended dose -RRB- for 2 months . It did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ! Now switching to Lithium Asparate . If that also does not work I 'll take Trileptal , the anticonvulsant with the lowest side-effect profile .
 Did n't do any magic for me . . I did n't bother buying extra bottles , to either find out or to waste further money ... I 've got a pretty severe sinus problem .
 Do n't let others tell you what fluoride is and does , take your own health into your hands and do responsible research . It will only take a few hours to learn that fluoride is a dangerous neurotoxin and listed by the FDA as an un-tested drug . Health Canada claims that it is `` VERY TOXIC '' . As little as 7 drops is lethal . Fluoride has been scientifically proven to cause bone cancer , lower IQ , increase heavy metals adsorption , inhibit over 60 enzymes needed in your body , and other cognitive problems and damage to organs . Fluoride was first used in nazi concentration camps to keep prisoners docile . If you do n't believe me read some of the books on fluoride and do your own research . or you can check websites such as fluoridealert.org
 I like the idea of this product . It was easy to figure out and felt like it would give some support . However , the straps that go between your legs were n't lined up right front to back . The straps ended up being off center and there was no way to correct it . I had to wear spandex underneath the V2 support and they still cut into my legs when I was sitting . Finally , the material used made it sound like you were wearing a diaper when you walk . People would definetly be able to tell you had something on . When it come down to it , it was more uncomfortable to wear than and support I got out of it .
 This brace was uncomfortable for me maybe bec / I am pregnant . When I sit down , it is so wide that it gouges me in the belly . I returned it for the plain V2 supporter w/out the hip brace and that was much better !!!
 I developed varicose veins in my second pregnancy and was able to control them quite well in my legs with compression stockings . When I started to get these veins further `` north '' I did n't know what to do . Going to the bathroom , taking a shower , even standing could be almost unbearable . That is why I was willing to shell out the big bucks for this product . I could not wait for it to arrive in the mail and relieve my discomfort.Unfortunately , when it did arrive I was very disappointed . It was easy enough to put on but all I felt was more discomfort . It did not relieve the pressure at all and the velcro was so stiff that I felt like I could n't walk comfortably . There are two velcro straps that also cut right across the butt cheeks which not only pressed on one of my veins but the sharp velcro dug in and was painful . Since the whole thing is basically just a bunch of velcro is also makes noise when you move . I have also had problems with my hips and SI joint but this thing was too uncomfortable to wear to find out if the hip brace works or not.I thought I would do anything to get rid of the discomfort of my varicose veins but it turns out the one thing I will not do is wear this terrible contraption . I returned it . I do n't know if there are other products that work better but this thing is likely not going to be comfortable for any pregnant woman ... and frankly I just do n't think it really works .
 This product will not stay in place no matter what ! Slides right down the leg . I tried several ways of keeping it in place . Save your money .
 I recently received this razor free with a grocery purchase . I normally use the Gillette Venus , but I figured that I 'd give this one a try anyway . Unfortunately , it proved to be quite bad compared to my normal razor.As I was shaving , I kept having to do multiple passes for each area of my leg , just to cut all of the hair there . Even a dull blade on my regular razor would do a better job ! I rinsed the blade regularly , but it kept getting pretty clogged up with hair . Eventually , it got so clogged that it just stopped cutting at all , so I ended up having to get my regular razor to finish up.The only thing that I can say is good about this product is the handle . It has a nice weight feel , compared to the usual lightweight plastic I use , and the metal/rubber color of silver and dark pink is quite nice . If only the blade worked properly!Overall , I 'd suggest that you pass on this item . My guess is that the folks at Schick took a razor blade designed for a man 's face and thought they could sell it to women just by making it pink . Unfortunately , it does n't quite work that way , and it 's not a surprise that my local grocery store is now giving these away for free !
 I was very eager to try out my Schick Quattro . I got a bit tired of the gummy Venus handle and thought I 'd venture out for a more hefty handle . That , and I have sensitive skin so I 'm always in search for a razor that wo n't give me razor burn.As I suspected , the handle was much better . I was happy . So then I shaved.I will never use this razor again.While shaving it did not smoothly glide over my skin . This should have been a dead give-a-way , but still I was not deterred I kept shaving . When I got out of the shower , my legs were COVERED with nicks . It 's as if the razor little bits of my skin off ! I guess there is such a thing as too close ? I have not gotten this many nicks since I last used a single blade disposable . My skin is a bit dry because of the winter , but my Venus does not do this to me.I am DEFINITELY going back to the Venus .
 The blades are too far recessed behind the moisture strips and did n't shave nearly as close as my old Gillette razor . The package does n't deliver on the promise to go `` a day or two '' without needing to shave again , as id did n't shave close the first time !
 I purchased this razor because I read great reviews about it and I wanted to try it.It 's a great razor and it works great -- when the head of the razor is actually on . Every time I shave , the razor falls off the handle at least 2-3 times . It is very inconvenient and dangerous , as it very easily cuts you when this happens . I constantly find myself searching for the head of my razor in the bottom of my shower . Whenever I finally finish shaving , my legs are very smooth -- it 's just not worth the time it takes . This is not a very good razor and I would never recommend it to anybody .
 I have never used a razor , even the cheap disposable ones that worked so poorly . The blades are to far back with plastic surrounding them to reach close to your legs , causing you to have stubble immediatly . Not to mention that the head pops off every other swipe , thank god the blades are to back to actually cut you as the head pops off . I used the mens schick 5 hyrdo first and it worked great , do n't know exactly why I tried this one , I think I liked the color . I even went as far as to write the company !!
 I read so many reviews about this razor , unfortunately mine was not as good . After a nano second use , the razor was already clogged and it was impossible to get the few hairs out . Was expecting much more . Would not buy again .
 I wish I had a good experience with this razor ; I was giving it as much credit as I could , but it simply does not live up to its supposed reputation at all . It barely cuts hair , let alone gives a close shave . True it does n't cut my skin , but I 'd rather that than waste my time with hair that is n't even cut . I thought maybe the default head was faulty or did n't have as sharp of blades , so I replaced it . I had the same result with the new head . I would not recommend this at all . I would just buy a men 's razor . If it 's good enough for a man 's face , it 's good enough for my legs and other regions .
 This is one of the rare times when Amazon totally let me down . I ordered this for Christmas ; it 's now January 23 and the product has still not arrived . I do n't know/can ' t recall whether Amazon was the direct seller , or whether they palmed it off on some other company . Still I 'm out the purchase price -- and never got the product . Shame on you Amazon .
 Now in fairness , and the reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 star is because there was no false advertising and I apparently screwed up . I did n't do my homework and it 's my fault and I guess your opinion of this will depend on what you 're using it for.The lenses are alright and the magnification is okay . but they 're * so * small . I wish I bought anything else but this . A few years ago I bought a couple of cheap radioshack magnifiers . They were similar to this . The lenses were n't quite as good , but they are * much * bigger . Since then , they 've taken some damage and I was looking to replace them . This was not the way to do it ! I 'm so disappointed ! If was n't for me not paying enough attention when I read the specs on this item I 'd give it a 1 star . I 'm thinking about re-selling it because I 'll likely never use this . If I got $ 10 dollars for it -LRB- 40 % of what I paid -RRB- it would be $ 10 that would use , unlike this . * so * disappinted !!!
 I tried this after years of using the schick intuition . I figured 4 blades , better shave ... I was wrong . The razors worked OKAY for my legs , but HORRIBLE for armpits . It would leave hairs everytime ... I would switch directions and go over and over . Finally had to resort to just using razor on legs and using a Venus on the armpits . Final answer , no I would not recommend or buy again .
 i recently bought this razor because it looked like a quality razor for the price . boy , was i fooled ! after having to go over my legs three times with it , they still came out prickly . shaving my armpits with it is a joke ! i might as well be using a butter knife ! i had to try to go over some spots so many times that i now have razor burn ! i am an experienced shaver who has had no problems with other razors , so i know that this is not due to error on my part . i think there are two problems
 I used the Women Quattro to shave my -LRB- blank -RRB- area and I cut myself to pieces . I ended up buying a -LRB- blank -RRB- load of bandages.Schick Quattro Midnight Razor , 1 Razor
 I bought these razor refills because I have the Schick Trimstyle -LRB- a great trimmer ! -RRB- and I like the idea of having a razor and trimmer in one . However , the razor does n't give a close shave on my legs . I have to go over the same area again and again , and it still does n't feel smooth ! This means it takes me a lot longer to shave . I do n't use shaving cream , but I get a great shave with the Venus Embrace without shaving cream , and in a lot less time . The Schick Quattro razor is very non-irritating and I never cut myself , and it does seem slightly better than the Venus Embrace on underarms in terms of irritation and getting stray hairs , but that does not make up for the dismal job it does on my legs . I really wanted to like this razor since Venus Embrace is twice the price and I have to keep a separate razor and trimmer , but it just does n't work well enough . I wish I could exchange this product for Venus Embrace refills .
 I used to have a woman 's schick quattro razor . I can tell you that it is absolutely a piece of junk ! It dulls four times faster than a man 's razor of the same model . If you enjoy working harder for more money to buy junky things and to fill our land fills this is for you . I recomend just learning to hoan and get a good straight razor . It will last literally 100 years and take up less land fill space when it finally wears out .
 If you never try hena with this product you may need some one experience people to help you . It made Mess my bathroom .
 I had ordered from this company before and the color worked pretty well even though I had purchased the wrong color . This one , NO . My hair hardly changed , and it has a sort of greenish looking tint to it -LRB- which is what color the henna was -RRB- . I followed directions precisely and left it on my hair for 2 hours . It is a mess putting on and gets everywhere no matter how hard you try not to . I have used better henna than this .
 I say do n't waste your time instead of money because this was cheap , but so not worth it ! I used this in hope of getting dark hair on my too-damaged-to-chemically-dye hair . The box itself is so cute , with its little bird . I think honestly that 's why I was lured in , by the way it looks . However , this did nothing at all to my hair but make it smell like hay . I followed all instructions , boiling the water and mixing well . I was really excited for this . But the henna did not mix well at all ! It wasnt finely ground to allow for easier mixing/application . This was the messiest henna I have ever tried . Believe it or not , there are some out there that are n't a mess to mix , apply , and wash out . Oh , and once I washed this henna out , my hair was THE SAME . I hoped in a few days when it `` settled '' it 'd get darker , but nope . I have read many other upset users who believe the leaves are too old to give color , and this company uses `` expired '' product . I would n't be too skeptical about that idea . Do n't buy this if you 're considering . Try Rainbow or Henna Hut !
 I have been using Henna for a while now , specifically Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams . I came across this brand and thought , why not?I have very short , light brown hair , which had been colored previously with the Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams -LRB- purchased from Amazon -RRB- . It was time for a re-color and thought I 'd use this brand instead . I followed the directions and got ... a very light cover . In fact , it does n't really look like I colored my hair at all.The other brand , gives me a deep , beautiful , red . This one ... well ... you know when your hair color starts to fade ? That 's how my hair looks now . It looked better before I even began to color it , last night . Yay me !!! A waste of money and especially time , for less than mediocre results . Not happy with results at all . Will not repurchase.This being said , my mother likes it . So I guess it 's really a matter of preference . My mother 's hair is medium/dark brown and while it does really make her hair look red as my other henna product does , it 's alright for her . I personally did n't like it .
 I made a batch of this up 6 hours ago and have checked it on a regular basis for dye release , the only stain it left was a greenish tint when checking it . I will not be buying this again and highly doubt I will apply it to my hair , since it seems that it would stain it greenish brown , ruining the nice red henna color I already have .
 Unless you can not find an indian store , then it is ok . I do not like the price , it os overpriced . I found a store , I was lucky , where I was able to buy a five-pound bag and it saved me a lot of money . At least the greys fade , it is not black , but it does not matter , as long the greys hide . I have used this before , and it worked pretty good , I just do n't like the price , it is overpriced compared to the regular Henna I have bought for more volume and a great price !
 I tried to cancel this order like 2 minutes after I ordered it because I had gotten the wrong color . The seller emails me back , the next day , telling me I can not because it was already being processed -LRB- even though they could have -RRB- . But I decided to try this color anyways so I would n't of wasted my money ... YEA RIGHT . I wasted my money . In my opinion this color is not what I expected . I had medium brown hair and it turned out orange ... like a fiery red , sun orange . I hated it so bad I had to go to the store and pick up some different haircolor to get that crap off my head . Someone else may like it , but I sure did n't . And it did n't help the seller screwed me over .
 I can not say if the product `` performs '' as advertised , as I just received the shipment . But what I can say is that I 'm unhappy , even before trying the product . First off , there was the $ 9.99 shipping and handling charge , which was steep -LRB- but I knew about that from the beginning -RRB- . Then , it took eight days for the order to arrive -LRB- which is a bit longish , eh ? -RRB- . But the real complaint is that there are ingredients in the `` Boswella Cream '' that were NOT listed with Amazon , and had I known of those ingredients , I would NOT have ordered the cream . The two `` active ingredients '' that are listed on the jar -LRB- but not at Amazon -RRB- are `` methyl salicylate '' and `` capsaicin '' , and I did not wish to use either of those two ingredients .
 The package arrived with the seal on the inside of the container broken and open . The pills are quite large but are easier to swallow than the chalk type . If taken an hour in advance there is a descernable difference in your weight lifting output . Slightly more reps are achievable . The affect is more noticible if I am lifting on a day that I am fatigued . It gives you the little extra you need to get through the tough routine day .
 I did n't really notice anything from this pill , maybe it does work but I have n't noticed anything . It 's weird how it smells like semen too , and 50 bucks this product is a rip off
 The insole fit a D with , and I have EEE . So they are too narrow . Seems like a good product otherwise
 The item was broken with glass every where . I had to throw it away , and the only way I could get an exchange or refund was to return all the broken glass and vitamins . It did not make since and was unsafe .
 I love the larger MysticMaid cloths for windows , but the personal size one I used on my eyeglasses and did not like the results . It also seems to have a courser texture and I was a bit afraid it might scratch the lenses , but it did not . I really would pass on this product if I had the chance .
 I tried three different magnifiers . I wear progressive lens trifocals and I have for years . I a hand held magnifier with a Glass lens that is 2 inches in diameter . It is 20 years old and very scratched . It fits neatly in my shirt pocket and has traveled a lot and been dropped a lot . No one seems to make this device anymore . The new hand held 's are usually plastic lens and most are much bigger . So I tired this Bausch & Lomb Compact Lighted Magnifier , 2x and VisAcuity Wallet Light Magnifier Card and 3X 6X LED Illuminated Magnifier Card Shaped Reading Magnifying Glass , Silver by Merax.By Far the BEST is 3X 6X LED Illuminated Magnifier Card Shaped Reading Magnifying Glass , Silver by Merax!The Bausch & Lomb Compact Lighted Magnifier , 2x is too heavy and bulky . And as one other reviewer noted the light does not come on as it is supposed to . This device is far too awkward for the way I use a magnifier . It is my opinion that the cheap plastic case will have a very short life with any use at all . This was the most expensive at $ 10.90 . My opinion $ 1.00 would be more fair . Oh , I got free shipping on this item on Super Saver.The VisAcuity Wallet Light Magnifier Card is in my opinion a TOTAL RIP-OFF ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! It cost $ 5.49 plus $ 5.47 shipping for a total of $ 10.96 . My opinion , this item should be a FREE give away . I will NEVER use it . My opinion it is a total piece of junk ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! And the flimsy plastic case is like plastic wrap . My opinion , this item Should NEVER be purchased ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! The BEST in my opinion is the 3X 6X LED Illuminated Magnifier Card Shaped Reading Magnifying Glass , Silver by Merax . One cost me $ 4.49 plus $ 4.98 shipping for a total of $ 9.47 . This item is Worth it ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! So I ordered 10 at $ 4.49 each . Shipping was $ 13.86 minus a promotion of $ 6.74 for a net shipping cost of $ 7.12 . So 10 are costing me a total of $ 52.02 . Now I am set . I have one to carry and some to spot around my place and Spares ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ ! ~ !
 What can I say ? I press the buttons , the lens pops out but the light does n't come on unless I jiggle the lens . Not how it 's supposed to be.This magnifier is made in China , cheaply , and there 's apparently no quality assurance for $ 10 items . You might get a good one . I just did n't - and I 'm not going to start a return procedure for $ 10 . A better choice would beCarson MiniBrite Pocket Magnifier .
 I was advised by my sister who is a dietician type freak to take these and my cholesterol would be lower . I take them and I 'm still alive . Make of that what you will . But I think I wasted my money and wo n't buy any more when they run out , unless I see a remarkable drop in lipids .
 Not as good as I hoped . Also picture is deceptive . I was thinking larger cans ... and they 're the small ones , so not as much of a bargain as I anticipated . Kinda chalky , and only good if extremely cold .
 My original order was Primadophilus for kids orange and cherry flavor . The vitamin Shoppe 's standard shipping was 99cents . It took a couple of weeks to finally receive my order and it was only the orange flavor . On my receipt from the seller in said that the cherry was on back order and I saw that they doubled my shipping rate to $ 1.98 when it was supposed to be 99cents . When I emailed them twice about the shipping they ignored me both times and I also cancelled the back ordered item with the seller but still received it in the mail a few weeks later and still no comment from the seller . I know it is only 99cents but it is the principal of it and I do n't trust `` The vitamin shoppe '' . Plus when you cancel a back order item does n't that mean for the seller to ` cancel it ' ! I will never order from them again .
 Abbott Labrotories drug makers make this bar with genetically modified soy . I have used zone bars for years and thought that abbot bought the rights to this product from Barry Sears . I 'm still unclear on that point but know the ingredients in this bar and all the other bars manufactured by abbot are not the ingredients in the original zone bars . I called abbott today and they admitted they use genetically modified soy . End of story for me . No more zone bars from abbot will cross my lips.Go to barry sears 's site he still has zone bars he approves of there
 This product did not live up to its claims . Product is expensive and waste of money for very minimal , if any , results ... would not recommend to others .
 This dishwashing detergent did get my dishes clean if I had my dishes stacked just so . The problem is that if you have a detergent dispenser with a door that opens at the right time -LRB- which most washers do -RRB- you can not utilize the space around that door . If ANYTHING is hindering that door from opening ALL THE WAY the tab does not come out and fully clean the dishes . I will be going back to liquid as soon as this box is done . I have had to rewash several loads because of this so , due to this being somewhat expensive detergent , the sometimes double use of water and electricity and not being able to get as many dishes in , it will not be on my next shopping list .
 It 's the best chapstick in the world no doubt , but I 'm from Raleigh and I can get this way cheaper in stores here .
 What kind of company tricks you by listing their products such as burts bees lip balm at $ .01 and then says there is a standard $ 1.95 per item on top plus another s/h fee . Why not just tell the customer the price and not make it so confusing . To me that is annoying .
 I first tried the beeswax lip balm after my lips got really dry and chapped from being out in the sun . I thought the beeswax would soothe and it might have , but I did n't bother to notice because my lips were burning from the minty-ness ! I looked at the ingredients and noticed it contained peppermint oil ! I did not expect that from the label and even question why they would do such a thing . I did n't think you were supposed to use a menthol oil on such a sensitive skin area such as lips ! Overall , I was dissatisfied . The beeswax is n't very smooth or creamy either . I appreciate the natural products , but not this time .
 I 've always loved Burt 's Bees products . This lip balm , however , ALWAYS causes my lips to peel . It feels so good when I apply it and I love the refreshing smell . Within a few hours , though , my lips begin to get dry patches which end up flaking and peeling , almost as if they are burned . I suspect that it may be the peppermint oil.Good old-fashioned -LRB- black label -RRB- Chapstik is now my lips ' best friend .
 The cost of Burt 's lip balm , 49 cents , jumped to $ 2.00 each with insane shipping charges -- $ 14.99 for 10 tubes .
 I bought this as an alternative to blistex and I have to say I am disappointed , it does n't do anything . I honestly ca n't understand how people can rank this product with 5 stars . I applied it to my lips and it did make them feel better for about 2-3 hours but after that it was gone and the pain back . I had to reapply at least a few times a day . The worst thing was that the next day my lips were in even worst condition than before the applications . I did use the product for the entire week and it works well if you apply it every couple hours without fail . It certainly has no effect on healing though as I did not notice the condition of my lips to improve after a week of use .
 The vendor `` The Mind Body Source '' will kill the deal as they want an INSANE amount in shipping . I was going to order 10 of these and the shipping came to $ 15 for $ 5 of product .
 Before you fall for this one-cent offer , check your shipping costs . They will skyrocket if you order many ! Then you wo n't be able to get back into the item to cancel it out .
 not sure if my shoes are not roomy enough but this thing hurts a lot ! even in my running shoes that have extra toe room it not only hurts my bunion it also hurts the other toes as well . this seems counter to what it is suppose to be doing . Not a fan !
 This is my first try at using HG weed . I do n't know if it is this particular brand of the product or the weed itself but it is n't doing much for me at all .
 This product had no affect on me what so ever . I even took four caps . I took it for an entire week total waist of money . This is totally worthless unless your getting excited or something based off a placebo effect . I had no reduction as far as I could tell in my arthritis and nothing even close to what those people claimed about friskiness or anything like that . Blue Goo works better which is a lotion for pain relief . Anyways not recommended unless your fooled by taking pills.I ca n't put the star rating at one because I do n't know how to prove arthritis reduction if I did or did n't have any reduction just know other methods work instantly .
 I ordered these for metatarsal pain and they do not `` fit securely '' as the description says . They always slide out from under my foot while I 'm wearing them . Maybe if I only wore really tight shoes it would be fine . They did n't really have much cushioning , either - they 're just a piece of rubber with some raised circles on them . Not sure why they are called `` Gel '' Ball of Foot Cushion.I also purchased theFootSmart Metatarsal Sleeveand that was what I needed .
 I WENT TO PUSH DOWN TO SQUEEZE WATER OUT , IT SNAPPED BACK , I RECEIVED A BLOOD BLISTER ON MY RIGHT HAND INDEX FINGER , I AM HOME TREATING IT AS BEST I CAN , I HOPE I DO NOT LOSE MY FINGER ...
 I need a refill for my mop and can not find the right size anywhere . Mop refills online do not list details -LRB- size , if they are attached w/screws , etc. -RRB- . Can someone please tell me the length of the Quickie 0272 Jumbo mop refill and if it is attached with 4 screws.Thank you .
 The Quickie web site says that the HomePro mop -LRB- model 041 -RRB- uses the 0472 & 0473 mop refills , which are `` Type H. '' Amazon tells a different story ? Who 's right ? I have definitely wasted more than 2 hours of my life getting the wrong refills at Safeway and my local hardware store.The best use for this mop , as far as I can tell , is to take this mop and smash my computer screen , because my only choice before contributing more waste to the landfill is to take a gamble and buy the refill that Amazon wants me to buy -- the Type J -- which is not the manufacturer recommended Type H refill . Even writing this review is a waste of my time . I feel this mop has aged me by at least 20 years . Cruel world . I just want to clean my floors .
 I thought this was going to be the replacement w / the screws like other reviewers had posted . It was n't . Now I am stuck w / a mop replacement I ca n't use which cost more than I could have paid at Home Depot around the corner . I know b/c I already bought the `` new '' replacement there and returned it , hoping to find the original type here . At this point I will likely have to buy a new mop b/c w/o a replacement sponge , there 's not much point in keeping the mop . Not exactly a green practice but I do n't know what else to do . If I return this useless replacement sponge , I have to shell out more $ . If I could , I would n't give ANY stars but I am forced to at least give one . So buyer beware - even though the picture shows the original sponge replacement before Quickie switched to the quick release pegs -LRB- which do not work in the old , screw style mop -RRB- , that is not what I got .
 My old sponge mop had four fasteners . The new refill has only one fastener at each end and two : &#34; nubs &#34; for the center holes in the mop assembly . To squeeze out the sponge mop you have to hold the middle of the sponge in while sliding the mechanism down the handle . Very cumbersome . I probably will not buy this replacement sponge refill again .
 It does n't hold up long . Gets very flat and provides no comfort at all . I 'm 6 &#34; 0 and 200lbs . Maybe works for someone smaller , but does n't support me at all .
 I hate to be the one to give a bad review on a mop that seemed to be great ... but , My housekeeper was happy to get this since she wanted something easy to use . However the mop wrings out by sliding a grip on the handle and squeezes the sponge to clean , and if one is strong and the grip is pushed in the wrong direction , the plastic head pins will break in one second and the mop is unusable . Quickee Pro company should make the pins metal like the rest of the head or build in a stop if pushed in the wrong direction . So , if this is your mop , be careful which direction you push the grip . I gave my housekeeper $ 20.00 to go purchase what she would use . . she went to Walmart and got something with a sponge on it and gave me back $ 8.00 change . When I leave for work each day , I see the Quickie Pro still peeking out of the trashcan.Update
 Garbage . Waste of money . First time I tried to use the wringer one of the plastic pin things broke . Not the ones that twist on and off to replace mop head . One of the pins in the center of the head assembly . How can I return it if it is dirty and extremely odd shape box that was beat up in transit ? I guess I am out the money . DO NOT BUY , unless you want to take the chance that you end up with a good one . One star was more than I wanted to rate it , if there was a ZERO rating I would have used that rating .
 i bought this mop to use it with floor renewer bit its not helpful at all it makes the floor full of linesvery disappointing
 I was so happy when I found this mop . Little did I know that this was just another flop mop . I broke the mop the first time is was used . Push down on the sponge and watch it crack in half . Give me the old fashion type
 I love this mop . But one can never change the sponge . Every time I need a refill , I have to buy a new mop - because they make it impossible to change the sponge . That goes with every mop company . I just threw away six handles because replacing the mop is impossible .
 Standard , cheap , flimsy , plastic , walmart style mop . Nothing professional about this product at all . Standard plastic chinese made dollar store mop .
 After using it two times to scrub the floor in front of my unit there is no much brush left except for a piece of wood
 this product was a size of a chap stick , and had only one use . I am so disappointed , what a waste of money .
 It does not work . I had razor burn and it made it itch more and more . It was a complete waste of money .
 I have hair on my face and I had hopes this product would help me . What a nuisance . It just dried my skin and made me waste money !!!!
 First , this mop will not fit in the wringer of the bucket shown in the `` buy together '' part of the item listing . Check out my review on the bucket.Second , I 've been soaking this mop for four hours now and it will not soften and hold water the way cotton mops normally do . Not sure what 's wrong with it , but so far it is useless .
 Good squeegie only for a small window . Well made but way too small . Good quality but not wide enough for me .
 The photo made it look so much bigger . the blade is sooo small . not sure why you would need a squegee this small .
 I got this because of a Dr. Oz recommendation BUT ... I have found this has no effect whatsoever on me . A waste of money . Shipment from the vendor was fast and no problem . But I can not recommend this product as an energy booster . Just seems to be candy . Very , very disappointed .
 The results of increased energy were not noticeable to me so I would n't purchase this product again , but it did have a nice fruity sweet taste .
 Do n't waste your money . This product is quite useless and &#34; online &#34; research on this product seems to be made by manufactures of this product .
 I rarely watch Dr. Oz , and have never followed his advice until the show about `` Super remedies '' -LRB- or what every it was called -RRB- . Dr. Oz had this product as one of his `` Super '' energy helpers . Supposedly helps increase your energy . The chewables taste good , but do n't help with energy . I tried a couple the Dr. Oz 's recommendations from that show and found neither did what he said .
 I could n't wear these even when I was 23 weeks pregnant ! I was so happy to get pantyhose that could go over my belly ... but these were too tight and an extremely ugly color ... I would recommend thigh highs when you 're pregnant !
 I purchased this for my young granddaughter to wear at night instead of a case on a band . When I opened it , I found it to be maybe as large as a baby 's bootie -LRB- maybe -RRB- , made from material I would expect an inexpensive Christmas tree skirt to be made from -LRB- the white ones w/very small colored stars applied w/a glue gun -RRB- , and the method of attachment is a large safety pin -LRB- a diaper pin without the decorative pink/blue top -RRB- that I feel sure will pull free from the flimsy material after a few nights . Including shipping , I paid $ 21.95 for this misrepresented `` SleepEze '' insulin pump holder .
 Like all other women trying this , I took it in hopes of getting a normal period and hopefully falling pregnant . You have to rule out major health concerns , and if there 's no bigger issue , this can aide in pregnancy . But for me it did nothing , so i stopped taking it , however , that does n't mean it cant work for others , as i have seen ,
 this product did not work for me at all . I bought two of them and used them all and i saw no change . besides them not working , the horrible herbal smell seeped though my skin and came out though my urine and feces .

 I could n't believe my eyes when I opened the package and found this duster - the selling price was high for the quality but what really got me was the shipping fee which put this dollar store reject over $ 6.30 ! No way - a penny swindle or a dollar swindle is too much swindling ... and the seller should be ashamed for selling this cheap plastic and dyed feather duster at more than $ 1.00 and then charging $ 5.28 for shipping . NO lambswool that I can see in this product . I can say the color is pretty but I would not display it due to the cheap materials and construction .
 I was happy with the regular ultimate absorption poise pad . It is thinner and less absorbent now . I called the company and they say only the color of the pad and the packaging has changed . Not true -- it leaks , in fact it beads up initially , It is definitely thinner than the old ones . I have both on hand and can see and feel the difference.Now I will try other brands
 I too used Poise for several years . They have now `` imporved '' the old design . There are many complaints on the Poise site about itching , swelling , rawness and hives or rashes . This is a big change from the former product . Because I too experienced some of the above symptoms I have notified the company but have found a suitable generic brand . Some have had to see their doctor symptoms became so severe .
 I have bought this product for years because of their quality . THey did what they said they did . I was not thrilled when they changed the design - less product , same price . Because they now make them thinner they bend almost as soon as they are put on so , guess what , they leak ... Very frustrating.My frustration increased when I found out that they do n't even offer their old style pads that were much thicker and sturdier . If I had known in advance what was coming I would have bought as many of the old style as I could afford and saved them ... For those of you who are dependent on continence pads you know how hard it is to find one that works on your body . Luckily I did find a brand that has n't switched to the ` new ' slim style and it does hold up well and is more affordable than the Depends . I am now happily relived using Walgreen 's pads and hoping they will stay true to their style and quality.I am glad to have found a company that is willing to not follow what everyone else is doing and that maintains it 's standard to a quality product at an affordable price .
 I was hopeful but this item did not work for me at all . Ended up giving them away !!! I tried them consistently for several days with no results . I mean no results so these were a NO for me !!!
 This is not like the original sponge that you purchase when you buy the entire mop . It is a piece of foam rubber that does not absorb the water well and does not conform to the floor . You might as well wash the floor with a piece of cardboard . It is awful
 In my experience , most of the screw-on parts did not fit securely , or at all . Which made it very difficult to use .
 I would give the new refill zero stars if I could ... for all the reasons outlined . Inferior to the old yellow ones . Do n't work ! Fall apart ... If you want to let them know directly how disappointed you are , go to the Quickie website and fill out their customer feedback form . Until they work this out , I 'm buying another kind of mop . May not ever go back ...
 I wanted to order the YELLOW sponges because they are no longer available from retail stores . YELLLOW sponges are the real old fashioned sponges that absorb everything . When my order arrived it was a box full of the BLUE sponges that are the new , cheap , non-absorbant sponges that really wet your floor when mopping rather than absorb the spilled liquid . These are terrible . Do n't buy them . When you dunk the mop into a bucket of water to rinse the sponge out , the sponge never really squeezes out the excess water . Rather , you commence mopping the floor and find that you are soaking the floor with the bucket water which leaves lots of water streaks on the floor . This is absolutely terrible . Buy the YELLOW sponges -LRB- if you can find them -RRB- or do n't use the QUICKIE mop at all . These `` new and improved '' sponges are cheap and they DO NOT WORK . Amazon has the yellow sponges advertised , but they send the blue ones . I am so upset .
 I bought this because in the picture it is yellow . Ozbo sent a blue sponge . So do n't buy this one if you want a yellow one .
 Whatever happened to the old reliable quickie refills made from cellulose sponges ? These cheap foams are not only NOT absorbent , but the foam sponge separated from the plastic backing with only light use . In the old days , they were made from cellulose sponge and it would last until the sponge literally disintegrated from age -LRB- I mean years -RRB- . This new sponge barely had any use and the plastic backing separated making it absolutely useless . Cheap manufacturing that not only rips off the customer but adds to the landfills prematurely . I bought a refill from home depot , but the holes do n't align which means that I would need to buy a whole new mop too . really makes wonder about this company.I wish there are better products out there so I do n't have to buy this quickie crap . I still love the decades old mop design though , which is difficult to substitute.Updated : I used Elmers glue to glue the sponge back to the plastic backing and it fell off in single use . Then I used an entire small tube of instant epoxy -LRB- Duro Super Glue -RRB- from the dollar shop -LRB- about $ 1 worth -RRB- to glue one side of the backing to the sponge -LRB- I rubberband it after applying glue and let it dry for maybe 48 hours -RRB- . After maybe about 8 uses or more so far and still holding up . 5 stars for the epoxy and about 1 star for the quickie refill.A few months later , the other side came off as well . Used another small tube of epoxy to glue it back . Hopefully , it can now last years w / light weekly use .
 I 've used Quickie Automatic ringer sponge with Type S sponge for years . They 've always been great mops , getting the job done efficiently UNTIL NOW !! The new sponge material is a foam block stating on the package `` Dry Shine . '' The sponge mop does n't dry anything , except for what it does n't even reach or clean . The mop does n't clean grout !! It takes several passes pressing hard , till the grout finally looks like its been wet . The sponge is not flexible and not absorbent at all . It leaves the regular floor soaked . I constantly have to ring out the mop several times and go back with light strokes to soak up the extra lines of solution that it leaves on the floor.I do professional house cleaning and ca n't recommend the Quickie Automatic Sponge mop to my clients anymore . I really do n't want to tell all of my customers that we have to buy a new mop now because Quickie has ruined their product , but I may have to!If there is any store or distributor out there with the old style yellow or Original style blue sponge Type S size that is not Dry Shine technology , then I would love to hear from you !!
 The sponge is fine . The problem is that the glue came loose almost immediately so I can use it as a sponge if I want to mop by hand but otherwise not as an attachment to my mop handle
 This mop head does not correspond to the mounting on my mop . The screw holes are way different and there is no way to make it fit . Other than that , it looks like it would have been good .
 I 've used Quickie 's sponge mops for years , always using the head until it wore out completely . I recently had to buy an entire new mop after the pole rusted out - hey , it was old . After a couple of months of light use , the sponge separated from the plastic backing . Quickie replaced the head . Happened again . Once is an accident - twice is a bad habit . I 'm off to buy a different brand - metal , American made .
 I bought a Quickie mop recently to use in my apartment . Nothing challenging - small apartment , hardwood floors . It was a few dollars more than I 'd expected , but hey , it came with an extra sponge head . After three or four not-very-strenuous uses the sponge separated from its plastic backing . The replacement sponge did n't even last that long.What a rip-off - avoid these like the plague unless you like throwing your money away .
 Quickie Mfg. Corp. and Amazon should be shamed for selling this product . As a previous reviewer has said , the refill does not fit the Quickie Original Standard Sponge Mop . $ 6.49 thrown in the trash ! While we did not get the chance to actually use the sponge refill , since it wo n't stay on the mop , the refill clearly is not the quality of sponge that comes originally on the mop . By the way , this refill is not made in China , either , but in the good old USA .
 I got a huge hole in them the first time I wore them ! So not worth the money I spent on them .
 I have used Hyland 's Teething tablets for years-for my own kids when they were teething , and have recommended this product many times . I am now watching my god-daughter 's baby who is teething and having a difficult time . I immediately ordered a bottle of Teething Tablets for her . I was dismayed when I learned that it now only contains Chamomile , and that Belladonna , the homeopathic ingredient used to treat inflammation has been removed . When checking Hyland 's website , there was a discussion stating that Homeopathic Belladonna was safe . They further stated that it would take at least 10 bottles of the homeopathic preparation to be ingested by an infant before any side effects of toxicity were seen . There was no explanation as to why it was removed from the teething preparation . I can only say that the Teething Tablets alone do not work . My only suggestion for parents or caregivers struggling with the suffering of a teething baby and wanting to go the natural approach , is to buy an additional bottle of Belladonna 30x , and give both the Teething Tabs and Belladonna together . This would have been the original formula . It is unfortunate that many parents will resort back to Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen and just assume that those `` natural remedies '' do n't work .
 I love the idea of a natural remedy for teething so I ordered the tablets and the gel . I saw no change in the irritability in my daughter . I switched back to Baby Orajel and have seen a huge improvement . Would not buy this product again .
 the product is as desribed , i just wasnt aware exactly what the vibrations would feel like , i was so excited for it to arrive , once it came my bf and i tried right away , it makes my back itch like crazy ! and it did nothing for the type of massage i was looking for , didnt have any relief . Im more of a fan of the DEEP tissue kneading type massages , so if this sounds like you , not sure if you 'd like this product . also , the operator 's -LRB- needs 2 person for this thing to work -RRB- hands can also get uncomfortable from the vibrations . i figured the only way to know was to try it out , im sad to say i had to return immediatley . oh well , will continue to look for something that will come close to human hands ... * sigh *
 The Jeanie Rub was not right from the time I got it . By 5 weeks it was falling apart . Because it was over a month I could not return it . They would n't even send a replacement . If your product ca n't make it 5 weeks you should bend over backwards to make it right . But no , I had to ship it back to the manufacturer for service , at my expence ! After almost a month and 16 bucks in shipping , I still do n't have it . That 's bad service !
 This was far too heavy to use . Although it was the variable speed model , the lowest speed was far too agressive . It actually caused our skin to itch . It was not relaxing to us at all . We went back to our Homedics unit as this was much more comforting , lighter , and more soothing . We returned it and because we purchased it from a third party , we had to pay a 10 % restocking fee and shipping costs to and from our home . Not a good experience at all !
 I 'm very disappointed in this massager . It seems to be a cheap version of Morfam 's quality massager . This one must have a smaller or less powerful motor , and the bottom vinyl -LRB- or whatever -RRB- covering does not slide nearly as easily as Morfam 's massager .
 massager appeared to be used as the motor was not strong -LRB- we have owned one of these in the past -RRB- I returned this for an unsatisfactory purchase
 This is a vibration based massage . It has a similar effect to a hot tub or a jacuzzi . Deep message is not an options for people who have knots and need localized pressure . I was n't interested in buying more accessories than I already had . I would recommend buying a hot tub or when your neighbor offers their back yard hot tub once in a while you take them up on it . Happy Shopping !
 1 . The ` dryshine ' sponge is WORSE than the previous cellulose-type sponge . It does n't absorb water , so you ca n't get the floor really wet . This means that instead of soaking dirt in water and then lifting off the dirt along with the water , you damp-scrub the floor , which is more effort .2 . The sponge-squeezing mechanism is very stiff . In the plus column , it 's a great workout for your upper arm muscles . In the minus column , I do n't want this much of a workout when I am simply washing the kitchen floor .3 . The shaft/handle is slippery . Say you operate the sponge-squeezing mechanism and hold the handle with your left hand
 This mop was a disappointment . It leaves a lot of water on the floor and also leaves streaks , does n't seem to soak up dirt or water.I 'm taking mine back to the store for a refund .
 I chose this rating because the company has not changed the quality of the sponge after my last communication . Sponge moves dirt around . It has no fibers to clean.A good old fashioned cellulose sponge with holes would be the better product.It is a waste of money . The only positive is the squeeze technology . That is good.My floors are just as dirty before the cleaning as after .
 Sure this product has no &#34; taste &#34; but it has terrible texture . If your goal is to mix this powder in a smoothie/cereal etc. in the hope that it goes unnoticed , you will be disappointed . Our son picked up the texture in the first bite . Complete waste of money.btw , after going through gummies/animal parade , this one and four other types that I can not remember , he finally took to the multi-vitamin by Seroyal , Genestra Brands - Childrens Chewable Multi . It has a hint of Mango / Papaya but he has been on it for months without a problem .
 I 'm a college kid and I wanted to supplement these tablets in an attempt to increase brain function and memory . I supplemented one 10mg tablet once a day for about 3 weeks.During week two , I was working out with a friend when something strange happened . We were doing an advanced plyometric exercise
 Did n't work for me . I have memory loss / lack of concentration from Hypothyroidism , i hoped this would help correct that . Also got headaches if i went over 10 mg .
 It did n't help my tinnitus at all . Waste of money . Am now trying ginkgo without any luck so far . That 's about three weeks . I 'll try it a few more weeks
 I could n't wear these even when I was 23 weeks pregnant ! I was so happy to get pantyhose that could go over my belly ... but these were too tight and an extremely ugly color ... I would recommend thigh highs when you 're pregnant !
 I just received my third Flowbee . I have used this product for almost 18 years . It has worked great and I have saved myself a ton of money . I am also picky about how my hair is cut . My chief complaint is how cheaply they are built now . I have all three flowbees side by side . The earliest model is black and built like a tank . It was made in the `` good ole '' US of A . The second one has a yellow head with the word Flowbee on it . It still works well but over time the blades get dull and the spacers break fairly easily . The parts apparently were made elsewhere but it was assembled in this country . The latest version came recently in the mail . What a disappointment ! It still has a yellow head but there is no writing on it . Everything about it is cheap ! Even the cardboard box it came in is thinner and less sturdy . The covering on the handle is shrunk-wrapped plastic . It is made entirely in China . Avoid this model if possible . Buy the second model that comes in a box without a picture on it if it is available . Hopefully the manufacturer will read this message and think about returning the quality to this otherwise fine and innovative product .
 I was very disappointed with the flowbee . It is entirely too heavy to use very easy and also very very noisy . I had purchased it to use to groom my dog , but with the noise there was no way . I have returned the item and asked for a credit on my credit card.Judy
 Ordered the Flowbee Haircutting system from `` As seen on TV ... '' on February 19 , 2006 . Made an inquiry on April 9 , 2006 as to when they would ship . Received an email saying that the order was cancelled . No explanation was offered .
 Used it once and worked fine . Second time I tried to use it it stopped working . DO NOT BUY ! Now I have a $ 100 piece of plastic .
 Perhaps my expectations were too high , but I was incredibly disappointed with this purchase . It was not at all how I expected . Firstly , it 's bulky and cumbersome and was not at all easy to use on yourself , especially if you like the sides and back of your head to be trimmed very short and evenly -LRB- I always wondered why whenever I see a demonstration of this machine on an infomercial , there 's usually someone ELSE doing the cutting on a subject . -RRB- Secondly it was extremely loud . I literally had to stick my finger in my ear when I cutting around it because I did n't want to go deaf . The reason I got this was because I wanted to keep about 3 inches of hair on top , and the flobee spacers would be perfect to use to ensure I got an even cut since traditional electric razors never provide a spacer longer than an inch . However it took much longer than expected because you had to go up and down , and it was really difficult to know which spots you have n't already gone over , especially since the hair gets sucked up and moves about . If you wanted much shorter hair -LRB- maybe an inch and a half -RRB- on top , the flowbee system might work better for you . But for longer hair , your hair will look like a tumbleweed afterwards.For the sides I gave up on the up and down motion and I just ran it along the side of my head , which they do n't recommend . Here was where I could really see the benefit of using Flowbee -LRB- along with the cleanup factor -RRB- , because the hair was cut very evenly . However , the angle attachment is USELESS , as half an inch is n't nearly short enough to get the blending effect . I ended up having to go back to using an electric razor to get the gradually shorter effect which made the whole endeavor pointless.I was annoyed with the flowbee plastic spacers and attaching and detaching them were a pain . Overall , I would n't recommend this product unless you like one length of hair around your whole head , like an afro , although the guide specifically mentioned they do n't recommend using this on afros , or an all around uniform `` buzz '' cut of 1/2 inch with no blending . Totally disappointed !
 I guess my hair is too coarse for the flow bee product . I am using a dyson for suction . The product is not useful for coarse thick hair .
 The product is outdated technologically due to its size and bulk making it extremely ackward to handle and the 1980 's instructions are lacking a great deal of direction in how to use it . The clear spacers are flimsy and cheap . The machine lacks branding or labels . I contacted the company and did not receive a response . This is a company which has obviously made a good return on their one invention and one would think they would have at least after so many years reached out to some of the great minds of the hair cutting industry and asked for their input as how to best use their invention in a true functional manual with current styles . The concept is still stuck as unpolished as the day of its debut in the market ... a clunky machine invented by a handy man in his garage delivered in a white plain box with 1980 's instructions .
 Used to have the old model , broken down after over 10 years . Recently model only last for a few month , a replacement has the same problem.hb
 This is a great product for those who want to style their own hair . However , my Flowbee arrived with broken parts . It 's a wonderful product and Amazon shipped it fast .
 Very hard to use , I had to hook up my large shop vac to make it work , i tried my home vacuum but could n't get enough suction through the long hose provided . I was also unable to get the correct length I wanted with the limited amount of spacers that come with the flowbee . I have cut my own hair for years using electrical clippers so I have always wanted to try the flowbee , but I am sorry to say I was very disappointed .
 I got my Flowbee in 1994 . I use it on and off for 3-4 years at a time . I stop because I need to order new blades . I never did and I would start using it again . I looked up on line to see about ordering new blades . It says the blades come with 4 springs also . I do not have springs with mine so I e-mailed them to see if the new blades would work on mine . It took them several days to answer yes . I e-mailed them back to make sure since because I did not have springs with mine . Again after several days they said all the units have springs . I e-mailed back told them mine is 18 yrs old and he might not have been with the company that long . After several days I was told to throw away the springs . I emailed back to see if I could get my money back if the blades do not fit . It has been 3 weeks and I have not heard from them . They do n't have the best customer service .
 I have bought Bluebonnet supplements for years ; Bluebonnet has a good reputation for quality and price . And so I hardly hesitated to buy its multi-vitamin when I began searching for a new brand . I was terribly disappointed to discover , however , that it contains 5000 IUs of Vitamin A Palmitate -LRB- in addition to 5000 IUs of natural beta-carotene -RRB- for its Vitamin A component . Excess palmitate has long been known to contribute to bone loss and osteoporosis , and women are strongly advised to avoid it in supplement form . For more information on this , google the Mayo Clinic.I implore Bluebonnet to remove palmitate from this product -- 5000 IUs beta carotene supplies plenty of Vitamin A ! For now , sorry to say , I wasted my money ; do n't waste yours .
 This product `` used to be Multi-Fiber '' but is now called `` Cleansing Blend with Fibers '' . I 'm not sure , but it just does n't seem the same as Multi-fiber . Buy only one bottle to see if it works for you before buying more .
 I have taken Multi Fiber for years with no side effects . However , these new `` replacement '' supplements are more extreme , and cause unpleasant side effects , and G.I. upset . I do not recommend .
 I have tried different fiber mix and this one is below what i expected . You would be better with Metamulic than Nature Secret . It only soften up your stool . Once i stopped using it , it take a few day before my system goes back to normal . I think different people have different result with this fiber mix . I have better result with metamucil with lesser problem .
 I am in my late 20s and been getting gray hair on my head and beard . I have been using Nature 's way Fo-Ti for a little over seven months , hoping it helps with the gray hair . I have not seen any improvement . The number of gray hair have been increasing over this time period . Wonder if Fo-Ti helping people with gray is nothing but a fake hype . My experience with Advanced Shou Wu , which I used before Nature 's way Fo-Ti , has been the same . I will continue using it for another 5 months and share my experience again.FYI , there are no visible side effects of the product though . Hope nothing is getting burnt from inside .
 Fo-ti also called He Shou Wu is best when it is in its prepared form rather than in this unprepared form . In its unprepared form it is not as effective and not as concentrated as an extract and for some causes a laxative effect and for some has also caused liver damage.This is something that will not be a side effect of the prepared and cured form of He shou wu.Something that was not shown on the amazon website is the other ingredient included in these capsules are Magnesium stearate which according to the FDA is safe for consumption in small concentrations but is harmful in high concentration.If u do your own research though on this ingredient you 'll find that it is not exactly something you want in your body . It is used to make manufacturing more efficient as a lubricant . This other ingredient is listed on the Nature 's way website after you search for fo ti and look at the ingredients on the product 's website . My recommendation would be to get an extract and prepared form such as the He Shou Wu from Dragon Herbs.It is more expensive but it is surely to be more effective and safer.Don ' t take my word for this do your own research and decide for yourself .
 I have just started using fo-ti in addition to eleuthero all by natures way for four days now and I am experiencing its effectiveness . my lower back pain , knee pain and light headness are reduced . i hope by the time I finish one bottle each evertthing will disappear.My heart has also stopped palpitating . i did not experince any diarrhea from using the fo-ti rootI am from Ghana
 I like the product and the gel does wonders for my feet , however , I order mesh tubes that I could cut to fit and they sent me individual toe wraps which are too large for my small toes . I was not happy !!
 I bought some of this for a diet , but the flavor lacks and it is n't very filling . It does n't matter how I prepare it , it does n't taste any better and the texture is not right .
 I take a lot of protein powder so I 'm used to the taste , but the Strawberry Designer Whey protein is among the worst I 've ever had . Very chemical taste . Go with Optimum Nutrition .
 I read some reviews favoring vanilla 's flavor , so i tried . Guest what ? it was disgusting . One breath-hold and swallow . I 've paid for it ! Thankfully and finally i ate it all . Have you ever try unflavored ?
 I have tried a lot of different protein mixes and the chocolate and vanilla designer whey favors were my preferred choices for years . Last year I got a can of vanilla that tasted really bad . I thought it was a fluke and got a can of chocolate recently . It also tastes bad . They changed their label recently . I do not know if that corresponded to a change I the actual mix , but whatever the case , it has gone downhill .
 I bought this with high hopes . My cousin had the same model , and i thought i would get similar results.Doing a bit of research , the model came more or less highly recommended . . I bought this factory reconditioned model , and tried it out ... The first shave was alright ... no bumps or anything . irritated the skin a bit -LRB- as expected -RRB- and i continued for three weeks . Subsequent shaves were horrible ... I do not know if is my hair type -LRB- coarse , curly -RRB- and skin type -LRB- very sensitive -RRB- but the razor always left stubble in the same areas ... attempts at going closer would leave my skin raw and tender , and then the rzor bumps kept on coming . The reason for buying this unit was to avoid razor bumps and get a close shave . This unit was touted as being able to do both , but in my case failed sadly ... If you have the same type of hair as me -LRB- curly , coarse -RRB- you may do best to look elsewhere . . Disappointed , I gave it to my brother in law , and hoped he had better results . . I 'm back to razors and cream ...
 I got my Braun 7526 syncro shaver but I am very diappointed.When I turned it on , I shakes radically , which made it veryuncomfortable and difficult to shave . I do n't whether this isa common problem of this kind of shaver or just mine has thisproblem.I must return it .
 Works OK , but it 's loud and the cleaning solution is a pain to deal with . Better to just rinse it off .
 Great razor for about a month . Then it just flat out stopped working . Best of all , you ca n't return or exhange it through Amazon after 30 days . Your taking a big rish if you buy this item . - Scott , So Cal
 Infuriating . It takes 20 to 30 minutes to shave with the Braun 7526 . The screen keeps popping off ! I 've used it for only 7 months , but I am going to have to look for a new one . It wo n't be a Braun.I later learned the foil stays on if you push on the black plastic wings on the side of the foil and not on the top of the foil . So , now I 'd give it 3 stars .
 I also received the unit without the charging/self cleaning stand and no cartridge . The ad clearly states this is a self cleaning shaver with a cleaning cartridge provided . It 's not self cleaning without the stand . Where is the cartridge -LRB- also not sent -RRB- , supposed to go-without the stand ? Amazon sent me a second shipment , and it too was missing the same items . There is clearly a communication problem between amazon advertising and amazon shipping . My one star is based on the fact that I did not receive a complete shipment , and ca n't use the item . My first bad experience with amazon .
 The product is not as described , DOES NOT come with charger nor cleaner refil.BUYER BEWARE !
 I use this every now and then but it takes forever to get a decent shave , probably will be last refurb I ever buy . I have the feeling if I bought a new set of blades it would be night and day . If something is sold as a refurb is n't it supposed to be inspected and brought up to factory standards . As far as construction of unit and battery life they are fine . I happened to be writing a review for a brilliant Oral Breeze irrigator when other products I bought came up for review so decided to state my piece on this even though I 've had it for six months or more . I 'm convinced it is a good product and design , but was sent out with worn out blades . I 've never been much of an electric shaver fan but using a friend 's at his weekend house was impressed - totally different experience than what I received . I should have complained right away . I 'm told that most refurbs are not done at the factory but contracted out to refurb houses , I ca n't imagine Braun -LRB- a company I 've always respected -RRB- sending out a unit like this . You would think blades , even as a matter of hygiene , would be totally replaced in a refurb .
 I purchased this razor factory refurbished and loved it , it would stay charged for 3 weeks . After about 6 months it would stay charged for less and less time . Finally it would hardly hold a charge at all and would only work plugged in , even then it was very slowed down and weak . I ended up purchasing a newer model brand new with a 2 year warranty . It works great , even got the cleaner/charger stand this time .
 I did n't not receive all the self cleaning parts nor did customer service want to help much over the phone . The text has been changed since and so I had to fight them on what it said when I ordered . If it had n't been for the other reviews I 'd not have gotten my point across . Thanks guys ! This is now the second problem I 've had with Amazon . Are they not trying as hard ? At least they gave me a 20 % refund for all the hassle.The actual shaver is great , works well , but now I have to find a cleaning base to complete it . Feels much better then my old Braun which lasted many years . It is a great shaver .
 I have always used an electric shaver . This product is my first Braun and it is large enough to fit my hand . Even using preshave , it takes more than 7 slow storkes to get most of the beard , more than 12 and still a slight stubble remains . It did not come with a charger-cleaner base . I find this is not necessary as releasing the foil & running for 5 seconds clears the cutters . Every third day I remove the foil & cutters , rinsing under hot water & gently brushing , then setting aside till dry . When I want a realy close shave I resort to my 1950 AC-DC Remington three head flat bar shaver .
 Beware it does n't include the base . Amazon sells it without metioning this point . I have seen these exact same reconditioned model sold on ebay etc. and they all point out that fact . I emailed Amazon and they said it was too big of a problem to fix eight weeks ago . They still have n't updated their site to state that this does not include the cleaning base like a braun 7526 should . Truth in advertising is very impotant on the internet .
 I have been using Norelco since past 3 years . I tried to go for Braun 7526 after reading all the reviews . Unfortunately , my experience was not good.Pros : + + Little bit closer shave then Norelco . + + Good Price . Amazon rocks !! Cons : -- Need to clean every 2-3 days where as Norelco can be cleaned every 2 weeks . -- Unit was not very clean as described . -- Difficult to shave 2 or more days of growth . -- More noisy then Norelco -- Very Low Durability . The foil on my shaver is broken in just 3 months and it is not covered under warranty . So , I need to spend about $ 30 to replace the foil and cutter as they come together . I will rather discard this unit all together . -- Customer Service at Braun not upto professional standard .
 i am not sure if the dead battery was caused by `` wet shaving '' for a few times . before that -LRB- dry shaving for a few months -RRB- , it worked just nicely and the cut was as close as it gets . once i found i could get shaving results even better with `` wet shaving '' , i started to use it with shaving gel . after a few times , it died and battery would never recharge again . IT IS RECONDITIONED anyway , i thought , so $ 40 went to drain . i guess that 's what it was worth with .
 I am 34 and have been using Braun shavers for my entire life . I have always been pleased with their products except for this one.It just does n't pick up the hairs on your face unless you go back and forth 10-15 times . Everything else is fine on the shaver . It just does n't work unless you continually go back and forth over the area . I am very disappointed with Braun .
 The shaver I got was not good at all . After 10 minutes of shaving , I had to use a razor to finish . Maybe it was just mine that was bad , but I 'm returning it .
 This is my second Braun . I enjoy the cleaning system BUT this is my second Braun electric razor in 26 months that has DIED?The shave is as good as the foil Panasonic but my Panasonic after 6 years is still working.There is DEFINITELY a problem with this model . 1 year use and throw it away ! It resembles the realiability length of time as 20 BIC RAZORS . I love electric razors but for $ 140.00 they should last longer than 1 year .
 I went through two of these shavers , neither of which would recharge properly . Now Amazon is seeking to levy an undisclosed $ 10 restocking fee on the return of a defective product . There 's a reason these shavers are cheap - they 're lemons , and you 'll pay $ 10 for the privilege of trying one and returning it .
 - This thing was never able to give me a close shave on the neck unless I attacked each hair individually-This morning , after just a couple of months , a plastic piece brokeI 'm going back to my Norelco
 Although everything about this product clearly states that it is a `` Smart Logic Shaver , '' that is not what you will receive . What you will get is a Braun 7505 with an extra LED , low battery to be exact . But no where on the box , or in the user guide does it say anything about `` Smart Logic . '' So despite the fact this is supposedly a great shave , this one is going back because I did not receive what I was sold .
 I am over 60 and I have been using Braun shavers all my life . This was the finest one for about 2 years . By now it stopped shaving . It became noisy and takes forever to get anything but a close shave . I noticed that the cutting block has a huge play . It has probably reached the level when it does not move through an entire hole in the foil any more . I do not think replacing the block would help since the hole in the plastic part that tranfers the motion to it got enlarged . Looks like it is a design flaw . Other customers who complain about the slowness of the shaving and noise most likely experiencing the same problem in progeress .
 I have used a Norelco shaver for a couple of years , and the battery recently stopped holding a full charge . So , I thought I 'd give this Braun 7526 a chance ; certainly , the reasonable cost of a re-conditioned unit and the good reviews listed on this site were major factors in the decision.When I first shaved with it , the shaves had poor results ... lots of beard left on my neck and in the mustache area and many repetitions to get it sort of cleaned up . I figured I 'd give it some time and took it on a two month trip ... the bad part of the decision being that I left my Norelco at home . For the whole two months , the shaves were the same ... very poor relative to the easy and quick ones I was used to with my old Norelco . So , I 'm now back in the Norelco family with a new 9160 XL and the shaves are even better than with the old one . The Braun was a waste of money for me .
 Impressed with the Braun name , and having read a few reviews warning about factory reconditioned units , I purchased it anyway at a great $ 39.95 price . Ultimately , the problem was the cheap little plastic ON/OFF switch . Move it up and the shaver turned on . With much effort , I finally got the switch to slide up higher to the `` clipper '' mode . Problem was , it stayed stuck in this mode and would not budge downward . When I finally did get it down , the thin metal element beneath the switch was damaged . What a cheap , crappy switch Braun decided to use ! Why , who knows . Amazon promptly refunded my money . Thanks .
 This is really a bad deal . The 7526 was first made 8 years ago and has since been followed up with 2 more Braun model series -LRB- the 8000 and 5 series -RRB- . Price wise , this model is not much less than the subsequent models.In fact , this reconditioned model does NOT come with the cleaning/charging base . On Amazon you can get this model WITH the charging base for about $ 1.11 moreBraun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean & Charge Storage Stand . I think it 's quite clear that it would be foolish to buy this reconditioned model .
 I purchased this good shaver , plugged it in for 6hrs and expected my new shaver to caress my face . However , it never worked ! My wiskers are going to have to stay on for an extra day . The factory recommended that the new charger be plugged in for 4 hrs . I did that and 2 more ! As we speak , I have the shaver plugged in , the red light is flashing -LRB- this indicates that less than 20 % of a charge on the battery -RRB- , and my bushy face is getting bushier . Buyer beware ! Also , this product DOES NOT come with the cool Clean & Charge Storage Stand . Bummer .
 This unit looked old and worne , it was old and worne , the battery would NOT charge . What a piece of JUNK .
 My dissasitsfation with this razor is about the design not the fact that it has been refurbished . It works like it is supposed to , it just happens that it ca n't cut a thing.I suffer from folliclitus , and I am extremely frustrated by every razor thinking that the only thing that men care about is how close it shaves . Neither myself or any of the men in my family care how close of a shave they get , the real issue is irritaion and whether the razor actually cuts what it is supposed to cut.This razor shaves close enough , but misses massive amounts of hair especially on the neck and under the chin area . The long hair trimmer simply does n't work . The blade moves , but run it over some hair and nothing ever happens except you maybe irritate your face a little bit more trying to cut the hair that the normal head left behind.Bottom Line
 I bought this same shaver from Amazon last month -LRB- a refurb model -RRB- . It arrived in great shape , and it works as expected . But after giving myself plenty of time to adjust to my first electric razor , I can tell you confidently that it is NOT blade-close . I doubt any electric is , really . I have to shave twice a day with this thing if I 'm going out in the evening . Not so with my old 50-cent disposable twin blade . Even right after shaving I ca n't get my lower jaw or neck as smooth as a twin blade could . And how 's this - it takes LONGER to shave in the morning than it used to!So why am I still using it ? Good question . Maybe I 'll post mine for sale .
 This shaver barely maked a dent in my beard . To get anywhere near to a close shave , I must go over the area repeatedly . Even , then , my disposable razors far outshine this debacle . After I saw that it was not an every-day shaver for me , I was going to use it when I travel , just to touch up . Even then , it 's not a real shaver . I saw other good reviews . Do you have peach fuzz for a beard ? Mine is , I think , average . At any rate I am going to try and return this . Whew !
 I used to own a Syncro 7570 which was top of the line when I bought it . I was extremely happy with it and can honestly say it was the best reazor I ever owned . Sadly I left it behind by mistake on a vacation . So , I took the cheap route and bought a refurbished 7625 to replace it . I assumed it was basically the same razor without the LCD display but was sadly disappionted . It is far louder , much more rough against the skin , vibrates radically and does n't shave as close . I really miss my 7570 !
 The first one I received did n't work . Exchange is fairly convenient , but I have read other reviews with the same problem .
 I bought this reconditioned shaver , thinking that it would work like a brand new shaver . However , it simply broke down after using it for less than a month and now even plugged , it does not work . Very disappointed , will never purchase another `` reconditioned '' machine .
 The seller needs to do a little research . The 7526 is the shaving system with the automatic cleaner . What is advertised here is the 7505 shaver only .
 I am used to shaving with a Norelco 3 head shaver and decided to purchase a Braun . Here are the results : Pros :1 . Cool factor2 . Cleaning station works well3 . Keeps good chargeCons :1 . Noisy ! 2 . Odd shape and difficult to hold3 . Heavy4 . Can not shave neck areas well at all -LRB- I have already shaved 10 times with it , so it is not training -RRB- 5 . Cut hair falls down -LRB- have to shave in front of sink -RRB- 6 . Price - not worth the price -LRB- incl cleaning station -RRB-
 in this case , reconditioned = lemonthe switch is defective , and I 'm almost certain was the original problem ... otherwise why would it have to be RE-conditioned ? oh , the switch worked well for the first few times , but soon it became evident it had to be repeatedly repaired ~ by me ~ OH YES , IT 'S A LEMON ALRIGHT ... and I lose ... lesson learned ?
 I was eager to avoid the bells and whistles of the RETAIL version , and opt for this fantastic price for the RECONDITIONED shaver . When it arrived , I was immediately suspect to it 's quality , as there was a visable CRACK in the lower part of the shaver . The packaging was as minimal as you 'd expect -LRB- it would have come better prepared off CRAIGSLIST -RRB- ~ After plugging it in for a few hours , then turning it on , it was louder than any shaver I had purchased before ... but ever the optomist , I decided that I should give it a try . I had read other `` favorable '' reviews , and decided it was now my turn to test this item . After a lame attempt at a smooth shave , I tried again . Still it was weak on removing the hairs that were not all growing in the same direction . In summary , I sent it back and wished I had never ordered it . I guess when they say , `` IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE , THAN IT IS ... '' is pretty much accurate when it comes to this Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver . AVOID IT AT ANY COST .
 Do not buy this razor if you want something that lasts longer than 6 months . I was delighted with this razor when I first got it . It shaves cleanly and smoothly , much better than the Remington it replaced . But soon after I got it , the light that indicates it is fully charged stopped working . No big deal ; I charge it for several hours when it needs it and that seemed to do the trick . However , now the power cuts off to razor whenever you add any pressure to the front -LRB- the side where the power slide-button is located . -RRB- This also happens to be where you hold the razor when you shave . This means that shaving has now become impossible without contorting my hand into a ridiculous , uncomfortable position which reduces shave quality and increases shave time , basically rendering this thing useless . Save your money for something else .
 I am very disappointed with this shaver.Try as I might I do not get a close shave.The stubble simply stays there.So I am shaving with a razor blade now 2x a week to keep myself well groomed.My previous shaver was a Norelco which I used for 14 years , until it stopped charging , it always gave me a decent shave . John Le Cheminant .
 Use extreme caution when ordering this item . Some parts may be missing , and customer service will NOT refund you your whole purchase price even if it is there error . They will blame the return on you and charge you a $ 10.00 restocking fee and $ 4.00 for shipping . BUYER BEWARE !
 Bought one of these brand new , used it for 2 months , then it would n't hold a charge for more than a minute or so.Returned it . Smart battery technology , huh ?
 The refurbished 7526 I received had 4 blades missing from one side , you have to look very closely . It shaves much better with a new blade but that cost $ 25 , I did n't catch it time for a return . For the total price I could have bought a new one . Learn from my mistake ! Check that blade ASAP .
 I Bought a reconditioned mod .7526 shaver . I get better shaves using a dull razor .
 Do n't be fooled by the low , low price . They keep the cleaning stand , and for the price of the stand , you might as well buy a new unit -LRB- shaver and stand together -RRB- instead of trying your luck with a reconditioned shaver . I feel like I 've been ripped off !
 Due to the fact that certain blood born infections remain virulent despite heat and chemical attempts at disinfection , hospitals now use ALL disposable instruments . Scissors , staple removers , forceps , as well as syringes , scalpels , and sutures are SINGLE USE . Hepatitis C patients are universally counseled to keep razors inaccessable to children and guests . In my opinion , the resale of used razors should not be permitted , as the reuse of contaminated instruments is not permitted .

 I ordered this shaver yesterday . Received confirmation today that it shipped already . Thats good . I 'm sure that I will enjoyed the shaver , but today you have lowered the price by five dollars . I feel cheated .
 Never received the Braun shaver but would like to.Could you check it out?ThanksDon Smith
 `` RECONDITIONED shaver does NOT come with Clean & Charge Base `` It 's worthless if you do n't get that . Just make sure you know what your doing when you order it . I just noticed it so I 'm not going to get the RECONDITIONED one .
 Hold on to your warranty . The manufacturer has has a lot of problems with the motor . You will know you have a problem when it starts sounding like it is about to fall apart . And repair shops are having a difficult time getting replacement motors . I 've waited for three months for a replacement motor . Fortunately , the motor noise does n't effect shaving ability , which is adequate .
 I received this shaver in June , 2004 . It quit working in August , 2004 . I sent it back to the factory and received a replacement in September , 2004 . This second shaver quit working in December , 2004 . I have n't sent it back yet for another replacement because I have no confidence in getting another shaver that will have a reasonable life . I intend to make a claim to get my money back to buy a Norelco.My previous shaver was a triple head Norelco . The Braun shave is maybe as good as the Norelco but the Norelco rotary heads provide a quicker shave with fewer passes . The Norelco battery is much better . It lasted over 3 weeks per charge for well over 7 years then started to dwindle down for then next three years.The Braun battery lasts 2 weeks per charge when new .
 This is my first electric shaver and there is no comparison with a razor . First of all , it takes a long time to shave and it leaves a big mess . If you have a thick shave like I do , you will need your handy gillette shaver eventually , to do the fine cleaning under the chin.I am going back to my gillette shaver .
 The shaver was faulty . I charged it when I got it . Then it required recharging after two two minute uses . The same thing happened again , and I called you . I received a new one from you today , so we shall see .
 Works great when plugged into AC but wo n't function after about two days in cordless mode -LRB- wo n't stay charged -RRB- w/normal use .
 When I first got the shaver it seemed to have a STRONG motor and still does . However it rattles , it 's loud , I have to shave 3 times longer to do the job than previous models of Braun I 've owned . I have an old worn out Braun that barely runs and still it shaves me with less passes than the new one . I even have the CLEANER set up for it . The cleaner cartridges are costly and need to be changed more frequently than I expected . Anyway , I AM a Braun fan and always will be but I think this one needs some work !
 This product does not measure up to a Norelco shaver -- not even close . The overall battery life is shorter and you get fewer shaves per charge . The 3-head system of the Norelco makes it easier to shave curved areas under you chin , etc. . Also , the Braun does not collect whiskers , instead when you are finished shaving , you find a layer of whiskers on your shirt . The Norelco does a fine job of capturing whiskers in the shaving head and keeping you clean . I had a Norelco for years , then bought a Braun . I have used it for over a year and have recently returned to Norelco , a much better product .
 With my five year old Norelco overdue for replacement I went hunting for a new razor . Based upon the reviews given this razor , and the price , I decided to give it a try . Bad move on my part , it does not shave nearly as well as the old Norelco . I will never make the mistake of buying a Braun again .
 Absolutely junk , will not buy anything from Braun the rest of my life . It simply does not shave right and it turns shaving in a torture session . I tried to work with Braun expecting maybe a mal function as it is hard to believe this device can be so bad but they just make you run in circles from one service center to another . So besides a crap product also terribe customer service . Save your money and buy a Norelco .
 Why would anyone buy a factory-reconditioned Shaver ? U must be out of your mind to use something that has come into contact with someone else 's bristles.Yeech . In this case I rather pay more and have the peace of mind that its only my bristles clogged in the machinery .
 i decided to use the murine ear wax removal and boy do i regret using it !! i read the positive reviews and decided to try it myself following the instructions carefully.hours later my eardrums were in constant sharp pain !! i read up on some other reviews from other websites and have noticed that many others have had similar symptoms but they all recovered by the following day , which was the same for me.I will prob never use this product again . Maybe i was one of the few that had reactions to murine . im sure it worked for others but unfortunately it did not for me . i am not sure as to why my ears hurt so badly but i can not take the chance and reuse this product .
 I bought this ear wax removal because I 've had a hard time hearing for the past year . I put the drops in at 11:30 pm and woke up at 3 am with the worst pain I 've ever experienced in my ear !!!!! I was in tears and was tempted to go to the emergency room . I looked up online if other people have experienced this and they have . So I took a few Tylenol and woke up in the morning with no pain . It was the most terrifying experience I 've ever had !!! Do not use these ear drops !!!!!!! I 'm telling you it 's a very scary experience !!!!!
 Alright , I purchased this kit at my local Longs Drugstore hoping to eventually hear a bit better . I had a notion that my recent degraded levels of hearing were due to wax buildup.I followed the directions to a T. . . I did not see any wax leave the ear after the warm water irrigation . Three hours later , I was in EXTREME pain . I have never had an ear infection -LRB- knock on wood -RRB- in my life so experiencing this major ear pain was the pain sensation I never knew could exist to say the least . After literally shedding tears over the pain in primarily my left ear and trying to deal with it via OTC pain meds , I had my husband drive me to a clinic.If I were n't in immense pain at the clinic , I would 've felt like a douche crying to the intake person , the vital signs checker , and the doctor about my idiotic choice to clean my ears this way . THANK YOU DOCTOR for whipping out some RX-level ear numbing/painkilling drops . They did the trick like , super fast and she also informed my -LRB- in a semi-lecturing tone -RRB- that I had absolutely no wax buildup and I need to throw the box of cleaner away and never again venture into earwax cleaning realm.Perhaps I had an extreme allergic reaction to the drops , but perhaps many people do -LRB- I read some other horrific similar stories on the internets -RRB- . If this is the case , the Murine folks need to put a better advisory on their box and make people aware of the likelyhood that some people experience EXTREME PAIN after these drops are administered . If I can prevent ANYONE -LRB- even my worst enemy -RRB- of experiencing this horrific ear pain , I feel a bit better about the world .
 WHAT A RIPOFF . I bought two boxes of this product , and used it as directed.It DID NOT REMOVE ANY WAX out of my ears at all .
 After reading the rave customer reviews about this product , I decided to give it a try and used it exactly as directed . Nothing happened . I 'm so disappointed . The only thing good about it was the price , that I did n't lose much money because of it . If I thought it would do any good , I 'd return the product to the company and ask for my money back . Would not recommend it to anyone . Such a let down .
 it did not worked for me , I still have pain in my ears from the drops after 24 h , there was nothing coming out and due to the pain as after affect I am not going to put the drops again in my ears , the syringe ball is not really unpractical for my ears eater , i feel like wasted my money with this product .
 I used it on just one ear and put in 3 drops . Went to bed and woke up with excruciating ear pain . Two hours later still pain , 400 MG motrin still pain , I then flushed my ear with hot water . Less pain but NEVER AGAIN ! Im headed to the dr in the morning .
 Not only does this product NOT WORK , but when I called the number to cancel the order after the 14 days , I was told that it was 14 days fromt he day I placed the order , not received it . I only had it for a week !!! They charged my credit card for $ 88 and refused to let me speak to a supervisor , told me they `` were in a meeting '' - are you kidding me ? DO NOT BY ANY PRODUCTS BY NATURE CLEANSE !!!!
 THIS COMPANY DOES NOT HONOR THEIR 2 WEEK TRAIL PERIOD FOR THE PRODUCT , AND THE PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK . SAVE YOUR MONEY !
 THIS EASY WIPE IS A TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND IT CAN NOT BE REFUNDED!IT DOES N'T HOLD TOILET PAPER AT ALL , AND HARD TO MANEUVER , DO NOT BUY !!
 I am really disapointed in this product . It broke after using it a few times . Obviously I would not send somethinglike that back for replacement . After spending 30.00 $ I was not going to buy another one .
 My suggestion would be to save up and install a bidet . Unless you want to put on some latex gloves every time you need to go # 2 . The TP does not release from the product , you have to pull it off . It does not clean your bottom unless you go threw a time consuming process of wrapping , wiping , and pulling off the TP -LRB- yuck -RRB- again and again . The button does not release the used tissue . Poorly designed products like these only serve to frustrate and humiliate . Not even close to being worth the money . If it were $ 10 I still would not buy it . If you use it -LRB- of course -RRB- it can not be returned . The only possible way I could see this product useful would be for a female unable to bend or reach who needs to cleanse after # 1 .
 DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCTS BY NATURE CLEANSE , THEY DO NOT WORK AND THEY REFUSED TO ISSUE A CANCELLATION ON THE PRODUCT AFTER EVALUATING IT FOR 2 WEEKS LIKE THE AD STATES ! THIS IS NOT A LEGIT COMPANY !
 I did not notice anything special/any effects after taking this supplement . It seems like another waste of money . I need to stop believing the hype .
 I respect Natures Way brand but having Non cooked/prepared Maca is not suitable for me and others as I have read this gives stomach cramps and bloating to the stomach . I experience this for myself
 I 've used Naturade soy replacement formulas before and loved them but the french vanilla was by far the worst . The consistancy was very think , almost like yogurt and it smelled awful . I was unable to drink it . The expiration date on the bottom says 10/2014 but in September of 2012 it was as if it had already expired . I recommend the vanille naturade soy replacement .
 I recently had jaw surgery and am on a strict liquid diet . I thought this would be a good way to receive nutritional content without using a milk product . The taste is awful . I have a really hard time getting through the whole shake . After just a few sips my stomach starts to rumble , I become bloated and last night I could n't leave the bathroom for hours , which makes me wonder if this product is dehydrating me ! I would not advise people to try this . I 'm going back to Slim Fast !
 I was very excited to see this particular kotex with velcro wings online since I had not been able to find them any where in stores . I ordered it immediately ! However , when I received the package it was a different fit of kotex then the one I was so eager to receive .
 Although I wanted products `` Natural Balance '' , products arrived were the old goods . I was disappointed . Because Photo was `` Natural Balance '' .
 I purchased this product for my 80 year old grandmother with back pain . She could n't put this on alone , an nearly fell over stepping into the band . I kept the belt for myself post partum , but this product is awkward to use since the white stretchable strap , under the velcro belt , is one solid piece . You have to either step into the circle and pull up , or put it on over your arms -LRB- like a tshirt -RRB- . Unfortunately when contending with back issues , or hip , or anything else the product advertised to help , I ca n't imagine bending and streching to put it on for the necessary support . Otherwise the velcro design is nice . Two stars because the stretchy band material does procide support and the velcro design with a tightening option on the left and right side works well .
 I have never in my life had a problem swallowing pills . But these Country Life Calcium Magnesium pills are the biggest & hardest I have ever taken . Some days I simply ca n't get them down . I do n't recommend them unless you have no problem swallowing huge pills .
 Product messes up your hormone level/balance . I had the longest menstrual cycles ever -LRB- 25 days -RRB- !!! I needed to see a gynecologist and be on a treatment before things fell back into place !
 This helped the hot flashes for about a week . Then I was searching for something else . The only thing that really works is prescription hormones .
 I had a hard time to relief the anxiety and panic attack which are caused by itRead and read about it before you buy it
 Came in dry caps . Guess I did n't read the fine print . You have to have a fat or oil to absorb . I have to make a special effort to make sure I take with fish oil or other fat . The product designers should know this and make only a softgell with oils to help absorb .
 So I bought this about 1-2 months ago . . yes it does mix it very well , it did n't leak for a bit . But then the little plastic cover on the cover for the `` vent '' if you may , which allows oxygen in the bottle for ease of quick drinking . . cracked so now everytime I shake it , my protein gets all over the bottle and hand . . very messy . If you ask me something like this , which mind you does not get alot of abuse should definately last longer . Yes i could just put a finger over it but just goes to show , you get what you pay for .
 I picked this up one day from the Vitamin Shoppe as I was in need for a cheap shaker bottle . It seemed to work well at first as long as you made sure to close the lid tightly , which was n't always easy . It usually took a minute or two to get it on properly and make sure it was tight in order to prevent leaking . After a couple of months of use , the rubber that keeps the lid tightly in place began to tear . Needless to say that without it , it leaks . It 's hard to say to avoid such a cheap item , but save yourself the trouble and go with a shaker that snaps on . Much easier to get on and off , I 've never had leaking issues , and also does n't have any grooves in case you decide to drink directly from the container . I 've have good luck with Tupperware personally .
 I got this for free and used it for a couple years before I found something better . It works somewhat , but I always had it leave a little bit of powder -LRB- not really enough to matter -RRB- . The top does n't screw on as efficiently as it could -LRB- sometimes you will miss the threads and it will screw on crookedly -RRB- . It has two caps on the top . One is a spout to drink from , and the smaller one is to let air into the bottle so that it will create suction when you drink . The spout does n't close as easily as it could either -LRB- you have to put some pressure on it and `` wiggle '' it just a little bit to get a secure connection -RRB- . Additionally , I always had to put my fingers over both spouts when shaking so that they did n't open and spill my drink everywhere.For anyone who is thinking of buying this , I recommend theBlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall , Blueinstead . It is twice as expensive but much better at actually blending your drinks . Had I not ever used that , probably would have given the Bodytech Shaker 3 or 4 stars , but it 's hard to do that once I 've experienced a product that works so much better .
 This thing is a piece of garbage . The top does n't secure correctly meaning when I shake it vigorously I have to keep checking it and tightening it so I do n't spray protein shake all over my walls . I would never buy this product again .
 I bought mine at Vitamine Shoppe , but after less than 10 uses , the protein mix started to leak from the lid whenever I shook it . Maybe I received a faulty one , but still the material that the bottle is made of is not as strong as the Blender Bottle ones .
 Used for about six months , then the plastic pieces on the lid broke . The seal also went and it now leaks when shook .
 The little cover that goes over the air vent hole broke after the first use.Don ' t recommend .
 I gota $ 2 Body Fortress shaker from Wal-Mart -LRB- which works fine -RRB- and I kept leaving it work so I picked one up for home when I was at the local Vitamin Shoppe . First of all the plastic insert thats supposed to aid in mixing your shakes has very wide spaces and does n't do that good a job . Second the thing leaks . The first couple times I thought I was n't putting the lid on correctly but after several uses it 's leaking every single time . Maybe I just got a defective but mine was garbage .
 The top does n't close right . It leaks very badly even if you hold it closed . Poor design . If you drink it in the car on the way back from the gym like I do , expect the worst . Although the blades leave little clumps . I would get something else .
 I purchased a pair of these shaker bottles about a year ago and they constantly stink of plastic . Whatever they 're made of , they never smell clean . The material these are made of makes the liquid inside tase of plastic .
 Do n't buy it , please!This thing has a really awful smell if you leave the top closed . It mixes pretty good , but sometimes it leaks ; it 's just very poorly designed.I do n't recommend it !
 I was pretty happy with this bottle until it started leaking like crazy after a few months . The biggest leak came from a crack in the smaller vent cap that was most likely caused by repeated pressure to keep the seal tight . Over time , the physics of the design simply causes the plastic to split . If the cap was made of something more elastic like silicone or rubber , this problem probably would n't exist . The rest of the leaking seems to be coming from a worn-down rubber seal that lines the inside of the cap . Even though it 's sightly more expensive , I 'm buying a BlenderBall BlenderBottle to replace my BodyTech bottle .
 too hard to close and sometimes you have to close it a few times so it will be tight . And you have to hold the top part everytime you shake it so it wo n't spill . Good mixer have n't have problem with that .
 Poor quality product . leaks and spills every time . the ` bodytech ' logo is completely gone after only 6 months of use . Although , it gets the job done , never got any lumps in my protein shake . I generally shake for 20-25 seconds . It 's also easy to wash . I had to ditch this shaker and buy a new Optimum Nutrition shaker .
 This was something cheap they made to give out for buying their product . It is just a plain and simple bad product
 Awful . Not worth a penny . Drinking stuff that taste like plastic ca n't be good for you . If you value your health , avoid at all cost .
 you get what you pay for . This fell apart after the first 3 uses . Followed directions and never placed into the dishwasher , but washed by hand . spend the extra couple of bucks and buy something that works .
 I bought this because I needed something simple to use that was easy to take on the go . It worked nicely for about a month and then the cap that covers the drinking hole broke . now it is worthless and unusable .
 I bought three of these shakers all around the same time and they worked pretty well . I never had any problems mixing with whey , but my casein would come out a little chunky . I still really enjoyed the bottles with the air vent and the great lip for drinking from though . However , after about 3 months of regular use -LRB- using each bottle about twice a week -RRB- 2 of the shakers air vent covers had cracked , one actually split in half making the bottles leak quite a bit while I mix my drinks . So now I have 3 bottles with only one working top . In the companies defense I did put them in the dishwasher top rack once a week to make sure they were sanitized .
 This is a completely useless product . It doesnt mix and the cap doesnt close properly . It keeps spilling everywhere . I would suggest getting a blender and not wasting money on garbage like this .
 cheaply made , does not hold up to heavier disabled peoplewhat is the use of a riser if it ca n't hold weight and uses for which it was intended ? . minute screws dont hold and plastic breaks easily.not very safe when your disabled elderly mother falls offbecause it breaks off the seat on the first use .
 I wish I would not have spent a hard earned 20.00 on this . It says All-Natural on the box , but look at the ingredients and they are
 These things do n't work very well . I originally bought three packs -LRB- 100 count each -RRB- because I was hoping to use one per day and have a 3 year supply for only $ 3 or so.The 3/4 '' of floss on each little plastic thing wo n't go between all my teeth like my normal wax-coated floss . Either these Kool Floss swords do n't use waxed floss , or the floss is n't as thin as my good floss.My teeth are very close together and it 's a little tough getting normal -LRB- good -RRB- floss through the gaps but using the floss swords requires an insane amount of force to drive the string between the teeth . I end up breaking the floss loose from the plastic after only 5-10 teeth : -LRB- Do n't waste your time with this product unless your teeth are far apart . In that case , you 'd probably really enjoy these : -RRB-
 I was shocked to see Propylene Glycol in the ingredients . This is a cancer causing solvent that scientist Hulda Clark has found to be present in the majority of cancer patients . Propylene glycol is used in anti freeze for cars . According to the latest scientific studies , propylene glycol is as deadly as benzene and both solvents cause cancer even in small amounts . Unfortunately , scientists recent studies on the effects in the human body shows that propylene glycol builds up in the body even if ingested in very low quantities . The reason for the build up is that the liver takes five days to detoxify propylene glycol , after a person stops ingesting it . So , if someone is ingesting it on a daily basis , this burden on the liver allows propylene glycol to build up in the body to toxic levels . Also , the presence of this solvent burdens the liver so much that it can not rid the body of parasites . Many scientists believe this is a major cause of cancer ... parasites and solvents in the body.Update
 Ordered 2 bottles.Paid for 2 bottles.Received only 1 bottle in the mail.What can be done about this shortage ?
 Cleans nicely though I do n't have enough experience to compare it to other power brushes . On/off switch did not work -LRB- even after some fiddling -RRB- so I open the battery compartment to turn it off .
 Could tell this is a cheaply made product when actually seeing it.I have gotten good deals at Amazon before , so I took a chance.This product did not work upon receipt . Thought maybe it was the battery , but a new one did n't help.I would not recommend this product to anyone .
 The objective of the designers was clearly to make something cheap . The toothbrush vibrates , using a small 1.5 V motor that spins an eccentric weight . The vibration source is in the handle . The bristles are not moving , other than what happens by way of this vibration . The on/off switch is easy to operate , but my three children dependably forget to turn them off . In my opinion , this is a waste of money up front , and the product will eat batteries as children use them up quickly -LRB- forgettting to power off -RRB-
 I was so disappointed with this product . It is supposed to be an electric toothbrush that actually moves when you turn it on . . but it was so slow I still had to manually move it to brush my teeth !
 Well I got this to pollinate my tomato plants and it was the cheapest powered toothbrush I could find . However this product is very poorly build and mine broke down after a few days . For $ 2 I ca n't complain and you cant go much wrong .
 This item BROKE the first time we used it . The battery contacts are flimsy and twist and break very easily ... The electrical design needs to be improved on many Doc Johnson items . Good shape and power , but since it broke , we did not get a chance to use it for very long ...
 Very disappointed . I purchased this and the replacement blades are linked to my shaver - they do n't fit . not even close to being a match to my razor . Thought I made a mistake , looked it up and this same advertisement for the blades are linked to my razor . They do not fit . OF course to get the blades out of the package , you have to tear the package apart . This is the first time I feel I was ripped off by Amazon - your advertisement clearly was wrong - these blades do not fit my razor .
 I had purchase this as part of Amazon 's recommendation when I purchased my Panasonic razor . Little did I know that it was the wrong part until I have to replace my blades -LRB- 1 1/2 years later . -RRB- I wish Amazon would do cross-checks before placing products together !
 Do n't get these.My shaver is 4 years old and I replaced the cutters and foil two years ago . Lately I decided to replace them again with these new ones.These new ones cut much worse than the old ones.SO bad , in fact , that I went back to the old ones.I would recommend just getting a new shaver .
 Like the other reviewers , I claim these things are pretty dull . I shaved with the original blades for years and figured I should replace them . Never had a fantastic shave since , even wet or with pre-shave . If I ca n't find decent blades I 'll have to get rid of the Panasonic shaver that has served me pretty well over the years .
 Since these are visually , mechanically and structurally inferior to the originals why ca n't we find the right replacement blades ? Someone must know where they are available .
 I have owned a ES8068 for about 8 years . At the time I bought it consumer reviews regarded it as the best . I could cearly see why after I bought it , as I also had a new Remmington , and even tried a Grundig . No comparison . I have used the original blades and foil head since I have owned it . I get a good shave but it takes progressively longer . Occasionally I even get pulled hairs ... which never happened in the past . Replacement blades were $ 70 in the past , so I kept putting off changing them . Recently I decided it was time and ordered the blade foil head combination pack . Immediately I noticed a major difference in the construction of the blades . Panasonic , or whoever designed the baldes , took a continuous rectangular piece of metal , slotted it , and wrapped it around and attached it to the plastic base which connects to the blade mount . The original blades consisisted of a series of 28 individual blades made out of thick steel , mounted individually in the plastic base . The orginal blades where much higher quality , and had significantly more solid and substantial construction . The new blades do not even come close . I was ready to send them back when I first saw them!But I had to try them to see how they performed.The replacement blades sound different than the old ones . Higher pitched , and more hollow , less substantial . The shave they delivered was also less substantial ... It was almost as if I did not even change the blades . It took a long time to shave , and I had the pulling again , which I experinced with the 8 year old blades . I did get shaved , and after a while , it was not bad , but it took as long as the old blades did.This appears to be another example of cutting corners and keeping costs down ... Too bad for Panasonic , and the have seriously compromised quality here.I put the oringinal blades back in , and have returned to using them.Panasonic states on the foil head / blade pack , that `` The blade 's shape has been modified since March 2004 . `` They should have said '' We threw out the original , excellent , solid design and construction of the original blades in March 2004 , and have replaced them with this very cheap , flimsy , shabby substitute , which will not shave you nearly as well as the originals . `` NOT recommended ... but there appears to be no choice .
 WES9070P Panasonic Shaver Blades for my ES8068I just bought these blades to replace the blades that have been in my Panasonic model ES8068 shaver since I 've owned it for the past 8 + years ... I was n't having a problem with my shaver ... I just assumed that after all these years ... I should get new blades . I installed these new blades ... and they were bad ... like they were DULL ... I had to go SLOW because it was n't cutting my facial hairs fast enough ... I ended up putting the old blades back in and I could shave fast again . SOMETHING is funny with these blades ... They had to be dull or a different material than the ORIGINAL blades that came with my shaver .
 The name indicates the product is a Panasonic , it is n't . It appears to be a copy and is n't nearly as good . Next time I will spend the difference and get Panasonic replacement parts . Very disappointed .
 Like the other reviews noted , this is a cheap generic blade set . Not Panasonic quality steel . Blades dulled quickly - within two weeks they were worse than the blades they 'd replaced . I do n't know whether to blame Goodman 's or just my not making absolutely sure that I was getting Panasonic quality . Fortunately , I did not trash my old blades . Now , is it worth buying new Panasonic blades , after already wasting money , or buy a whole new Panasonic shaver for not much more ?
 I too , thought I was getting Panasonic replacement parts . The package I got had no manufacturer 's name . Just a list of shavers these were good for on the back of package . The year old blades worked better than these supposedly new ones . -LRB- but alas , I threw them out when I got these -RRB- . Avoid Goodmans at all cost .
 This item was purchased from Goodman 's . Using Panasonic 's name and part number I thought I was purchasing an original replacement blade not a generic . I was wrong , I had to dig back thru trash can to retrieve old blades because the blades I purchased were terrible . I returned explaining the problem . Recieved credit for blades , did not recieve credit for shipping charges . I think Goodman 's and Amazon should have credited freight because item sold never claimed to be generic .
 The blades I replaced were at least 8 years old . These cut no better and possibly worse , certainly not like I remember the original ones performing . There may be a secret way to insert the blades , but it 's not obvious , and there were no installation instructions or any other documentation included whatsover.The blades do fit and they do cut . And that 's all.Bummer .
 What a horrible product ... DO NOT BUY THIS CUSHION ... you will just end up with a useless piece of foam and a nice cover!I am an over-the-road long haul truck driver . Keeping me in the driver 's seat up to 11 hours at a time with very limited oppurtunities to get up , stretch , etc. . In the past I had purchased a moderately priced wheelchair gel cushion and was satisfied with the comfort but not as satisfied with the durability of the product.After ` wearing out ' my first cushion I decided to begin a hunt for a durable , comfortable replacement . I read a whole lot of reviews and decided on this spendy but well reviewed product . Man , what a waste of money!Not only did I pay way too much for what ended up being a useless disappointment but it brought a really major concern for the customer 's that may have this bought for them but are unable to express their EXTREME discomfort . Please , please , please ... if you are a care-giver or loved one of someone that depends on a cushion for their wheelchair ... DO NOT buy this product . It took less than a day of sitting on this cushion and my backside was more cramped and sore than any day I spent without a cushion.Not only did the cushion raise me up WAY too high the darn thing felt like I was sitting on an over-inflated beach ball . Not conforming to my derriere but forcing my derriere to conform to it . Ouch ! By the next day I removed the covering -LRB- which , by the way , is the only thing worth a ` nod ' of approval -RRB- and used a box knife to separate the foam cushion from the gel pack . Tried the next day to just use the gel pack and found that it still felt like my backside was performing an impossible feat by balancing atop a too-full bubble . There is absolutely no ` give ' to this cushion . Attempting to salvage something from this expensive buying experience I found myself using the 46 cent foam cushion and the cover that I still will use on my less expensive replacement.What a horrible product ... DO NOT BUY THIS CUSHION ... you will just end up with a useless piece of foam and a nice cover !
 I have used soy powder for awhile now in my breakfast smoothie . I was attracted by the subscribe and save service that would have had this delivered at regular intervals and I would n't have to remember to pick it up at the store . Am I sorry now . This soy powder has the worst taste I can think of . It ruined my smoothie and made me want to gag . I 'm back to the store brand .
 I bought two of these thinking they would work much better than the cheaper neck bands that require soaking . These ice packs are too wide to wear around my neck . They do n't cool me down like the crystal based coolers .
 Does n't stay cold very long ice strips are too small to cool you down . would n't recommend this product good idea just does n't work
 The ice pack broke after two uses and leaked down my neck . It is a very poorly made product , and is not recommended .
 Ok so it cools , but just barely . Ice pack only stays frozen for about 30 minutes in the 95 degree heat we have been having .
 I looked around for a while before deciding to buy this ice bandana . It sounded great but I 'm disappointed with the actual product for several reasons , mainly because it does n't work well . I can barely feel the ice in the bandana unless I tie the bandana really tight , which is n't very comfortable . Also , the black terry cloth on the inside of the bandana leaves black residue all around my neck if I 'm sweaty .
 I gave this as a gift to someone who works in a hot office without A/C . She told me later that it only made her hotter because the cold does n't penetrate the material and the cloth only insulated her neck.Sadly , just was n't what I was hoping for .
 The Ice Bandanas are the WORST investment I have ever made . They claim to be cold for up to two hours . 45 minutes AT BEST ! Four of them with shipping cost $ 50.00 . Do n't buy them !!!! Trust me !
 I bought these for a week long scout summer camp . They work OK , but I found that using a gel cold pack and soaking it in ice water for 30 minutes and then wrapping it in a wash cloth , work better and the gel pack retained the cold better and was more refreshing .
 I LOVE THIS PERFUME AND HAVE BEEN WEARING IT FOR OVER 20 YRS , SO WHEN I SAW IT ONLINE I KNOW IT WAS A MUST HAVE . I ORDERED AND I WAITED AND WAITED FOR IT TO BE DELIVERED AND WHEN I FINALLY GOT IT , THE WAS HARLDY ANYTHING IN THE BOTTLE I GUESS IT EVAPORATED OUT , SO I EMAILED THE COMPANY AND IT WAS REPALCED AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE SECOND BOTTLE CAME WITH ALMOST HALF IN THE BOTTLE AS WELL , SO I DECIDED THAT 'S IT I WILL TAKE THE LOSS BUT I WILL NEVER EVER ORDER ONLINE AGAIN I 'LL JUST GO GET IT AT THE STORE SINCE THAT IS WHAT I AM USED ... I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I NEEDED IT AND TODATE I STILL HAVE N'T GOTTEN WHAT I PAID FOR ...
 Back years ago this scent was somewhat ok , I remember having a small bottle of it someone gave me.I thought I would enjoy it again so asked for it as a gift.I was wrong.It was heavy and gave me somewhat of a headache.It 's to old lady like.And very musky.I would n't recommend this scent.I sold it on ebay.I have noticed yellow or golden colors of perfume are too strong and musky .
 This is by far the worst scent I 've ever smelled in my entire life ! Imagine a bottle of cheap cologne lost in time -LRB- let 's say like 100 years -RRB- and recently opened . That would be it ! My mother absolutely loves it and I get nauseated every time I get near . Horrible smell , something an old person would use .
 I bought this item based on good reviews and now I 'm regretting it ! When am I going to learn to stop buying perfumes based on other people 's opinions !??? I mean honestly the first thing I thought of , when I sprayed this perfume on is powder ! It smells like you 're in a makeup room where you powder your nose . Also this scent is more of a grandma scent in my honest opinion . I 'm 19 years old and that 's what I think of with this perfume . I think it 's a bit too strong and mature for younger girls . I do n't think guys will be attracted to the scent -LRB- At least not in my age group -RRB- . This is my honest opinion and I hope I can help someone from spending their money and regretting it -LRB- like me -RRB- . From now on I 'm just going to buy perfumes at stores AFTER I smell them . Lesson well learned !!!
 Bought this for my wife and thought the fragrance that lasts only 30 minutes was normal , until she bought one from a department store . The store bought fragrance lasted for hours and hours.My experience with this product bought from Amazon does not reflect the usual high quality of its products . I do not recommend this product at all .
 I got this as a graduation gift from my mom 's friend whos in her 90 's . She knew I liked Elizabeth Taylor 's Gardenia perfume , so I imagine she thought I would like this one . While it does smell nice it 's very strong and old lady smelling . It has a very old fashioned smell to it and its embarassing to wear if you are 18 years old . . If you are younger than 40 do n't buy this even 40 's might find it a little too old school smelling ...
 I could n't really tell if it helped or not , at first I would think it was doing something but then my milk would go down again and I was still taking the pills .
 Lots of foam , very little gel sandwiched inbetween the foam . Much too firm to serve the purpose of a gell cushion , ie , distribute weight and relive pressure spots .
 This cushion is too thick and the gel part seems to be a circular bubble right in the middle and when placed on the wheelchair seat tended to roll me toward the back rather uncomfortably .
 The item 's cover is NOT removeable for machine washing . The foam filling is defective , it breaks apart .
 After reviewing the other feedbacks before i bought it , i took a chance on it because not everyone is the same . After trying it for the first time , i found the clitoral stimulator to be rough and not at all pleasurable . It was very hard plastic with sharp points on the end trying to do the job . After the second time of using it very gingerly , it worked for a few seconds then it would turn itself off . I played with the buttons for turning and vibrating , but nothing happened . I tried to change the 3 AAA batteries that it requires , but it came to no effect . It was also very slim , maybe an inch in diameter or so . It hardly did any good unless it was used with another vibrator . Yes , it 's cheaper than other vibrators , but other cheap ones work much better .
 Too big around for insertion without a lot of artificial lubrication . That was n't fun or spontaneous . Then , using it in the water , it leaked on the first try and then I could never use it again .
 I guess unless you are a good anatomical fit the clitoral stimulation leaves a lot to be desired . The rotation has worked intermittently since I purchased it at the end of Nov , but since I have only used it maybe 5 times I figured maybe it was related to the batteries . Sadly you only have 30 days to return it . At this point it has been 45 days and inside the red covering you can see some gross looking discoloration from something . As with most toys the plastic/rubber smell is still strong . It just did n't offer much a bang for any buck and did not end up on the favorite toys list fortunately I did n't pay a lot .
 Are you kidding me ? Was this toy made as a vibrator for never before touched virgin hoo haas?This is the worst vibrator . I could n't even get off.The vibration was silent , the circular shaft was loud . The vibrator 's highest settings still were not strong enough to reach climax . Shaft is way to small , skinny . and the batteries start dying quickly.Money down the pisser , nothing worst than getting a new vibrator that ca n't even get you off.I put this vibrator in the child toys category . Thanks for ruining my morning .
 I really wanted to like this . Okay apparently they switched the batteries over from 3 AAA 's to 2 AA 's . I got the model that supposedly required 2 AA 's , I 'm okay with that , I would have been okay if it required 3 AAA 's . What I am not okay with , is the battery compartment was too big for AAA 's and too small for AA 's . So I bought the product and ca n't use it , because no batteries fit in it correctly to use it !
 I received this last Tuesday , and by Thursday it was broken , after only using it twice ... . I had high expectations for this product seeing as it goes for around 50 dollars on other websites , so I thought 10 dollars was a steal . But when I opened the battery compartment there was a oil-like substance on the inside , which alarmed me from the start , but it worked well in the beginning , I used brand new batteries , so I know that was n't the problem . The vibrations were also not nearly as powerful as I like . my toothbrush puts off more vibration .
 Not good , do n't buy it.This chemical smell did n't go away and this is hard as a steel
 Underpowered and not very well designed . It keeps stopping and you have to fumble with the buttons . Also has a very strong plastic smell . Would not recommend .
 I got it , but it does n't work . Put the batteries in , but it is not what it is supposed to be .
 The screen that came with my razor lasted me years until it finally broke , so I purchased this one , and within ONE MONTH , it broke.I did n't have any problems -LRB- ex
 o n't get these.I have had this shaver for 4 years and had not replaced the shaver heads and foil for 2 years . The quality of the replacements was terrible . I ended up going back to the old shaver heads and foil because the new ones did not cut as close.I am going to just replace the whole shaver now .
 This stuff is garbage . It causes severe cramping and diahrreah . I am out fifty bucks , and all I have is a bottle of a very nasty laxative . Contacted the company , and was told they would get back to me . That was over a week ago -- I 'm still waiting .
 I had problems with constipation , weight gain , and depression . I do think it was helping my memory and , maybe , if I could have stuck with it a while longer the side effects would have evened themselves out .
 Not as good as the original . Major vibration and pinching along with the replacemenrt blade ; constantly loosening would not stay in place during function . I threw out the whole electric shaver and bought new one .
 Foil does not adhere snugly to blades resulting in poor shaving . This is NO WHERE NEAR performance level of original foil .
 There was a break in the casing on the wiring SO it did not work . No returns so I 'm left with ???
 I had been eyeing this toy in a sex store but was waiting for their Christmas in July sale where everything is half off . I finally got it , turned it on ... and felt nothing . The vibe was so weak that I ended up just throwing it away . It 's very flexible , would 've been a great toy otherwise .
 I purchased this item about a month ago , and after only a few uses , the motor has died . I ca n't even say I got my money 's worth because even when it was functioning , the performance was very poor.It looks like fun from the pictures , but it 's much larger than I had anticipated , and the shape is actually quite awkward . Also , the intensity of the vibrations are a disappointment , as well . I would not recommend this product to anyone that needs to be done in 30 minutes or less .
 first , be sure to reverse the battery directions so it works . but this one is a lot bigger than it looks and is not very soft . its kind of rigid and when it arrives it stinks like plastic . there is this section underneath the bubble that reminds me of bathtub stopper that gets in the way of , going forward . maybe this is better for someone with a wider entry ... personally i like the cal exotics butterfly kisses , its soft , flexible and hits the G.lucid dream 28 by doc johnson is just too big and rigid
 last week i placed an order for this product , i send an email asking for my tracking number and they told me that my orde will be ship on september 1th , but on september 2nd they send me an email saying that they put on back order this item because they dont have ... so i respond the email asking when will be ship and they says that MAYBE the next week ... . so how its possible that they anunce a product here at amazon if they dont have it ... so i cancelled the order because if i still wait ... maybe i will get sptember 15 MAYBE , the seller is DAB NUTRITION
 I tried to use this product , but after the first two days . I felt nauseous and generally sick to my stomach . It does give you a energy boost , but due to the feeling it gave me . I did n't want to eat at all or work out . Plus I started off easy , far below the recommended per day , I ca n't imagine how I would have felt if I went recommended dosage . I love BSN products but steer clear of this one .
 I bought and paid for this item some time back . I never received it or a refund . The company had tracking numbers for the package and REQUIRED a signature , which I worked during the day and was unable to provide . They refused to make alternate arrangements and never refunded the monies . BEWARE . This is not the company to do business with .
 I do not recommend this product . It 's just another hype filled product to target fat people in need a quick solution to lose weight . The best way is to do it the hard way . No need to spend money on a pill that 's suppose to aid your results , because most of the time you are better off with a placebo .
 Ok for a laugh or if you are just trying to start slow . Better of useing some neck ties or a more expensive set .
 The picture shows velcro loops at both ends of the teathers , there 's only one loop and you have to tie the other . Also , I do n't know what kind of king size bed the people have that say that it fits one , but it does n't , unless they had a footboard to tie it to .
 I tried this out and then put into the `` useless '' box . The material from which it is made is just too hard . The shape just does n't work .
 The second Doc Johnson that has died in less than three months . Am really disappointed.Overall had a good feel , nice vibe , four speed , but ... dead is dead .
 Aweful product , does n't work . It has 4 speeds but only once in a while will the top speed work . Do not buy
 I did not know there is such bad floss before I used this . do not try it . It will tear , split easily .
 Terribly sticky and waxy ... I ca n't believe it 's a lipstick !!! You can push it out but you ca n't draw it back ... it looks just like to contain too much water and ca n't be called as a stick ...
 I purchased this for a trek on Kilimanjaro . I found the taste to be repulsive . I was disappointed in the product . I do n't believe it delivered on what it claimed it could do .
 I used it on a burn on my leg and it made the area sting and hurt worse . Maybe on a more minor burn it would work better .
 I lived in Hawaii when I ordered this and the spray molded over . I only used it once or twice on my son for his diaper rash . Get the ointment holds up way better !
 When i bought this product it had no reviews . So i feel obligated to review it . This product gives you the impression of the name , smell , and taste that it will do something wicked to your body . Well it did something wicked , make me pee a lot . As all creatine will make you go to the bathroom since your consuming lots of water . But any creatine that wants you to load early in day and later is in my opinion one not worth buying . I did n't get the feeling i would get with other products that makes me want to lift to get rid of the feeling , and i wasnt alert with this product at all . Pros i would say it mixes really well , the taste is halfway decent , and if you use this as a sole creatine supplement with caffeine and other enhancers , it still may do something for you . With the huge lack of knowledge users have of this product online , i would say do n't buy it because flat out nobody knows about it , and me being one that has used it , is telling you it 's not worth buying over muscle pharm -LRB- assault -RRB- or jack3d .
 This product is now made with so much less material that it tears easily , defeating its purpose . I will not reorder , and I am looking for a substitute , perhaps at Walgreen 's . They did not change the product number ; just the product and the colors on the box.Safetouch Powder Free Vinyl Exam Gloves , Non-Sterile , Medium - 100/BoxSafetouch Powder Free Vinyl Exam Gloves , Non-Sterile , Small - 100/Box
 These are not worth the little bit you save from nitrile . My boss ordered these and they rip , tear and do not fit true to size . I told her if she was gon na keep buying these I 'd buy my own nitrile gloves I am allergic to latex and absolutely hate the vinyl gloves unless they are good quality polyisoprene .
 These gloves are a little thin and tear easily , so do n't use them for anything strenuous . The price should be lower .
 I like to wear vinyl gloves to cook . My local store stopped carrying size small vinyl gloves and therefore , I made this purchase . I wish the quality of the gloves were as good as the shipping service and packaging . First the gloves fit smaller than the other brand that I usually used . The simi-clear material is not stretchy . The first pair I put on , I tore one of it apart when pulling it onto my right hand . As I wore them to rinse and prepare food , water started to dampen the gloves at the tips of each finger . That 's not very protective , is it ? I will try to return the unopened box and will not order this brand again .
 We have not received this product -LRB- gloves -RRB- yet . We original ordered two items from this company through amazon -LRB- adult wipes and gloves -RRB- and found the company 's service to be very slow to ship . When we tried to cancel and reorder because the original order had not been shipped in a week - the company allowed us to cancel the wipes , but then immediately shipped the gloves and gouged us on shipping costs that exceeded the cost of the gloves -LRB- when we canceled the wipes the total order amount fell below $ 25 needed to qualify for free-amazon-shipping -RRB- . Revised standard shipping charges for the gloves exceeded the cost of the product . We are using supplies ordered to care for a family member and are trying to find high quality supplies , shipped timely , without over-paying and we do not find this company to meet our needs in these areas , and the company appears to take advantage of applying excessive standard shipping costs that could have been used to expedited instead of gouging customer.Safe-Touch Disposable Latex Exam Gloves , Powder-Free , Size Large , Box of 100
 In the past , I 've bought vinyl gloves at Costco for various tasks around the house . These were priced much cheaper . They are also flimsy and frequently tear when putting them on . I wo n't be buying these again !
 To date these are the WORST gloves that I have used !!! For every glove that I 'm successfullwith putting on , two will tear . On the box , they are marked LARGE , but they just meet thatqualification . They should be more of a MEDIUM . If these were selling for half price they wouldstill be a rip off ! It 's no wonder , they are made in China !
 Headband is a little too large and no way to compensate for that . Also stretches out a lot from one use and does n't shrink back up after washing and drying . Not worth the time and money to return .
 I bought these because the picture shows a box that is NOT those crappy Ecstasy condoms/Sensations condoms where they felt a need to balloon the tip so you feel like you 're using a garbage bag . So yeah , I got the garbage bag condoms instead . So they lied . Do n't order these if you do n't want garbage bag condoms .
 horrible . did nothing for me . Ca n't be returned . I am displeased . I do n't know what else to say to fill up the required amount of writing .
 The vibrator came with no manual or instruction at all and looks poorly bulit - cheap plastic , and the battery sometimes becomes loose . It looks the same as another Doc Johnson model sold in Amazon -LRB- you may find it by searching `` massager '' instead of `` vibrator '' -RRB- , only a different color , but the other model sells for only $ 9.99 and comes with more assessories . It 's too bad I ca n't return it .
 Very disappointing . Save your money . Anyway it 's shock protected while in the original package . I checked that by dropping it from the 4-th floor height .
 Product was very cheaply made and shorted out after 3 uses , Nothing worse than smoke from down under !
 Seems to have lots of Power ... but just straight vibration , No pulsating modes ... It has been rated as just OK ... but its at the bottom.Sorry .
 Not worth buying !!!! Not worth 1 star . The best vibrator so far is the magic wand , nothing else beats it or comes close .
 The hard edges on the outside of this product hurt . Budily fluids tend to get trapped inside the textured cap -LRB- which is also made out of uncomfortably hard plastic . Also it 's noisier than any other vibe I own . Not recommended , there are a lot better vibes out there .
 It worked for a couple of years , then a silly little plastic connecting piece from the vibrator to the blades broke off . I ca n't find a replacement , so now the whole thing is worthless . I suggest maybe fewer parts , but metal construction for the critical ones ...
 I bought this Acqua Di Parma Colonia aftershave balm -LRB- 2.5 oz -RRB- from Archipelago Botanicals because my stock , bought from Nordstrom , was running out . On a per ounce basis , this was a great deal , and I bought several bottles . That turned out to be a mistake.One morning , I finally ran out of the Acqua Di Parma bought at Nordstrom . I had already put aftershave on half of my face , but I had n't finished the job . So , I took out a bottle bought from Archipelago Botanicals . Immediately something seemed wrong . The Archipelago Botanicals bottle had a different label from the Nordstrom bottle . I opened the bottle , and the Acqua Di Parma bought from Archipelago Botanicals smelled different from the Acqua Di Parma bought at Nordstrom . There is no reason that the same aftershave should smell completely different.I do n't know if the `` Acqua Di Parma '' bought from Archipelago Botanicals was fake or if it was just very old . But it was not the same as the much more expensive -LRB- but new and genuine -RRB- Acqua Di Parma bought at Nordstrom . I can not recommend buying Acqua Di Parma from Archipelago Botanicals.Follow-up
 Hate it ... never will i buy cologne online without smelling it . It had good reviews so i thought of buying it
 I purchased this deodorant after reading the great reviews , but I have to say it is the worst deodorant in the world . Yes , it smells good , but the scent is short-lived . To keep it going you would have to probably reapply 4 or more times a day . Besides , it does n't even have an anti-perspirant ingredient . So while I agree the scent is great , the performance is not . I ca n't believe I spent $ 35 for a deodorant that does n't work .
 This powder does n't smell like much and certainly not Aqua di Parma . I would n't spend your hard earned money on it . I love A di P and was willing to pay extra for the talc but this is a HUGE disappointment . I think it 's a fake and I recommend not buying it .
 FOR ALL OF THE POSITIVE THINGS I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS FRAGRANCE , I ORDERED IT AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FRAGRANCE . I HAVE USED IT ONCE AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER TRY IT AGAIN . ACQUA DI PARMA COLONIA IS WAY TOO UNPLEASANT FOR MY TASTES .
 I just got my first ! And for my surprise when got to my house ! It was already broken ! Not working at all !
 This little vibrator buzzes loudly like there is a thousand bees in the room . It produces too fast a vibration that feels more like a tingle than a vibration and does not produce the desired results.To turn the unit on and off you twist the top , and if you twist just a bit too far the entire unit comes apart . The top has a small hard plastic cap that comes off for cleaning , and it also comes off when you do n't want it to.The very small lubricant bottle continuously falls as the bottom is too narrow to hold the bottle upright leaving messy drops here and there .
 Amazon.com Product DescriptionUse these AA batteries ... What 's in the BoxEighteen twin packs of AA batteriesProduct DescriptionDuracell Coppertop AAA 2-Packand the picture shows AAA . . WTF ?!
 I was putting these batteries into a tv controll and I dropped one and it fell into a pond by my house because for some odd reason I was outside , nearly 50 feet from my house . Well anyway , I picked it up and put it into the controler and now it doesnt work !!!! I am so mad !! Like this smiley !!!! > 8 -LRB-
 I ordered a pack of a dozen 9V Duracell batteries from Blinq , and they arrived with a `` Best before '' date that was only seven months away . In my experience , Duracells bought locally or at other websites generally have `` Best before '' dates which are several years away . I 'm not sure that I will be able to use all twelve of these within seven months , so I wish they were not so old .
 The watch arrived broken from Maxi Aids , and we have n't received the new one yet , its been over 3 weeks .
 The watch is worthless . It claims to give you the time but it does not work . You press the button and the clock does not respond . I 'm returning it and expect to get a full refund .
 Watch band is very large and can not be made smaller . Voice is not very loud , so not too good for an older person who also has a slight hearing problem .
 Amazon failed to send the correct item . What was sent was a 60 capsule Adrenal Plus instead of what we ordered , which was 120 capsules of Energy Plus . I will say that when we reported this error , Amazon provided us with a full refund . So this low score is just for Amazon mismanagement of the Vital Nutrients . Vital Nutrients in reading the first review , was most accommodating by emailing us with a lovely email that offered to complete our initial order at no cost . For Vital Nutrients we offer a score of A + + + . Vital Nutrients vitamin products are excellent and we had been so disappointed to receive the wrong product . Vital Nutrients provided excellent customer service , even when Amazon failed to process our order correctly.Vital Nutrients Energy Plus 120 capsules
 I bought this for my wife because it looked cool and the price was right but I should have listened to the other reviewer.It stopped working after 2 days and the replacement sounds like it 's about to die right out of the box.Save your money , even at this price this thing is not worth it .
 I knew when i bought it that it was $ 20 under all the other sites and that should have thrown up warning signs but i still bought it because the other Doc product i bought -LRB- from a store not online -RRB- Has been working for 3 years if not more now . But i have had this product less then a month and already the moter is dying and i have to smack it to start moving again . Do n't buy these they just plan suck if u want something that is going to last go somewhere else .

 This product GIVE YOU THE SYMPTOMS YOU ARE TRYING TO CURE . All homeopathic products give you the exact problems in hope it will cure your problem . EXAMPLE
 As a general rule of thumb , you should be weary about sticking anything in your ear . I read several articles that ear waxing could be dangerous , so I 'd consult a doctor before attempting this .
 I was very disappointed in the quality of this candle . It is made of a very thin wax and the wick is fragile , hence the candle did not burn well . I had to throw it away after 6 hours of use as it was no longer usable ! I enjoy a candle that is not overpowering yet subtly freshens my home with a delightful fragrance . The fragrance from this candle was non existent . I would NOT recommend these candles !
 Liners are great . They are the right size for those occasional mishaps . Great for taking care of the odor too .
 I too have used these for years . They are perfect . BUT they changed the product . I contacted the company about the fact that the sticky substance does not extend to the end of the pad anymore . They told me that I just had some defective product . BUT now I looked at the new packaging and they are just like the ones that were defective . Are they trying to save money ?? by not extending the sticky part to the end of the pad . The pad now curls up at the front and back . NOT GOOD ! I have n't found me a substitute , but am looking .
 I 've used Poise Pantiliners for several years and found them quite adequate for light leakage . Unfortunately , they have been changed , coated with something that 's supposed to make them more absorbant . Whatever this coating is , I am allergic to it and develop a painful rash when I use them . I 've had to change products to something that does not work as well as the old Poise.I hope the manufacturer will get enough complaints to change back to the old formula !
 I wore the original pad for years and found it worked perfectly . Now they 've changed the look and the product and it 's uncomfortable , the sticky part sticks to my skin and I am embarrassed by having to adjust it when I 'm walking . I 'm switching brands asap .

 I am very disappointed in this product . I just started to use it and the cap kept coming off . The motor was very weak ! I keep myself trimmed ... but it was still ripping some hair out for the short time I got to use it ! Dont waste your money !
 This trimmer would 've been perfect if it worked . After putting in the battery and trying several other batteries , I gave up hope and purchased a bikini trimmer at Wal Mart . Do n't waster your money !
 I loved all the different sized head options . The templates are cute as well but I never got to use them . This is very poorly made . I have owned a number of hair trimmers/razors and this one broke the fastest . The plastic pieces are horribly low quality . Mine broke the second time I used it . The heads did n't snap on/off well . Buy a different trimmer , save your money .
 I just got it in the mail today . I put in the battery the little light turns on but I ca n't get the trimmer to actually turn on . They do not accept returns so I lost my money . It seems pretty cheap quality too .
 I 've used Amosan for 20 + years with great results . Vince does not work well at all in comparison . Yet when I search on the internet , Vince is the product that comes up . Just be aware , at least for me , Vince is not near as effective as Amosan .
 it would have had the same net effect with less bother . If I could give this a below-zero rating , I would.It looks nice & efficient in the package , but it 's ridiculously complicated to use . It 's sad that any non-electronic pill-minder should require directions for using it at all ; but this one does . And what is provided is in such small print & so poorly illustrated & explained as to be maddening to try to read and follow.Ironically , the child-proof locking mechanism is the easiest part of the contraption to manage.The locking button that holds the lids in place is difficult to push in at first ; after a few tries , it easily falls out altogether . The sliding lids for each day 's pills do n't quite fit properly , making the lids just difficult enough to slide to be irritating.The pill compartments are somewhat smaller than they appear before they 're opened . A single large caplet or softgel may not fit at all , or be difficult to remove.Once you get the compartment open , it is necessary to turn the whole thing upside down to remove the pills . If the sliding lids worked well enough to make the device reasonable to open , one would risk sliding it all the way out & dumping multiple doses while turning the box upside down trying to get one dose out.The inner tray is supposed to be removable to make it easier to fill each week . I could n't get the inner tray to come out at all . -LRB- That also made it impossible to get at the card one fills out to document which medicines are taken at what times . -RRB- Thinking I might be overlooking something , I asked 2 other intelligent adults to read the instructions & try ; & neither of them could slide it out either . Based on the edge of the tray I was able to observe & feel during multiple attempts , it is made of a thin plastic comparable to the type that is commonly used in packaging , & easily crushable.In my opinion , if the workmanship was of a much higher quality , this might be usable by an adult with small fingers & good manual dexterity . It 's absolutely impossible for someone with poor dexterity , & in any case would try the patience of Job .
 While the individual cubbies can be locked , the entire pill box can be slid open with no lock on the side . This is not safe and does not work as described . I do n't understand why anyone would design anything like this .
 This test is supposed to be sensitive enough to detect a pregnancy prior to the date of your missed period but I got a negative two days after I missed my period . I tried two other tests -LRB- dfferent brands -RRB- and they both came back positive . I think the AIMSTICK is a waste of money .
 I was NOT happy with these tests . We are TTC , so anything that gets hopes up , to be shot down is a NONO . I took 3 test on 3 different days , and each one came up with a faint positive , right away . I went to the doctors for a blood test . BFN -LSB- big fat negative -RSB- :-LRB- I will never purchace these tests agian .
 First off , this is too expensive for quantity . This is pretty much a travel size bottle , you can easily get double or tipple for less . Second , it 's not very moisturizing , it tends to make your tattoos dry and scaly while healing . And Thirdly , It contains an ingredient dimethicone , which is a natural rubber latex , meaning , IF YOU 'RE SENSITIVE TO LATEX , DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT !!!! The company who makes this is just trying to make money off you , you dont need this lotion !
 I have friends that rave about this product . Unfortunately I found I was allergic to it and there is nothing worse then the itch of a new tattoo combined with a reaction itch .
 This lotion is all around terrible . From the scent to the consistancy . It 's like oily lotion that feels greasy with an unpleasant smell . It would be worth it if it actually made tattoo colors more vibrant , but it fails in that department as well .
 didnt , like this , , felt very dry after applying , i rather stick to regular lotion. , just didnt think it was worth what i paid for .
 I purchased this along with the salve in a tin . The salve works great and is a good moisturizer , but this is a totally different story . I 've tried this now on a small tat and on 1/4 of a sleeve , and both times I thought it was awful . For me , it actually seems like it dries out the area . I have no idea how this is possible , but it literally feels dry after I rub it in . I swear by the Tattoo Goo wash , and the salve is very good , but this stuff does not work for me at all .
 Mrs. Meyer 's Clean Dish Soap is a useful product but expensive . The box arrived with a spill from one 16 oz . bottle that made a big mess . It is not packed well for shipping . Now I have to clean up my front poarch and Mrs. Meyer is not here to help !
 I was surprised to find Meyers does n't make fragrance free products . I sampled all of the fragrances and found them all way too strong . I do n't want to smell like a French whorehouse . I want clean , not stink !
 bought this cause I love lemon verbena fragrance - does n't smell bad but way strong - makes me sneeze-but diluted twice amount of water gets dishes clean so ok
 I wanted to like this soap . The fragrance was wonderful until it stayed on everything I washed with it . I rinsed and rinsed , and tried using less with no avail . I bought the Seventh Generation Free and Clear dish soap instead and did n't have the same peobelm .
 Do a search on line for sodium laureth sulfate toxidity . Two ingredients on the bottle are listed as Plant Derived Surfactants & Perfume -LRB- I was under the impression there was no added fake perfume from the product description , but I definately noticed the chemicalness & irritation upon using the dishsoap -RRB- . I called the company and was told the perfume ingredient on the list of ingredients was indeed chemical -LRB- man made , not essential oils as the others listed -RRB- . `` Plant derived surfactants '' is what companies put on their labels when using sodium laurel sulfate or sodium laureth sulfates -LRB- the two that you should avoid -RRB- . There are non toxic plant derived cleaners that suds , but companies will list the actual name as they have nothing to hide.I gave this product 2 stars , one for great cleaning and one for their customer service .
 My favorite scent for this line is the Lemon Verbena because it is non-floral and subtle . I wanted to try the dish detergent , but it wasnt available in Lemon Verbena , so I ordered the Geranium . Well , it doesnt smell like geraniums to me , maybe more like sweet pea flowers , but in any case , it is hugely overpowering . You can smell it thru the entire house , and a very faint smell remains on dishes after they 're rinsed . I sometimes wash my hands with it because the dispenser on the sink is filled with it , and boy , it 's Perfume City for hours after you unleash the suds . I know that strong aromas are very popular now , and I also know that people who like everything scented do not notice when aromas become too strong -- it 's olfactory overload in the nose . We like to cook in this house , and avoid scented candles , air wicks , incense , or other smells , but we enjoyed the Lemon Verbena cleaning spray , sink cleanser -LRB- excellent ! -RRB- , and toilet bowl cleaner . The geranium however , Eh ! No thanks . By the way , I ordered several boxes of these liquids from Amazon , and everything arrived without leaking , but I am not surprised to read the reviews where people complained . There is no vacuum or heat-sealed cellophane on the cap , so if that cap gets bumped in transit after its little cover comes off , you got big sticky trouble , and the post office staff will hate you , Amazon , Mrs. Meyers , and everybody involved .
 Mrs. Meyer 's dish soap and many other products in this line are very toxic . I 'm told they made it into the ` health section ' of stores because they are biodegradeable . However , they contain toxic synthetic fragrances -- note they are simply listed as ` fragrance ' on the label . Synthetic fragrances are known to disrupt hormones -LRB- promoting obesity , thyroid disorders , sperm damage , and birth defects -RRB- , induce or worsen respiratory problems , cause immune system supression cancer and kidney disease , and damage the brain and nervous system.Many companies add a natural ingredient -LRB- in this case lemon verbena or lavender - if these are indeed the real thing - to pretend their product is natural . This is unethical.For general cleaning I recommend vinegar . For dish soap - I suggest you look at other brands.If you desire more information on fragrances and their toxic effects , Sandra Redemske of Redemske Design has put together some remarkable information .
 Very disappointed in this soap . The scent is not `` lemony '' ... it stinks of `` old lady powdered perfume '' . If you know what I mean by an old powdered scent ... you 'll know what I mean . You get this on your hands and you will have to smell it for hours . It 's horrible raising food to your mouth with this `` perfume '' on your hands . You ca n't wash it off either.Besides that , after washing a few cups during the day , I noticed my hands were now chapped and burning . The detergents in this soap opened the cuticle of my skin on my hands so horribly that they felt like someone had taken sandpaper to them.Absolutely horrible stuff . Oh , your dishes will smell of this perfume too . I raised a cup to my mouth to drink coffee and smelled the powdery perfume smell in the cup . Had to rinse and rinse and rinse . Never buy again .
 My hands became very irritated after using this product . Lavender scent lingers on everything , which would n't be a bad thing if was natural lavender , but it is n't . Would not purchase again .
 Well , so it goes for ordering online . This smell just did not work for me . And it is so strong that I smell it after I am done with dishes . I usually like lemon verbena smell of other products or brands but this one is a killer .
 I could n't clean my toilets often enough when I got Mrs. Meyer 's rose & geranium cleaner ... . it made the whole bathroom smell lovely . Now I see that it is just geranium ... . but I still like it.HOWEVER , I bought lemon Verbena scented dish soap and I think it is horrible . It suds ok but the smell is weird . I have had Lemon Verbena hair products from another manufacturer and it is a delightful odor so I know it is not that I might not like that particular scent . Now I am afraid to try any other of your products !
 I finally purchased the Mrs. Meyer 's lavender dish soap after seeing on the store shelves . I find the scent to be very `` perfumey '' and it almost smells like artificial lavender . The soap cleans ok , but the smell seems to linger on glasses and cook-wear even after an extensive rinse . The lingering smell is enough for me not to recommend the product .
 I 've used this product for several years now , but it is n't working very well lately . The main problem is that there 's very few bubbles and I found I was having to use more and more product to get my dishes and pans clean . The consistency appears to be the same , but it just does n't clean . In fact , this is my main complaint with most all of the Mrs. Meyers products I 've used . They smell nice but do n't do much beyond that . I feel like I 'm using a product that was devised for a reniassance home - lots of perfume to cover the bad smells , but no cleaning power . What a let down.Update
 This stuff smells so good , I love the packaging and the hand soap but I got the dish soap and now everything I cook in my frying pan smells like flowers . Smells great , tastes not so great . I cant get the freakin flowers out either . I hate taking stuff back to the STO but this is gross .
 It suds pretty well - I 'll give it that . But the nonsense about being scented with `` essential oils '' is greenwashed bullhockey . The scent of this product comes from artificial fragrance , with a smattering of real essence thrown in so they can charge you double . Every time I wash dishes I choke on perfume , and the smell of fake flowers blended with sink scum is not entirely pleasant . My hands seem drier , too.I despise brands that pretend to be `` eco-friendly '' and `` natural '' just to make an extra dime off the gullible .
 I thought this was supposed to be a natural product but it has artificial fragrances and it really bothered my hands since I have mild eczema . Very disappointed since the labeling was misleading .
 The sent of this Lemon Verbena dish soap is really disturbing . I love natural Lemon Verbena paste and find this nauseates me . I asked the kids to use it and find that I want to leave the house if anyone is using it . I agree that it takes a long time to get the smell off your hands . I would advise avoiding this brand .
 Soap is fine but I have had three faulty pumps which leaked soap and would leave a mess on the sink until the bottle was empty . Very frustrating . I do n't intend to buy this product again .
 I was hoping this product would be as effective as the ones with more chemicals . Not so . The product does not work even with a clean shower . Maybe the other reviews have not used other more effective products . I would rate it a zero if I could .
 One spray bottle was empty because it had leaked into the cardboard container . I did not realize that there was a choice of fragrance . I preferred the rosemary that I had the last time . Any chance of getting a replacement bottle ?
 This works pretty good , I usually make my own cleaner by thought I 'd get a `` treat '' to make cleaning a little more interesting . I think the lemon verbena smell is terrible . I know this is personal preference but just thought I 'd share . I LOVE to use lavender and tea tree oil when cleaning ... I do n't even mind the smell of vinegar with tea tree oil in it ... but this stuff smells like `` old lady '' perfume to me . The lingering smell is too much for me . I should have stuck to what I love and ordered it in lavender .
 2.0 out of 5 stars not so green , March 12 , 2008By Jakob OasI always thought these products looked the part of clean and natural , until they showed up in my house.They are very fragrance heavy , and being a person slightly sensitive to fragrance I started to notice it would make me a bit flushed and headachy . The countertop cleaner really bothered me most of all , because it would be on my food eating and prepping surfaces.The more I was around it the more it bothered me . I would even say it was overwhelming on my table while I ate and the fragrance got into the food when I used it on my butcher block.My wife also got the hand soap and having just used it I found that it too caused me some flushed feeling . So I decided I should share my experience . I have never written a product review before , but I 've decided I find the claim of natural and `` green '' to be a bit misleading . These products truly bother me where most other average products do not , be they green or conventional .
 I just broke down and rinsed my counter with water , and thought I should note that the smell of this product is very , very strong -LRB- `` aromatherapy '' indeed -RRB- and not to my liking at all . I cleaned my countertop with a few squirts of this spray several hours ago , and the smell was overpowering ! It was like I had spilled an entire bottle of perfume -LRB- not good perfume , either -- more like eau de grandma -RRB- . I opened the windows and kept hoping it would go away , but every time I walked by my kitchen that gag-inducing odor was still thick in the air.As counter spray , it does just what it ought to , but you may want to give it a sniff in the store before you buy it .
 I 've tried this product on all kinds of cleaning tasks . Forget harsher cleaning products - it does n't even hold its own against dish soap and water in a spray bottle . It cleans slightly better than water by itself , but only just . I genuinely do n't know what the positive reviews here are talking about .
 My housekeeper , who has worked for me for 3 years , says Mrs. meyer 's effects her asthma . I have used many other ` eco-freindly ' products in the past which has not caused a problem . I recommend not using this product . I thought it was a superior ALL NATURAL product since it was sold in WF . After purchasing another of Mrs. Meyer 's products , my wife complained about a metallic taste left in her mouth . I did some research and found they use artificial fragrance . Is this what is causing the issues in my home ? I would not purchase again .
 I had read about this product and wanted to like it so bad , but after cleaning my kitchen with it , I ca n't stop sneezing and my eyes are watering ! I 've never had this happen with any other cleaner before . I guess I must be sensitive to something in this stuff . Needless to say , I wo n't be buying this again .
 I bought this product because I needed a cleaner that would be easier to use than my natural lemon juice-vinegar-baking soda homemade mixtures . I was looking for a cleaner that was gentle on people and the enviornment and settled on this one . Although it 's a counter top cleaner I first tried it on the sink and tub in a small bathroom . The scent/fumes were overwhelming and I had to open the window and step out of the room . Today I tried using it on my kitchen counters and again I found the scent much too strong . I gave it two stars because it cleaned pretty well but I ca n't use it again . If you 're sensitive to strong scents or fumes you might want to try another product .
 I have used Meyers lavender products in the past -LRB- stainless steel cleaner and detergent -RRB- and really liked them.This product does n't smell like lavender ... more like a dime store perfume.It 's awful ! And I ordered a CASE of them.I recommend that interested parties buy one and try it first .
 I was looking forward to trying this because I love the smell of lavender . Unfortunately the scent is overpowering . It 's way to strong . I 'm glad I only tried it on one countertop because I 'm sure I would have a headache if I had cleaned the entire kitchen . I will be returning this .
 This establishment is a scam . This is the 2nd time I have tried to order this product . The company allowed me to order it 2 times , charged me and told me it was on it 's way . When I track it I receive a message that the product is undeliverable however it actually never leaves the facility because they do n't have the product . It took weeks to refund me the first time . I have yet to be notified that the product is unavailable more than a week after ordering AND I have n't received a refund . TOTAL SCAM . Not sure why Amazon continues to suggest the product is in stock and that it ships . Totally unacceptable .
 I 've used the Lavender spray for years and love it . I tried the Geranium and it is much stronger , too strong for me . Too bad I bought a six pack before realizing I did n't like the scent !
 I really really wanted to like this and tried it tonight on my Corian - left the Corian streaky and SUCH A STRONG SMELL . Ugh ! Back to Lysol kitchen spray .
 Terrible . DO NOT RECOMMEND . I 've had a number of protein bars and I do n't know what people who say these taste great are eating , because they are terrible . If you want a good protein bar , go with PURE Protein . You can get the peanut butter ones with 33g of protein and they taste fantastic , almost like a candy bar . DO NOT BUY THESE .
 Maybe I did something wrong , but the instructions were clear so I do n't see how I could have . It just did n't work . The instructions clearly say not to put it in the frig or freezer . But that 's the only way I can think it might actually work . Otherwise , it just does n't stay cool
 A little disappointed ... this is n't staying cool and it keeps moving around and getting lumpy inside the pillow case . Am I doing something wrong that it doesnt ' stay cool all night ?
 What a disappointment ! It does not work as described . The pillow does not get any cooler then the water you put in it and it does not stay cool . I ended up throwing it away - save yourself the money and do not buy this .
 Not only does the Chillow not stay cool for longer than 10 mins. , it is n't comfortable . I put mine in the trash .
 This was just a way to get your money . It does n't work at ALL !!! I feel really stupid for beleiving that it would work . I tried several times and each time after I filled with water and followed the directions it still was not cool . Maybe for a minute or so but it does n't stay cool it gets warm just like any other pillow after you lay on it . and it is not comfortable.SAVE YOUR MONEY DO N'T EVEN BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP .
 I was really happy to receive this as a Christmas gift but the cap does not seal well and the chillow leaks ... slowly ... but who wants a wet bed ?
 This thing is not a pillow . It just holds like 5 cups of water and is a flat insert that is heavy and does not stay in the pillow case . You have to lay flat and can not move on it in order to get the benefits . This is the dumbest thing I have ever bought . Do n't waste your money !
 I have been using this item for almost 3 months and soon will have no need for it further . Initially I was very pleased as the seat allows one in a cast to be able to take a shower with the use of a shower cap for the cast . The frame of the item is sturdy enough but the plastic seat is of poor quality and is deteriorating with continued use . If I had to use it for another 3 months I do not believe it would make it . the price was very attractive but sometimes you do get what you pay for . Important point is that I weigh 225lbs . If you weigh considerably less I believe it would hold up much better .
 My husband had a stroke and needed this to bathe . It came and when we tried to put the legs on , they all went easily except one , where the button would not push in for us to slide the leg on , no matter how hard we tried . Called Amazon , whose basic response was `` So sorry , comes from another seller , nothing we can do . We 'll give you a refund when we get it back . '' This is increasingly Amazon 's policy . Nothing they can do , all the fault of the seller . In the meantime , I 'm stuck with a defective product and no way to give my husband a shower unless I want to pay for another chair and get my refund later . What lousy customer service . Amazon should take their cue from Zappo 's - the best online customer service on the planet . I 'm a longtime customer of Amazon who has spent TONS of money on this site , but no more . They 've lost my business , and were n't even interested in doing anything to keep it.Good riddance to Amazon .
 The seller or the manufacturer should put more information on the size of the bench . It will not fit in the bathtub because the bathtub curves on the side . The bench was never used . It was donated to a charity store because the box that it was mailed in was over-sized , and it would have cost more to return it than I paid for it . I am very unhappy with this transaction .
 Once-able people are not enured to the junk our forever-disabled comrades are.I am so sorry.This piece of junk is not well designed , and difficult for others to move out of the way.I should have known the clueless physical and occupational therapists read a magazine ad , once .
 When the box was delivered , we should have refused delivery as it was torn . One of the legs was actually exposed . Upon assembly we found that that leg was bent the the device would not sit evenly . We immediately called the shipper and left a message . Further communication with Amazon and the shipper have resulted in no action . When we disputed the charge on the Amazon Chase credit card we were informed that it may take up to a year to resolve and we need to keep the bench . This is not a very good reflection on the quality of the vendors that Amazon chooses to include in their web site.VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE WHOLE MANNER THAT THIS HAS BEEN HANDLED !
 Well , hard to tell it does not work , it is just that I have not notice any effect from it , and I am 64 y.o. , could be that my hormone level is just fine while on some herbal supps . And Paleo eating / living for + 2 years now , anyway I guess sublinguals are effective . Lmb
 I bought this item and found it much too high . Most chairs are 16-18 '' high and a transfer bench should be chair height . Other transfer benches can go this low . Looking at the manufacturer 's website , I find that this item can be adjusted to 20.5-25 .5 inches high . Since the legs that go into the tub need to be shorter than those that go outside the tub , the transfer bench will be perhaps 22 inches off the floor when the bench is level . For many people , their legs will be hanging at this height or they will be sitting on the edge of the bench weight resting on their wet slippery feet . It 's ridiculous that the supplier has n't warned potential customers that this item is unusually large.In all other respects , this transfer bench seems perfect fine . SInce safety is the main reason for buying this product , I gave it one star .
 Was asked to purchase for my step-Mom . A doctors news letter suggested its use for Alzheimer 's , along with four other products .
 I am used to using sucralose sweetener and this is not near as sweet . I had to use 7 packets to sweeten my coffeeand it had a strange taste that I did n't like .
 For anyone considering buying this ... it smells like rubber and its sticky ! ick ! I 'm returning it because it is n't smooth and I would not put it anywhere near my genitals ! Also the drawstring is very long and pointless . Oh and it 's solid blue . . not this translucent blue like in the picture !
 I purchased the bar for use in an area with little use -LRB- motorhome -RRB- . After about a month of occasional use it was on the floor . I have cleaned it and the area and tried to re-adhere , it sticks but will only last approx 1 day before falling off again . I am very disappointed as it could be a potential safety issue .
 I bought two of these bars . The one I attached to drywall works fine . The one I put in the shower wo n't stick longer than 30 min . although I followed all the instructions -- cleaned surface , not fastened on grout lines . I contacted Driver and got no help or satisfaction .
 One month after the warrantee was up the lever on the suction cup broke . I paid $ 37.00 for one of these and the replacement part were going to be over $ 60.00 . Go for the Safer-er Grip . Cost is half the price for a better product .
 I 'd say these grab bars suck , but they do n't . They just fall off . They do not even deserve 1 star , but there is no option to give it nothing .
 The clamping lever on one end of the bar failed after about one year . Drive would not honor their 3 year warranty , insisting that the lever was part of the suction cup which only has one year warranty . For want of a 50 cent part , Drive wanted me to purchase the entire suction cup assembly for almost as much as I paid for the unit in the first place . An overpriced product and poor customer service does not rate many stars . I purchased a cheap -LRB- about 25 $ -RRB- unit at the same time as the Drive unit and I use it regularly -LRB- 3-4 times per week -RRB- same as the Drive , and it 's holding up just fine . The Drive unit looks like quality , maybe this was just a flaw but the poor customer service does it for me . I will never buy another Drive product .
 The item looked of good quality but would not adhere to the wall due to the 4 '' tile surface . The grout lines were in the way of a solid connection . I did not realize this when buying the item and therefore had to return it .
 PROS ; NONECONS ; THIS CLIPPER GETS TOO HOT TO THE SKIN TO FINISH ONE HAIR CUT ALSOTHE HOTTER IT GETS THE LOUDER IT GETS .
 At first I was impressed by this dishwashing liquid ... The scent and the cleaning ability seemed great after the first wash . But , we soon realized that the scent was somehow being absorbing into all our plastics including our sons bottles , plastics spoons , spatulas etc. and was overpowering the taste of food . If you never use plastics in the dishwasher , you might enjoy this product , but in our house it just does n't work . We 've gone back to cascade ... maybe all natural is n't so great after all .
 I had been very pleased with Meyer 's products , especially the basil scented all purpose cleaner and cleansing powder . This product is awful . Dishes do not come clean , even if I rinse prior to washing . I called Meyer 's to see if they would offer a coupon for another product since I was very disappointed . They increased my disappointment by acknowledging the the product does n't work at all on tea or coffee stains but did n't offer anything other then `` return it to the store you bought it from '' . terrible customer service
 The milky film stays on all the glassware right out of the dishwasher ... No test kitchen ? Mrs Meyers , what gives ??? I use almost all of your products but this is too much work . I do n't have time or want to waste the resources to re-wash everything.Sorry , but this is a miss ...
 I did n't mind the smell but it failed to clean my greasy pots and pans . I am using 7th Generation powder now and will restock 7th Gen when I run out .
 This review is referring to the lemon verbena gel product.After using this soap for 3 months I have to say I am dissappointed . The dishes did n't come out clean . The scent remained on the dishes after washing . I do n't like drinking my morning coffee with the scent of lemon verbena strongly wafting up my nose . This must mean that the product does n't rinse off very well even with a fairly new dishwasher in good working condition and with the use of a rinse aid . Maybe it is the water in my area - who knows ? Of course , I bought a case of the stuff and luckily I had found online another use for it . It is supposed to work well as a toilet cleaner . Anyway , I will be continuing my search for the perfect eco friendly dishwashing detergent . I am glad it works well for some of you .
 `` Includes a pleasant fragrance to fill your kitchen with freshness '' - This products are SO STINKY we had to wash our dishes several times afterward using this product to get the smell out of the dishes and the kitchen . If you enjoy drinking a cup of tea and smelling your dishwasher soap , then by all means , this is the product for you . If you are chemically sensitive , stay away from all Mrs. Meyers products . Their `` aromatherapy '' is not good for anyone .
 I love everything else I 've tried from Mrs. Meyer 's , but this stuff is awful . It does n't matter HOW much you use . We have a water softener , and the soap still leaves a terrible film on everything . Stuff looks filthy when its done in the dishwasher , especially silverware . Also , poor marks for actually cleaning the dishes . Stuff like coffee , not dried on . If I have to wash the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher , and again after its done to get rid of the film ?!! I think not . I sure wish I did n't still have so much of this .
 I 've been using 7th generation for a bit and I was getting tired of the grit left behind on glassware so I decided to give Mrs. Meyers a try . I was ready to love this , I truly was . However I was in for a rude awakening as their auto dish soap is among the worst I 've ever used.Whenever we use this , everything comes out with a film . Everything . The glassware , the mugs , the plates - there is always this thin film that requires me to further rinse the dishes before use . Now this is annoying . As if this was n't bad enough , my regular knives come out dirtier than when they were put in ! I have no idea how this happens but almost every knife has this strange white , milky residue . And maybe a green bit or two . The spoons tend to be worse . However , the forks are fine -LRB- go figure -RRB- . Now before this gets chalked up to me and bad dishwasher habits , every other auto dish soap I 've used has never had this problem . None . I simply do not understand what 's going on.Finally , we grabbed the Lavender soap by accident . I tend to prefer my dishes to not have any smell , but heck I do n't mind florals . I 'm not sure what Lavender plant they are trying to mimic but they really picked a stinky one . When the dishwasher is on , I need to leave the room as the smell gets too intense . Once the dishes are done , the odour is very minimal but still present.Overall I want to help the environment but I also want clean kitchenware . I 'll continue my search for an automatic dish soap that is both ok with the environment and good at cleaning since Mrs Meyers truly is n't working .
 So I love the Mrs Meyers products in general and use all of the housecleaning products . I decided to use the diswashing liquid because it got pretty good reviews . Well I 'm not sure what those folks saw but what I saw were simple rings in my coffee cups that would be easy to remove with Cascade . It did a lousy job cleaning any of our dishes and we generally rinse our dishes before they go into the dishwasher . Do n't waste your money on this .
 Not at all satisfied with Mrs. Meyer 's Clean Day Automatic Dishwashing Liquid . I use many other products from Mrs. Meyer 's and am very satisfied . This product just does not get the dishes clean without putting them in the dishwasher already basically clean after a thorough rinse . Still looking for an environmentally friendly dishwashing liquid or powder .
 The friend who I purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too FAST for her to keep up with . She is used to a two wheeled walker , but wanted one with a seat . She did n't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund . It turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund ; so she did n't return it . The lesson
 I bought this rollator for my grampa -LRB- who lives in a different state as I do -RRB- when he needed a walker and also frequently got too tired to keep walking . The medical device stores were all selling rollators for 3-4 hundred dollars , so this seemed like a great deal . We ordered the blue , and with a wire basket . This one was red and with a cloth basket -- not what he wanted but not a big enough deal to send it back.A year later , the leg broke at the seam where the back and the leg are welded together . My grampa called me to ask how he can get it fixed ... . after all Drive has a great reputation and a LIFETIME guarantee . I have talked to Amazon and Drive no less than 20 times now . Amazon says they will only replace it within 30 days of purchase . Drive says they do n't deal directly with consumers - only through retailers . Drive advised me that if Amazon wo n't help me replace the item , I should call around retailers in my grampa 's area to see if they will replace it . Here 's what all of the retailers have said -LRB- and i 've talked to over a dozen -RRB- `` so you want us to replace an item that we did n't sell you ? No . I 'm sorry , but it 's not our problem . call someone else . `` So here we are , with a broken rollator , many wasted hours on the phone chasing a worthless guarantee , and a poor grampa who said tonight on the phone `` it 's ok for now , I 'm trying not to lean on the broken side '' . I completely regret buying this brand as well as buying it from Amazon.com . If you are considering this item or ANY item with a guarantee for purchase online , please research the guarantee conditions first .
 Too much vitamin B. I started taking them and after 2 1/2 weeks I started to feel dizzy and experienced heart palpitations . Two days after I discontinued taking them i started to feel much better . These did n't work for me . Bottle is sitting in my pantry almost full .
 This supplement smells bad -LRB- like sulfur -RRB- and makes us smell bad , too -LRB- like onions -RRB- . Also , research shows that vitamin B in pill form does n't work on anyone who has used antacids , or pepto bismal , or Cimetidine , or anything that causes the stomach to lower the acid production level.I discovered that the Vit . B injections seem to have the best results . I wish I had gone to the doctor and gotten the B injections instead , or ordered the injectibles online through Dr. Gates -LSB- . . -RSB- and paid someone 2 give us the injections . Now , we 're stuck with bottles of this stuff and are n't going to take them because of the bad smell and they did n't work for us -LRB- energy , calmness , weight loss , etc. . -RRB-
 This vitamin complex has a strong odor that turned me off immediately . I tried taking them twice , and both times it made me nauseous and upset my stomach for the rest of the day . I would not recommend this product .
 It smelled good , but I did not buy it for the scent . I bought it because I thought it was more enviromentally friendly then what I could find on my grocery store shelf . Turns out the ingrediants are just about the same . I would not buy it again .
 I do n't know what happened to this product , but whatever it was , it was n't good . I had purchased my first vial nearly a year earlier and was thrilled with the scent , and it lasted all day . It was sweet , sensual , wonderful . This new edition is none of those things.First off it does not smell the same , there is no longer the sweetness , the floral tones so important , obviously . Second , it does n't last , which is now I suppose a good thing.I ended up pitching the whole thing , I was n't going to wear it , it was just taking up space . Too bad , it had been my favorite .
 Received an e-mail stating Advil would be shipped in 2 days , received it about 3 weeks later.Also the price I paid was more then the price quoted when ordering . Have order Advil many times , this is the first time I had a problem .
 Workouts were great , results were indeed quite amazing!I did the recommended dose of 2 cans back-to-back , and I saw indeed a lot of results during the time.I also had a good time at the gym on top of it - definite boost in work out motivation and interest to push the weights.What I did n't notice at first is that not only my muscles got more toned and round , but I also developed small lumps under my nipples , so-called `` gynecomastia '' . This became especially noticeable in the days after I stopped taking the product.I am still struggling with this side-effect today . Not only did my T-shirt size grow from size M to L during the 3 months surrounding my consumption of this product -LRB- I am not kidding you -RRB- , but I do have to wear bigger T-shirts now also to hide my somewhat pointy/baggy pecs.I had never thought this could have an effect like that as it is not a banned steroid or other direct hormone product , but evidently it succeeds so well in boosting testosterone in a `` legal '' way that the test gets `` aromatized '' into estrogen and can cause you to start growing female breast tissue.The only way to get rid of these lumps I have now is surgery.I am sharing this embarrassing story so you can make an informed decision.And Animal Nutrition , I am disappointed that you have no warnings about this on the product . I am sure that I am not the only one this has happened to .
 Go and buy Twin-labs ZMA Fuel on bodybuilding dot com , does the same thing at a fraction of the cost .
 Also got Nausea and a migraine from taking the product.Followed directions and still nausea and headche lasted for days.Will not try TEST again , throwing the remains away .
 I had high hopes for TEST after reading all these reviews so I took 2 straight cycles of this . I just finished the second cycle and i have n't noticed any difference . If there was a difference then it was so minimal that I could n't tell . Also , keep in mind there is no testosterone in this . It only has ingredients that raise your natural test levels . Maybe it works but not for me
 Overall , I was extremely disappointed with animal test.I 'm young , athletic , and well conditioned when it comes to weight lifting . I was looking for something to take it a step further . So I kicked up my diet , kicked up my workout routine , and figured I 'll give animal test a try . I bought two packages , which is one cycle according to Universal Nutrition.While I took animal test , I had a very strict diet and workout plan . I ate several meticulously planned meals a day and took weight gainer , atop my normal protein and supplement routine . I 'm an unemployed student , so I have plenty of time to ensure my diet and workout routine is regular . Throughout the cycle , I averaged 3500 or so calories a day , and at least 250 grams of protein a day . I 'm a lean 200 lbs.I gained about 4 or 5 lbs in the 42 days of animal test plus the following few weeks , which I 'll attribute the credit to the results of animal test . OK , 4 or 5 lbs , but using about the same routine , about the same diet , and just basic supplements -LRB- with NO test , gh , or hgh boosters -RRB- , I gained about 8 lbs in the course of about 10 weeks several months after I stopped taking animal test.And I 'd normally not mention the price of a supplement in a review , since that has nothing to do with effectiveness of a product , but there 's no hiding this one . It is EXPENSIVE . You need two bottles for ONE on cycle . Why ? Because who 's gon na pay $ 120 for one bottle of supplemental pills ? Exactly . You would n't even consider it if it costed $ 120 . Since it costs 60 , you 're looking into and reading the reviews , are n't you ? That is Universal Nutrition 's plan , and it worked on me.I honestly hate to admit I wasted $ 120 or so , but I did . With this product , Universal is selling hype . There 's seriously nothing on the market right now that can do what this bottle claims it does . Learn the cheap way and do n't buy into hype.And I 'm not writing this review out of anger , I took animal test about 8 months ago . I can truly say there is no difference between taking this product and not taking this product.One more thing
 I like Universal products and got great results from them all especially M-Stack , but not so much with this one . The only result I got was extreme hunger which is a good thing if your trying to bulk up . Other than that I saw no results . Most of the people on here did and I am not saying it is a bad product , just wierd that I got nothing out of it . The pills gave me bad burps and a wierd taste in my mouth , almost like a fish oil pill .
 I took this product after a meal before bed , the next day I woke up with a terrible hangover . Nausea and a migraine that lasted 2 days . I tried to return it but amazon says this product can not be returned . DO NOT BUY ! ESPECIALLY HERE !
 What kind of lie is this ? There is NO testosterone in the product , it is NOT `` gear '' and NOT animal . Complete bullshit .
 I noticed no noticeable change in concentration after taking this product for three weeks . I began to develop significant headaches after two weeks , which went away two days after I stopped taking it .
 Very poor quality cheap ! don not buy you are better off spending more for better quality ! I wish I would have returned it when I had the chance
 No good as a Pedicure Kit or my toe nails are too tough . Wasted my money on this item . Ray B.
 I expected to use the electric manicure/pedicure kit for my finger and toe nails . I am 67 years old , and doing my nails is not easy any more . This product worked but required alot more time to do finger nails than it did with clippers and nail file . Forget about it doing any kind of job in trimming toe nails ; even filing seemed to take a much longer time . It needs more speed and better/stronger filing tools to get the job done in less than an afternoon .
 My wife being from Europe , is really into foot care , so I thought I 'd buy her one.Save your money !! She hates it !! The revolutions are simply not high enough to get rid of callouses.It 's probably fine for fingernails , but not for stubborn foot callouses.It is not worth the money .
 This product is very elementary and has no power behind it to do any kind of pedicure job . I was very disappointed in it , it looked good , but is certainly NOT anywhere near a professional tool and I would not recommend it to anyone .
 I previously had the Medicool TurboFile II device but it broke down so I decided to purchase this one as a replacement . The device does work , but it is nowhere near as powerful as the Medicool device . For harder nails , the increased friction from applying increased pressure easily -LRB- and constantly -RRB- stops the head from spinning ; it simply does not possess the high torque of other devices . I would recommend this product only for light tasks .
 Did not have the proper attachments for a pedicure . Lost charge quickly . IO had to do pedicure/manicure in stages while waiting for the tool to recharge-definitely inferior to Dremel .
 I am not thrilled with this product , as it lacks quality and is NOT durable . Attachments are very small and need replacements . Very little power for the job it was designed to do . Since I 'm not long on patience , it ended up in the garbage !
 The electric tool is just fine , but the bits are worthless . I used the fingernail bit once and it was worthless after that . Better to get a Dremel and use their bits .
 I am not happy with my purchase . The ad said it was electric and it is actually battery powered . Tried it and wish I had not purchased it .
 For that much money , I expected a REAL Tool with Real Power and Serious Implements . This is a toy !
 I received this about a year ago and it worked great ... but now it does not hold a charge at all and is not usable .
 I bought this kit and it is a huge disappointment . They included two of one type of file for acrylic nails that I ca n't use and omitted the one I could use for natural nails . After no less than 6 phone calls , waiting on hold , calling manufacturer and amazon , many emails and promises , I still do not have the missing piece I paid for . buyer beware ; : - -LRB-
 I have IBS and this product irritates me . Went to Chelated Magnesium by the same company and I get along fine
 I received this product in a very timely manner and quickly followed instructions for returning the test for analysis and as of Oct. 5th have n't heard a word from them . They mentioned it would take 7-10 days to process and return the results . I have as yet to hear or see anything of the test results . I received this product on or around Sept. 2nd .
 I 'm not sure what this does . A friend of mine suggested it would help with my memory problems and another suggested it would help me sleep better but it has done neither .
 Impossible to absorb for our body this formula of glutathione . It will be destroyed before to go in the blood stream .
 I have purchased many products on Amazon , and never have purposely come back to the site to leave a review ; this time it was bad enough of a product that I felt it was required to warn others.THIS IS THE WORST TASTING BAR I 'VE EVER HAD . I have tried Myoplex , NitroTech , etc etc and this is by far the worst . During consumption , it tastes like it is almost rotten -LRB- the exp date is 3/17/11 - 5 months away -RRB- and leaves a terrible aftertaste , and it is hard as a rock.If you enjoy wanting to throw up after eating a protein bar , this is for you .
 Tastes like POO!Literally!I promise , as soon as you taste it , you will be wondering why you can smell excrements.GROSS!The first time I tried it , it was ok.Maybe the second batch was bad ?!
 My protein bars were melted - and I 'm now needing to clean up my work desk , because there are chocolate crumbs all over the place.I live in Kentucky and this is November . The bars did n't melt , sitting at my doorstep . They probably melted sitting in Amazon 's warehouse - considering the fact that the product I got was sold my Amazon itself.Very dissatisfied . If Amazon ca n't produce better results than this and do so regularly , they should NOT be selling this product !!
 These bars might be very good if they did not need to be refrigerated . I received mine in a box that stated to refrigerate before opening . After 24 hours in the refrigerator , I opened the box . I could see without even opening the wrappers that the bars had melted in shipment . They were caved in . When I tried to eat the bar , I could not bite off a piece to chew . The bar was hard and cold . I tried putting the unwrapped bar in the microwave for 5 seconds and it was still to hard . It took 10 seconds to make the bar edible . I did not enjoy a warm , melted bar . I did like the taste , but the warmth and the melted chocolate and caramel was not good . I did get a refund . I wish I could find these local so that I did not have to suffer shipping meltdown . The thing I liked the most is that I stayed full from breakfast through lunch . I noticed I ate a lot less at lunch . I just can not stand the warm , melted condition of the bars .
 I have tried many different protein bars over the years , but this one tops them all as the worst of the worst ! The texture is not dissimilar to numerous other bars and caramel , peanut butter and chocolate are standard in about 90 % of nutrition bars on the market . The smell is normal , but 3 seconds after the first bite and suddenly I know exactly what cat crap must taste like ! The taste suddenly makes me think I 'm standing in the middle of a giant catbox trying to scoop out the poop ! Anyone who has taste buds left should pass on this one .
 I received this item and passed them out to friends . I purchased them for a specific outing . Anyhow , thye were all old and the chocolate had turned chalky on most of them . Wo n't be ordering them again .
 I absolutely adore the Tung gel and have been using it forever , simply putting it on my regular toothbrush after brushing my teeth.I tried the Tung brush once , and it quickly ended up in the trash can . It is way too strong for my tongue , making it bleed , and extremely sensitive for several days after using it.Yes , cleaning my tongue with a regular brush does make me gag every now and then when I reach too far back , but trust me , it 's a lot less pain in the butt than being uncomfortable from the scratches on your tongue from this brush , for days .
 The tung brush is crap.That 's not even for lack of better words.This product does n't do what it says it does.You can get the same effect from a tooth brush.Sure a toothbrush is n't nearly as wide , but it does the same job.Recommendation
 THIS BRUSH IS A WASTE OF MY MONEY BECAUSE IT DOESNT REACH FAR BACK INTO MY MOUTH W/O ME HAVING TI GAG AND BRUSHING LEAVES MY TONGUE RED AND BLEEDING SO I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT .
 Had great hopes , but no shazzam . Perhaps if I were 30 years younger ... ? For a 77 year old man in great physical shape -LRB- round is a shape -RRB- I bet less booze and Rx medicines would be better . I am throwing all my pills away , especially the statins . Reflux Rx also goes . The booze and ginger stays , as they worked when I was younger .
 As a female I figured it could n't hurt to make sure the sex drive stays up there . Thought I 'd give it a try . Personally , the reaction was n't what I was looking for . Too hormonal -LRB- As if we ladies do n't have enough of that to deal with -RRB- . It was like a major emotional PMS moment . Oh well on to the next one to try and see if its any good . Ca n't hurt to try right ? Give it a try as if you like as everyone 's body chemistry is different but just know if your a chick this could be a result .
 ACK ! I used this on a blouse , and it left a STAIN ! there are no warnings about staining on the product label . The label even suggests spritzing on . Phooey !!!!
 This is the only spa mat that I have ever used so I cant compare it to others but it was really loud which is not good for me because I like to take a bath before I go to bed late at night when others are asleep so I could hardly ever use it . The bubbles are okay but they shoot out cold air , which makes it kinda chilly , and I noticed no thermal chances like the name states . Also , It is quite uncomfortable because the suction cups dont stay at the bottom of the tub , and I have an old ceramic tub , not plastic and it still doesnt stick . Whenever I sit up the mat floats up and shoots up air on top of the water level and I am constantly struggling to get the mat to stay down the entire time , so combined with the noise level and the cold chills from the air bubbles , i didnt get much enjoyment out of the spa mat and I hardly ever use it .
 and have n't seen any difference in the pain . I will continue to use it but was thinking I should have experienced SOME relief from the muscle pain in my calves and the pain in my knees by now .
 I was not impressed with this product . From the reviews I thought it would really help with the inflammation and ease the pain ... I 've just use until it is used up .
 My order was for 3 100g Traumeel oitment . The package stated 3 tubes were enclosed . There were only two.there was also no cost paid on the invoice . I called the company and was told the third tube would be sent out and to look for it in 3-5 days . I am presently awaiting that now . The price was checked and correct but that information belongs on the invoice without having to call . That 's the biggest reason for not wanting to do business with this company again . Last time I ordered through Amazon it came from Amazon in their packaging . No need to do anything but open it and Bless Amazon again .
 Not sure that this product is doing anything for me . I am using it on thumbs thatare plagued with tendonitis and I do not feel any difference , yet .
 The photo is not the product being sold . This one is only for pain relief -LRB- i.e. the red cap -RRB- and not the anti-inflammatory & analgesic -LRB- blue cap -RRB-
 I purchased this because I got rave reviews from a friend who used it on her wrist when she had a carpal tunnel flare up . Since I have been dealing with plantar fasciitis for more than 2 years , I was ready to try anything . I used the product twice a day for 3 weeks , rotating applications with Sombra Heat Therapy . Unfortunately , it did not seem to make a difference .
 I was very excited about this product based on the reviews I have read . I was hoping to treat my running overuse injury with herbal ingredients . However , after applying the creme to my aching foot soles I broke out hives on my ENTIRE body that lasted for HOURS ! I have since been informed that people who have allergens to ragweed might develop reactions . I would definitely be cautious and would advise people not to use this product if you have allergens to flowers , plants , or trees.If I could give this item anything less than one star I would ... . Only because I thought I was going to die of an allergic reaction .
 I WOULD SUGGEST YOU USE A SMALL AREA TO TRY THIS OUT . I PUT IT ON MY SHOULDER AND BROKE OUT IN A RASH AND ITCHING ALL OVER MY BODY . HORRIBLE HORRIBLE TOOK A COUPLE OF HOURS TO WORK ITS WAY OUT OF MY SYSTEM . I TOOK 3 SHOWERS.NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE .
 I had very high hopes for this product , but found it to be no better than what I had been using -LRB- Blue-emu -RRB- . Cost was same but no relief .
 I tried a free sample of this cream on my lower back and it felt the same as if I had rubbed any cream on my back . It really do n't make any difference in helping my lower back pain . Maybe it is good for other types of pain , but it has n't done anything for me .
 I was hoping that this product would help with my sciatica . Unfortunately , itdid not work for me . Would not buy again at $ 19 .
 For two plastic beads and some hobby-thread ... you can make your own for MUCH cheaper!Luckily , I got free shipping on my order -- otherwise this product is not worth once cent more than the $ 5.49 it is currently being sold for.Actually , it 's not even worth that much . Nice packaging , though .
 I have experienced problems with Rayovac Ultra Pro batteries leaking . When I first experienced the problem a couple of years ago , I assumed that it was just a bad battery or a bad batch . I understand that no product or manufacturing process is going to be perfect every time . So , I decided to give Rayovac the benefit of the doubt and I continued to purchase their Ultra Pro batteries for my electronics . Since then , I have continued to see the problem happen . It has now happened more than once with AA , AAA , and D cell batteries . I have never had the problem with their 9V cells or C cells , but I do n't use as many either . All of the batteries that failed were well within their expiration period , stored and used properly , and most were purchased at different times . Tonight it was my 3-Cell MagLite - and this is the last straw for me.Rayovac does provide a warranty/guarantee against battery leaks and product damage , but they require the customer to mail the damaged product and the leaking batteries to them . I think it is unreasonable and potentially hazardous to mess around with the corrosive batteries that are leaking in order to package them up for shipping . Warranty or not , with the frequency of failures that I have experienced , I will not be putting Rayovac batteries in any product that I own again .
 Why is every other battery unit priced per battery and these are priced per oz ? FYI , it appears these cost out to about 39 cents per battery . I have not used the batteries .
 There are several things I did n't like about this product :1 . The sections are numbered 1-4 instead of using labels like `` morning '' or `` lunch . `` 2 . The sliding pill cases are very difficult for anyone with arthritis to work . They only slide half way open to expose two compartments at a time .3 . If you slide off the container top all the way , the sections are numbered 1,2,4,3 . It 's hard to explain here but the numbering system and the top that only slides open half way are very confusing to someone who is elderly . If the alarm goes off and she goes to slide open the top all she sees are numbers , not the meal or time of day . She has to put together that if it 's the # 2 alarm going off then she should take the pills in the # 2 compartment .4 . The alram startles my Mom . It goes off again if she does n't hit the right button . After three times it just stops going off so if she 's not in the room when it goes off those 3 times , then she misses it .5 . The compartments are too small to hold her meds and vitamins.In general , i think I wasted my money . It 's too complicated for a senior .
 It 's no accident that the product shot is shown open . It CAN NOT be zipped closed with the amount of equipment and supplies shown ; furthermore , the pockets are not expandable enough to be functional . We tried it with several different meters to the same result.Buyer beware . This is close to useless .
 THE ITEM I ORDERED WAS , THE ON THE GO PEN ORGANIZER . I GOT THE ON THE GO ORGANIZER INSTEAD . I HAD ALREADY OPENED THE PACKAGE , SO I CA N'T RETURN IT . I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED . IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY . BECAUSE I NEEDED SOMETHING TO HOLD MY NOVOLOG AND LANTUS PENS PLUS SOME PEN NEEDLES WHEN I TRAVEL , NOT A SHARPS CONTAINER AND FREEZER PACK IN A BLACK BAG .
 Very unhappy . Bought for my husband 's back - recovering from back surgery . He is a big man -- over six feet , 200 lbs and cushion was too small . Sides are hard so no give to them . Went to Walmart and bought a round oblong lumbar pillow -- cheaper and works better .
 This item is too thick and too firm to be of use for me . I went with a much thinner and smooshier design from another manufacturer .
 Amazon 's link for purchasing the product was bad . I ended up with the wrong product which had to be returned -LRB- my cost , even though I ordered something else ! -RRB- and still have not received the original product . Although the problem was with Amazon 's ordering process , they made me try to resolve it with the seller of the product . I 'm unhappy about this , with no resolution in sight .
 I have been so disappointed with these batteries . I change my smoke detector batteries every December 31st and never have an issue with them lasting a year but here we are April 12th and I have now replaced 3 with low power , mid you these are devices that have little current draw and should easily last a year . The last battery I took out even allowed some acid to flow out it did not hurt anything but it was trash . So I give these a VERY LOW RATING >
 I bought these in August 2009 . They had an expiration date of Dec 2009 . I ended up discarding half of them because by the time I got around to using them they were essentially dead . They would power a smoke detector for less than a week .
 I bought the 8 pack . The 8 pack came sealed inside a little reclosable plastic container and was not damaged . I tested all 8 with a voltmeter and they all measure at 9.97 volts which is good . The expiration date is Dec 2016 . However , for some reason , this is the first 9V set I have purchased where half have slight dents in them . Previously , I purchased a 3 pack 9V standard Rayovac set from Wal-Mart and they were all pristine.All 9V batteries have 6 tiny cells inside them . Search Wikipedia 9V battery for more information and pic 's . I do n't know if these dents will damage these little cells and cause them to leak . I am going to be using them inside myTakamine G Series EG340SC Dreadnought Acoustic Electric Guitar , Naturaland any leaking would be a disaster . I do n't know if I should bother contacting Amazon and return them . Perhaps all of the Rayovac UltraPro 9V sets have dented batteries . Most of the batteries only have a slight dent . However , one is fairly pronounced . This is the last time I will be purchasing the Rayovac UltraPro 9V 's . I will either buy , retail box , the standard Rayovac 9V 's at Wal-Mart or go with the Energizer Max 9V 's at Home Depot.Specs : Expiration date is Dec 2016Rayovac UltraPro 9V Alkaline battery capacity
 NOT FOR SMOKE DETECTORS !!! STAY AWAY !!! I purchased these to do routine battery replacement for smoke detectors in our home . After I installed these batteries into all smoke detectors I had a great sense of accomplishment . Until one night one smoke detector started giving warning signal . I had to take a battery out to find out it leaked . Then it happened again once in the evening and another time in the night . Just last night I had to pull another smoke detector out in the middle of the night . When I got to my battery organizer to get a replacement I found that one of the last two batteries leaked while sitting in a plastic storage box !!! STAY AWAY FROM THESE . Maybe Rayovac makes decent batteries but definitely not these . These are not worth a penny !
 Buy these only if you want to keep changing your fire alarm battery every week or so . That 's what I have been doing . 8 pack will last approximately 8 weeks .
 I bought the pack of 8 for my guest room alarm clocks that need a 9v for backup when the electricity goes out which it does frequently in the country . I ca n't get a single one of the five clocks to work with these new batteries . Is this a NEWER type battery that does n't work in the older alarm clock ? My clocks have 00P6 on the inside where the battery goes . All the other 9v I have purchased before work and I have one of the older ones with enough charge that I tested the five clocks with the old battery and they all worked . Should I be more specific when ordering 9 v batteries or did I get a `` dud '' box . The expiration date is 2016 so unless they were stored outside in the blistering sun for months they should be okay .
 These batteries do not last . I 've had to replace 3 already in a span of a month for my fire alarm .
 but it did n't mention that in the description.I have purchased this item in other places and it has always come with the battery . . so just fyi . . I was disappointed to have to go out and get batteries.and then to have to take the thing apart to install them .
 This thermometer is a great concept , however , it never worked . I replaced the battery , but that did n't help . It turned on and looked at though it was going to take a temp and then ... nothing . My 3 and 5 year olds did not like how it sat in their mouth .
 I did alot of research and picked this product from the great reviews . I actually purchased one here on Amazon and it didnt work on arrival . Seller was great in helping me out . Then I purchased the same model on a completely different site and it , too , was dead on arrival . I thought maybe it was me but it wasnt . I spent alot of time researching , ordering , and then troublshooting what should be a simple product . What a pain . There must be something wrong with a recent lot . who knows . WIll give up with this one and try another make/model .
 Unbelievable ! Does not help when not included . Can not even find out what happens without a battery . Sorry I mad a purchase for this today . Stay away at this time .
 Just received this product . I opened it , pressed the only button on it and the button stuck . It will not work ? It does n't work and I am not happy about throwing my money away . I do not recommend this product .
 Great design , comfortable , but like many of the `` new generation '' thermometers , it pops up with it 's reading within a few seconds and the metal tip still feels cold in your mouth . The readings are way off.I have 3 other thermometers that all read within .1 of each other , and this one is about a full degree off -LRB- usually .8 high -RRB- . One of my other ones is a mercury fever themometer , and a basal mercury -LRB- only reads to 100 so easier to see small changes -RRB- and an older basal digital that takes 30 seconds or so to come up with a reading very close to the mercury ones.Althought the Timex one does n't say `` predictive '' it seems like some of the other `` few second digitals '' that do say `` predictive '' in terms of predicting what the temperature would be -LRB- before it fully warms up to that temperature -RRB- . I would pay 3 times as much for an accurate thermometer , what good is something that guesses at your temperature?I called the seller , they were very nice . I followed their recommendation and checked the battery on a meter - read very strong . So it was n't the battery . The seller refunded with no hassles . Too bad this thing does n't give accurate readings , I love the design as the other digitals are hard to keep in your mouth while you wait for the temp . -LRB- I monitor thyroid meds with temp , so I use a thermometer 3x a day -RRB- .
 It 's hard to find 350x reading glasses in most stores so I found these online and ordered several pair . Sorry , they do n't last very long because the earpiece breaks . I used to buy three pair for $ 20 at Sam 's and they lasted forever ; however , they do n't come higher than 300x . I 'll keep looking for glasses they last longer .
 These glasses have worked fine for me , but the design in rather `` old '' looking . Also , the left side temple piece came off about a month after I got them . I found the screw and fixed them but the hinge is poorly designed .
 I sent these back because it only has one small pouch of lavender filling that only heats one side of the hand . Not good enough ! The mitts I had before surrounded the entire hand with filling but they 're worn out and I ca n't find another pair like them . Too bad because the outside is really nice .
 Well I really do n't know how well the 4-pack of Teledyne piks -LRB- BRJ4 -RRB- works because , even though it 's clearly what I ordered , Goodman 's , without notice , sent me the Official WaterPik 2-Pack -LRB- JT-70E -RRB- in its place for the same total cost to me as what I had paid for the Teledyne 4-pack . Two piks in place of four ? For the same total cost ? Of course I got cheated . But is it worth the hassle of returning the package -LRB- paying postage , etc. -RRB- and reordering ? Obviously not . It 's not worth writing this review either , except to spare others from dealing with this dishonest company .
 This order was a complete rip-off . I ordered the product shown and was sent a shoddily packaged and manufactured copy . No where on the package does it say Teledyne or Water Pik . I received a package with the letters Wp-Brj on the front , absolutely no manufacturing info anywhere on the package . The clear plastic cover looks like it was removed and pasted back on by a two year old . I have no intention of using this product . I will return it immediately and will inform Amazon of the poor service from this company .
 Well they shipped them promptly , they were well packed , a fair price ... But they were half dead to dead on arrival should 've expected as much it 's the chance you take when shopping online : /
 Used these batteries in flashlights that we bought for our kids . The batteries did n't last 24 hours in them before they needed to be replaced.Spend the extra money and get batteries that will last ! Wish I did ...
 They did shipment quickly . But they sent me not 12 packs with 6 doses each , but 12 packs with 3 doses each!Today -LRB- 4/4/09 -RRB- I sent request to Customer Service of Red Tag about the problem . I 'll post result here . -LRB- 4/18/09 -RRB- Update
 This was recommended to me by a family member when I had the flu . I took it as directed , and was scared to find that within an hour my flu had become a lot worse . I tried taking more , and two hours after that my flu had gotten even worse ! I should have listened to my body , but attempted a third dose . At this point , the projectile vomiting started . I passed out at some point after that , and had to be taken to a hospital . Subsequent research I 've done has brought similar experiences to light and shown that it 's utterly ineffective . I guess I should n't be surprised , as it was promising something too good to be true . If it worked , the doctor would have probably prescribed it but hindsight is always 20/20 . I would n't touch this stuff with a ten foot pole , and under no conditions would I give it to a child who it might actually kill . Buyer beware !
 Homeopathic `` remedies '' contain no active ingredients . That is , there is no medicine in here of any sort . None . If you are already familiar with `` homeopathy '' and think it `` works for you '' , then this review is not for you . Keep on doing what you 're doing . If you are unfamiliar with `` homeopathy '' and stumbled upon a mention of this product , or were told about it by someone , here is how it works
 My dad insisted that I take this the last time I got a cold , so I did a little research , and found out what this is . They use pseudo-scientific jargon to disguise the fact that this is quite literally a sugar pill . The active ingredient is `` Anas barbariae hepatis et cordis extractum HPUS 200CK '' . `` Anas barbariae hepatis et cordis '' is Latin for duck heart and liver , HPUS is the acronym for a reference book that defines the ingredient . But do n't worry about consuming duck organs , the `` 200ck '' describes the method of preparation . They puree the duck parts in water . Then they actually completely empty out the bottle and refill it with pure water , and whatever is stuck to the side of the container is then presumably absorbed into the new water , thus quickly and drastically diluting the solution . And then they repeat this process ... 200 times ! They take the final `` solution '' -LRB- pure water -RRB- and put it on little balls of sugar . Statistically it would be like winning the lottery if even one molecule of duck was in your dose of sugar . Basically they could be using the heart and liver from the same duck for every dose they make until the sun explodes and they would have plenty left over . True , if you take this medicine your cold should be better in a few days . However , if you do n't take this medicine guess what ? Your cold should be better in a few days . These people are immoral crooks , and France out to be ashamed that they have n't put this company out of business.I am sorry for the negative review , it just makes me very upset to see such a deliberate , organized , long-lasting scam that has been accepted by so many . There is no cure for the common cold yet , just stick to medicines which help your symptoms , and if it makes you feel better to take this , go ahead , it wo n't hurt you , it is probably the safest medicine on the market .
 You should have record that I have reviewed this product before . NOT HAPPY . Ended up buying 2 bottle thankfully I could use one of them . The other I had to throw away which I found out was a mistake . The other company gave me a 20 % refund for a product I could not use .
 The only effect I had is to use the bathroom more with some bad feeling in my stomach with no effect on my weight ,
 Used as directed and found no difference , no weight loss . I am not sure if one month use is long enough to show results .
 I know the too good to be true saying , but I guess I still have hope . This product has done nothing to help with weight loss . I am on my second bottle now . It was a waste of money-I wo n't be a fool for this one again .
 I ordered white kidney bean extract and did not find this to be effective . It contained so many other ingredients , I felt it affected the potency and for that reason I was not satisfied with the product . I will not reorder . I did n't feel it had enough of the ingredient I ordered . I will look for something with a greater concentration of white kidney bean extract .
 When I ordered this product and I order not 1 but 2 bottles I read all the ingredients . When the product comes I found it also has Chromium in it . Well I can not take Chromium it makes my heart race and I just feel weird all day . Lord help me if I take at night because I would not sleep at all . I hate that I was duped on the ingredients as I know they make White Bean Extract with nothing else added.Now I have to search to buy something without the Chromium and I 'm hesitant as I ca n't afford to keep buying things I ca n't take .
 Did not notice any effects after a whole bottle . I ca n't say that I am impressed with it . Somewhat disappointed .
 this didnt go anything for me it was a waste of money & it wouldnt purchase it again . It might work for body builder but not me .
 This was another produce I saw on Dr. Oz for weight loss . Has not worked for me at all . In fact , it causes a lot of embarrasing gas .
 I exercise daily , and I finished the entire bottle . I saw no change in my weight fluctuations . My bodyweight was basically reacting the same as it did before I took these . It seems the mode of action of these pills is to block a type of amylase which breaks down carbohydrates . Well , your body can produce more than one type of enzyme to break them down . Another thing to note here is the fact that all the 5 star reviews are people who have only reviewed THIS item , which makes me question either the integrity of the seller and/or the manufacturer of this product .
 Took it for one who month and nothing . Did n't eat fatty but not complete fat free . Did eat starches . I took it 10 minutes before every meal . Nothing .
 I tried this product last year , with high hopes . Carbs are my downfall . I cut back on calories while taking Carb Intercept and followed the instructions carefully . After finishing an entire package , I lost 1 pound . I am at an age -LRB- 52 -RRB- where losing weight is getting more difficult , but i did expect to lose a few pounds . I did not have any side effects at all while taking this , however , which is why I gave it 2 stars .
 I decided to buy this product because of all the positive reviews , but I wo n't be taking it any longer . Each time I try to eat any carbs after taking this supplement , I spend the next several hours feeling horrifically nauseated , and no medicine nor `` other methods '' could make me feel any better . Even cutting down the amount of carbs eaten after the pills have been taken does n't have an effect on the nausea . Other stomach problems followed.I would n't recommend it . I have a rather tough stomach in general , but it ca n't handle this stuff at all .
 I wish I was someone who could tolerate this , as I 've heard good things about results using Natrol Carb Intercept . However , this gave me the worst case of gas ever . I had that gurgling , uncomfortable internal distress . My tummy felt bad . My guts were in turmoil . And thank God it was during the night -- ALL NIGHT -- or I would n't have had the nerve to step outside my door with that much gas rolling around and erupting.I tried it again , just in case it was n't the Natrol and was something else . Eating different foods -- same result . Gasorama.Bummer .
 The description promised that this contained `` white kidney bean extract , Gelatin , Acacia , Water , Magnesium Stearate , Silica '' . After I started taking this I realized that this is not true.The box now says `` Our new and improved formula also contains Foodbound Chromium , which provides 40 mcg of Chromium to help metabolize fats and proteins for energy . `` I do n't want chromium . If I did , I 'd buy it and take it . I do n't need it slipped into other supplements . Worse , the recommended intake has been lowered to 35 mcg for adult males and to 25 mcg for adult females . One dose of this , or two capsules , provides more chromium than that . The directions state that you should not exceed four capsules per day , which would be a dose of 80 mcg of chromium -- more than three times the recommended amount for women.If you 're considering taking this I recommend you speak to your doctor before starting . My doctor has said no chromium . Your situation may be different . But I 'm stuck with a nearly full bottle of something I ca n't take .
 I followed the directions faithfully and no results . The side effect was terrible gas ! Do n't eat cheese if you 're going to take this product ! Your stomach will act as a rollercoaster after you eat pasta or bread . Such a dissapointment :-LRB- I thought this was going to be my `` miracle pill '' Not recommended .
 I think I actually GAINED weight ! Best bet is the South Beach Diet then you do n't have to worry about carbs at all . These made me feel very bloated .
 This white kidney bean extract formulation includes maltodextrin . Maltodextrin is an easily metabolized carbohydrate that 's often added to foods as a bulking agent or to improve mouthfeel -LRB- dietary term that basically means ` texture ' -RRB- . But it has the same digestible calorie density -LRB- about 4 kcal per gram -RRB- as sucrose -LRB- table sugar -RRB- . What beneficial purpose does the maltodextrin serve ? Since Carb Intercept is capsulized , mouthfeel is no concern . -LRB- The only texture you encounter is the pill casing . -RRB- Similarly , a bulking agent is not needed . My best guess here is that Natrol is using maltodextrin as a filler because it 's cheaper than the primary ingredient.To be clear
 I have taking a carb . blocker in the past and I have seen good results.This product has not done anything for me . I exercise 3-4 times a week and no change in anything . I will stop using it .
 I have taken these and after each meal , I test my blood sugar levels , and there is no change . Does n't work for me .
 Be careful if you are sensitive to caffiene . I used these for 2 days . I did not sleep either night . And I took them before lunch . I bought mine at GNC and returned them today . I also felt very bloated when I used them , as if I had not taken them . This is how I feel when I carb load . My heart was racing and headache was soooo bad!So they did not work for me . I know not all products work the same for everyone . But I would not recommend these to anyone with a caffiene sensitivity .
 Do n't waste your money on this product ! I am a type II diabetic , and I thought that by taking this carb blocker that I would be able to enjoy the occasional slice of bread or higher carb food like fruit . Wrong ! I took the recommended dosage of two pills immediately before eating a baked potato . I took my glucose reading two hours later and it was 196 . My average glucose reading is between 110-115 . The only time it has been that high is when I ` cheated ' and ate a candy bar ! Now I 'm stuck with two bottles of Carb Intercept that I would n't give to my worst enemy .
 Used this with small amount of carbs -LRB- two beers -RRB- Did not work ... two days later still trying to recover , would not recommend if you plan to use with beer
 I do n't know what this product is like because I have not received it yet . I will let you know when I receive it . It has been 1 month since I ordered it !!!
 I am not impressed with the results from taking this . I think there are too many high scoring reviews , which is usually the case on Amazon .
 no change in weight loss , but i take it anyway . heard it can screw up your intestinal tract in the long term . oh well .
 Followed directions , excerised daily , continued eating healthy , had same small amount of carbs as ususal . However , no miracles or even additional weight loss with product . Took for 3 months . Save your money .
 Watch out ! You 'll spend the entire time in the bathroom after taking this product . If it helps you lose weight , it 's because of the diahrea !
 The product discription says it includes the head device , springs , and ratchets . The picture shows the whole device . But they are only selling the mount that goes above the door . They are deliborately false advertizing it so people buy it , but have a few places that say `` door mount only '' just to cover themselves . They should show a second picture of just the door mount , and delete the description and replace it with just `` door mount only for the traction device '' . I hope they will give me a refund . I 'll let you guys know if they refund the shipping , though I doubt it . I 'm probably out at least $ 11 in shipping .
 The quality of the materials and build for these products is very low , if you have n't handled them , you will be surprised by the cheap plastic . The idea is good , clearly there will be more such things in the future . But the two products from this company I have tried -LRB- OhMiBod and Ohmibod club vibe -RRB- are badly made and will fail . I had the club vibe controller burn out the egg in one 10 minute use and then burn out a couple more similarly sized eggs in a couple minutes of use each . Lame .
 Once I put in the batteries it started up , but that was all it did . It did n't work with an ipod or with any of the patterns . Sometimes it does n't even turn on . : -LRB-
 I really liked the different pulses and worked well for me . It is more powerful than others I have used ; by no means quiet . Unfortunately , I never got to use the ipod feature as it stopped working after just a few uses . I took the batteries out after every use like the directions said hoping to preserve batteries and make it last longer .
 Bought thinking you could vibe to your favorite music , but the volume had to be up so high that it was unsettling . Then the vibes came on like gangbusters with the louder passages and virtually nothing with the softer . Retired to the circular file .
 With how high the price is , there is no way it can be worth it . The rythmn feature is great -LRB- some hot dance tunes can get anyone off real fast -RRB- , but really other than that , there is nothing that is that great about it . Rubber or something more fleshlike would have been more comfortable -LRB- and realistic ;-RRB- -RRB- . It had to be made out of this cheapish plastic.Also , I have gotten better stimulation out of cheaper ones , so not even the vibrating is that great . The music feature is great , but I would only get this if you are really set on that one thing .
 The dust cloth might be able to remove dust from computer screens , but I needed it to remove `` dirt and smudges '' as it claims to do . I tried it on a desktop monitor and my laptop with no success on either . I would not recommend this product .
 These glasses have worked fine for me , but the design in rather `` old '' looking . Also , the left side temple piece came off about a month after I got them . I found the screw and fixed them but the hinge is poorly designed .
 It 's hard to find 350x reading glasses in most stores so I found these online and ordered several pair . Sorry , they do n't last very long because the earpiece breaks . I used to buy three pair for $ 20 at Sam 's and they lasted forever ; however , they do n't come higher than 300x . I 'll keep looking for glasses they last longer .
 Folks , if you do n't glean anything else from this review , know this
 First off , I really did enjoy these vitamins the first run through , which I why I ordered a second bottle ... that will probably be my last . Initially , I noticed a bump in my energy that did n't leave me requiring coffee every morning to get going to class and be able to focus without falling asleep . The pills are one of the few that I am able to swallow w/o feeling nauseous five minutes later , despite their size . Yes , they do smell ... like a multivitamin :P . If you 're used to taking the generic store vitamins like centrum or one-a-days , these do have more of a smell to them , but so do the majority of other mv 's that you 'll order from nutrition shops.Now , for the bad news . Out of curiosity from the previous gent 's review , I have been paying close attention to my TSH levels as I am already on Synthroid due to hypothyroidism . My last two visits gave a stable level for my TSH level and my medication did not have to change at all - things were looking great . I just had bloodwork done last week to monitor my levels and keep them in check some more , and my medication was increased by approximately 15 % . I will continue to take them until I run out , since I do monitor my thyroid hormone levels , but will be switching to a different brand once this bottle dries up to see if my medication can be reduced at all in the future . Bummer ! I was really liking these ! If my levels do not revert to previous values upon switching mv 's , I will gladly return to state that ... to be continued : -RRB-
 This would be a good men 's multivitamin if it did not contain `` fad '' ingredients which in some cases do nothing and in others have actually been shown to have harmful effects . Alpha Lipoic Acid , for example , can actually be harmful . Recent scientific papers have shown that it suppresses proper thyroid function , and the `` S '' isomer -LRB- which is not found in nature but is approximately 50 % of the ALA in this product -RRB- is toxic to rodents . My blood tests showed elevated levels of TSH - Thyroid Stimulating Hormone - after I started taking this preparation , indicating that it was disrupting production of the active form of the thyroid hormone thyroxin.I 'd much prefer to see a `` no nonsense '' men 's multi rather than one that follows every supplement fad , as this one does . NOW should act responsibly and remove ingredients which have been shown at best to do nothing or at worst do harm.One other thing I discovered which may factor into your decision to use this product
 I pulled the following right from `` NOW '' website.We currently offer our customers vitamin D3 -LRB- natural cholecalciferol -RRB- in 400 IU and 1000 IU potencies . We plan to release a 2000 IU vitamin D3 soft gel capsule , which will match the current UL . We 've chosen vitamin D3 as natural cholecalciferol -LRB- derived from sheep 's wool lanolin -RRB- for our Vitamin D soft gels , rather than the less effective vitamin D2 synthetic form -LRB- ergocalciferol -RRB- .
 I bought these softgels as a supplement , and was specifically excited about the ZMA in it because I wanted to improve my muscle recovery time . After 2 weeks of taking 2 a day , I noticed no difference in how i felt or in my soreness . However , whenever I took it , a few hours later I would have a bad taste in my mouth . I stopped taking them because there was no point . I 'm giving them 2 stars because they are what they claim to be and delivery of them was prompt , but they did n't do anything noticeable for me .
 I started losing my hair because of this product . Avoid vitamins with stinging nettle root .
 You must have to be a sasquatch for this thing to be fully effective . I mean , it worked for me ... as in it pulled some hairs out . I do n't claim to have a contingent of hair growing from my nose but I thought this would trim the few hairs I have better than the rusty scissors I found at the bus stop , instead it 's pulling some hairs out and cutting some . Maybe I need to let them grow out , but as a maintenance tool it 's not working that great for me . It 's construction is good and it seems like a quality product , but I may switch back to those scissors .
 Badly made , and not so effective , maybe better than electric , but not so great . Plastic and not metal .
 I received the product as implied , but it did not perform as advertised . After a few days use the item would not open up without pulling the ends apart and I sent it back after the first week . Plastic parts should be stainless steel , but that is why people say you get what you pay for ...
 I would like to say this thing is DANGEROUS . I used one on my nose and the spring broke sending part of it LIKE A NAIL GUN into my nose ! Blood streamed out like I 've never seen before . I was ready to call 911 but I eventually got the bleeding to stop . I just want to warn people DO NOT use this thing near your eyes , ears or nose . I was lucky that I did n't lose hearing &#65279; or eyesight -LRB- can only imagine someone using it on eyebrows or ear hair . The spike -LRB- broken spring -RRB- did sink a good 1/4 '' to 1/2 '' into my skin . It was a very scary experience from such an innocent looking device . It needs a redesign just to prevent the spring from shooting out if it breaks . Not worth the risk !!!
 Even though I did not pay a huge price for this trimmer I was disappointed.I believe you must have a thick jungle in your nose to make this product worthwhile.It did not work at all for me .
 I expected more - it works but it is just ok
 I can not for the life of me understand anyone who says this does a competent job . Mine broke after 3 uses . The `` squeeze '' mechanism basically turns the rotary clipping blades a few revolutions on the squeeze ... and another few on the release . It totally blows . You need the RPMs of one of the plastic cheap-o models despite the latter requiring replacement every year or two . Avoid this one . Trust me .
 This device does not cut most hairs . In most cases it pulls them out very painfully . Impossible to get a close trim . Takes forever and with most strokes it cuts no hairs . I have the product and do n't use it anymore . -- Victor
 Groom Mate TrimIT Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer + Lifetime WarrantyIt 's not possible to get a close trim and it 's `` catch as catch '' can with nasal hairs . I often feel nothing is happening . Nevertheless , it 's better than nothing .
 your photo , and description is that of the saunders hometrac ... your listing is that of an extension foot ... perhaps you could provide a photo of the extension foot , and even a description of the extension foot ... otherwise it appears as if you 're selling a $ 400 unit for $ 8 ... miked
 sometime ago I had the chance to try the Rhodiola 110 by nutrilite . It was the first time I tried it . I was amazed with the results . I could see the results a few minutes after taking only one pill . Because of that I came here to buy a bottle of rhodiola . The nutrilite 110 is only 30pills and 110mg but $ 22.00 . After researching I found this which is 250mg of Rhodiola and 60 pills for only $ 8.00 . Thinking I could save money and have better results because of the amount , I was completely wrong . I take 2 pills -LRB- 500mg -RRB- and I ca n't feel any difference ; not even 0.0001 % . I do n't recommend this brand to anyone . Unfortunately I will have to buy the expensive Nutrilite but at least I know that works .
 I 'm a Rhodiola user for many years , and I respect this brand . I believe that this company is related to Schwabe in Germany , which has a good reputation for their St. Johns Wort , so I thought this one would be a winner . It was a turn-off from the moment I opened the bottle , however , as it smelled funny and tasted funny too . Not the kind of `` dirt '' flavor that Rhodiola and other herbs have , but a distinctive chemical odor . Perhaps something in the processing , or the result of a poor quality extract . I could n't get much of a boost out of it , certainly not as much as a 150-mg -LRB- and higher priced -RRB- Rhodiola that I generally use . Judging by the good reviews , there are people using this that have n't tried other Rhodiolas . It 's kind of like pizza . I have never had a truly BAD pizza -- they 're all filling . But once you try a great pizza , or Rhodiola , you wonder why they bothered with the cheap version . Were they trying to hit a price point , perhaps using Chinese roots ?
 There 's NOTHING in the TITLE , the `` label '' for product info is purposely -LRB- IMHO -RRB- too small to easily see the details.STAY AWAY FROM THIS VENDOR . GO WITH A DIFFERENT VENDOR WHO MORE OPENLY DISCLOSES ALL INFO , FROM THE TITLE on down to THE LABEL .
 This product did n't real do anything for me , guess you never know , glad I did n't overpay for this . Maybe your experience will be different .
 The original Arm & Hammer was great -- worked terrifically well , was a little flaky but not too bad , effective odor absorption without stinky perfumes.This new Arm & Hammer product is nasty . Sticky and disgusting . Worse than roll-on deodorant ! I was a huge fan of the old stuff , but it is no longer available . I recommend looking elsewhere . I have switched to B * n 's roll-on product . It is less flaky ; does n't work quite as well , but it is less sticky & nasty .
 This item depicts three brushes and the description did n't specify that . I was surprised to receive only one . When I sent a polite note to HBA Zone to point out that they might want to revise the image or the description , they never replied . When I left poor feedback as a result of not hearing , they sent me a message stating `` We noticed the feedback that you left on our website . We are sorry that you are unhappy with your transaction . . We would have liked to be notified of the issue so that we can help you with the problem or at least issue a refund . To make up for the trouble , we are offering to issue a $ 5.00 refund if you remove the feedback . `` Pretty good , HBA Zone . You ignored my `` notifying you of the issue '' , then , when I left you poor feedback , you tried to buy my removal of the feedback without ever addressing the original issue . Nice way to do business ...
 The few times we used this product , it seemed to do the job . However , since it was still early June , before the heaviest mosquito season , it is hard to tell if it kept bugs away or there were simply not many -LRB- or any -RRB- to begin with . We had two problems with the product
 This is an actual letter written to the ThermaCELL company . `` I recieved a ThermaCELL MOSQUITO LANTERN as a gift this past Christmas . Please do not see this as a complaint but rather as consumer feedback . We reside in Savannah GA , therefore it is not unusual to have mosquitos in February and March . Our first time using it , it was hard to tell how effective it was . There really were n't enough mosquitos to know its effectiveness . Unfortunately , the lamp was left on overnight and by the next day we had an empty cartridge . Bummer . A month or so went by before I could remember to pick up a refill at Wal-Mart . I purchased a kit containing a cartridge and some new pads . At more than $ 6.00 I was a bit dismayed , but I figured we 'd be more careful.And so we tried the lantern once more . Sometime during the night , someone had lifted and moved the lantern without relighting it . Out of sight , out of mind . The next day I went to relight it and it would n't work . What 's going on ? It 's a brand new cartidge and we barely used it ! Then I noticed the ON/OFF switch on the side and it ocurred to me that no one ever turned it off after it had been lifted from the table the night before . I have to wonder , does the cartridge continue to drain even after the safety switch extiguishes the flame ? If so , I would percieve this to be bad design . Sure it may be good for the ThermaCELL company because people will buy more cartidges , but in my case I see it as a tricky way to get over on the consumer.On the other hand , if the cartidge is designed to stop flowing once the safety switch is activated , then my argument does not stand . From there I would have to assume that the device is defective since a cartridge should be expected to run 9 to 12 hours . We got maybe 2 hours from it.So what is the deal ? What did we do wrong ? What does that ON/OFF switch really do ? WIll the cartridge continue to drain if the lantern is placed in the OFF position?Conclusion - although the product itself may indeed be effective against mosquitos , the design is such that it requires substantial post-purchase expenses in the form of refill cartidges and mats . At $ 6.00 a refill I do not see myself buying into it for very long , especially when it is so easy to empty an entire cartridge by mistake . I would look forward to an improved model that makes more efficient use of the expensive refills . ''
 This item did not even last a year before it would not light for any reason . New butane , no spark . Could not get it to light at all . No way to bypass the lighter and use a match or any other means of lighting . Now I have the refills and no light and do n't plan to buy another of this brand .
 I was excited to get this for my 3 yr old granddaughter . Unfortunately , the earpiece wo n't stay on . For some reason , they are at a weird angle and are uncomfortable -- aside from flipping off . She wo n't use it .
 My daughter -LRB- age 6 -RRB- loves to play with this when she pretends to be a vet . It works great -LRB- the dog even learned to tolerate her listening to his heartbeat -RRB- . However , the plastic circle that covers the head of the stehoscope likes to come off and it takes me about 20 minutes to put it back on -LRB- as it has to slip very precisely into a very small slot -RRB- . Without the plastic piece it does n't work .
 We just got this Stethoscope for our 2 1/2 year old because she had been asking for one . This is a nice Stethoscope , but it really hurts when you put it in your ears ! I had read the reviews but figured that maybe the other reviewers were exaggerating . They were n't . I can only put it in my ears for a few seconds and my daughter has not been able to put it in her ears yet . I am going to keep looking for a Stethoscope that does not hurt so much .
 The stethoscope is very tight fitting for my 4 1/2 yr old grandsons and they can not hear the actual heartbeat - as advertised . Disappointed in this product and it 's advertising .
 Are all stethoscopes like this?The ear tips are too tight and does n't fit well no mattter how I adjusted it . Those hurt the ears!Volume of the heartbeat was fine if the chest piece is placed right but if the chest piece bumps against anything else , it 'd get really loud ! Was purchased for my 2 yr old but I guess with the uncomfortable fit and loudness , I wo n't be letting her play with this at all.Will check out something else .
 I ordered this for my daughter and her cousins to play with because they love playing doctor and veterinarian and learning about the body and how it works . Before I put this under the Christmas tree , I took it out of the package and tried it out . It works , alright , but the sound when you first touch skin is WAY TOO LOUD even for my ears . Unless you very gently and slowly put this against your skin , the sound in your ears is very loud . As other reviewers mentioned , the ear pieces are also tight . My ears were left ringing for several minutes after I took the ear pieces out . Once I touched skin , the sound of the heartbeat was really clear ... but there 's no way children will be gentle enough to barely touch it to the skin . I 'm not usually one to keep a toy from a child because it is n't `` safe enough '' by picky standards , but I do n't even want this in my ears :-LRB- and I do n't mind louder sounds . This did not go under the tree , but rather went under my bed . Maybe I 'll pull it out to use with them one day with very close supervision . I 'm disappointed .
 Afther searching everywhere for Arm & Hammer 36 hour w/baking soda , it was recommeded to me to go to Amazon . Wow , I was ecstatic when I found the product for my husband because he swears by it . The picture of the product shown states 36 hours on the label and shows w/baking soda . It was n't until the next day when I looked at my confirmation and discovered the product description stated only 24 hours protection and no baking soda . I can buy that at my local store w/o shipping if I wanted that .
 I purchased this product because it was advertised as being compatible with the Ascencia Breeze 2 Glucose Meter . The product -LRB- Asencia Autodisc Control NORMAL ; lot 1613 -RRB- that was shipped to me had less than six months left before the indicated expiration date -LRB- 2009-09 -RRB- on the label . When I used it as per the instructions on the Ascencia Breeze 2 , it gave test strip calibration readings that where 90 % above the expected range for a test solution classified for the normal glucose range . Either the product that I received was not the one advertised or it was from a bad lot or had degraded during warehousing and/or shipment .
 This item was sold at a great price but I did not receive it until 12 days after it was promised .
 Her Pleasure ? Well if you could feel anything , than maybe . Trojan has made another thick feeling condom , therefore not helping anyone but their own pockets . Buy Durex or Lifestyles instead . Its not worth the money to buy anything Trojan .
 I will not order this product again . Read the label and read the ingredients . It clearly states you will receive arm & hammer that has sodium bicarbonate -LRB- baking soda -RRB- in it and lasts for 36 hours . THATS WHAT IT SAYS ... GUESS WHAT YOU GET ? Some old stuff ... regular arm & hammer that lasts 24 hours and has NO BAKING SODA !! How deceptive can you be . I 'm sending it back for a full refund and I think it should be taken off the Amazon web site . Why hassle with ordering a product you clearly are not going to receive !
 but I believe I have a strange reaction of dizziness when I take it , so I was not able to give it a fair evaluation since I stopped using this product .
 These are so nasty they fill the air with that nasty rubber smell but on the up side they work so ya but there still nasty
 I 've been seeking a soft solid unscented deodorant and ca n't seem to find them any longer in the stores . For some reason , it appears these types of deodorants have been discontinued in all brands . Does anyone know why ? And I would BUY this one , but for the sad and obvious fact that this seller is taking advantage of the dirth of these products still available . I mean , really . Almost twenty bucks for one deodorant ? Can we spell R.I.P.O.F.F ? Thank you , no . I 'd rather go on stinking , just like this seller 's conscience .
 This tubing was too bulky and cheaply made to hold up and use comfortably . Would return , but not worth the trouble .
 -LRB- 3 -RRB- pieces , each -LRB- 3 -RRB- ft. long were rolled up in a box . When opened all were distorted and crushed because of the packaging . In tim the product will regain about 90 % of it 's memory and will return to it 's original shape , but it 's a very slow process . What 's worse product falls off my toe . I use these to relieve the pressure while running against one of my small toes . The foam tube falls off and ends up under my other toes in the sock , making my outdoor run very uncomfortable . I use to buy a similar product through my foot doctor 's office , and paid a higher price . I went back to my doctor 's office ... this is an example of &#34; you get what you pay for &#34; .
 The label on the bottle reads `` potassium Plus Iodide '' , which means this is potassium with a small amount of iodide . The seller has written in the product description that this `` Potassium Iodide Plus '' , suggesting that the word `` Plus at the end makes it better or something of that nature . This can be very misleading . In the case that you dobuy real potassium iodide , here is what you should know.Potassium Iodide is Not a supplement/substitute for Sodium Chloride -LRB- table salt -RRB- . Potassium Iodide should only be taken when instructed to do so by official health warnings -LRB- in case of radiation exposure -RRB- . Medically it is only used as a supplement if you are Iodide deficient not `` potassium '' deficient . If you want extra potassium in your diet or something to add to your shake , try eating a banana . Bananas contain very high levels of potassium . Here is a link to vitamin shoppe for Potassium Iodide :[ ... -RSB- On the Vitamin Shoppe page for real potassium Iodide you will see the warnings / instuctions for taking Potassium Iodide .
 the dose of potassium iodide in these things is only 225 micrograms , so to adequately shield your thyroid you would nedd to take a few thousand ... a day
 gained weight when taking this , not what I was hoping for , I took it for 3 weeks but never did drop the weight until I stopped taking it , could just be me though , I have a tendency to be opposite most people on a lot of things .
 Based on my experience , I 've come to believe the CLA marketing has been masterful but the results have been lacking . Omega 3 's EPA DHA are the way to go . Have an AWESOME day : -RRB-
 I see absolutley no impact in health or weight loss from this product . There is some research to suggest it may help but I do n't think it 's worth the money
 I did not receive the item yet , I 'm still waiting no word on it . Thanks .
 Only used this for a short period , never saw any real affect its practically a placebo . Get a pre workout powder shake it will be better , do n't get pills they do n't work as fast as a solution .
 It may as well be filled with chalk . I have been taking these faithfully as directed and have received absolutely nothing in benefits .
 I was just looking for some massage oil ... if you do not mind strong smelling flowers this oil is pretty good . I had to purchase unscented oil to mix with it ... it is just to strong scented
 On the packaging it says
 This product description has XT written all over it , but when I received it , it was definitely NOT XT . The packing slip also said that it was XT inside . I called the place from which I received it , and they said they do n't even carry XT . Beware , this is the Ultra product , not Ultra XT .
 I tried a bottle after trying Tribulus X , which I can not find on Amazon . Anyhoo , this stuff is worthless , no effect . The X is the stuff to get if you can find it .
 The only thing this did for me was possibly increase my blood pressure . I noticed my ears getting hot and that 's about it . Nothing happenned to show a possible increase in testosterone levels .
 Beware ! No matter what size you choose you will receive women 's 6-7 then all of the paperwork will reflect this size . I ordered men 's size 10 and I received women 's 6-7 , thinking that I had made a mistake in the ordering I reordered size 10 but at the end of the ordering process it stated women 's 6-7 , so unless you 're vigilant and cancel the order you will receive this size . As far as the product , I bought my first pair from my podiatrist and they are absolutely great .
 Item says in stock and will ship in two days ! Then after two days you get an email that says `` Sorry for the inconveinence but your item is out of stock and will be 10 days later '' -LRB- or MORE ! -RRB- I wish AMAZON would just go back to doing it themselves instead of letting any dork with a website sell stuff . This is BS ! This is probably the last time I will do business with AMAZON or ANY of it 's so called merchants .
 I have been using this brand for about two months , but I was using the one with the new and improved formula . I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate . I was wrong this one does n't dissolve as well and it does n't taste like chocolate , it 's more of a bitter taste . Also it does n't keep me full 4-5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it 's $ 20 at Sams Club !!! The new and improved formula is the way to go !!!!
 the cover falls down with the potty inside . there is another brand that has magnets that stick the potty to the cover - makes much more sense . This is very plastic and the front edge of the child sized seat was very sharp . i returned it so my kids didnt get cut on their bottom .
 The elongated version is still an inch too short for our standard elongated toilet . The bolts do not fasten down tight so the whole thing is wobbly . The three piece seats do not stay in the upright position for my husband to use the toilet . The toddler seat is the only thing we like . If you can put it on a toilet specific for that use and you do n't care about the look of it being too short , it would be fine for that .
 I just recieved this and was very excited about the idea that my daughter could comfortably sit on the potty without looking like she 's going to fall in and without having some wobbly insert that can be removed -LRB- which , no matter how much I discourage , I continue to find her putting on her head like a hat ... ick -RRB- . I received the toilet seat and was a little bit leery when I noticed the thin plastic , where the bottom and top of the plastic meets , it was not smooth . Instead , right where someone sits and the skin somewhat -LRB- and just barely -RRB- has applied pressure and molds around the form of the seat , the plastic has an edge and somewhat jabs into your skin - it was n't smoothed at all . But I installed it anyway , because this will enable confidence in my 3 yr old when she goes to the bathoom . Maybe her seat is n't like the adult portion ? Its in the spare bathroom , so it 'll almost only be used by her.She was excited at first when she saw it and immediately wanted to use it , but by the second time , she started to complain that it hurt her butt . She now wo n't use it and prefers to use my bathroom , which defeats the purpose entirely.Its a great concept , unfortunately , poor execution .
 I like the taste , and in the few months I took it I think I can say it worked great . I do n't know how I missed it , but it contains Sucralose ; so I switched -LRB- once more -RRB- out to other Protein Powders -- ones that do n't contain artificial sweetners ... -LRB- Whey Protein Isolate from BlueBonnet , Optimum Nutrition 100 % Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey , and Body Choice RTD 's -RRB- .
 the seller said it was new but already had enough use of diagnostic equipment for that reason does not work for all . It is therefore advisable to settle themselves before buying though they say that is new
 It did nothing for me . Absolutely nothing , tried it for around 4 weeks , no side effects though.I gave it to my mum , she did n't report any interesting effects so far.I 'm giving it two stars because I did some research on it before buying and I do believe it might work for some people , and personal experience does n't really count with medical treatments , but that 's why you have lots of reviewers for !
 After a couple of days use -LRB- one pill/day -RRB- this stuff seamed to make me disoriented . This product may be useful for others , though not for me . Two days after I discontinue use , the disorientation was gone .
 Unfortunatly minty and as my son has a great aversion to mint not a good choice as does not say mint flavoured on the description
 I think this product works okay , but the taste is not good . Most melatonin products taste decent , but this one tastes pretty bad . Also , for those of you looking for Melatonin only , this product does contain B6 . Even though it 's more expensive , I like Source Naturals orange melatonin tablets better . They have a great taste and no B6 .
 I 'd been using Vitamin Shoppe melatonin lozenges , but I tried this out because it 's cheaper . The taste was just really , really bad . I ca n't attest to how well it works , honestly , because I could n't bear to let it dissolve . Given the otherwise good reviews that this seems to have I suppose that others do n't have such an adverse taste reaction to it , but personally I ca n't tolerate it . Source Naturals makes the best tasting one I 've found , but it 's also the most expensive of the three I 've mentioned .
 This has 150 % of the RDA for Vitamin B-6 . I was looking for a product that only contained Melatonin . I see now that B-6 is listed as an ingredient in the list , but I overlooked it . A picture of the `` Supplement Facts '' should be with this listing so people do not miss this important information.I have no other reviews being that I 'm not sure a child can even have this much B-6 .
 I regret ordering this product . I think that NOW products are inferior as they are loaded with inferior binding agents and such . This particluar procuct has a synthetic sweetener , which really disappointed me . I will not be taking this product !
 The materials in this kit could be picked up at a local pharmacy for a fraction of the cost and the bag itself seems to be of the quality of a cheap lunch bag .
 I received this product and was very disappointed with the quality of the blades . I even tried all of them and have been putting up with them for a while now , almost to the point where I forgot what using a sharp blade was like . This is a classic example of ` you get what you pay for '
 The title of the product indicate 8 count which is exactly what I received but according to the features it should be 16 : Product FeaturesGillette M3 Power refill cartridgesBrand New 16 refill cartridges2 boxes 8 blades in each pack
 My husband bought these to save money . They were totally worthless and a big WASTE of money instead . They were dull and would n't cut at all .
 I was extremely upset when I received this package from Amazon . I specifically chose this vendor and this listing because it stated Mach Three Power and not Blades . However when I opened the package it was two packages of blades and no actual razor . I feel completely ripped off and will never purchase any type of bath product through this site again . I would rate this seller a 0/10 if given the opportunity .
 I believed that I had found a great bargain in these blades until they began to literally fall apart after one or a few shaves . I tried to put them back together at first but I 've chalked this one up to `` if it seems to good to be true , it is '' . Do n't do it !!
 This is a wonderful price , but the product is not very effective . Cod Liver Oil is a great source of Vitamins A and D which promote strong , healthy teeth . With other brands my teeth felt hard and strong , this brand was not effective , and I felt my teeth actually becoming softer and weaker.I use Green Pasture 's fermented Cod Liver Oil now and highly recommend it over cheaper varieties .
 I was excited to purchase this product being that I didnt want to carry the bigger tubes and bottles to weigh down my diaper bag . To my surprise , I was sold expired items from 2008 . Shame on the seller , these are little people , new in the world . They should n't have to deal with this , thank goodness they have people to protect them .
 Not well made , The metal head broke from glass body . I have not dropped it . It worked well for three months but then I went to shave and the metal head fell off . It can not be re-attached . I would not recommend anyone buy this product .
 Web vitamins is great to do business with . They have super speedy shipping and great customer service.Having said that , I thought the rootbeer flavored stevia was awful.Loved the grape , orange , vanilla and lemon , but not this one or the chocolate .
 was not good with taste , had to use a lot to get the taste . if you want the rootbeer taste not worth the money
 I was really excited to find this product but was disappointed in the results . I used it to sweeten some carbonated soda and the first sip was great . Every sip after that had less and less root beer flavor and more and more of the artificial sweetener/alcohol taste . So now I 'm looking for another root beer extract to try !
 These Sweetleaf `` flavored '' products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor -LRB- you probably wo n't even be able to tell which one it is -RRB- . If you 're looking for a product that 's about half sweetness and half flavor , THIS IS N'T IT . I urge you to save your money and look for another solution .
 YUCK ! I 've not had Stevia w/an an aftertaste before trying several of the `` Sweet Leaf '' brands ... tasted more like Sweet-n-Low to me than Stevia .
 Would love to tell you what it actually tasted like but , got chocolate flavor instead of the Root Beer I ordered !
 I 've tried many of the Sweetleaf Stevia liquid flavors and have throughly enjoyed all of them , but the root beer one is one I will never buy again.I love root beer , even diet root beer and this liquid is very weak compared to the other liquids . The other products I can put a half of a dropper into 64 ounces of water and have a perfect taste . The root beer takes two or three times this amount to get any taste in the liquid and it is not a true taste.The english toffe , vanilla creme , chocolate raspberry dark chocolate and cinnamon are all great tasting .
 Ok , I was very excited when I thought I could enjoy the flavor of root beer without calories or worrying about the effects of aspartame ... well I was pretty disappointed in this.It does have a slight root beer flavor , but I wouls highly recommend using a whole dropper -LRB- or more -RRB- to a glass instead of the 6-8 drops suggested.Also I would suggest to the manufacturer to not only enhance the flavor but to also add some natural color to make it APPEAR to LOOK like real root beer.I think this was a great idea but needs to be tweaked more.Also use seltzer water instead of plain water otherwise it will be like drinking flat weak root beer .
 I had high hopes for this - I added it to seltzer water and it tastes every so slightly like root beer ... more like diet root beer . I was hoping to use this as a soda replacement to try to be a bit healthier - but I doubt we 'll even finish this bottle .
 Not well made , The metal head broke from glass body . I have not dropped it . It worked well for three months but then I went to shave and the metal head fell off . It can not be re-attached . I would not recommend anyone buy this product .
 I suspect -- suspect , mind you -- that the batch of this product I received contains a sulfate , specifically , sodium lauryl sulfate , a common egg white powder additive.I 'm very sensitive to sulfates and sulfites . Even in small amounts they trigger in me hot flashes followed by pounding headaches . As a result I avoid them scrupulously . I go to a lot of effort -LRB- and sometimes expense -RRB- to buy only pure egg white powder with no additives . Deb-El is a pure egg white powder , but in larger quantities it can be expensive . I decided to try this brand to save a little money.When I make protein shakes I always add a pinch of salt for flavor . The first thing I noticed when I made a shake from this powder was it tasted a little more salty than usual -- indicating to me some extra sodium was in there . I was n't really thinking about it so I did n't pay that much mind.Later in the day I had hot flashes ; later that night a pounding headache . I reviewed what I had eaten and the only thing different was I was trying this brand of egg white powder.Sodium lauryl sulfate is a foaming and whipping agent . Egg white powder containing it is often sold as `` meringue powder , '' and it 's intended for use in making desserts and other meringue products.Pure egg white powder -LRB- mixed with a little water of course -RRB- is difficult to whip . I tried whipping Deb El once and it took a lot of time and a lot of extra powder to get even passable results . I decided to run a little test with this powder and see how it did.I mixed two tablespoons of this powder with a few tablespoons of water and started whipping . Within seconds I had a bowlful of foam ; in less than a minute , with no addition of sugar or anything else , I had the lovely whipped meringue you see in the picture I posted.So I had three clues there may be sodium lauryl sulfate in the batch of this product I received
 this product tasted very bad in my opinion . it did n't matter what you mixed it with or how you mixed it , it still tasted bad . Egg whites as you know foam up a lot when shaken or stired , so it was really hard to try to use this as a protein shake . The reconstitued egg whites from the powder tasted like leather or rubber .
 I purchase many items from Amazon with great satisfaction . I have purchased three `` button '' hooks in the past few years . I wish I had saved my money -LRB- and time -RRB- on this one . The item is flims at best . The wire used is light weight , bends and twists to easily . The button hook part is also it is not a complete loop . The base end is open , which gets caught on the button hole.It does have one redeaming quality in my opinion . The zipper puller is a heavier wire , is open sufficiently for most zipper tabs.My search continues .
 I bought this because so many said it was so good . Well , in my case it is pretty `` iffy . ' I have neuropathy and can not feel the buttons and holes with one hand and need my sensitive hand to pull the hook part , so feeding the thing thru the button hole has proved daunting . And while this DOES have a zipper pull and does fit in my pocket , if I could feel the darn zipper tab I could pull it.Fishing for it with the hook is n't very effective . I guess if you can feel with your finger tips , but not actually button a shirt , it would be OK , but shipping costs twice what the item did , So that was strike one !
 Appears to be very flimsy . Not worth the money , 50 cents would be a better price . Look for a better made product . If I could I 'd give it zero stars .
 I purchased this for my son who has no left hand . The button hook was cheap and pulls out of the handle . The zipper hook seems fine . I should have spent a few more dollars for a more durable button pull .
 When I spent so much money on this item , I had hopes for an item worth its value . I was not at impressed . One

 I like this ankle brace , but it runs small and they wo n't let you return it . Therefore , I do n't use it as much as I would like , because it is too tight . Since you do n't want a brace to be too loose , either be really sure you have the right size , or buy it from a store where you can try it on or return it , or try something else . I used the measurements they gave , and it was still too tight .
 I use large pipe cleaners to clean my straws . I make smoothies all the time andto clean the straws I went to a craft store and purchased a package of the longwhite pipe cleaners . They call them chenille wands or something like that . Whenone gets too worn , I just take a new one out of the package . Its alot cheaper .
 I just received this straw washing brush in the mail , and I 'm a bit disappointed . I should have listened to the other review that complained about the stiff bristles because they really are too stiff to clean plastic straws without severely scratching them . I was planning on using this brush for my reusable Starbucks straws , but I 'm worried that this thing will destroy them . However , I think I might find other uses for this brush , such as cleaning the nooks and crannies in my cats ' drinking fountain , which is made of a much harder plastic than Starbucks straws . Overall , great idea and perfect size and length , but the bristles are just too scratchy for softer plastics . Still looking for a similar product ...
 The bristles on this brush are so stiff that they scratched the inside of my straw . This basically just creates new places for bacteria and debris to hide . Kind of defeats the purpose!The straw I used it on is a hard plastic ... maybe polycarbonate or acrylic . It seems like wetting down the bristles and twisting the brush as you pull it through the straw may help reduce the scratching .
 $ 5.99 postage for a $ 1 item ???? If I had known , I would not have ordered this . Does a fair job of cleaning .
 This brush is much too stiff and abrasive for use with reusable plastic drinking straws . The bristles are abrasive enough to cut into the plastic leaving indentations for bacteria and molds to establish and grow . My guess is that the need for a brush was recognized and someone in marketing or product development sourced a good deal on an industrial grade -LRB- inappropriate -RRB- brush . Please let me know -LRB- through comments -RRB- if you find a better brush . I have n't found one yet on Amazon -LRB- or elsewhere for that matter -RRB- . Thanks .
 As a big fan of the Spenco Walker/runner and crosstrainer insoles , I bought these for a new pair of Mizuno 's that I got . Unfortunately , these red ones are a big downgrade from the previously green ones . It would appear they 've increased the padding by like 50 % across the insoles , particularly in the forefoot area . As a result , they do n't fit comfortably in any pair of shoes I have as the old ones do . The top part of my foot always feels jammed up against the nose of the shoe . I could begin ordering a shoe size larger to accommodate them , but then I 'd have issues sliding around -LRB- particularly running downhill -RRB- , which is quite a bit worse.All in all , a disappointing upgrade from Spenco . Bring back the old green ones ! Luckily , I noticed the crosstrainer one has n't changed and still fits well . It 's not quite as comfy as the old runner/walker one though , but it 'll have to do since these new red ones are terrible .
 Provides good cushioning , but ... on both orders I received , the left arch is higher than the right arch . Poor quality control .
 These interupted and delayed my walking schedule following hip replacement . I much prefer Spenco 's &#34; Cross Trainers &#34; for superior heel cushion .
 I have used these insoles before and love them ! When I received these , they looked to be alright , but there was definitely a very awful smell to them , like mold . I have a very sensitive nose and needed to put these back in the box right away because of the awful smell . Were they such a great price because of some smell defect?I ordered the same kind for my husband , and interestingly enough , these were normal ... no smell . I also paid a lot more . ?
 I purchased a pair of Spenco Polysorb insoles at a Foot Locker about a year ago and they were great . I thought it was the `` Walker / Runner '' model but obviously it was n't because what I received from Amazon was a pair of insoles with good cushioning by the heal but paper-thin material by the toes . Very uncomfortable compared to the the sneakers ' original insoles . Unwearable .
 Bought it for our small Holland Lop rabbits , who are small . But , this box is only appropriate for a very , very small rabbit .
 The item arrived late , but it arrived . I did have to write Ozbo -LRB- the company -RRB- to remind them to ship it , and upon replying they had not shipped it . They promised that it would arrive on time , but it did n't . I suppose you should hope that your item is n't anything valuable that might break , since they do n't package items well . Other than that , the product was fine and as advertised . I am giving it two stars for the service , not for the product .
 I 've liked other PowerBar high protein bars and used them when I 've no time or opportunity for breakfast or lunch . However , I would n't recommend the reduced sugar variety . Rather than being less sweet , as I expected , they have a pronounced and cloying artificial sweetener taste .

 I have used any number of diaper inserts in my life -LRB- I use mostly Bum Genius and Fuzzin Bunz diapers -RRB- . I use them not only to collect the poo , but also so that I can use serious diaper creams like Desitin on my daughter 's diaper-rash-prone bumbum . I bought these instead of my regular brand because they were -LRB- slightly -RRB- cheaper . What a disappointment ! Yes , they will probably be just as effective at keeping poo and medicine off of the diapers , but they are so rough and rigid that I truly worried that putting them against my daughter 's skin might rub her diaper-rash raw again . Yuck ! I tried them a couple of times , and she actually did n't seem to mind -LRB- I will admit -RRB- , but I just did n't feel good about using them . There are much softer , nicer brands out there for nearly the same price . Do n't settle for these .
 these liners are waaaaay too rough in comparison to others on the market . i wo n't even use them . buy a different brand !
 Kuddos to everyone who had a good time using these liners ! Maybe I 'm just the one out of every few who has a bad time . I was spoiled by the Bambino Liners , however my partner and I decided to start trying other liners , to see if we could get a few more for the price . While Bambino only holds about 160 to a roll , 200 for the a little less was worth trying ... so I thought . I 'm so disgusted with these liners right now . I eagerly opened the package -LRB- I do n't know why , ever since we started cloth diapering I was ecstatic about all of it -RRB- and my first impression was disappointment . They felt like paper compared to the Bambino , which had more of a fabric softener sheet feel to it . These were n't as `` fluffy '' I think would be the best word . Just in case I had lost my mind , I presented them to my partner . `` They feel like paper , '' came the uninhibited response.Still I was willing to give them a shot . After all , I am a new mom and maybe I was being too picky . As long as they get the job done , right ? Wrong . These things did not get the job done . The first time I had a blowout EVER with cloth diapers the poop came oozing out of the backside of the diaper . Horrified I ran straightaway to change my son . I thought it was my fault . I had been carrying on a conversation with a friend at the time , allowing my son to play with his cousin and thought that I had somehow allowed the diaper to become too full . He had peed a great deal , so I thought perhaps I had fouled up . I had been a bad mom and not changed him in time and the poop was simply unable to be absorbed . : -LRB- Then , I began to notice an increasing amount of work attached to each diaper change . It seemed like EVERY time my son pooped I was scraping poop off the back end of the diaper . -LRB- And what 's the point of a liner if you are still scraping poop off the diaper ? -RRB- It turns out the sheets were not `` catching '' the poop . Instead the feces was sliding across it , like paper , and being forced out of the back of the diaper ! I thought I was losing my mind until I had yet another fatal blowout . That 's enough . . I 'm sick of these things . Thankfully I have another set to try which seem closer to the Bambino brand . While I am glad to hear this product has had so much success for some , please note to others . . if you are experiencing blowouts , or noticing that the majority of the feces is ending up at the rear of the diaper it is because these things are not doing their job !
 when i told my husband we were going to use cloth diapers he was so concerned about the poop . so i looked into liners hoping to alleviate his worries . i read so many reviews i drove myself crazy . i ended up buying these because they costed less and you could wash them.they are horrible . they are so rough and scratchy . these liners gave my little one a horrible rash . they do get softer as your little one pees in them and sweats . you can actually wash them and reuse them.i just dont feel like these are worth giving my little a rash . thankfully my husband realized cloth is really no different then disposables and poop is not an issue.i would not buy them again and i have so many left that are going to waste .
 I do not understand why it got good reviews . Maybe just because these liners are cheap . It looks like it is not supposed to be used for children . These liners are emery paper .
 Our son has special needs and will need to be in diapers longer , so we went ahead and invested in some good cloth diapers . He only voids once a day but it is very messy . We thought these liners would help keep the diaper somewhat cleaner and easier to rinse , but the liner just created a shoot for the poop to come out of the leg holes ! Yuck!Since we know when he is going to do it , -LRB- he takes medicine for it and we have it timed out -RRB- we either put a paper -LRB- decomposable -RRB- diaper on him and toss it , or watch him closely so that we catch it right after it happens so there is less mess.I would only recommend this product for kids who have very solid stool . Our child 's is very loose and the product does not work for him . I will say that we washed some of them with the diapers and it seems to more absorbent and less stiff after its washed .
 I think my heading says it all ... these liners are rough , they feel like sandpaper on hands let alone my baby ' s bottom . The perforations are barely visible and when you pull on the roll , the liner will tear . I am returning these .
 The pros
 What a waste of money ! They bunch up rendering them useless ! I thought it would be a great option for my husband who was hesitant to change poopy diapers , but I 'd rather rinse them off myself . Such a disappointment .
 I got these to try and it was 2.00 less than my regular nappy liners brand , well `` what is cheap is not worth '' I use them on my daughters cloth diapers , and they break easily , move around , basically do n't do the job !!! DONT BUY !!!!!
 I bought these liners because they were less expensive than others . I gave them two stars for a few different reasons.My daughter has very sensitive skin and I need to use diaper cream on her every time I change her . Even using two sheets , folded , the paste still leaks through to the diaper sometimes . A big bummer when using cloth diapers as you have to spend extra time scrubbing to get the paste out.The price seems cheaper than the others - 200 sheets for the same price as 100 sheets - but I end up using two at a time . So it really evens out in the end .
 These liners are not good ! I bought these specifically to protect our baby 's cloth diapers when he has to use heavy-duty diaper cream - they do not do the job well . They are rough , tend to bunch up , and tear easily , resulting in diaper cream all over the diapers . Great . We had another brand before this -LRB- I ca n't remember which brand -RRB- and they were much , much better . I strongly recommend buying a different brand .
 I was expecting a lot more from these . When they came I laughed . They are so think -LRB- like a fabric sheet if not thinner -RRB- so how that is going to hold any urine is beyond me , I did n't even use any of them I just threw them away .
 I got these liners because they were less expensive than others and had great reviews . Seriously , the people reviewing these have n't tried other brands . I love , love , love the Bummis and Bumkins liners . Compared to those two brands , the imse vimse feel like sandpaper . I put a few on the changing table so my husband would used them . When I asked him why he had n't been using them , he said , `` Oh , I thought those were dryer sheets . '' Thats what they feel like , stiff , ichy dryer sheets . The Bummis and Bumkins brand are soooooo soft . All three serve their purpose , but I would n't want the Imse 's on my butt ! Bummis are my fave because they are on a roll , if you do n't care about it being in a roll , the Bumkins are perfect . They all seem too big , so I just tear them in half and get twice as many !
 These liners are a good size , but they are really rough and my son now gets rashes when I use them . On the plus side , they can be washed and reused and are more soft after washing , but I would prefer a product that is soft from the start . I like the bumkins liners much better .
 These are so rough and thin . They do n't catch anything either . They are way too big for little bums . I would not get these ever again .
 I bought this liner because it was the only one available on amazon at the time . It is my least favorite liner I 've tried . It was too wide for the diapers so it has to be folded to fit , and its really thin and scratchier than others . I will say that so far it hasnt broken on me , so its held up as far as usefulness goes , but its an annoyance to put in .
 They are stiff . They do the job but I have used other ones I like much better . Also they tend to tear when they get wet were the other ones would n't . I would n't recommend them .
 Not a fan of these . They 're very rough and give my baby redness , so we 're stuck with 175 liners we do n't know what to do with . Would have preferred if like other companies they sold them as 100 , so I could have decided and saved money . They do the job they 're supposed to do but at the cost of hurting my little one 's bum , so no go .
 These diaper liners were rough and after using for a whole days worth of diapering , my little one 's skin started peeling . We looked at all the usual suspects
 these liners are really rough feeling and left my daughter with a very red bum ! they would stick to her inside the diaper and then when i pulled it off she was really red . i know its definitely the liners because i didnt use them at night and she didnt have a rash in the morning even after been in her diaper for 6 hours or so .
 We cloth diaper my son -LRB- mostly , anyway ! -RRB- and like using liners because it makes cleanup so much easier . He has messy poos that do n't spray off easily , so the liners are the best way to keep my diapers cleaner longer and cut down my diaper-cleaning time!I bought these ones over my usual Kushies , because they were cheaper . I have to say I do n't really care for them - they are much less soft than the Kushies and have a weird texture , reminiscent of dryer sheets oddly enough.The size is what does it for me though . They just do NOT fit in my Bumgenius 3.0 's at all , without folding . I find this to be wasteful , it adds a whole extra step . The size is odd to me ; if I cut it in half it would n't give enough coverage . I have to fold a third of it under , leaving 2/3rd 's to work as a liner . I took some pictures , so make sure you check the customer photos.They do seem to work well enough , once folded down to fit the diaper correctly . No toilet clogs , no rashes , no leaks -LRB- PROVIDED they are folded ! If part of the liner overhangs it WILL wick pee -RRB- . They just do n't work for my diapers . I 'll go back to Kushies after my rolls are gone .
 i usually get the kushies liners and thought they were a little rough . i read the reviews on these and thought they sounded good . we HATE them ! they are too thin , they bunch up so it does n't really catch all of the poo . they get so beat up after using them that we never even tried to wash them in order to reuse them.the fit is weird too . they are too wide and too short . just ordered more of the kushies . very disappointed !
 This product picture IS NOT ACCURATE from what you recieve from the company . You only get half of a package and it comes wrapped in plastic wrap with no label or product information . The company also charges $ 6.99 for shipping , but pays $ 3.85 in postage -LRB- priority mail stamp on envelop -RRB- . That cost is more than the product , and cleary not worth it given the shotty presentation .
 We decided to give these liners a try because of their lower price point than the other brands . When I tore the first sheet off the roll , I instantly understood why they were cheaper.The sheets are smaller and they have a tendency to bunch/creep which means they only catch about 1/3 to 1/2 of the `` output '' . Most noticeably , they are extremely rough ... I honestly felt bad about even putting them up against my child 's bottom . He has never had diaper rash and is almost one year old , but he has developed a rash since using this product . I had taken him to the pediatrician earlier this week due to illness , and while I was there , I mentioned the rash . The doctor looked at it and said that it is most likely caused by friction/rubbing . With these being so stiff and scratchy , I would n't be surprised if these liners were a contributing factor as nothing else in our diaper routine has changed.I am extremely disappointed in this product and will certainly never be purchasing it again . If you 're looking for a good liner , stick with Bumkins flushable liners -LRB- 100 count for $ 7.99 -RRB- . Bumkins are very soft , larger , stay-put , and completely serve their intended purpose . They are well worth the -LRB- very minimal -RRB- additional expense .
 Feel quite rough . I am afraid my baby will be very uncomfortable with these . Will be sticking with Viscose Biodegradable / Flushable Liners for Dispoable or Cloth Diaper - BubuBibi from now on . Their incredibly soft .
 these are super thin , rip and do not work well at all . I was bummed because the imsevimse training pants work well . These liners however do not .
 When we started cloth diapering , getting flushable liners was a must for us . We first used Grovia liners . I tried switching to these as they were a little cheaper . Sometimes you get what you pay for . These bunched up and did not do a good job of catching all of the waste . They are much thinner and flimsier than the Grovia liners . We did n't even use them all up before we ended up buying some more Grovia liners . We are pretty much done with diapering , so I have not done anymore research to find an alternative . I would definitely not recommend these , though .
 The individual sheets are too big and we need to cut them in half in order to use them with the Bumgenious cloth diapers .
 I really did n't like these liners . I bought them because I read some good reviews , but they felt so rough , almost like paper towels . I ended up ordering more Bummis Bio-Soft liners , because the Imse Vimse ones just felt so hard and rough against my poor boy 's bottom .
 Did not ship the `` Old '' formula as pictured on the website from Alpharma . They shipped the new formula , same as now available at Costco , from another manufacturer . This `` new formula does not work for me as it contains other ingredients that irritate my skin . This is going back .

 Completed the bottle . Never saw any difference in skin or joint health . On the bright side , it also did not cause any bad side effects . Have found choline makes a difference in my joint pain .
 Not double strength , it 's normal strength sold for twice the cost . Other than that , I am still using this for my broken bones and did n't notice much difference so far .
 This came highly recommended , but I am not getting relief with a torn rotator cuff . I 'm taking with glucosamine & condroitin , MSM and high doses of vitamin C. Do you have any experience with this ? Recommendations ?
 I researched this product before I bought it and had high hopes . I already take collagen and thought this would be a good addition . During my research I did see allergic reactions mentioned on a few sites.Well I guess I 'm one of the few . After about 4 days I had a VERY itchy rash appear on my face and neck after taking my dose that day . It appeared in under an hour . I tried lotion thinking it was just dry skin at first , no effect . Tried cortisoze cream -LRB- this ALWAYS should work -RRB- NO EFFECT . Tried washing my face thinking it was just a contact allergy , nope . It finally went away later that day . This was SEVERE itch , like shingles or chicken pox.Suspecting this supplement I stopped cold turkey for two weeks and then took a dose today . Within a half hour I wanted to rip my hand and arm off they itched SOOO bad . Again nothing but time -LRB- about an hour -RRB- could make the rash go down.I plan on trying AGAIN in a few weeks to super duper make sure , but I have no doubt I 'll just itch again . : -LRB-
 The condom packing was fine . But , when you tear the condom out of the its packet , it is so looosely rolled as though it has been used . Almost 70 % were in that condition.You understand what I mean here . I regret I used them . I have thrown all away . I would rather buy from my local pharmacy . Dont want to risk my life.I suggest no one should buy things like condom online at all .
 I would n't really recommend this product . It will not mix with liquids , and is challenging to consume . I did not notice any beneficial effects while taking this product for two weeks . As far as I can tell , it does not work as claimed .
 The bottles that arrive most likely wo n't look like the picture . I recieved bottles and lids losely in a box . If this was something for myself I might not care , but every baby item I purchase I have always made sure it is sealed for sanitary reasons - most of the items I purchase are Medela and they have the safety seal stating that if the seal is broken , the item can not be returned , which i like - it makes me feel safer about the products I am purchasing . However , if I use the bottles , it will be helpful that I can freeze then un-freeze and feed without having to transfer from a bag to a bottle .
 I ordered directly from BabyBecause and the bottles are not as they appear in the photo at all . Packaging is totally different , no pink caps and different logo . The product probably works fine , but I 'm giving this only a one-star rating because of the vendor . I contacted them and while they are willing to take the product back , they will not issue any kind of refund for shipping . They insist that the product is the same and that they did not advertise a specific COLOR bottle .
 I think this is OK , like Biofreeze and all other product . I think its way too expensive tho I will just do ice therapy , its free , natural and works as good . If you want to spend money , by tauma oil instead . Its cheaper and less chemical means healthier for your body , for your furniture , for your cats . I use it all the time putting it everywhere , and my house feels so soothing .
 I gave this a 2 star only because something in the smell of it made my cat go absolutely crazy ! I put the gel on my foot and wore my shoes ; later in the day when the shoes were off and the cat caught whiff of them she went ballistic ... like she had been given an over dose of catnip or mind altering drug !! She attacked and played with the shoes and then was ready to start at my feet . There must be some ingredient in it that stimulates the cat 's brain . I had to give my 2 units to a friend who has no cats and he says that the product does provide relief so maybe my rating would have been higher had I been able to use it .
 i BOUGHT THE &#34; SPRAY ON &#34; VERSION , IT DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS . POSSIBLY THE &#34; ROLL ON &#34; VERSION WOULD BE A BETTER SELECTION . I HAVE USED THE &#34; ROLL ON &#34; VERSION AND WAS COMPLETELY SATISFIED .
 I ordered this roll for neck support rather than lumbar support , but find it 's not suitable for that purpose . Here 's my situation . I like to sleep with a small roll type pillow for several reasons . I started using a rolled up bath towel and found it worked great to support my head and neck while preserving my hair style and not aggravating my skin which can break out with rosacea if I use a pillow that retains heat . I switch to a side sleeping position during the night often times and then the rolled up towel is not high enough to give me good neck support . I found a U shaped pillow at BB&B ; with a comfortable foam that I love in winter for back sleeping , but it does n't work for side sleeping either , so I set out to find a foam roll that would work for neck support ideally from both back and side positions , but at least the side position . The pillow I like is not heat sensitive and firmer than most foam pillows , hence my thought to try the firm version of this pillow . Sadly , it is REALLY firm . It may be great for lumbar support , but is way too firm for laying your head against . I get hardly any depression in the foam from the weight of my head , so it feels rather like the upholstered arm of a chair instead of what I was hoping for . My search continues.If , like me , you are looking for foam neck support , I do n't recommend this.Update
 if you are buying this to put behind your back it may be fine . if you want one to roll on your back and legs it is completely useless . the carrying case is pretty cool if a soft pad is what you want .
 I purchased this product for my auto and office chair . The elastic strap is too loose/flimsy to hold the product in place . It rolls forward and places the user in an umcomfortable , and possibly physically dangerous , position .
 Used this support for less that 4 hours total and it had already started to unravel at the seams , obviously poor quality
 I have used the McKenzie Lumbar Rolls for many years , and they have been lifesavers for me . I use them at home , at the office , going out to eat , and especially for air travel . Without lumbar support , I get into back trouble , and this is the best lumbar support I have found.However , the product has changed . The traditional roll is the one pictured at the top of the product page in which the belt is attached through reinforced slits in the roll 's cover . These traditional rolls last for a very long time , and the cover and belt outlast the firmness of the foam . The new rolls are made out of different material , and the belts are sewn into the seam at each end of the zipper . These seams rip out in a few months , well before the foam has begun to soften , and the belt becomes useless . I 'll try to add a photo above to show what I mean.I hope that the designers and manufacturers will notice this problem and come up with a remedy . As I said , I depend on these rolls . Since I am forced sometimes to carry them in public , they have to look good and not ratty.By the way , I have found one workaround . I slip my torn roll into a small , light nylon briefcase just wide enough for the roll , and I leave it zipped in there . I carry the briefcase to a meeting or a dinner , and I just slip the briefcase behind my back , and then I have the support I need , and no one sees the torn roll -- or any roll at all . -LRB- By the way Amazon , this is not a toy . -RRB-
 The Lumbar roll is a good product however I ordered a firm one and it is way too hard . It 's difficult to adjust the roll to your lumbar area because it 's so hard.I would not order firm but the middle density .
 It kept sliding down on the back of my office chair since the straps just get lose on its own . I would n't recommend it to my friends .
 I bought this for driving . It 's not thick enough for me , and the shape tends to concentrate the pressure in a narrow area . They should make a 6 '' -LRB- minimum -RRB- D-shaped roll . I 'll have to go back to a thick rolled-up towel .
 The lumbar roll does n't form to my back like I had hoped for and it is very uncomfortable . I purchased on the great reviews it got but have been disappointed using it in the chair or car .
 The roll quickly flattened out to be thinner that the rolled up towel it replaced . Should have stayed with the towel
 I sincerely tried to lick it off the skin . It tastes horrible . I have no idea if it 's the product quality or the product itself . Not thrilled , returned it .
 Product is what you would expect , but for your own sake , do NOT deal with this company ! They are shady and love to change their pricing once you place an order . So do n't believe what their listed price on here is . Just wait for that email telling you that `` Oops , we made a mistake , you still owe us additional $ xyz '' . .
 Received promptly , but appears it was returned by someone else since part of bottle was missing . I followed the directions ` exactly ' ... my new sheepskin rug Did Not whiten . It was already pretty clean.Definitely would not recommend .
 I Took this product for over six months -LRB- started November 2008 -RRB- and I did ` nt see a change in my blood Pressure . when I call the company , they say things to encourage you to continue . I 'm on blood pressure medication and wanted a natural remedy and i tried the product . My blood pressure was around 145/75 taking my prescriptions alone . after taking the blood vessel support formula for 6 months , my pressure was still around the same as when i was taking the prescriptions . I was taking the BVSF along with my meds , and i later reduced my meds to a lower dosage and still nothing , when i called the company I was told their product allowed my pressure to stay around 145/75 using a lower dosage which i did not believe . I stop taking the BVSF and continued taking my meds and my pressure is still the same . 2 months later my pressure is still the same without taking the BVSF . They never offered me a refund . . This may work for some people but it certainly did not work for me . Now i 'm looking for other natural products so i can cure my HBP for good.Lou , Miami FL
 I bought these gloves after my hand started to hurt from using the computer for extensive periods of time . I quite a bit disapointed after recieving them . I would definatly say that they are not worth $ 16 . They are very flimsy and remind me of something that i would find on a rack in a 99 cent store . . I have been using them on the computer and i will say that they are better than nothing , but i am still searching for a good pair of gloves to use on the computer , and i do n't think that these will last very long . .
 I purchased this Dyzolv Carpet Spot Cleaner and it is the worst spot carpet cleaner I have ever used . It works no better than just using water . I have used other spot carpet cleaners in the past that were a third of the price of this stuff , and they all worked far better than Dyzolv . Also , the sprayer bottle it comes in is more like a spritzer than a sprayer . I actually had to open the bottle top and use is that way . I just want to alert anyone who might think of spending money on this overpriced cleaner , DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !
 I bought this Dyzolv spot remover based on the reviews which made it out to seem like the answer to tough spots . Upon using it , it works okay . It certainly is n't a miracle solution like the reviews here on Amazon made it out to be . Also , 13 bucks is a lot to pay for such a small can -LRB- think Glade air freshner small -RRB- . I 'll be looking for less expensive spot removers in larger quantities . I also noticed the spray nozzle is cheap and frustrating . BAD BUY for the price !! Look elsewhere and do n't be fooled by the 11 5-star ratings this product has gotten on Amazon . They are not deserved .
 I bought this one 6 + months back -LRB- after reading all these great reviews -RRB- because I wanted to get rid of a stain that other removers could not . . neither could Dyzolv . Does this remove other stains ? yes but so does a $ 2 stain remover -LRB- Gonzo , red + white bottle -RRB- that I bought from a local hardware shop . Both performed the same so why pay 6 times more ? BTW , the spray does n't work . I had to move the contents to another spray can . Looks like I 'm not the only one having this problem . Spend your extra cash on gas instead .
 I have tried many diet supplements in my day and I did n't find that this was as effective.You get what you pay for with this product . I am sure with months of use it would have an effect but ifyou want fast results this is n't the product for you.Good Luck !
 I noticed no different using this water pill ... drinking more glasses of water illiminates water much better than these pills ... waste of money
 I followed the directions , had a sensible diet plan , and exercised . No results using these pills .
 OK , so the picture of this item does and EXCELLENT job of hiding how very very CHEAP it really is.The fake leather strap etc is the cheapest material money can buy . It 's almost paper thin etc and just really terrible . Also te strap does n't go through the ball . The strap ends on just either side of the ball , and an even thinner piece of fake leather -LRB- thinner than a shoe lace -RRB- goes through the ball . This tiny fake leather thong piece is simply tied to either side of the strap with a single overhand knot ! Cheaper than dirt , and felt like a joke . The buckle in back was so cheap it hardly worked - thin cheap light chinese metal.Trying to wear the gag was a joke . It would just flop around and fall out , unless you tightened it AOLT , which just caused the srap to stretch badly and fall apart as the thin thong ripped out and popped off . Also , once tied back together , the gag would not stay in and work unless the buckle got tightened so bad that it really was painful or uncomfortable.ZERO STARS .
 This gag has a strong smell and seems like it was designed more as a joke than for actual use . The smell is the plastic releasing a gas . . and it makes me wonder exactly what it is . . I just think of Lead in toys from China . My GF and I used it once and did n't like it at all we got a gag from tantus and love it . Also the leather hurt when it was put on tight . Look elsewhere if you want something to use again and again .
 Dyson Zorb is a UK-made `` moist '' yellow carpet cleaning powder with a lemon scent . A resealable 750g -LRB- 26.46 oz -RRB- bag usually retails for $ 14.99 plus HST in Canada . I found that one bag is sufficient for approx . 165-195 sq ft of carpet but note that I have carpet on the stairs only , hence I need more Zorb per square foot . If you have carpeted rooms you probably get -LRB- considerably -RRB- higher yield . The product description claims that Dyson Zorb binds dust and dirt as it dries , making it easier to vacuum it out of carpets . It has been specifically designed for Dyson vacuum cleaners . You first have to sprinkle it onto the carpet , then groom it into the carpet using the vacuum head -LRB- without turning the vacuum on -RRB- , then wait for 30 minutes , and then vacuum it out of the carpet.I do not have any experience with other carpet cleaning products , hence I can not compare Dyson Zorb to its competitors . However , I can say that , if you have a carpet that is , say , a few years old and that you already carefully vacuumed , the added benefit of using Zorb is close to zero . It may be different with older and/or dirtier carpets , judging from the reviews of others , but for people like myself I do not see any point in using Zorb . My experience does not support the claim of the manufacturer that Zorb allows you to remove dirt that normal vacuuming can not remove .
 `` Felt '' the product in my nasal passages and mouth from the very first moment after opening the bag . Used it on a small area of carpet , gave okay results with an Oreck vacuum cleaner . Now feeling itchy on exposed areas of skin . Have windows wide open and am disposing of remaining product immediately , replacing the cleaner bag , and am showering and shampooing right after . I 'm generally not prone to reactions , but definitely feeling that this product is not for me .
 I tried this cleaner -LRB- twice -RRB- after the reading the reviews on this site . I followed the tips given on this site , heavily sprinkled and really brushed in before letting dry and vacuuming up . My carpet is cream colored with very obvious high traffic areas . Although the carpet showed a little improvement , I think it really needs a good shampoo cleaning as oppossed to a light refreshing .
 I have light-colored short loop berber carpet which does not shed when vacuumed . Three weeks ago I got my first Dyson because my Hoover Wind Tunnel kept losing suction without carpet fuzz to be mixed in with the dirt . I love the Dyson , and I was looking to buy any accessories that I could for it . I found the pet cleanup kit on Amazon on sale and promptly ordered it.I used the Zorb on a high-traffic area of the carpet that is looking very dingy after 3 years of use . The Zorb groomer was fairly easy to use to work the Zorb cleaner into the carpet . It was fully dry after 45 minutes . When I vacuumed it up , I got very little extra dirt , and the carpet did not look much cleaner . As other users have mentioned , the room does seem to be fresher.The Zorb cleaning powder did not help much with my carpets . It could be because I have tried unsuccessfully to steam clean this area several times in the past . Perhaps if I had used the Zorb powder initially I would have seen a bigger difference ?
 This is my first carpet cleaning product . I followed the instructions and let it dry for about an hour and then used my DC14 dyson to suck it all up . The lemon smell was not great but not that bad . Unfortunately the carpet looks identical to before using it in every single way .
 Own a Dyson vacuum and love it . Discovered an unpleasant smell emanating from the master closet . Thought I would try this product in lieu of the carpet cleaner truck . Did n't see much of an improvement after using this . Honestly , I could n't really say that it did much if anything to alleviate the problem I was trying to correct . Threw out anything that looked old or dusty from the master closet area -LRB- walk-in closet with mirrored door on a hinge -RRB- and put a couple of Febreeze air fresheners on the shelf . The Febreeze units did far more than this product did . In my opinion , if you need your carpet cleaned , break out your checkbook and call one of those steamer vans . The rental do-it-yourself steam units are a joke .
 So I was very excited to try this product , but my excitement faded as soon as I opened the bag . The smell was so strong it made my eyes water , nose run and throat hurt . Not only is it a strong smell , it is a BAD smell ... chemically and sour . I held my breath and tried it in a small area . It took about an hour to dry and after vacuuming I saw no change in the carpet . The smell took days to fade , had to open window in 95 + degree weather . Could not use the rest of bag . Might work on significant stains but did nothing for my high traffic light stains . Someone with less sensitve nose/eyes might not be bothered by smell . Wanted to like this but I was disappointed !
 I tried this product and it is like spreading wet sawdust on your carpet . It did n't seem to remove any dirt whatsoever . My carpet looks the exact same as it did before I used the product . It has a nice smell and that 's about it . I would n't recommend this product and I will stick with my carpet cleaner from now on .
 I had high hopes that this product would remove dirt and stains but it did nothing . I love my Dyson Animal vacuum but will continue to have my carpets professionally cleaned .
 I just spent two futile hours trying to remove some garden variety dirt from my stairs . I vacuumed -LRB- and I really ca n't say enough GOOD things about the Dyson vacuum , it 's awesome ! -RRB- used the zorb tool that came with my vacuum and thoroughly worked it into the stains , waited 30 minutes and vaccumed thoroughly again . Nothing ! I should have read a book instead for all the good it did . Very disappointing and now I 'll need to find the energy to get out the carpet cleaner and do it all again .
 I have to admit I bought this hoping it would clean up some spots on a beige carpet -LRB- two carpets , actually . -RRB- Bottom line , it did n't work on either the plush one or the flat-synthetic Berber type carpet . In addition , it left a residue and an odor -LRB- some kind of perfume . -RRB- Now I feel like I need to clean the carpet with a steam cleaner to get rid of the smell and residue but I 'm going to go with a day or two more drying and then see if it vacuums clean.If it just did not do a good job , I 'd blame it on the age and dirt on the carpet , but I 'm unhappy that it left something behind . It was the equivalent of spraying the carpet with something to try to cover up an odor , as opposed to actually removing any dirt . I had emptied the Dyson before vacuuming up the Zorb and it did NOT pick up anything else , no more hair , no more dirt , just the stuff I 'd put down . -LRB- Which does n't even look dirty after being vacuumed up . -RRB- That 's why I gave it a 1 as in my opinion it did no cleaning and left the carpet worse .
 I used this on my carpet - it is very easy to use , I followed the instructions , and other than being vacuumed , there is no noted difference . The stains/high traffic dirt are still there . Maybe it would work great on new carpet , but if your carpet is new , do you really need this ?
 Carpet smelled nice but this stuff does not clean the carpet . It promised to clean even old stains . I would n't even clean a fresh dirty area .
 Two days ago I used a bag of Zorb that had come with my Dyson a year or two ago.Maybe this stuff spoils ? It left the most foul smell , smells like my father-in-laws basement , on the lake , with the leak , that he never used to go in to.We poured an entire box of baking soda on the floor in my daughter 's room , but you can still smell it throughout the entire house . It 's nauseating . It even seems like when I went to work this morning the smell had gotten into my clothes and went with me!I love my Dyson , but boy , this Zorb stuff , peee-yewwwwww !!!!!
 I just used the zorb product on my carpet . I followed the instructions and then some . I meticulously vacuumed my carpet before starting , then sprinkled the zorb , scrubbed , scrubbed , scrubbed with the special zorb attachment for my Dyson and then waited an hour . I then vacuumed again , and again , and again just to make sure I had gotten it all out of my carpet . The whole process -LRB- excluding wait time -RRB- took about an hour -LRB- and the area I was doing was not that large -RRB- . I was extremely disappointed when my carpet looked the EXACT same !! The reason I was using this product was to get a few small stains that my toddlers had spilled . These were about the size of dimes and were not very dark or noticeable and yet they looked the exact same . I did not even notice a difference in the carpet fibers like some other users had seen . My carpet is about 3 years old , and does not have a lot of wear and tear ... it is a loft area.I would NOT recommend this product .
 My wife and I are on a tight budget , so I really wanted to feel justified in getting this . Our carpet is n't top-of-the-line , and it could really use a little refresh . My carpet is about 2 years old . We do n't have pets , but we do have 2 toddlers that spill everything everywhere.I divided a 4 ft by 4 ft section of carpet in half and marked both sections with white electrical tape . I followed the directions step-by-step in one section -LRB- which includes sprinkling the powder , grooming the carpet , and allowing to dry -RRB- , and vacuumed the other section in my usual method . Neither section of carpet has any major stains.I brought my wife in and asked her to tell me which side I used the powder on . She could n't tell the difference . It did smell nice in the room , but both sides look exactly the same . To me , it seemed the the Zorb side had a slightly darker hue , but otherwise I could n't tell the difference either.I do feel a little bit like a sucker for shelling out -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks for a nice smell . I 'll include photos of both sections of carpet in the `` Customer photos '' section of this review . Have a look for yourself . I shot the carpet with a Nikon DSLR and off-camera flash , white balance set to `` flash . ''
 i am not impressed with this product at all . although i love my dyson vac , this carpet maintenance powder must only work on new hardly soiled carpet as my old carpet is just as dirty as before
 I got a free bag of Zorb with my Dyson . Tried it out and I could not be less impressed . I used it on the high-traffic areas of my carpet , which showed a hint of discoloration due to the dirt tracked in . Nothing particularly difficult to remove - it 's just where most of the dirt is deposited and it starts to show after a few months.Zorbed the carpet , worked it in , let it dry , vacuumed it up , and no visible change . I would have been back at the store asking for a refund if I 'd actually paid for it.Hit the same are with Resolve powder and the carpet looks brand new again.Could have been me , could have been the Zorb bag I got , could have been my carpet , but Zorb did n't work for me , and I 'm not inclined to try it again .
 I love my Dyson ... very impressed with it so I though I would try this stuff out.I was unable to see any difference at all . I will not use this product again .
 I recently bought a Dyson DC25 vacuum from Amazon for my new apartment . Afterwards , I searched on Amazon for a carpet cleaning powder and selected Dyson Zorb . Zorb had received some good feedback and was being sold under the Dyson label.Unfortunately , I 've gotten nothing but poor results using Zorb despite followed the directions to the letter . First , Zorb has a strong chemical odor . It might cover the existing carpet odor but it does n't improve it . I found I even needed to use baking soda to absorb the Zorb order afterwards.Second , Zorb clogged and caused widespread blockages throughout my brand-new DC25 . The Brush Bar became totally clogged . The hose became clogged at several points . The Clear Bin had a residue all over - in ever nook and cranny - that was tough to clean . Even after spending an hour cleaning my Dyson , there was still residue that I could n't reach - a big disappointment on a brand new vacuum.I definitely would n't use or purchase the Zorb Carpet Maintenance Powder again . It does clean your carpet - although no better than some other alternatives - but the smell and the huge mess it makes overshadows any effectiveness .
 It does nothing that I can see except leave a pleasant scent . I scrub it in with a firm bristle brush , wait 30 minutes , vacuum with my Dyson , and my carpet still looks the same . It is only 2 years old so it is n't an old carpet . It might work on carpets that are more of a `` pile '' but not berber . I gave 2 stars just for scent alone .
 It smelled nice . It was like sawdust but spongy and moist . It smelled nice.Other than that , it did nothing .
 It wo n't clean any spots but it will freshen the the smell , if any , and awaken the nap ... no pun intended . It refreshes and renews with relatively little effort . We have 2 dogs and they have had no adverse reactions . So , in between carpet cleanings this product will give your carpet a pick-me-up .
 Muscle milk is a very good product that is very healthy for the individual that is drinking it ! It 's everything that the product maker of Muscle milk say 's it is . We drink Muscle milk by the 14oz , 17oz or 20oz container at least once a day . But you have to watch the way they ship it to you . We had out of the case of 12-17oz containers of liquid muscle milk three broken containers and one that was spoiled but we did received 8-17oz in the case that were up to our expectations . Way to go Muscle mlk
 I do n't know if i have some gene that lets me taste the toxic waste in this stuff , but this is by far the worst protein shake i have ever had in my life.Got a pack of 4 twice from convenience stores , awful consistently each and every time , and made me feel terrible after i drank it.I have had a lot of proteins by powder on bodybuilding website and such . If after trying this horrible stuff you think you do n't like protein shakes . try again.A pretty popular decent protein shake is optimum nutrition chocolate .
 I stopped by a convenience store today and picked up a bottle of this Banana Creme Muscle Milk because I was out of my usual morning protein drink at home . This is one of the worst things I have ever tasted in my entire life ! Seriously tastes like they bottled monkey vomit ! Three sips and I threw it in the trash . Total waste of money ! Do not buy !
 Let me start by saying that Muscle Milk is a fantastic supplement and I highly endorse it . But this gets one-star from me because it is sold as a Ready-To-Drink product which has not consistently met that claim . I have ordered several cases via the subscribe and save from Amazon . Each and every box had more than half of the tops off or damaged beyond use . The last box that arrived only had TWO drinks with the tops in tact . The tops serve two purposes
 Cytosport Muscle Milk High Protein Shake , Banana Creme , 17-Ounce Cartons -LRB- Pack of 12 -RRB- Lots of potential but -- had tried the chocolate , very good . Ordered 2 more cases -- both are curdled and lumpy . The lumps will not go back into solution . Probably not dangerous but definelty not appealing . Amazon should get out of foods if they ca n't deliver the good .
 The brace will not stay up when I walk ... starts sliding and by step 5 it 's at my ankle . I 've tried everything I can think of . It feels good when it is on and I 'm standing but as soon as I start walking it starts sliding . There is a design flaw somewhere , I see others have had the same problem .
 This item worked fine only initially ; comfortable and stabilized my knee . In a short amount of time , about 2-3 months , it began falling down . At first I could adjust it and it might last 1-2 hours . That shortly degraded into not staying up at all . I would not recommend this item .
 It wo n't stay in place if you move around alot so any activity is out of the question . If you are going to wear them to sit with your legs elevated they are fine . Otherwise they slide down to your ankles . I was able to get it to stay somewhat but I had to have it so tight that it was a bit painful.In short , I was disappointed with the product .
 I received it in excellent time . However according to the sizing chart it said I needed a 5x . This was huge !!!! As in could n't keep it up no matter how tight the straps were huge . So the sizing runs a bit big . Overall quality seemed ok but the primary reason it was returned was because the stitching on the side of one of the hinges was completely missing causing the hinge to pop out . Outside of that it appeared to be good quality .
 I was very dissapointed first the 4xs made by this company in the other models are larger then the 5xs in this model which did not seem to make sense . aslo the brace always sliped off after a few steps I had read this in another review but did not take it to heart .
 The first month I got these they worked great but this second month they do n't seem to be doing anything at all . Will not be purchasing these again .
 These were much smaller than I thought and would not fit my curling iron . I believe they were mis-represented .
 Conair has n't figured out how to create a hot shaving cream product that works over time . It stops putting out lather , everything that can be done to make it work does not make it work , and it just will not force the cream from the enclosed can ! This is a fundamental design problem and the company 's engineers need to get back to work . A big waste of money , Conair needs some competition ...
 I just tried this stuff for the first time because I was looking for a healthy breakfast . I was really excited to try it this morning and I was really DISAPPOINTMENT . I 'm forcing down the Maple & Brown Sugar and it taste like chemicals . There is absolutely no maple & brown sugar taste in this . I 'm going to have to dump this because it 's so hard to swallow . I do n't understand the people that are saying it taste so great ?
 For about a week after opening a bottle of this , it smells fine , but after that the rancid fishy smell begins and increases . This is despite closing the bottle the second I am done pouring from it , and quickly putting it back in the refrigerator . The peachy taste is n't so peachy either . I decided to switch to wholemega and have been happy about it .
 I got this -LRB- peach -RRB- for my children and myself as a supplement . I had one tsp . and everything I ate tasted like fish for over 24 hours . Would love ideas to mask it better because it has been sitting in the fridge for a month now . yuck !
 I used this for a short while and was very pleased with the taste . As far as refined fish oils go this is the best one on the market . The reason for the 2 stars is I and most other have no Idea that this and most other fish oils contain artificial vitamins and the fish oil itself has little benefit after deodorizing and processing . Because so much of the natural goodness is removed they have to add it all back.I wish there was some sort of consumer protection label to warn people about this many would still choose to take it but the more health conscious would search for more natural sources of vitamins.There are still a few brands out there that do unrefined Fish oils however you do have to deal with the taste , fortunately there are capsules and the liquid pump as well . Vital choice salmon oil is awesome with high natural vitamin A & D There is also Fermented Cod liver oil by Blue Ice High A & D . Fermented is the traditional way it has been made for thousands of years and the healthiest . It is more expensive per bottle but you need to take less so it comes out even in cost.If you see a fish oil high in EPA and DHA and low in A it is most like been highly processed.Consumers want High EPA & DHA so they alter the oil it does not come naturally that way from a super fish .
 The product is amazing , however , Pure Health did not ship well . One bottle was broken on arrival and the bottles were very poorly packaged . As well , I was not compensate4d for the broken bottle .
 This bottle arrived broken , the postman came to the door with a box saturated in fish oil in a plastic bag . There is no way to contact someone at amazon to explain situation only a form that said to return the bottle for reimbursement . I did print out the form but did not know how I was to send that mess back .
 Product is horrible . I used the packets for 3months & within the second month , it made my feet itch like crazy . What a big waste of money .
 I 've taken diet pill before but this green tea fat burner was a nightmare ... It gave me a lot of energy for my exercizes but it I started waking up 3 times during my sleep every night that I took this pill . I stopped taking it and I stopped waking up in the middle of the night . This fat burner also caused mood swings ... major mood swings ...
 The OTC brace is impossible to wear more than 15-20 minutes . The problem is in the materials used
 I measured my knee around the bend and then ordered this is the coordinating size , which was recommended on the site , and it is way too large . It falls down my knee the moment I put it on . Going to have to return it and had to go out and purchase a more expensive one in town .
 I was used to much more support when wearing a brace but this was n't for me . It tended to slip down my knee , if your looking for something simple maybe this is for you
 This product has been of no use for two reasons . First , though I measured myself and selected the appropriate size , it is simply too large by at least one size . Second , it is not as robust as the picture would suggest . I do not plan to grow into it ; perhaps an alternative use will occur to me . Suggestions ?
 The brace will not stay up when I walk ... starts sliding and by step 5 it 's at my ankle . I 've tried everything I can think of .

 Did not like these . Too gummy like jelly on a rubber strip and lint gets embedded in it and it doesnt wash off like they say . Really expensive . .3 months supply would cost about 300.00 if I use a new one every week because they get so dirt and it does not wash out so you have to use a new.I purchased ScarAway 6 weeks ago and the sheets wash off cleanly and I have seen great results already . ScarAway is a soft fabric with a silicone layer which feel nice on the skin and clothes glide over it without pulling off . I did not like the ScarFX because it was like rubber so it pulled under clothes and rolled off .
 This silicone garmet belt is very easy to put on . It 's like a big piece of tape that you wrap on to your body and wo n't fall down . However , if you are wearing it for a little while , it is ok . If you are planning to wear it for hours to half a day , this is not a product you want to use . Usually the scar is not as big as the area of the whole sheet that covers your body , but you have to cover a large area of your body in order for the velcros to secure the sheet . There will be a large area of your skin not able to breath any air for a long time . After I use it for a few hours , I started to feel itchy , hot and uncomfortable . After trying it for 3 times -LRB- I wore it for 6-8 hours per day -RRB- , I started to get some rashes on my skin . After consulting with my doctor , he told me to use the small silicone strips just enough to cover the scar itself , which has been working better for me .
 Having purchased this item several times from my local Medical Supply Store I was very upset to open this package today and find its a FAKE !!! What you see in the picture is the REAL Gelzone Garment Belt , however , what you will receive in the mail is a FAKE !! Dont be a victim of the classic `` bait & switch '' . Buyer Beware !!!!!
 I ordered the Gelzone and this was a no name wrap in a gelzone box . It was not the one I have seen on T.V or the picture that they have up . I paid the money for the gelzone not for a off brand wrap.Garrett
 This is the second gelzone belt that I have purchased . The first one was perfect . It provided great support and lasted 4 weeks . I was so pleased that I promptly ordered a second one . I think this product has been used ! It is falling apart , in the same way that my first one did after 4 weeks ! Only I have only worn this one for two days . I definently got a lemon , and am upset because I ca n't send it back . This is an expensive product . I also paid for 2 day shipping and I did n't receive the product until day 6 . I am upset . I really loved my first gelone belt . I think someone has scammed me with this one though .
 Product other content lists `` calcium carbonate '' . This was not listed in detail online . No wonder this help in acidity problem but it is no different then taking Pepcid . It is Pepcid with papaya flavor .
 I had just started taking this supplement that was a different brand and it was n't bad and I thought i would order more in bulk on line . This one is much more chalky like a tums than my previous one and I tried to keep taking them but have since stopped . Will try to find previous brand that was almost like a little desert after meals . It probably was sweetened or something but the texture and taste would be worth it .
 This papaya enzyme does n't work as good as any other brand , even the one I bought from Walmart works better .
 The last ingredient is papaya flavors -LRB- see list later -RRB- . Everything else seems to just make an antacid . Probably works great for that , if that 's what you 're after . I was n't . Sure would beat mint or other ` fruity ' antacids -- so I would highly recommend if you need it . The tablets are very small -- I would say 2 or 3 would compare to one small tablet of a competitor . Bright white , with a slight off-putting smell , but they do taste great -- just like papaya . I think I 'd have to eat dozens to get any papaya benefit though . On the label everything is listed as `` Other Ingredients '' which are
 Tastes OK , but each papaya enzyme product contains different sweeteners . This one contains sucrose , the `` bad '' sugar . My wife feels nauseous right after taking these -LRB- sensitive to sweets -RRB- so we ditched it and are moving on to another brand . Mannitol , another sweetener used by American Health , is known to cause diarrhea if you are sensitive to it , so be careful which papaya enzyme product you get .
 In my personal experience , neither the liquid nor the tablets provided anything more than a very brief respite from heartburn . While the taste was pleasant , the relief was minimal at best . I wo n't be buying this brand again .
 This stuff was absolutely nasty ! I made one shake and through the rest away . I would have asked for my money back , but clearly they need it more than me .
 I thought that the bristles could handle tough bathroom scum , without scratching the bathtub surface . I was wrong . I do not feel that it was worth the price either .
 very bad gripdo not purchase this item as you will have to through it to the garbage !!! libman has good items , but not this one !!!
 This is one of the worst products I have ever used for multi coated optics and you better be real quick about getting the film off multi-coated optics before it dries.Simply a beautifully packaged product that may ruin your finest lenses but works well on a D 700 LCD panel . I am being gentle here - being a D3s - D 700 - EOS 1V guy - I speak from experience.DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ON MULTI COATED LENSES OR B&W ; MRC FILTERS .
 This simply do not clean ones glasses ; they leave a lot of streaking and dried something behind ; utterly pointless , and the fact that the individual packets have to be ripped of off each other is annoying.I swore by Sight Savers till they recently changed their formulation to be like Zeiss ' , and am now desperately searching for a replacement . : -LRB-
 The company sent the wrong product which was a bummer . They sent a big bottle of liquid cleaner - not the wipes . I was on a vacation and had it shipped to my location so instead of returning it , I gave it to a person who wanted for their glasses.So my review at this point is limited to the shipper .
 This Nature 's Way product like others says it 's standardized but when you get it , and look at its ingredients , only 300mg of it is standardized and the other 200mg of Hawthorn is n't . This is a very deceitful practice and I 'm finding that this is a common problem with so called standardized anything .
 I have extreme hypertension , and a friend of mine told me about Hawthorn extract . He told me it was widely used in Europe for hypertension and heart problems and was a safe alternative to medication . I have used medication in the past . It worked OK , but made me feel tired all the time . So I figured this would be worth a try . I have my own very accurate BP cuff that I use every day . I took this standardized formula for a little over a month . The results ? All it did was give me headaches , and had no , and I mean ZERO , NADA , ZIP & ZILCH effect on my blood pressure at all !!! In the past I also used garlic pills , with the same results . All this is just further confirmation that `` alternative medicine '' is a crock . I recently found a new doctor who has me on a beta blocker and dietetic , and lo and behold , my BP has come way down and is under control . No doubt the true believers will say I 'm either 1 . lying or 2 . I did n't do something right . OK , do n't believe me and waste your time and money . Order some of this junk for yourself and see what happens . But if you trust me enough to take my advice , find a good doctor and get some real , bona-fide effective treatment . Just my two cents .
 The product was satisfactory , however , does not fit . I am unable to return it as there was no packing slip enclosed . Amazon.com says to return directly to the manufacturer , but how can I do that ? I have no paperwork showing proof of purchase .
 the company has tried to get me to change my review of their product . did not appreciate that at all . the item was late in arriving though they try to tell me i am wrong . there is not enough padding in the product to make it comfortable to wear for over an hour but does provide relief and i appreciate that . no review of mine should ever come into question as i am not negative or positive but want to be objective for the benefit of others .
 Once again ... you get what you pay for . It was cheap , it is cheap . Does n't really work very well . It 's just awkward to use .
 The product came in about a week after I ordered it which is a plus and that 's the ONLY good thing I can say . The product is CHEAPLY MADE . The picture looks better then what the product actually is . The collar adjusts the length of the neck but not around the neck , so if you have a skinny neck this wo n't fit . The collar is cheap plastic and cheap thin foam cusion that looks like it came from a packing plant . DO NOT get this product . I would return it but surprise , surprise no return receipt or any receipt for that matter . Ticked off to say the least .
 This item ships flat . Imagine that . A flat piece of thin plastic with sporadic and thin foam on the inside , very thin , like a quarter of an inch.Now your neck is round , and concave , imagine how a flat piece of a plastic can adequately fit and immobilize a round and concave shape.It ca n't . I 've worn a different collar for years and it is getting worn out so I was looking for a replacement , this one is not it . I put it on and it offered almost no support , and barely restricted my movements . It was n't a factor of tightness , it could be tight against my jaw , but because my neck is not as wide as my head -LRB- who woulda thunk it ? -RRB- it is n't actually tight to the neck.Returning it and looking elsewhere .
 I bought and paid for a Laederal StifNeck Select Adjustable Cervical Collar . I did not receive one . Instead , I received a Laederal StifNeck Extraction Collar.The primary difference between the two is that the advertised product is adjustable vertically whereas the product I received is set at one size -LRB- Adult , NoNeck -RRB- . I did n't rate the product 1 star because the NoNeck collar is an alright product that I suppose I will still be able to use , but if I had known that the seller was going to ship a one-size collar instead of an adjustable collar , I could have just bought one of the many other , cheaper NoNeck collars available.The advertised item is available for $ 14 directly from Laederal , but the item I received is only $ 9 from Leaderal . I feel kinda ripped off considering that I paid 33 % more for the collar than I could have paid if I had bought it directly from Laederal thanks to this seller 's dishonest ad.I will be in contact with the seller shortly to see what can be done , but if the other reviewers are correct this seller has a history of shady business practices so I really do n't expect much to happen . I will keep this review updated as things change .

 This is a handy product to have around , especially with the suction cup accessory to hold it upright in your sink . But the sponge is too flimsy to do much beyond glasses or very superficial mess , and the green scrubby portion of the head falls off within a few washes . Definitely not the best dish brush I 've used .
 We love the wand , but we hate the ` scrub ' head . We 've never had that scrubby green bit on the end last more than two weeks before falling off . It can be super-glued back on , but that only postpones the inevitable.This product rates two stars instead of one only because you can use the ` dish wand refills ' with it . The ` dish wand ' head lacks the scrubby bit at the end , but it lasts much longer due to the one-piece construction . Our local housewares stores only carry the ` scrub wand refills ' these days , so we 'll be buying ` dish wand refills ' on Amazon for now !
 The image -LRB- which is no longer available -RRB- showed a pack of 6 toothbrushes but only a pack of 1 toothbrush was delivered !
 How much Resveratrol is actually helpful in weight control , providing antioxidant protection , boosting the body 's anti-inflammation abilities , and cell rejuvenation ? Go to your local healthfood store and look at the various bottles and brands , You 'll see dosages as low as 20 mg while others clock in at 500 mg . And what about the additives ; should you take pure Resveratrol , or might it be best to consider a product with Vitamin C , Quercitin , or C0 Q10?A video on Dr. Oz 's website indicates that the effective dosage begins at 250 mg . But from what I 've read , it 's not the amount of Resveratrol ... it 's the amount of trans-Resveratrol , and an effective dose is at least 100 mg of trans-Resveratrol . The product being reviewed here -- Resveratrol Synergy -- contains just 18 mg of trans-Resveratrol , in addition to Vitamin C and Quercitin . So it seems that if you 're looking for an effective dose of this supplement , this particular product does n't offer enough of it to be particularly useful.On the other hand , the study that kicked off the Resveratrol craze has come under attack . And Sirtis , a pharmaceutical company , prematurely ended its trial on Resveratrol in December 2010 . The Wall Street Journal reports that Sirtis put on the brakes because in doses too high , kidney damage might result . The NYTimes does n't go so far in its reporting , but quotes Sirtis ' chief executive
 My doctor recommended that I give this product a try to boost my immune system and help me with lagging energy levels . I 've been using it for a few months now and I have not noticed any difference in my energy levels at all . I would pass on this in the future as I really could n't justify spending the money on it .
 Most studies are recommending between about 500 and 1200 mg TRANS resveratrol per day . This item contains about 16mg per it 's label with other `` stuff '' . So if your looking for TRANS resveratrol this item is pretty much one of the worst choices you could make for your money . This stuff is expensive and that may be why they put so little in each tablet .
 When you search for generic acetaminophen , this product comes up in the results . Unfortunately , I relied on the search to return relevant products . When you are allergic to aspirin , and can not take it , it is not a viable alternative to acetaminoophen . DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT GENERIC ACETAMINOPHEN . It costs more to return the product than it cost to buy it and ship it . Therefore , you are out of luck if you wanted generic acetaminophen and have to reorder . Shame on Amazon for including other drugs when searching for a specific drug .
 I used this product years ago and loved it . I have n't been able to find in any store since and was excited to find it on amazon . When I received it in the mail I immediately opened it up at put some on . It tasted bad , like it was VERY old . Maybe the reason I have n't been able to find it is because it is a product no longer made ?? I wonder if someone who sold Neurtrogena products is getting rid of old stock . Bummer !
 Need MEDIUM size , not large
 When the mop falls apart -LRB- and it will -RRB- , the manufacturer does not honor the guarantee , except to provide a $ 1.00 coupon towards a new mop head !!
 I give it 2 stars because i 'm sure it would whiten if my teeth were darkened by coffee or other black things , but mine are just a little bit yellow and thus this product had no effect on my teeth
 After i have used it for a week , i havent seen any noticale results . This was suppose to do a quick5 minutes whitening , but never did . That 's why i give it one star .
 The OTC brace is impossible to wear more than 15-20 minutes . The problem is in the materials used
 I was used to much more support when wearing a brace but this was n't for me . It tended to slip down my knee , if your looking for something simple maybe this is for you
 This product has been of no use for two reasons . First , though I measured myself and selected the appropriate size , it is simply too large by at least one size . Second , it is not as robust as the picture would suggest . I do not plan to grow into it ; perhaps an alternative use will occur to me . Suggestions ?
 The item I received did not have the dropper top on it at all . It leaked fluids all the time and was therefor useless for my needs . Buy elsewhere .

 Buy a $ 5.00 Radio Shack rechargeable 6 volt light and take the battery -LRB- SLA -RRB- out . It 's the same battery .

 I bought this product as a gift for my boyfriend ... and he hated it . It did n't so much tingle as burn . I guess if you or the person you plan on getting this for loves the sensation of IcyHot on their genitals , then this product if for you.It was so bad that I felt crappy for buying it for him . The rest of the Kama Sutra products I 've bought have been exceptional however .
 The title says it all . Another reviewer made a snide comment to this effect and he 's probably right . I ca n't believe that it 's advertised as `` ultrasonic '' ... because it 's not . It just vibrates . And there 's more vibration at the base than on the brush head .
 It is cheaply constructed . It is not water-proof . The batteries inside the battery compartment are wet after first use . Not recommended !
 The battery compartment on the product would not remain closed . It is cheaply constructed and totally unsatisfactory .
 it 's been almost a month and I have yet to see any results from taking this overpriced supplement . live and learn
 I used this product a grand total of two times before it stopped functioning . First I started in the shower but moved out of it ; I noticed a small amount of water inside the battery housing . I removed the batteries and let it air dry . The second time I used it wholly within the shower and submerged it within the tub which , since it was marketed as waterproof and all , I figured I could do . -LRB- i even jammed it shut as hard as possible before operation . -RRB- My session ended with no malfunction , but when I opened it up , there was a lot more water in the housing , some of it on the batteries . I towelled it off as best I could , removed the batteries again , and let it dry for several days.Now , it wo n't come on at all . Switching batteries did nothing . I guess ` waterproof ' translates to ` leaky utensil ' in German , which is very unfortunate . . I like the design , the quiet motor and the material . Maybe I 'll keep it around in its stunted form , but I 'm extremely disappointed overall .
 Well after reading the great reviews , I wanted to try this product . I ordered and paid almost $ 18 for the one day shipping . I received item ... no whitening gel was inside box . Frustrating !! I contacted Amazon ... they said they would send a replacement ... next day . Great !! I received a new kit . No whitening gel . I contact yet again to say ` can you please just send me a COMPLETE kit or the gel ? ' and they said `` sorry , this is a widespread problem and we are not able to resend another '' but they are going to credit my account and said to just throw the other two shipments out . So if you 're going to order this product , make sure you contact them first to see that this problem has been taken care of or you 'll wind up with something you ca n't use !
 did n't work for me i tried a couple time but i did n't notice any difference and after the first three or four time i used it , one of the light went off .
 After paying for one day shipping , I was excited to get the package next day ... only to find there was NO whitening gel . UGH . Contacted Amazon who sent me another kit , next day mail ... next day , very excited to get the package ... then ... no whitening gel in that kit either ! Now I was NOT happy . Contacted again . They said there was nothing they could do as this was more widespread than they originally thought . They said they could n't even send me just the gel . They credited me , but still ... is there no quality control at the factory ? How can teeth whitener kits be sent out minus the teeth whitener !!????
 I 've tried purchasing this in 3 different places . The results are the same everywhere . Either you get no whitener in the package , or it is leaking all over the package .
 did not get a chance to use this product . i have returned it because the bottle inside the package was leaking .
 I was so excited to get this product , but when it arrived , BOTH TIMES , the whitening product had leaked all over the package and was unusable . Big bummer !!
 Hey , do n't mess up on your order ! They make it most unprofitable to return an erroneous order . Just keep it and move on .
 They are trying hard to unload # 3 empty capsules . If you 'll check it out , you 'll see that # 3 filling machines are far and few , unless you can spend big money.So check your invoice very close and put it in special instructs what size you are expecting to get , and plain and simple , just do n't order them from HerbsPro .
 Be careful ordering your capsules from this seller and Amazon in general . This is the second time I have ordered capsules apparently from 2 different sellers and gotten the wrong ones . Both times I ordered 00 size caps and was sent 0 size . The first seller was very quick to make things right but this seller was very slow to even email me . I ended up having to keep and use these size 0 caps because it was 2 weeks before I even got them and I had run out of my supply.They will let you send them back but so far its been about a month and this item still has the deceptive option button and you will get the wrong item . Better luck to you .

 was n't really sure what to expect with never using ear candles before . Did n't really see a difference and felt the exact same . maybe I did n't do it right but def . wo n't do it again .
 I did not feel any suction . The build up stuff at the tip that the youtube videos claim is wax being sucked out , ha scam . I was wondering how it could suck stuff up . It does not . Smoke was shooting out the tip . So I was smoking my ear canal , Sure to leave residue inside .
 I gave these a try . . it does appear that the bottom of the candle fills up with ear wax , but in reality that is wax from the candle itself . We burned the other one to test out that theory and the two candles were identical in their contents , even though one had never touched an ear . Do n't waste your money on ear candles .
 So , I LOVE the idea behind this because I love gadgets and gizmos aplenty . I tried it in my right ear - the ear that seems to get blocked up from time to time and I was AMAZED with how much build up and wax I cut out at the bottom of the candle . But I 'm a serious Internet reader ... and far too many people said these were n't the real-deal . Since I read a TON about how witch-doctory these are - I created a control - I used the other candle with the bottom hole sealed on my palm - and guess what ... the build-up at the bottom of the candle was the EXACT same as the one that I put in my ear . So unless I have hidden ear wax in the palm of my hand ... these do n't work.I really wanted this to work , but it does n't from my little experiment . The wax that I cut out of the bottom of the one I used in my ear was just the bees wax from the candle.The pluses of this product - it smells awesome - maybe sandalwood or patchouli - but that 's about it . No ear wax removal .
 I 've had an ear blockage for a while now , and after reading he glowing reviews on this product I thought , what the heck , I 'll give it a shot . I burned one in my ear , the other by itself as a control.-Imagine my elation when I cut open the candle from my ear to find gobs of orange-brown wax inside . It worked ! - Imagine my despair after I cut open the control candle to find ... the exact same orange brown wax.-Imagine my anger when I realize I had been scammed.Don ' t trust the positive reviews folks , they are either shills for the company or have never performed a simple test to determine the legitimacy of the product .
 I 've used these for years and my supplier -LRB- a local health food store -RRB- went out of business and I could n't get them any more . I was so happy to finally find them again . I 've used many types over the 15 plus years I 've been candling ears and these , by far , are the best . THANK YOU for carrying them.I wrote the above review before I received them . Now that I have them and have used them I 'm disappointed . Apparently , somewhere along the line , they started using paraffin instead of the beeswax they had been using . They burned VERY fast so be careful .
 I never tried ear cones before . I thought I 'd give it a try . It did n't really work . My ear was still full of wax and when I tried to put out the fire as directed it slipped out of my hands and fought the carpet on fire . It left a huge burn Mark on the carpet . This product sucks ! I wo n't be trying it again .
 Love the wand , love it . Gets into tight spots , cleans well ... but the head - well , it wo n't stay put . The end is a different scrubber material and it wo n't stay bonded to the softer foam . We 've gone through abot 4 of the heads in the last month . Upside is that the heads are staying very clean , but it 's kinda expensive.I 've repaired one using high strength contact cement around the perimeter and it appears to be working well , but it 's only been a week . We 'll see ...
 We have had this wand for about 2 years now and it works great -- dispenses just the right amount of soap and can clean just about anything . PLEASE be aware that the scrubbing top replacement is very poor quality . The green scrubbing portion will almost always fall off within 1-3 weeks of normal use . I have glued them back on with Krazy Glue Gel several times , but they will fall off again and again . I am going to try the all blue replacement heads to see if the one piece construction will be better .
 The glue that holds the green to the blue is apparently not very good quality . The top always falls off prematurely . I would understand it if the sponge was actually getting old , but my last batch lost their tops within a week of being attached.Love the wand , it is perfect for my wine glasses . But get the solid blue tops without the green scrubbie .
 Do not buy this sponge refill . The green portion falls off after a few washes . Update
 Soap does n't dispense very consistently at all from the sponge . They are very hit or miss . One sponge might work perfectly , while the next sponge in the same package wo n't suds up at all . Will be trying something new when this pack runs out .
 The concept of these is great , but the actual design stinks . The green scouring part of the wand falls off easily and thus you have to replace the dispenser often . Plus , I found that the wand leaks soap too if you do n't have the tip screwed on crazy tight or lay it horizontally .
 They sure do n't last long , but I ca n't live without them . In an effort to not just purchase a new glass cleaning wand , I keep buying the refills even though they fall apart quickly . I noticed they started selling a wand that is all one piece , since it 's the top green part that always comes off .
 I bought this heating pad to ease the foot cramps I get . It is very slow to heat up and produces very little heat . The instructions for the pad have all kind of dire warning about burning yourself on the heat produced . The warnings make no sense to me since has never come close to too much heat . The problem is getting any heat at all . As I said in the title line , this is the worst pad I 've ever used .
 It stopped working , the switch light is on , but the pad is cold ... lame.Also , even when it did work , the switch part would get really hot . Scary!Sure it shuts off after 20 mins. , nice auto off feature , but I was afraid it would burst into flames ; pLame .
 works fine but not what i wanted ... they advertize as a soft heating pad ... there is nothing soft about it ... it 's like a hard piece of cardboard with some cloth around it .
 I had bought this heating pad previously for an elderly cat because it did not have automatic shut-off and it works wonderfully . I just bought another one for our sickly kitten and they have added an automatic shut-off valve that they do not mention in the product description ! I wanted a heating pad without automatic shut-off ! I can get a heating pad with an automatic shut-off anywhere !
 Bought two of these at CVS , both are worthless , pieces of shiiit ! Have another brand from the 70s w/o a timer - that still works - do not buhythis prodcut - zero support ! frikin losers !
 Disappointing - bought at local Target store for $ 13.99 yesterday . Highest heat setting is barely warm and also found it to be too rigid to target specific area -LRB- neck/shoulder in my case -RRB- .
 I just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one I had for years . I read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices , price being the primary concern . The saying you get what you paid for is true !! The heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap . Pay more and be happier .
 I am disappointed because the tag lied . They do automatically shut off . I bought these because the tag said that they do not automatically shut off . Liar liar liar
 First , I should note that it is likely that various configurations of this product are being sent out under the same product name , probably based on whatever is convenient for the manufacturer due to availability and cost of parts and material . Therefore , other customers may have received a different pad , and therefore had different experiences , than I did . As a side note , the product I received had no auto shut off ; as apparent from the reviews , some do and some do n't . A rather striking feature discrepancy is that my pad only had one heat level -LRB- just on or off -RRB- , despite having a three level switch controller and a product description to match . I dissected the pad due to the fact that it had burned out -LRB- more on that later -RRB- , and found that although the controller had the circuitry necessary for three levels , the pad itself did not . Two of the three wires going to the pad were simply connected together within the pad , and there was only one heating element . Given the design of the controller , for three heat levels , there would have to be two heating elements . This finding was consistent with an observation I had made months earlier when I plugged the product into a watt meter
 I bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they do n't have automatic shutoff , but now they do . I guess this is considered an improvement , but I bought them for an elderly cat , and she ca n't reset the control every hour . They are a good value if you do n't mind the auto shutoff .
 I bought a 12X15 inch Kaz SoftHeat unit in December 2007 . On 12/07/2008 the electrical cord unexpectedly broke at the junction of the cord and the blue stress reliever near the control unit , shorted out , and started sparking . Fortunately , I was n't shocked or burned . The unit saw almost daily use for a back condition but has not been abused . I 've contacted Kaz to request a refund . Frankly , I think that the construction of their SoftHeat products is shoddy and unsafe and I wo n't buy another one of their heating pads .
 I followed the other reviews that said that this heating pad got hot enough !!! What a joke ! This is not a heating pad ! It does n't even get warm ! I wasted my money!So please do n't waste yours !!!
 I read the item description , and was sure this pad was 14x24 inches . Imagine my surprise today , when finally getting it out , to find it was a dinky 12 `` x14 '' !!! That 's too small to be good for anything ! There is no foam padding between the heating coils and the cover , so that the only tolerable heat setting is low . The ` safety ' instructions are printed on the fabric cover for the heating pad -- both unattractive and unnecessary . Overall , this pad was a complete waste of money and I 'm sorry I did n't open it before the 30 day return period expired . That 'll teach me .
 The item you get is soo not worth the price . They were what they are advertised to be except that the amount you actually get is underwhelming to say the least .
 If you need consistent , dependable heat for an aching back this is NOT the heating pad for you . I have digenerative disc disease in my lower back & have quite abit of back pain . If I can use a heating pad at work or when I finally sit down at home in the evenings it reduces the amount of medicine I have to take.I bought this at Walmart for work because of the price -LRB- 11.99 -RRB- . I used it 2 days & returned it.It does heat up quickly & does have a nice , long cord.WHAT I DO N'T LIKE : - While it heats up quickly to the highest setting it does n't maintain the heat!I do n't know why . After only 20-30 minutes , you realize there is barely anyheat at all , like you turned it down to the low setting.-It 's small & rather stiff so it 's hard to place to be effective.-Auto shut-off . I prefer one that I can de-activate the auto shut-off . In conclusion , I 'll spend a little more and get one that meets my needs .
 You 'd think that the manufacturer would realize that heating pads , more so than most other appliances , may have to be used where there 's no wall outlet handy . But NO , this manufacturer has designed a heating pad that wo n't work properly with an extension cord . It comes on initially just fine , but once it goes into automatic shut-off mode , the on/off/set temp switch will not operate unless the pad is plugged directly into the wall . I 'm very glad I did n't spend more on a fancier model of this heating pad . Also , the CSR at Kaz claimed that this limitation is described in the owner 's manual . It is n't .
 This ugly blue polyester covered heat pad broke less than 48 hours after I bought it . I used it three times within my house . Nothing crazy . When it worked it was nice but what 's the point ? I think I 'm going to try a different manufacturer .
 Although there are 3 heat selections , low and medium and no different than high and high is too too hot . I could see serious injury to anyone who falls asleep on this . I do not recommend this product . I have only used this product dry . I do not now if it would be any better moist .
 This was my second purchase of these meal bars - I love them and they are very good . But this time I ordered a lot to hold me for a while . But the seller did not pack them right . I ordered 6 boxes of 12 each but instead of getting that I received on 1 box with 4 in it . The rest were loose in a box . Because of this and the fact that it is summer they were melted and all smashed . I wrote to the seller on 8/10 to complain about the packing but they never answered me . Next time I will find another seller .
 I searched and searched for a HEATING PAD ... w/o AUTO SHUT off ... Low and behold , I thought I had found it here . Well it has auto shut off ... wasted money as I now have to go back and search again ... I should have read other peoples reviews before buying
 The kaz heating pad I bought was smaller than this one , but it was lousy . It stopped working after 2 weeks . I would never buy anything from them .
 The advertizement said this was a 12 '' x 22 '' heating pad , but when it arrived , it was only 12 X 14 . $ 40.00 is too much for a small heating pad like this . In all fairness , I have not contactd the seller to see if they would make it right .
 Tried this about a week ago for the first time on a dingy bathtub . It worked OK on little rust stain around the bathtub fixtures but not perfectly . Seemed to do nothing for the overall grayness of the tub , though I used the whole tube in one swoop . -LRB- Ultimately , I solved the problem with some Zap ! restorer/cleaner . -RRB- One plus to the product is that it seems nontoxic and relatively mild . May be a fine product for other uses , but for my needs , it was , overall , a waste of money .
 BLUE STUFF DID NOT HAVE A BAD ODOR BUT ALSO DID NOT RELIEVE MY PAIN .
 I have had this battery for a little more than a year now and it has steadily progressed to holding very little charge.At first I thought it was just me not letting it charge . But yesterday after the charger verified it was fully charged the battery lasted less than 10 minutes . I was able to get about 12 images and I have the energy saver set for 2 minutes so no it was not because the camera was left on.I would highly recommend looking further for a different brand
 After 5 days of minimal use , this pad stopped working . Kaz replaced it . After 3 days of use , the pad stopped working again . Kaz replaced it again . After 7 days of use , the pad stopped working a third time , but this time Kaz VOIDED the warranty ! Then , they said I should get an electric blanket if I wanted to keep warm . I wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache !
 I bought this kaz heating pad from a local store . It worked for 2 weeks , then died . I figured I got a defective one , so the store exchanged it for another one . The second one gave out after one month . This product is a piece of garbage !! I would never buy another product from this company .
 I purchased this heating pad hoping it would be long lasting . . After about a month it is all but junk . It will not vibrate and the heat is to low to feel anymore . Plus with the way it was made the heat after a while shrinks the pad up into a ball of plastic that just makes it worse . Do not buy this item !
 Way too thick to lay on , awkward position for my back . It does n't get hot when the heat is on .
 Maybe my expectations were too high . This heating pad does not get hot enough ; not nearly as hot as others I 've used . The massage feature is not effective and is simply two speeds of vibration I bought this one because I was attracted to the thickness of the pad . I 've had problems with other heating pads bunching and folding up too much . If this one only got hotter it would be nice ; I do n't really care about the massage feature . My heating pad has n't broken yet as the other reviewer experienced . I 'm still using it for now .
 The product description is misleading . The massage part seemed to work , but it did not get very hot , only warm .
 Welp , you get what you pay for . I though people were over exaggerating about it not getting hot enough . Truth is my other heating pad 's low setting gets warmer than this one does on high . Of course the massaging is not all that great but that is the one thing I did expect . Where the power cord goes into the heating pad is already splitting and I 've had this product for less than a month .
 I bought this heating pad for my Mom . She noticed that it constantly shut off after several minutes . It is supposed to shut off after an hour for safety . The control started blinking and she noticed that the wire that attaches to the control was cracked in two , with bare wire exposed . The quality of this heating pad is inferior.I would NOT waste your money on this product .
 Bought this for starting seedlings and it is no good due to the auto shut off after 1 hour . Shipped from Amazon with free super savers shipping which was fast so no complaints for amazon , just this product .
 What I really wanted was theBodyMed ZZHP1427 14 '' X 27 '' Electrical Digital Moist Heating Padbut it simply was n't in the budget . I saw this SoftHeat pad at Walmart for $ 20 and decided to take a chance . I got home , checked here on Amazon , and realized I 'd bought the pad I had specifically not wanted based on the reviews . But I already had it in my hands and because of the reviews knew to pay attention to the controller getting hot . At first I made sure I never fell asleep with it on , just in case . I 've had it for a month now and I 'm actually quite pleased . I still wish for a pad that 's a good 6 inches longer AND wider but this is way better than what I 'd been using for years . I 've used it virtually every day to help with my fibromyalgia pain , often several times a day , and I jokingly call it my new best friend.I 've noticed the controller getting a bit warm at times but nothing outside of what I would expect . I 'm one who likes the 1-hour shut-off -- this works really well for me , especially because the pad heats up pretty quickly . The lowest setting is almost always warm enough for me and I 've never used more than the 2nd setting . -LRB- I do put it under my legs or behind my back so that helps it feel warmer than if it were laying on top of me . -RRB- It 's worked perfectly for me , served me very well in the month that I 've had it . I 'm so glad I `` accidentally '' bought it . I still would n't mind having the BodyMed pad but this one has been great and I 'm hoping it will last me a good long time.UPDATE 27 April 2012
 When this pad is fired up , there is a burst of high heat for a while before it settles down to whatever setting you 've put it on . Even if you only want low heat , you 're going to get a burst of higher heat for a while first . It is comfortable , but it did not last well , and I can not recommend it .
 I got this pad for Christmas and it has n't worked properly since day 1 . The problem is it just does n't get very hot and shuts off after 10 minutes . I am currently doing Chemo , so I need it for the aches and pains I get . I have another 3 year old pad from another company otherwise I would have returned it .
 This procut has Auto Shut Off . So if you do n't want this , do n't order . All other with Auto Shut off state this .
 I ignored the negative reviews because I had one of these heating pads for a couple of years before it quit working . This time it lasted about two weeks , a total waste of money . I wo n't make that mistake again .
 This heating pad will not last . Do yourself a favor and buy any other brand . This heating pad stopped working and I contacted the company because it offers a `` lifetime warranty '' . They asked me a bunch of questions on how I used the heating pad . Do you lay on it or did you lean against it ? Of course I did . If you do either of these two things with their heating pad , it will eliminate the warranty . This is a copy of their response
 I did a lot of research for heating pads because they are not cheap . I chose this one because of the features . It is long , soft , has a long cord , and offered several heat settings . The highest setting did not even get warm ! It blinks , and blinks , and blinks . I ended up trying three different heating pads , and found one with comparable features that I was seeking , and it gets hot ! Not warm ! Hot !! It is a Sunbeam Ultraheat , and that is what it is ! I have pain from my lower back to my calf so this covers a lot of the area , and it offers moist heat as well . This Softheat brand is exactly that . Soft heat as in no heat . I hope this review helps other consumers , and saves you time from having to return it . Good luck !
 If you have a problem with this product , Kaz will NOT respond to your requests for help , even if you are within the warrenty . They have a lousy customer service department . This heating pad would be wonderful if it worked . Mine quit 10 months into a 5year warrenty . I can not get any help from them so I 'm out over $ 30.00 and need to buy another heating pad ... it will NOT be a Kaz ! I too wanted to give it a zero rating but could n't .
 I really liked this heating pad . It replaced a 40-year-old heating pad that failed . Just over a year after I bought it , it failed . I am so disappointed in this product .
 I purchased one of these locally for my elderly mother because she has frequent leg pain caused by nerve damage from surgery . She often finds that heat from a heating pad is the only thing that will help alleviate the pain . Although I was not familiar with this brand , I bought it because I liked the large size which would cover a larger area of her leg than the Sunbeam heating pad that I was originally going to buy . When I hooked it up for her , the low temperature setting would n't work at all . So I returned it for a replacement -LRB- an identical brand & model -RRB- , thinking maybe I just got a rare defective pad . But , after 2 days , with only about 2 to 3 hours use each day , the low temperature setting would shut off by itself , and switch to the high temperature setting . Whether it was actually working at the high setting or not , I could n't say since the light kept flashing . Either way , I knew it was of no use to her , and possibly even dangerous . I would like to have had the larger pad for her , but I 'm going to take it back and buy her the Sunbeam , even if it is slightly smaller -LRB- I 've always been pleased with Sunbeam products -RRB- . In my opinion , this heating pad is junk .
 I have gone through 4 of these in the last year.the heating pad I used to have was a sunbeam and lasted over 12 years . I buy it because I need one for my pain quickly and the local store has it . I 'll wait and order a different one this time . They do n't stay on as long as they say they will and the stupid green light just blinks and blinks even after you unplug it and plug it back in , it does n't even take 10 minutes and its doing it again . Huge waste of money !! Would not recommend !!!
 I have used this all of five times and it already died . It makes me angry that I paid 25 dollars for it at Target and I only got five uses . The last heating pad I had was ten dollars and it lasted through daily use for THREE YEARS . If I could give this product less than a star , I would . I will not be buying from soft heat again .
 I wish I had read these reviews before buying this pad . I have had this pad 2 1/2 days . It seemed to work fine the first time I used it . The next time I turned it on and all times since it has heated inconsistently . Now it is shutting itself off after 5 - 20 minutes use , requiring me to unplug it each time to reset . Looks like I 'll be returning it tomorrow . -LRB- I had a similar Sunbeam pad that lasted for years with no problems . I decided to replace it when the cord insulation cracked . -RRB-
 I feel so stupid ! This product has all the features I want and I LOVE the way it 's made -LRB- soft cover ... easily washable -RRB- . EVEN THOUGH the one I already had only worked for three months I still decided on this one because I liked the design.Surgery was coming up so I ordered two ... one for upstairs and one for downstairs.This is when ready all the bad reviews and decided to take a chance despite what people were saying about their bad experiences with this product.When I received them , one did n't work right away . The other one quit working after less than two months.It 's a shame because I really like how this product is designed ... except for the fact that they do n't work.By the way , in all THREE cases above the problem was that it would n't heat at all , so I 'm not confused about the automatic cut off feature that , unfortunately , all heating pads seem to have these days . My three do n't heat at all , although the indicator light does come on.Like I said , I feel really stupid for not listening to previous reviewers .
 My heat pad caught electric fire . I 've had mine for about 5 months . I had it on my neck area and I kept hearing popping and sizzling . Then that burnt plastic smell . I got it unplugged and stopped the fire . Although I have a small burn mark on my neck . Never had a heat pad do that . What a bunch of junk !
 When this pad worked I liked it , but I 've had issues with it . My mom and I have the same pad , and we had the same problem . It seems like there is a short somewere in the wireing because the when I used it , it would switch on and off many times and the red light wold blink very rapidly . I always knew it would n't turn on if the red off light was blinking fast . I think this same short caused this very dangerous problme . I woke up today and turned my pad on and I smelled something scorched . I looked around and I was n't sure what it was . I left my room and came back , I layed back down and the smell got worse . I picked up the pad and where the chord met the first part of the clip , it sparked and a fairly good sized flame sprang up . I 'm so glad that I was in the room or my bed would have caught on fire . I was really shaken and upset because I would have been hurt and the heating pad was only a little over a year old . I would have expected that for what I paid for it it would have been safer .
 I ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover , instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once ... well , they do have a different cover , but the listing on Amazon did n't say that the pads SHUT-OFF after ONE HOUR . I am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself , and do n't need/want any auto shutoff . These two heating pads are going right back . I can get the regular heating pads that do n't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price .
 This is terrible and god awful . If you for some unknown reason want to get a nice quick heat up for about 10 minutes and then carry on with whatever it is you may be doing . Then please , buy this , because that is all you are going to get . This is actually quite funny , but the actual remote , is the only thing that stays heated the whole time and almost gets too hot to touch . It isnt even part of the pad !!! I 've already wasted my money on this and am well passed getting a refund , sadly , but I have used it enough times to say that this is pure garbage . I thought that maybe it had to be worn in or something , that maybe , its like a pair of new shoes . HA ! That was a joke and I was only kidding myself . I wish I had checked out other reviews before buying this , but at the time , I had no idea that not all heating pads are created equally and this is whats on the other end of the spectrum -LRB- the terrible side -RRB- ... Dont buy this .
 I was really happy with the design of the pad when I first purchased it . It had no sharp plastic corners to poke me and was big enough to cover my whole back . My pad lasted a little longer than the other reviewers ' pads ... several months . It quit working , so thinking there may be a bad fuse , I took the controller apart . Yep , a bad fuse . Only problem ? It 's saudered directly to the board . I ca n't just pop it out and replace it . Based on this and the other reviews , I definitely will not buy another SoftHeat heating pad .
 From the beginning it felt like it was getting hotter than it should , even on the lowest setting . The controller would get hot , too . We should have stopped using it and taken it back , but we did n't . About the 2nd or 3rd day of use , it actually got so hot it melted itself , the pillow cases , pillows , blankets , sheets , mattress cover and part of the mattress before my girlfriend could get it unplugged . Thank God all those items are made of flame-retardant materials . The house could have burned down and she could have been hurt or killed .
 This is a good heat pad if you do n't like a lot of heat . The highest setting feels like warm and when I put it on warm setting I ca n't even tell it is on . The only thing good about it is that it 's quilted and you can machine wash it , but there are other quilted brands that give off more heat than this piece of junk .
 My first impression of this heating pad was , `` GREAT ! '' It is large enough to wrap around a sore shoulder and well down the back , it has nice controls and four heat settings , and turns off after an hour or so -LRB- for safety -RRB- . Unfortunately , it was only 3 weeks before it stopped working . I exchanged it for another unit -LRB- thought maybe it was a fluke -RRB- . The replacement lasted about two months of almost daily use , then died . It appears that the controller simply burns out . I would not recommend this heating pad .
 I had the exact same experience as Stan , another reviewer . I bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off , I could not get it started again . Like Stan , I thought it was a fluke and bought another . Same problem , two days after buying the pad . I have looked in four stores in the Seattle area and can not find another brand of heating pad . This one should not be on the market . I am sending both pads back to the manufacturer .
 Boy I wish I had read the customer reviews before buying this pad ... The auto off feature totally sucks , it should be a selectable feature not default . I was under the impression after reading the description that the auto off feature was only on the pro models and the one i bought didnt say anything about being a promodel ... I love the size , too bad it dosnt work ...
 I 've had two of these , the identical model . I had the same problem with both , after only a few weeks or months the control panel started blinking red and refused to go to a setting . I followed the directions on their site , to unplug it and plug it back in after 10 minutes , but it did nothing.I contacted Kaz and they told me I can pay to ship the pad back for a replacement . I 've decided to save my money , why would I want to pay even more money for another faulty heating pad ? They also mentioned it was probably due to leaving it plugged in , which I never did.I 'd encourage anyone having problems to please let them know , there 's obviously something wrong with this product . Let 's try to save other people the hassle and money ... -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I have bought 5 of these crappy pads and all 5 stopped working after a short period . Buy the Sunbeam 902 Flexible heating pad -- much more reliable and useful too !
 I purchased this heating pad in November , it is now January and the product no longer works . Do n't waste your money on this .
 I purchased the Kaz Ultra King Size Heating Pad off eBay to replace another Kaz heating pad that stopped working after 2-3 months . Well , this is no different except I now have more expensive heating pad that is useless . Just like the other reviewers , my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process . I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time . I also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds , sometimes two or three at once . Nothing worked . Its was nice while it lasted -- heated well without getting too hot . It is just a shame that the quality could not last for more than two months . Thumbs down!DO NOT PURCHASE A KAZ SOFTHEAT HEATING PAD IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY .
 This pad works , basically , but it does turn itself after 30 minutes . There 's no way to prevent that . This may be fine for some uses , but it 's very inconvenient for others .
 Seriously , this is a wonderful invention . The pad is indeed soft , very flexible , the velcro is super-strength and it gets more than hot enough . Mine lasted about three months and that was not daily use . I 'd love another but have to consider the inevitable problem of them just burning out one day even with careful use .
 Shortly after getting it , the lowest setting started getting hotter and hotter . The cover is thin & barely comes to the end of the unit . There 's only one snap holding it on & the slightest movement causes it to come undone . The moist heat insert is too small to be of any use , as are the tie strings that are supposed to make it so you can wrap it around a body part . Maybe worst of all , the edges of unit where the cord is attached always ends up sticking out of the cover & is quite sharp & scratchy when it comes in contact w/the skin.Mine lasted 10 months before it died.When I called to find out how to get a replacement , I was told I would have to pay -LSB- postage -RSB- to return , even tho I still had my receipt . Because of its size , the most economical way to return would have been via medium flat rate which is $ 11 + . Did n't seem worth it to me . I talked to a supervisor who said they would , as a courtesy , send a call tag , but they do n't usually do that . I was n't impressed w/their customer service at all.Just be aware that if you want to replace under warranty , you will most likely have to pay to return .
 I had another of these or rather similar that lasted forever but this one has ridges in it and it has the tendency to roll up under my neck . The snap that hols it in the flannel cover will not stay snapped . It just is not near the quality as the old one .
 It worked once . The next time I tried it , nothing . I 've paid for a flashing indicator light and a worthless heating pad . What a waste of money .
 I bought this model from Walmart and went online to find a replacement . I turned it on for one heating period . It started to warm up , never really got hot or warm really . I unplugged it so that I could leave the house . I came back in about an hour later , plugged the device back in , now it 's just flashing green on the highest setting . So I unplugged it for an hour and plugged it back in , still flashing . Plugged it in for an hour , pressed a few buttons . It 's still flashing with no heat.This device lasted , with heat , about 10 minutes . This is terrible , horrible , and possibly the worst device I have purchased , period . I am disappointed and will guarantee that I will never buy another Softheat device again . I should take the thing back , but that 's too good for it . I will just cut the power cable and trash it so that Walmart does n't box back up the device and sells it to some other poor sap.Don ' t try to search online for help . There are numerous reports of this model failing withing hours to days . Add mine in and now it minutes to days . I may contact Softheat -LRB- Kaz Inc. -RRB- and let them know how disgusted I am.Doesn ' t even deserve one star IMHO
 I JUST bought this pad yesterday and it has n't heated up even once for me ... The light just started blinking immediately so I unplugged it and waited 30 minutes like I 've read I should do and still nothing . It 's getting returned ASAP . Lifetime warranty is definitely getting used .
 Picked this up today , spent the extra money on the deluxe ... good size , soft , but nowhere close to enough heat . It barely gets warm & that 's on the highest of 4 settings . Taking it back tomorrow & will try a different brand . Read several reviews on SoftHeat heating pads ... many similar complaints about lack of heat . I have used Sunbeam in the past , & heat seems to be good , but they only last a few years , then do n't heat up very much .
 i liked this heating pad ... until the blinking light came on . i sometimes use a heating pad all evening . why should i have to turn it back on every 15 minutes ? very annoying . mine heats well , but wo n't stay on . A mistake i wo n't make again .
 I purchased this heating pad over others because of the reviews that said it heated up quickly and occassionaly got so hot people could n't use it on the highest setting . I 'm not sure if I just got a defective one or what ... but mine barely gets warm , and far from `` hot '' . I have had a lot of heating pads because I use them so frequently that they do n't last long and this one has been the worst one yet . I sent Amazon a message about the picture of the controller above is from a Kaz pad and not this SoftHeat one . They are similar , but not the exact same -LRB- not a big deal really tho because they are so similar -RRB- . Mine also does n't have the ties on the side of the pad -LRB- that is n't a big deal to me tho because I actually prefer it without the ties -RRB- . I will say it does have a long cord and a soft cover ... but only one side of it is fleece and the other is the thinner material most heating pad covers have . So , while it does have a long cord and soft cover on one side ... I did n't purchase it for those reasons ... I purchased it to get hot and it has failed so mine is being returned .
 I do n't have anything to say about how hot this thing would get because I took mine out of the box , plugged it in , and the green light would start flashing . I did check the instructions and trouble shooting , and I will say this is the first time I 've had to read the owners manual for a heating pad . Anyhow , there was nothing in there about that symptom ; I could not use the control to turn the thing off , and it never got hot . Bummer , now my neck still hurts . Guess it 's another night of Icy Hot .
 This costs twice as much as the most popular brand and barely gets hot at all . I returned it after trying to use it for a day . I had to take the cover off to get any effect at all , and even then I could hold my hands flat on it and they get just slightly hot .
 I love the size of this pad . The ties are especially useful for keeping it on at work . However its programmed to turn OFF after 20 minutes . I am here today shopping for one to replace this .
 Avoid the busted SoftHeat sunbeams at all cost ! I use heating pads every day for chronic pain and this one seemed like it was going to work nicely for me . I can get over the annoying variable auto-shutoff features -LRB- sometimes an hour sometimes a few minutes -RRB- and just keep switching it back on but now it 's only doing the flashing lights and wo n't even attempt to turn on or heat up . I have battled it for four days now , it has been ` reset ' -LRB- unplugged for 30 minutes - per Sunbeam customer service -RRB- many times already and each time I plug it back into the power source the controller lights start flashing almost instantly and it wo n't turn on . I know you can not plug it in to the ac power before connecting the plug to the pad , so I know that 's not the problem . Basically they are using some sort of electrical controller sensor software and it fries out quickly and can not be fully reset -LRB- I even left it unplugged for 24 hours and it did n't help -RRB- . Why does n't anyone still make the durable always-on ones that we all grew up with and lasted through years of abuse ?
 Used 1 day when the light starting blinking and it stopped heating . The sunbeam company is just as worthless when I called KAZ the number on the pad they said well if you pay to mail it to us we will send you a new one ... Why should I pay them anymore for an item that is junk to get more junk ????
 I 've taken glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate for many years . Doctors publications -LRB- See the Arthritis Cure and Dr. Grant Cooper 's Arthritis Handbook -RRB- say THIS is helpful for arthritis . I 've had trouble getting it in recent years . First the Rite Aid product Pharmassure dropped it -LRB- replacing it with chloride -RRB- then Dr. Weil stopped offering it . The Twinlab product appeared to be a good substitute , but this summer I 've recieved two bottles of what I regard as a defective product
 It gets takes about 10 minutes to get medium warm even when it is set at the highest temperature setting . It never gets hot . I think that it has some sort of timer limitation because it seems to cool off after 20 minutes or so even if I leave it at the highest temperature setting .
 I bought a 12x15 inch Kaz SoftHeat heating pad in December 2007 . On 12/07/2008 the electrical cord unexpectedly broke at the junction of the cord and the blue stress reliever , shorted out , and began sparking . Fortunately , I was not shocked or burned . The pad had seen daily use due to a back condition , but it was not abused . I have contacted Kaz for a refund . The materials used in the pad appear to be inferior and I wo n't buy any more of their products .
 I had this item for about 6 months , using it for a stiff back and shoulders . The automatic shut off failed -LRB- or something else went wrong -RRB- and the electrical housing started to melt . Fortunately I was next to it and smelled the wires burning and was able to unplug it . By this time the heating pad and switch were too hot to touch . It really freaks me out knowing this thing could have burned down my house if I hadnt been paying attention . BUYER BEWARE !
 I bought this heating pad for my neck and shoulders , and it is terrible . It is so stiff that it wo n't wrap around my neck and shoulders . It 's like trying to wrap a piece of cardboard around you . I thought that with the ties , it would be ok , but it 's not . Do n't buy this if you need it to form to your body .
 The auto shut-off feature is ridiculous . I try to `` pre-heat '' the heating pad so that it will be ready in a few minutes but by the time I go to use it , it has already shut off . In addition , if I am using the damn thing , it shuts off way too soon for my tastes . Maybe I simply missed the `` feature '' but it 's awful and should be made FAR MORE CLEAR . I 'll have to buy another heating pad cause this is useless . But it wo n't be a `` SoftHeat '' .
 I bought this after giving my older model to a family member ... and I 'm not impressed because it does n't get as hot as my older model did and as a result does n't provide me the relief that I need . I like the simple , and easy to use design but I am probably going to end up returning it because it does n't get half as warm as my older model , even on the highest setting .
 The write-up on this SoftHeat Plus heating pad makes no mention of a `` New '' feature that automatically shuts the pad off after 1 hour . I specifically wanted one that did NOT have an auto-shutoff timer . Damn!Back it goes .
 Bought this product at a store . It did not work and the store will not take it back . This is a horrible product avoid at all cost !
 Although this heating pad is not inexpensive , it is very cheaply made . I have a lower back problem and wanted to use it while I sat on my couch . However , regardless of what I did , the heating pad unit inside the cover bent over on itself in the middle on the long side so that I ended up having a heating pad only about 6 inches wide . In addition , one whole end looks like it was wadded up into a ball and it will not flatten out at all making that end useless . The resulting heating pad is 6 inches by about 14 inches . I hesitate to use the parts that I ca n't flatten because I am not sure from a safety perspective that the heating elements should be squashed together as they are . I have tried everything to get the heating pad to lay flat and contour around the sides of my back and nothing works . Although I have had it for only a few months , this heating pad is worthless .
 I guess it 's a safety feature to prevent people from burning themselves but this heating pad just gets mildly warm . It 's a waste of money and the instructions says do not return to store . I will definately not recommend this product .
 I purchased the product , used it for 2 days and it has not worked since . The compnay has yet to respond to my request for return , and Amazon excepts no liabilty . Needless to say I wasted money .
 I ca n't believe no one is complaining about the powerful plastic smell it give off when cold , I ca n't imagine how bad it is when you heat the plastic up . When you breathe plastic fumes it gets directly in your blood.I can image this wrapped around my neck with my nose so close by.The plastic cover is stiff and will not bend to your body contours . Do not buy this get a softer non plastic one .
 Do n't buy this garbage , it barely gets warm even on the highest setting ! It was a total waste of money and I do n't wish this piece of garbage upon no one else . It warms up -LRB- barely -RRB- then turns itself off . So I got NO relief from my knee pain from this item . Amazon is great I 'm sending it back for a full refund . I will buy this item somewhere else . And this item is n't real cheap as it should be since it is defective !
 Have tried this product and so far I am not impressed . This is not a product that is supposed to be used on tool rests or power equipment tables as a previous reviewer suggested and actually many tradesmen have used floor paste wax for that with excellent results . This product is supposed to be used directly on the tool for cutting metal ; whether that is steel , stainless steel , aluminum , etc. . It worked okay but you really do have to apply after every cut , regardless of the process . No lubricant works best for all applications and materials , but in comparison Cut-Ease Stick Lubricant generally performs better .
 After purchase of this product I found the temperature to be inaccurate -LRB- 97 degrees to start and then got lower and lower over a week to 93 degrees -RRB- . Not acceptable ! The product was returned for a refund .
 I tried several times to use this thermometer , using the instructions each time . The temperature reading was consistently low by about three degrees F. I 've been tracking my basal body temperature for over a year , so I know what my temp should be ... . and it 's certainly not in the 95 degree range !
 I gave up on this after trying it a few times - as some of the other reviews mention , it consistently reads a low temperature . And do n't use it without the covers , the taste is awful in your mouth .
 Constantly gives an inconsistent temperature reading ! Do n't waste your money . Buy one that reads slower and you 'll find its worth waiting a few more seconds !
 I do n't know how accurately it measures temperatures , since I was only using it to check for fevers . However , I can say that this thing fell apart -- the back kept coming loose . I would n't buy one again .
 I was misled by pictured item !!! I was expecting two bottles of cologne with the spray head -LRB- better item -RRB- but instead received two bottles of the cheaper eu du toilet without the spray head -LRB- must cheaper item -RRB- Was disappointed !!!!!
 This product is one of the worse I 've ever purchased . It does not work nor does what its suppose to , actually it does nothing . If you 're considering buying this product do not waist your money.Thx ; Jose
 ASP for Men -LRB- Amazon -RRB- There is little to review ; there are no apparent side effects ; there is no effect as advertised . -LRB- dose doubling has no effect ; daily use has no effect
 No effect at all . I bought another product that does work . Do n't waste your money on ASP . I used the entire bottle as it states for a month with no sign of any results .
 The product did nothing as advertised . ED ca n't suddenly be cured by a handful of herbal products . Put your money into diet and excerise or save it up for Viagra
 Save your money . This item is worthless . Do not believe the reviews . It did not work at all . SAVE YOUR MONEY .
 I used this product for six weeks , taking the recommended daily dosage with no effect at all . Orexis is better .
 Do n't be suckered into buying ASP , it does not work and your just throwing your money away . Do not know a substitute for this but maybe you 'd be better off seeking help from a doctor . I threw mine away - adios dollars .
 Simply put its a money scam like all the rest . Kept me awake all night , my pulse was over 120 . Save your time and money and go fishing .
 Smelled great , but the lather was disappointing . Not very slick , no matter how I mixed it , whipped it or otherwise fiddled with the ratio of soap to water .
 The scent is close to pine-sol and very medicinal in nature . Was never able to really get past it . Lather was slightly better than a modern Williams puck but nothing exceptional . Hoping for more of a pine tar smell .
 The shipper sent the crutches as promised but they are very uncomfortable under my arms . The arm padding is very hard and not comfortable at all . I went back to using my old crutches which have a soft plush padding . ''
 Although I 've never used this particular brand of aluminum crutches , the outdated A-frame design is a thing of the past . The last few years have brought monumental changes to the design of underarm crutches . I recommend Mobilegs ergonomic crutches , or similar products like Millennial Medical crutches . Speaking from personal experience .
 According to the item 's description , I expected to receive the `` professional strength '' version of this product . What I did get was the standard formulation . I thought the price was exceptionally low , and now I know why .
 I was very disappointed to know that WaterPik no longer carries this accessory for their older models . So I was happy to find I could still buy them from Goodman 's . I received my order today and found the whole package looked torn . The plastic cover barely attached to the back paper and was easily lifted open . The package was actually the least of the problem . After I took each tip out I found every one of them looked used . The plastic tube parts were supposed to be clear and clean but they were neither clear nor clean . I can not believe they would sell used hygiene product to customers but the scratches in tubes were in such big areas and they look so bad that the last tip I threw away looked much more clear and clean than the ones I just received from them.It is too bad that I have to throw away my still working wp-20w WaterPik now that I ran out of replacement tips . I wish WaterPik will be willing to carry their accessories longer , otherwise what good can it be if the machine is good but there are no tips to use .
 The product is cheaply made . Out of the four tips , two did not have leaks between the colored section and the clear section . The remaining two were not bent at the proper angle for easy use . The angle of the tip should be atleast a 75 degree bend .
 I bought this 4 tips for my old waterpik model . What a waste of time and money!My old tip was broken after my son bent it.Unable to get one new tip at Wal-mart I found at the amazon web place this seller . When I received them , I tried the first one tip -LRB- The kit comes with 4 tips -RRB- ... what a deception , it leaked at the junction of the clear tip with the colored round connector , and tried the other 3 ... same problem , a bad seal at the junction . I fixed them with some crazy glue , and at this time -LRB- 3 weeks later -RRB- the fixed tip is doing its job ... those are generic tips , maybe a copy from the Chinese factory copiers ... but those leave a lot to desire.Since those are the only ones for replacement , it 's up to you to fix them in order to use your old waterpik .
 This has to be a product featuring the rejects . There is absolutely no quality control on this product . I purchased 2 packs and they all leak . Not usable at all . very disappointing because I like my waterpik and it still works great but now I 'm down to my last original tip .
 The clear tip separates from the colored part on these replacement tips . All four of them have broken . They are a Poorly made product .
 These tips are very poorly made and often fail on the first use.Instead , buyWaterPik hose repair kit with handle . . andReplacement BRJ jet tips , fits WaterPik . . The replacement kit works great and you can use the new tips.The only , small , problem is that the new handle does not storeon the base of my WP-35 , but I can live with that .
 There were 4 replacement tips for the Teledyne Water Pik . Within 4 days of receiving the order , 3 0f 4 separated at the base-tube connection -- the 4th within a week . Goodman 's kindly sent me another 4-tip packet . The first one used broke in similar fashion , the one I 'm using now is going on its second week without incident . With the original purchase , those tips lasted 7-8 years without problem . Must be Chinese innovation .
 I received this item and 3 of the 4 piks came apart on the first use . I requested a replacement and it was shipped to me immediately and with no hassle . I havent opened the replacement shipment yet.Water piks for me are the best way to keep gums and teeth healthy along with brushing .
 Arrived in bubble envelope and I was forced to return it because it was crushed and the foil was as bad as one I needed replaced . Refund was quick but my face paid the price in nics and scratches because I had to use a damaged shaver for another week .
 First off , the foil came quickly and at a good price - but the moment I started shaving with it , I noticed that it hurt a bit ... the foil itself seemed thiner . Then after a few shaves , the part started to fall apart . I ca n't use it now .
 Item broke after two weeks of use . It fits the Braun razor , but does not have the quality .
 This product took a long time to arrive ... unfortunately the baby is taking even longer and the pills are n't helping .
 well , i was told that this product was supposed to help enlarge your breasts , but apparently it does n't . at least for me , it did n't work . nothing against the seller . the shipping was quick and everything arrived as i was told it would . the product just did n't do what i thought it would is all .
 ... because the inner bark is not the part of the plant with the health benefits ! It 's only the ROOT that has medicinal properties significant enough to be actually have an effect on a human body . And the companies know this , but of course they can get the inner bark for much cheaper and then market it to people who do n't know any better . Very unethical.Also , heed the alcohol content . Anything more than around 10 % is excessive , serving no purpose other than diluting the product and creating a repulsive `` chemical '' taste .
 This product might work for some folks , but did n't work for my fianc&eacute;e . Again , maybe it works for some , but it 's a very very simple pill , and did n't provide any relief .
 I purchased this thinking I was ordering Organic Cologne as stated ! Well the only thing organic is the alcohol ! Big deal ! The rest is `` fragrance '' Not Organic fragrance . If its ' not Organic than what is it ? Chemical most likely or they would proudly state what the heck their lovely fragrance is . Nothing listed about essential oils or flower waters . Printed Directly on the box the cologne came in says
 I use and enjoy the HC Dusk soap , deodorant , and aftershave balm , so I thought I 'd buy the same fragrance as a cologne . It does NOT smell at all like the other Dusk products . This smells like the cheap , awful colognes my aunts used to buy me when I was 12 . It reeks and one spray made my room smell like rubbing alcohol for hours.I 'm concerned that I got a spoiled/bad batch or something , seeing as I really like everything else in the fragrance/brand .
 For the customers who are interested in knowing if this product is truly organic it is NOT . I recently visited WholeFoods market in search of a natural cologne . I came across this cologne and immediately disliked the smell . However , for the sake of inquiry I ask the cosmetics employee whether the product truly contained the listed ingredients and no synthetic derivatives of fragrance . She replied with , `` I honestly do n't know , but I will look into this question on your behalf . '' A few days later I received an email from this proactive employee with the following statement from a representative of the Company who promotes the cologne : `` In your email you asked if our cologne carries synthetic ingredients . The Essential Oils EO -LRB- s -RRB- listed on the side of the product carton are just a few of the MANY EO -LRB- s -RRB- in this fragrance . Since the fragrance is NOT 100 % organic we ca n't guarantee there are NO synthetics since some EO -LRB- s -RRB- are derived through synthetic processes . We hope this helps clarify the issue . Feel free to contact us with any other questions . `` Customers who wish to inquire further regarding this product or others can contact the company at the following email address
 I ordered this because my 80 year old dad wanted an eye chart to do eye exercises . I figured an `` illuminated '' one would be best . This is just the plastic face that slides in to a light box that you must already have ! Needless to say . . I do n't have one ! I was very disappointed .
 This product only contains 10mg aloe . The full ingredients should be listed on product description .
 I only used this product once and gave it away . I was nauseous for hours . Make sure you have taken this before you order .
 After seeing high reviews thought this would be a great product , however , it gives me a strong bo smell its so gross !!! Yuck I 'll pass on this on next time .
 Talk about price gouging ... I too bought Sportpharma Whey Protein for $ 20 from Amazon . This is the best protein powder by far but not at triple the price . SHAME ON YOU AMAZON !
 Quite a shock to see the price jump up from just under $ 20 all the way to $ 28.92 . Quess they 've figured out how to get around that `` free '' shipping . Not very nice .
 I purchased this exact product on Amazon as late as October of 2006 for $ 19.87 each -- and that was with super-saver . If you were me , would you now pay the current price -LRB- nearly double -RRB- without the super-saver -- when equal and better name brands -LRB- eg. , Twinlabs -RRB- are available for far less?Nor can the price be justified on the basis of quality , although I was pleased at the original price . I did n't find this product listed with the other whey products -- maybe they would sell more if it was -LRB- and quit jacking up the price unrealistically -RRB- .
 If you like to just mix up protein powder in water and drink it straight up , I would n't go near this stuff . Not too tasty . However , if you 're looking for something inexpensive to mix into a smoothie , this might not be too objectionable . Personally , I take my protein powder with water or milk , and I wound up giving this stuff away to a friend who makes elaborate breakfast smoothies .
 Had I written this review a year ago , I would have given it five stars . But in the last year , Oxo has changed the composition of the sponge , probably to save manufacturing cost , and in doing so they have made it useless . These new replacement sponges do not absorb water nor pick up dirt as well as the previous versions . I live on the desert and wet mop tile floors after vacuuming . It does n't matter how good the vacuum cleaner is , there was always plenty of grit to mop up . This new replacement sponge does not pick it up . Just moves it around I guess . My only alternative now is to buy another brand mop and hope it performs as well as the Oxo used to do .
 I bought the rollermop , with it 's original blue sponge - and one replacement sponge at the same time from bed bath beyond - the sponges LOOKED identical . The first sponge served well enough . Upon use of the replacement , I found it did not fit the mop - the rollers extended past the sponge on one side when squeezing dry , so it was continually slipping off the handle . Also , within about 30 uses on a fairly clean floor -LRB- no big challenges -RRB- , using murphy 's oil soap - no chemical challenges - the sponge simply tore off the metal bracket . I 'm going to try to return the roller mop itself , as it has no value without replacement sponges . I 'll go to a janitorial supply store for my next mop ; I find consumer products have been ` value engineered ' until all the value is GONE .
 The sponge refill is useless , I ordered the blue ones , and it came the yellow with blue strips . Poor quality , and leave my floor very wet .
 This product will not stay in place no matter what ! Slides right down the leg . I tried several ways of keeping it in place . Save your money .
 I actually liked this mop . I did n't think it was too heavy or had any problems with the mop head like the previous reviewer . However , the part in the middle of the mop that you lift up on to squeeze out the water from the mop head broke within 4 months of use -LRB- and this was infrequent use at that -RRB- . We fixed it ourselves , but do not know how long our fix will hold up . I am very disappointed in this OXO product .
 I am a great fan of OXO products , but this one 's a bummer . It does n't squeeze the water out well so your floors are left more wet than they should be . But the real problem is the mop head . Despite being secured properly , it falls of easily and regularly . I 've just given up at this point ... it fell of 5 different times while mopping my small kitchen . It 's too frustrating and wastes too much time to keep having to slide the mop head back in . I expect more from OXO , especially since my cheapie mop had no issues with the mop head falling off .
 This mop is a big pain . It is too heavy , you ca n't squeeze out enough water , and the mop head falls off easily .
 I bought this mop and returned it after its first use . The mop head popped off multiple times in the midst of mopping after securing it properly . The engineer in the house interjected a second opinion said it did n't look very functional either . Thank you , Bed , Bath and Beyond for making the return painless .
 Ever want to sweep sideways to deal with the utterly rare situation in which a wall meets a floor ? No dice for this sucker . Then good luck getting the head back on . You will feel like a surgeon trying to operate on yourself . Place that lever thing just right , as you hold it !!! Then it falls off again .
 Worked well the one time it worked . Broken I guess . Mop head wo n't stay on . Ca n't return it because I bought it in another city . Why ca n't they design mops that do n't break ? I have been through so many mops and they all break . It 's not rocket science . I am completely flabbergasted with the mop industry .
 Bought the Oxo roller mop because I thought it would be a great mop ... WRONG !!! First minute of using it , the sponge head popped off . It does n't secure so every time you use , the sponge falls off . More of a chore to use than mopping floors .
 I bought this mop at 9:00 a.m. and returned it at 10:00 . All of the other reviewers who complained about the mop head constantly falling off are so right . After the head falling off five times in a half hour , I went back to the store for a refund . Horrible product and frankly I believe they knew this was a faulty product .
 The head keeps falling off , the sponge does n't stay in place which makes it close to impossible to squeeze most of the water off . I am so disappointed , I used to love OXO products and designs .
 We have had this mop for about a month , using it to clean up our tiled kitchen floor . I wish we had returned it immediately.Pros : - Lightweight-Handle for squeezing water is good-sized and easy to useCons : - Sponge does not stay in the mop , sometimes falling completely out but usually just sliding from side to side , meaning you ca n't put much force into mopping-Sponge does n't wring out completely before you start mopping , leaving tons of water everywhere-Confusingly , given the previous point , the sponge wo n't absorb that extra water back up so we are left with huge puddles that have to air dry.-The sponge is held onto the mop with a little metal strip at the top that provides little support , so the big sponge just flops around loosely , making it impossible to scrub difficult dirt spots.This is far and away the worst mop I have ever used . Save yourself some trouble and some money and buy the cheapest off-brand mop at the big box store and you 'll be more happy .
 The mop head does not stay on and it does not strain enough of the water out . It 's a waste of money . My cheap $ 5.00 mop from the dollar store works better than this one .
 I registered for and received this mop as a wedding gift three years ago . Oxo is known to be a good brand , so I had high expectations for this mop . From the very first use it has been frustrating and sub-par . It has never scrubbed the floor very well -- I have to bend down and scrub up most spots by hand . As I 've used it more , the rollers that hold the head in place have gotten loose , allowing the sponge to slide back and forth on the head . And it does not squeeze enough water out of the sponges -- I can squeeze till no more water comes out , but I still get a puddle of water on the floor.If I just wanted to do a light surface cleaning of my kitchen floor , this would be fine . But for that dried-on grime , it 's useless . Thankfully , my other Oxo products have performed much better !
 I love OXO products in the kitchen so I figured the mop would be wonderful . Wrong . The head falls off , a lot ! If you try to do anything but a straight forward , backward motion , forget it , you will be holding the nice ergonomic handle and the wet dirty head will be on the floor , which you will then get covered with dirty water while trying to figure out how to put it back on over and over . And if the head is not falling off , its getting caught up in the rollers , so that the rollers on the operators side are hitting the floor instead of the head scrubbing it . Forget trying to get all the water out to do that last clean swipe . Its not gon na happen with this mop . I wonder how long BB&B 's satisfaction guar is ? I am not happy to spend $ 25 on this which got both me and the floor dirtier !
 The mop started popping out the housing on the first use . After a few uses , the handle came apart and I can not pull the lever to rinse out the mop . Save your money !!!
 I bought this mop after it was recommended on Real Simple magazine . The mop does everything they say it does - but it does n't last . A plastic part is broken near the head of my mop , so I can no longer use the squeeze function - I have to lean over and squeeez the sponge out with my hands . The head also falls off quite easily because of this broken part.Next time I am buying a mop that is mostly made of metal . Presumably this will last longer .
 I paid $ 29.99 for this mop and it arrived with NO MOP HEAD . The picture clearly shows a mop head on the handle and I never would have bought it had I known it was only the handle I was buying . I find this very misleading and I am not returning it because it came in a box the size of a small car !! How ridiculous . I am NOT a happy customer !
 After about 1 month of use , this brush was too worn down to be useful . Nothing great about this one , but its best feature is probably the shape .
 These are my go-to cough drops , and they 're great ! I love the taste -- not lemony or medicine-y or anything . But last month , these were under 20 bucks . Now they 're double that , and cost even more per bag than they do at the grocery store ! I do n't know why the price suddenly doubled , but I wo n't be buying these online until it goes back to being a decent deal .
 Did n't clean very well . Like that it was biodegradable but if it does n't work who cares . Wish someone made a safe product that really does the job
 Did n't work on our tile counters . The grout is still dirty . In fact , we had a lot of film substance after we tried to clean them.I had to scrub to get off the cleaner product because it made the tile even worse . I 'll have to try something else .
 We just bought house , not a brand new one . So i got this product in the hopes that it will at least make a slight difference on the grout in the bathroom . Any improvement is welcome . I only did half of my bathroom to start with . After using this product , it seems the grout is now slightly darker than before i applied this product . No kidding right ? My husband thought i applied this product on the side i did n't do . Would like a refund but i was not able to use the product right after i bought it since we were busy with the move . So if you decide to buy it and find out it does not work , return it right away . The seller wo n't accept after 30 days .
 For light stains , you really do n't need anything , just brush would do the work . I was hoping this product would make cleaning tough stains a little bit easier , but pretty ineffective , still have to brush hard over and over to get the tough stains off . So I do n't know what this product is really useful for .
 Did not work well for the grout on my shower tile ! Sprayed the tile and scrubbed but did not remove as expected .
 This product was VERY expensive . For the price that I paid , I expected it to work ! Save your money ! Clorox does a much better job than this stuff .
 Not worth the money . Wore 2 scrub brushes out , even then it only did a half way job . Awesume from the Dollar Store does a better job . Better yet `` Zep '' from Menards does n't require all the scrubbing and does a MUCH BETTER job .
 this product did nothing to remove grout stains ... i followed the directions to a T and after several applications the grout was no cleaner than before i started ... soap and water are 100 times more effective ... what a waste of money
 I had high hopes for this product , due to the dual nature of cleaning and sealing . I used a grout brush and tried this product in few areas , spraying a scrubbing . It was literally as effective as using water.Vinegar works so much better , my advice would be to use vinegar and buy a good sealer after you 're done cleaning the grout .
 Used on bathroom grout in the bathroom . Really did fine on some grout and not so good on badly stained grout . Will have to remove grout to get it the way that it should look . Think it would do fine if you scrubbed every year but it is not a product for me .
 I purchased this based on the positive reviews . I used the Hoover grout cleaner prior to this which also did n't work . I had great hopes for this . It did the job better than the Hoover brand which did almost nothing . I tried everything ; letting it soak in well ; scrubbing with grout brush , etc. - nothing . I so wish it had . Had to buy grout paint and redo grouting but it now looks great .
 Socks are very comfortable and they definitely do their job.But the quality is questionable . The seams at the heels started falling apart just after few time I wore them . For that price I would expect much more durability.Next time I will try another brand .
 they did not hold up to one days wear , They are too thin and go a hole the first day .
 I found these to be extremely tight and about one inch too long to be comfortable on my legs . They appear to be well made , but I 'm not at all sure I 'll be able to use them on a regular basis . I understood from the description that they would be ` light compression ' but discovered them to be quite the opposite . -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 11 '' and weight less then 190 # -RRB- . Rubber gloves will be necessary to help put them on.Good luck .
 My first item of contention was the long time it took for delivery of package . Ordered online 08-02-2010 , Did not receive package until 08-10-2010 via FedX ground shipping . To add insult to injury Amazon has a third party vendor that does not provide package tracking ... You would think that would be a top priority for ALL items shipped that Amazon represents.After wearing socks for only two days the threads are starting to unravel . I am not a happy camper . Too frustrated to send back ! Who knows how long this will take to be corrected .
 I purchased this amplified phone for my hearing impaired father . The phone was returned because it did not work . The phone buzzed or hissed or did not work at all . Pushing the audio amplification button caused a loud buzz that might just cause hearing impairment rather then help it . I then purchased an amplified phone by Uniden that is working well .

 My mother purchased this walker -LRB- from in town store -RRB- . She loved it as it would get around in smaller apartment doors , etc. . After a while , she got very comfortable with this walker and pushed down on the handles too much , the front wheel reared up causing her to fall and break her hip . I believe that this is a great walker , but extra caution MUST be used when using it . My brother was using it to get it from one place to another in the hospital . Not thinking , he put too much weight on it and the front wheel reared up with him . When she went into rehab , they would not allow her to use this walker and we had to get her another . Younger users would probably do great with this handy walker , but when the elderly are using it , they must be very , very careful .

 Seller OTCRX4U listed this item as time release melatonin , which is what we needed . This was false labeling , and now I 'm stuck with a product we ca n't use .
 This is NOT a time release formulation . It is Nature 's Bounty product no. 7900 , and if you check on their web site you will see that it is not time release . I was not able to find ANY time release melatonin on the Nature 's Bounty web site at the time of this review .
 These products -LRB- ordered 2-pack -RRB- arrived without any external or internal seal . Plus , when I opened each cap , the capsules in one bottle were a completely different color from the one in the other bottle . Creepy . Looked like they had been opened , dumped out and refilled -LRB- with who knows what ? -RRB- . I called Amazon and dumped them.I actually like the product , but I 'll buy at a retailer store so I can see the seal .
 Socks are very comfortable and they definitely do their job.But the quality is questionable . The seams at the heels started falling apart just after few time I wore them . For that price I would expect much more durability.Next time I will try another brand .
 they did not hold up to one days wear , They are too thin and go a hole the first day .
 I found these to be extremely tight and about one inch too long to be comfortable on my legs . They appear to be well made , but I 'm not at all sure I 'll be able to use them on a regular basis . I understood from the description that they would be ` light compression ' but discovered them to be quite the opposite . -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 11 '' and weight less then 190 # -RRB- . Rubber gloves will be necessary to help put them on.Good luck .
 My first item of contention was the long time it took for delivery of package . Ordered online 08-02-2010 , Did not receive package until 08-10-2010 via FedX ground shipping . To add insult to injury Amazon has a third party vendor that does not provide package tracking ... You would think that would be a top priority for ALL items shipped that Amazon represents.After wearing socks for only two days the threads are starting to unravel . I am not a happy camper . Too frustrated to send back ! Who knows how long this will take to be corrected .
 This product will not stay in place no matter what ! Slides right down the leg . I tried several ways of keeping it in place . Save your money .
 This product is such a disappointment . Its `` resin '' is a light weight plastic - the marbelized look is only for show . As soon as you hold it you know it 's very poorly made - the razor does n't balance well and the brush is top-heavy - It should be equally weighted . Not at all worth using , in my opinion . Also , the gold holder , while looking fantastic on the ad , comes tarnished and pitted . This is just such poor quality , I would n't even give it to my nephew as a `` starter '' .
 I used Nature Made 3mg Melatonin for two years , which worked great . Within 15 min of popping the pill , I could feel that `` time to sleep '' signal begin to fire . I ran out of pills , couldnt find the same brand , and bought Nature 's Bounty instead . It does NOTHING for me . Maybe it 's me , maybe it 's not . But i just ordered Nature Made brand again and tossed this one in the trash .
 I 've used Melatonin daily for 8 years ! Excessive , obviously , but no side effects apart from probably being somewhat addicted to it . But is it bad to be addicted to a good thing?Anyway , this particual product does NOTHING for me . It 's as if it is placebo ?! Shrug . I 'm back to my old brand , which still works wonderfully -LRB- this one was cheaper due to 100 % bonus , so I gave it a shot -RRB- .
 I bought this hoping to finally get a good night sleep . I tried it several times and all of them woke up with shortness of breath . I got really scared . I asked my doctor who told me it was rare , but it could happened . I wo n't be taking melatonin again .
 I have had insomnia for 5 years , and have been looking for something to get some sleep . Melatonin did n't help one bit . It didnt make me relax or fall to sleep . Do n't but this product if you have real bad insomnia it wo n't work !
 `` Walmart has a very similar product under the brand Spring Valley . It is 120 tablets 10 mg Melatonin time released with my favorite stomach vitamin B-6 10 mg -LRB- long rest sleep -RRB- $ 10.64 . I have had difficulty sleeping since I was at least 7 . I have tried many things to sleep including Rx meds . This , Calms Forte Sleep Aid by Hyland 's -LRB- 2 caps are a knock out -RRB- , and `` Relax Me '' Drink -LRB- slow sleep -RRB- with the Refrigerated OJ section all at Wal-mart are the only ones I 've found that work . I also have sleep tips at -LSB- ... -RSB- I am in no way affiliated w / Walmart and have never drank alcohol . Also , slows the progression of Alzheimer . Blessings and Good Health . b29349@yahoo.com ''
 I 've used another brand before and was hoping to try something with better reviews . It was a mistake , this has little to no effect on me . I would recommend going with a brand that has a red bottle with 300 tablets and an extra ingredient in it .
 I believe Melatonin is helpful . I have bought another brand before . This coating is hard for me to swallow so I 'm not finishing the product .

 This thing is way to small . The opening is the size of a pencil . Way to tight and not a good product at all . Wish I could get my money back .

 I was very disappointed with this product . Kiehls shaving cream is much better and not as expensive . In fact , I would recommend a Drug Store brand over it .
 I purchased a Face Caddy a week ago . It 's very uncomfortable and does n't do a good job of targeting the TMJ area . The Face Caddy covers the ears completely causing them to hurt from the heat or cold pack . I 've placed numerous calls to John Lucas@facecaddy.com who never answers his phone and does n't return phone calls . Very poor customer service . Beware , once you purchase a Face Caddy you 're stuck with it .
 The FaceCaddy was too tight for my head size . Also , I felt like the heating pads were adding weight to my jaw , causing more pain and a bigger headache than I had before I used it . I might use the heating pad alone for moist heat , but the caddy did n't work out for me .
 The bristles of the broom are much too soft . They do n't correspond with the weight and heavy duty construction . They flex too easily making it very difficult to use . Dustpan OK .
 There must be considerable variation in this product . Mine arrived with a definite wave appearance to front of dust pan , making it impossible to place on a flat surface to make effective contact with that surface . Therefore , one can not sweep dust into pan without a good portion of the dust going under the pan . I would return it except for the return postage of $ 5.99 . Unfortunately , the dust pan is a worthless piece of junk . I can use the brush with other dust pans that are more functional .
 I agree with another reviewer that the bristles are a bit too soft . The dust pan itself it made of a plastic that holds a lot of static . Because of this , when I try to empty the dirt out of the pan there is a lot of dirt that remains in the pan . Would not buy again .
 I am usually a big fan of OXO products . Ordered this pan , and when I used it the first time , I realized that half of the dirt goes underneath the dust pan . Turns out the front lip on mine is warped and does n't completely touch the floor . Kinda defeats the purpose of a dustpan . The brush seems nice . Too bad .
 I 'll begin by saying that I typically LOVE OXO products . In my experience , they 're a step above the competition . They look better , feel better , perform better and they last longer.Not this time . Here 's the deal.The handle on the &#34; broom/brush &#34; is bizarre . I do n't know , it 's like ergonomic-friendly for a gorilla . The black rubber &#34; knob &#34; that you hold is just wrong . It 's too fat and angled weird . You 're not sure how to hold it . This is the case for girls and guys alike.Plus , the bristles on the brush are n't firm enough at all . They 're soft as feathers and barely sweep up a thing.What a bummer . I had the rubbermaid version in my shopping cart , but switched at the last moment when I saw the OXO choice . -LRB- Which again , is more $ $ but usually worth it . -RRB- Choose another dustpan and broom/brush .
 I was looking for a small brush to collect bread crumbs from the table cloth . It is not suitable for this purpose as the brush is too still
 I retain ALLOT of fluid in my legs ... many days I have not ankles and they have kangaroo pouches under them !!

 The Futuro brand is a better option , period.I thought I would try a pair of these to make sure I did n't have a better option in the same price range . The top band is too tight around the top of your calf , and the whole area of your foot , including the ankle , is way too loose . No pressure in the ankle area , which is kind of important in these kinds of socks . None of those problems with the Futuro 's , which I wear with khaki 's to work every day now.I 've purchased 5 pair of theFuturo Dress Socks for Men , Brown , Large . My shoe size is 11.5 medium to wide depending on the shoe .
 The pressure seems to be fine from these particular compression socks , however , during the day , it has a tendency to roll down your leg causing uncomfortable pressure points mid to high calf . I only have problems with one leg , so I only need to wear these one at a time , which I do n't think makes a difference in how the top rolls down.Otherwise , they seem very sturdy and have a decent amount of foot room . I have a large foot -LRB- 15 -RRB- and wide too -LRB- 2E -RRB- and it fits in the foot and the ankle quite well . It 's just during the day that these really do n't live up to my standards , they do n't last all day long without adjusting them .
 Worst pair of socks I 've ever owned !! Supremely uncomfortable , makes my feet itch till it also bleeds !! Biggest waste of money ever !!
 There were 2 pens ordered
 Not much to say . This pen feels cheap when held . It is light and the material is VERY `` plasticy . '' Writes fine . The `` gold plated '' parts of the pen also seem cheap and gimmicky like the rest of the pen.Another note regarding the seller , the pen arrived with light abrasions and scratching on the cap . Clearly a used pen or the `` floor model . '' Not happy , but not worth the hassle of tracking them down and hounding them for my $ 30 . In sum , avoid this seller and avoid this pen .
 Strap does not have any give to it , becoming more of a tourniquet than a support brace . As a racquetball player , for the brace to become effective -LRB- immobilize the aggravated tendon on the innerside of the elbow -RRB- I had to tighten the strap significantly . Since there is no elasticity in the strap , after a half hour my arm was sore from the tightness of the strap . Recommed staying away from this type of brace . If you are playing sports , such as tennis or racquetball , where you are constantly gripping a racquet and need an effective elbow brace , recommend you get Futuro Elbow Support With Pressure Pads .

 I first bought this exact product at a well-known health and supplement chain . When I saw the same product at Amazon , I thought I was taking no risk by ordering it online . Though the bottles and capsules inside look identical to what I had purchased in the store , the big difference was the stinky smell ! The bottle I purchased in the store had no odor . The two I ordered via this website both stink ! They are nowhere near the expiration date . I ca n't figure it out . It may be the gelatin in the capsules , but why did n't the first bottle I purchased smell ? They may be fine , but purchaser should be prepared for this .
 It was Pro-Stat sugar free . Had the same item number but was much thicker , stronger taste and caloric content jumped from 72 to 100 -LRB- 28 % -RRB- .

 I have frequent pain in my thumb joint and was excited to get this brace . I was however somewhat disappointed when it arrived . The Noeprene is very thin and brace itself is not as wide as it appears to be in photo . I would reccommend purchasing a brace with additional thickness and a wider wrap around hand and wrist .
 I found this wrap , while very cushy , to be very warm . Actually made my hand sweat ! And I did n't feel like it gave me the support I needed to do the job . I returned this item 2 days after receiving it and trying it for 2 nights . I would n't suggest it . Its hard to wrap tight enough to make it effective , or maybe I ordered a size to big , but according to the measurement guidelines I ordered what I needed . Would n't buy this again .
 This stuff is incredibly dangerous . I 've pasted below a case report from a young woman who needed a liver transplant after taking usnic acid to lose weight . Want to lose weight ? Skip the cup cakes . -LSB- ... -RSB-

 I ordered this item , manufactured by Pride Mobility but handled for Amazon by reseller called MedLife Health . The item was listed as Prime for 2-day delivery . It was immediately posted as SHIPPED , specifying that the carrier was UPS but with no tracking number . Nothing ever showed up . I queried MedLife Health and they told me that it had indeed shipped and would be there `` very soon . '' A week later and three more queries from me and MedLife responded that they would check with Pride . I called Pride and found out that they were unwilling ever to do business with MedLife Health . I cancelled the order and MedLife responded that I could have a similar but better item in a few days for only a little bit more . I told them to take a hike .
 The scooter you get will NOT BE like the one shown . The one shown is how the scooter USED TO LOOK!This is the second one for me . The first one I got 9 years ago and it had the 2 batteries in a plastic pod as shown in the picture and was weather proof . And I never had a problem with it ; I just replaced the batteries as needed . There were no wires exposed . The one I got in March 2012 has the batteries in a canvas bag and the wires connecting the batteries to the motor come out of an opening in the bag and the connection to the motor wires that are exposed to the elements.Today I called for service on my one-year contract because the scooter just quit running . The batteries were good and all was all right until it suddenly quit just like that . And there is no power . The scooter is dead .

 I do n't write reviews , but I read reviews and because of this I feel impelled to write a review for this Seventh Generation Dish Gel , which I bought almost entirely because of the good reviews on Amazon.Let me say first that I like Seventh Generation and I am making a concentrated effort to be more eco friendly in the products I have to consume to get through my day and while I try to stay away from purchasing paper towels and dryer sheets in favor of more environmentally friendly alternatives , I do still need things like dishwasher detergent so I 'm glad that companies like Seventh Generation are there to help with that.That being said , I ca n't see the eco friendly end of having to wash dishes two and even three -LRB- ! -RRB- times to get them clean . I 'm a pre-rinser , though not a pre-washer and my dishes come out of the dishwasher still smeared with food and stained by coffee and curry -LRB- not the same dish for those two difficult cleans , mind you -RRB- . I was so disappointed I even went to the Seventh Generation website and it is only THERE that I discovered a MOUNTAIN of bad reviews saying almost exactly the same thing - dishes come out still dirty and stained . Users over there recommend Ecover instead but I have n't been able to try it because I have n't been able to convince myself to just throw this bottle out . I mean , I bought it because I 'm conscious of those things , right ? So I 've been cutting it with regular ol' chemical-y dishwasher detergent and things have improved a bit.I give it two stars because I WANT it to work , and I appreciate that there are companies that will produce these products but this particular product just does cut the mustard ... or grease ... or coffee ... or anything for that matter .
 I have a dishwasher to wash dishes . I remove chunks and might soak the nasty stuff to soften it before putting it in the dishwasher . Seventh Generation is n't a good match for me . Even after cycles of hot water , presoaking , turbo boosting , and all the other zippy , high-powered settings the dishes still came out dirty . I went through a couple of bottles of this stuff and am convinced it 's not the right product for me.This gel smells fresh and I appreciate the commitment to eco-friendly ingredients . I 'll stick to Bio-Kleen .
 I have been a happy user of Seventh Gen 's Powder detergent and thought I 'd try the Gel . Turns out it 's very difficult to make a Gel `` naturally . '' This does not clean well at all . Stick to the powder - it 's cheaper anyway .
 I love Seventh Generation products - I use their laundry detergent and their house cleaning products all the time . So I figured I 'd give their dishwasher gel a try , and I am so disappointed . This gel left my dishes absolutely filthy ! I ran the dishwasher right after making dinner , so the food was still soft on the dishes - nothing was crusted on or dried . There was a cheese grater in there that is difficult to clean by hand , but my dishwasher always does a good job of cleaning it . It came out completely covered in dried-on cheese . The dishes were dirty - any egg product on my dishes turned into cement . Lip marks on glasses -LRB- not even lipstick - just chapstick or lip marks -RRB- were still there , dressing was dried and caked on , and I practically had to chisel melted cheese off one of my plates . I 've tried using this gel on my regular dishwasher cycle and on the `` super hot '' or `` sanitizing '' cycle , and neither worked . I even put a scoop of 20 Mule Team Borax in the bottom of the dishwasher to help with hard water - nothing helps . It 's just not a good product . On the label it says if you 're not satisfied with the item to contact the company , and I did , but I have n't heard back yet -LRB- it 's been a few days -RRB- . I ca n't return it because it 's partially used , and now I just need to replace it with something , anything , to clean the dishes . Washing all of the dishes by hand after they 've been run through the dishwasher is so wasteful of time and water - I 'm not going to use this soap again .
 The Futuro brand is a better option , period.I thought I would try a pair of these to make sure I did n't have a better option in the same price range . The top band is too tight around the top of your calf , and the whole area of your foot , including the ankle , is way too loose . No pressure in the ankle area , which is kind of important in these kinds of socks . None of those problems with the Futuro 's , which I wear with khaki 's to work every day now.I 've purchased 5 pair of theFuturo Dress Socks for Men , Brown , Large . My shoe size is 11.5 medium to wide depending on the shoe .
 The pressure seems to be fine from these particular compression socks , however , during the day , it has a tendency to roll down your leg causing uncomfortable pressure points mid to high calf . I only have problems with one leg , so I only need to wear these one at a time , which I do n't think makes a difference in how the top rolls down.Otherwise , they seem very sturdy and have a decent amount of foot room . I have a large foot -LRB- 15 -RRB- and wide too -LRB- 2E -RRB- and it fits in the foot and the ankle quite well . It 's just during the day that these really do n't live up to my standards , they do n't last all day long without adjusting them .
 Worst pair of socks I 've ever owned !! Supremely uncomfortable , makes my feet itch till it also bleeds !! Biggest waste of money ever !!
 I retain ALLOT of fluid in my legs ... many days I have not ankles and they have kangaroo pouches under them !! I 'm a female weighing 220 and 5 ' 5 `` I ordered the XL sizethe first time I tried wearing them my legs cramped up after 6 hoursthe second time I tried them well my legs cramped up after 2.5 hours !! Andsaying they do n't constrict at the top !! WRONG !!!!!!!! YES THEY DO!sorry NO GOOD In my bookif you ca n't tolerate wearing them they do n't do any good !
 I 've been a user of an Oral-B Electric Toothbrush for a couple of years , and in the process I bought many Precision Clean brush heads under the recommendation of my dentist who believes this is the best brush head for my teeth and gums . This review is not about the toothbrush which works great and grants a separate review , but about the heads , particularly these brush heads shown here as a productFirst , they came all in separate individual packs , while the others I 've bought in the past usually came all in one pack . Then at least two of the packs looked different than the others , although the brush heads look alike as I compared them one beside the other . Then after replacing one of my wife 's brush heads with a new one from this shipment , the head broke apart after a couple of weeks even sending plastic debris into my wife 's mouth . Very , very strange . Then it was my time for a replacement , and from time to time the little metal piece that can be seen in one side of the brush heads protrude from the plastic piece and slightly tickles my tongue , not sure what 's going on . I though they were not original Oral-B replacement parts but then when comparing them to the older ones they look exactly the same , if they are fake these are very good fakes so I do n't think they areIn any case , they maybe very old brush heads without all the changes or improvements Oral-B had put into them over the years , or simple started to deteriorate after being stored for a long period of time . Not sureBut one thing
 Why are they still selling this item ? I bought six heads . Two of the heads broke from the handle . I had used the heads for about 2 weeks each . After the second head broke , I returned the brush heads to Amazon for a refund . After reading the reviews , I ca n't believe that these heads are still being sold on Amazon . I have been using these brush heads for years -LRB- bought from other sellers -RRB- and have not had any problems with the brush heads until now . This was the first time I bought the heads from this seller . I wo n't be buying this item from this seller again .
 I purchased these Oral B brush heads through Amazon from `` in stock novelties . '' They appear to be German models due to the writing on the box . Regardless , they did not hold up well . The first head lasted a few weeks and then the brush tip came loose rendering it unusable . Subsequent heads have been loose , fall off the toothbrush , or break very quickly . This product is definitely not worth the money .
 I ordered and receive these Oral B Precision Clean , formerly Flexisoft toothbrush heads from LightDeals . Why are these even being sold ?! Every brush I used lasted approximately 4 brushings before the heads got so loose that they would pinch the inside of my mouth . Every one of them.What 's up with these ?! Not only will I never buy the Flexisoft again , I will not buy from LightDeals because they sell inferior products.Another rip-off .
 I should have known this is too good to be true . Instead of rotating , the heads simply vibrates . Some of them also does n't fit quite snugly , and are prone to come off while you are brushing . Another telltale sign that I have read in a review of similar items is the `` indicator bristles '' does n't fade.I also have the feeling that these shady merchants may change their names to try to avoid being found out . The merchant I bought from was `` Platanus Home Stores '' , and in the review I mentioned above was listed under merchant name `` Direct Super Center '' . Then when I clicked on the link under `` Item being reviewed '' , the merchant name is now NEWBOLZ.Finally , I hope Amazon.com would be vigilant enough to `` crack down '' on such practice of selling counterfeit products .
 I am disappointed with the product that I received , as the heads get loose after a few uses , and end of cutting the inner lip . I have been using Oral B Precision Clean brushes for some time now -LRB- purchased at local store -RRB- and never had this problem , thus am assuming it was a bad batch that I received .
 I have noticed that other reviewers have wondered if these are real Oral B or knockoffs . Mine came in a sealed blister pack , and everything looked genuine based on my prior purchases of brush heads.These do n't fit snugly on the power brush , and I have had the head slip off numerous times . I never had this problem with previous brush heads . They also seem to be wearing out more quickly , the brush is very loose and wobbles around . It would take 3 times as long to see this level of wear on the previous brush heads.My power brushes are quite old now , and I wo n't be buying any more brush heads with the loss of quality . It seems that the manufacturing process has changed , and quality has suffered as a result . These things are * expensive * , and I am not paying a premium price for a poor quality product.The `` throw away '' power brushes are looking like a good alternative , even though they are not as environmentally friendly . $ 7 each at a retail store , and you can probably find them for less .
 These replacement heads are not soft by any means . I do n't brush for the full 2 minutes for fear I will take the enamel off my teeth . Being a former dental assistant I know you should only use soft bristle brushes . I think these were made for people who only brush their teeth once a week . I would not buy again .

 Cheap plastic construction . Battery mode did n't work unless I shook the device , and was then intermittent . Expected way more , given the cost .
 Worked for less than five minutes , then would n't turn on at all . Feels and looks cheaply made . Not as bad as the one I was hoping to replace , but there is no justification for this quality of construction costing more than 15 dollars . Maybe yours will not burn out . If mine kept working , I might have kept it . It did seem to produce good UV light . I just do n't know why no one can make one of these lights so it does n't feel and operate like it 's falling apart in your hands . Regular flashlights do n't have this problem . Anyway , I 've returned product to seller , and have already ordered a different style . Will review that one when I get it .
 Do not buy this for the Sony DSC-T5 ; even though it says it is equivalent to the Sony NP-FT1 , you will get an error message when trying to use this battery that says `` use InfoLithium Battery only '' .
 Will not work in Sony camera , because Sony has a chip in their cameras that will not allow a non-Sony battery .
 the image shown of the battery is not the battery they ship ... i got different ... a skinny battery which is a waste of money . . how can someone have a image of one kind of battery and ship something else . . i hate this
 It did n't work by pulling the hair out , it broke the hair off . I rerurned the product within a couple of days .
 I have gotten waxed several times . I noticed that there were still little hairs the wax did n't get . I would go home and tweeze as many as I could with relatively no pain . Well , I thought I was getting tough and could handle doing it all myself at home . I bought this epilator -LRB- my first ever -RRB- and it hurt worse than waxing . When you wax , it 's a quick motion , this thing has to be dragged slowly up your leg . I would have to force my arm to continue up my leg it hurt so bad . It did seem to cut some skin where it raises up around the hair . I even used it on my boyfriend who is very pain tollerant . After it was on his arm for 2 seconds he pulled his arm away . Spend the money to get waxed .
 I am sorry to have wasted my money on this product . I purchased the Braun 5270 as a replacement for my Remington Smooth & Silky EP-1000 that has served me well for the last 6-7 years of regular use . By comparison the Braun left many hairs even after repeated passes over my legs , and yes , I know how to use an epilator properly . In addition , the construction seems flimsy compared to the Remington model which is no longer available for purchase . I wish I had tried the Emjoi AP-10L with the gold plated feature .
 When I bought this product , I had high expectations . For years now , I 've been using an old Braun epilator that I really loved . It was effective that it pulled my hair from the roots and did n't not leave any hair behind . I thought this new Braun epilator would be better . But when I tried it , it was n't able to pull my hair from the roots . Hence , it left a lot of hair still . I did n't have that `` totally clean '' and `` totally hairless '' feeling afterwards .
 I bought this product less than a year ago and have used it about 4 times . I breaks the hair off instead of pulling it out . I noticed that it did this a bit from the very start , but it was not TOO bad . It rapidly became worse , and now that is all it does . It creates the worst ingrown hairs as a result . This is on the SLOW setting -LRB- as it always has been -RRB- . I cleaned it diligently -LRB- which is a real pain in the rear with this one -RRB- , and kept it in good condition . None of it made a difference.As for the pain , it is no better or worse than any other.Sadly , I thought that it might be better than the cheap Panasonic that I was using because the reviews were so good . It looks like I will be getting another cheap Panasonic . It worked fine and lasted a few years before it died , but it very rarely broke off a hair and it DID work up to the day it died .
 I have a pretty high pain tolerance but this thing hurts like nothing else . It moves waay too fast - I think if I had more control over the speed I might be able to deal with it better but there is n't that option . I think I 'll stick with shaving .
 It tweezed about half the hair and cut the other half so I would still have to shave on a daily basis .
 I was real xcited 2 receive this item n try it out . . i tried usind it different times and giving it a chance but I could n't take the pain . . not worth what I pay !
 I bought this product in hopes that it would make my chin smooth and silky , like I read in so many reviews for various body parts . However , for me that was not the case . This left my chin with more stubbles than I have ever had and it left me even more self conscious than I was prior to . Oh well , back to tweezing and plucking !!! Since , I have been able to get the skin smooth again , but was hoping for a quick fix , such as an epilator , but in my case , that did not work . I wonder if I can return this product after use . Minimal use , but nonetheless , use .
 Apparently epilating technology has not made much progress ove the last 20 years . Still to painful . I stick with a 10cents DE razor ... it 's also easier on the skin . The Braun gave me a real bad rash that lasted about 6 h. Wish I could return the item ... alas , landfill here it comes !
 I do n't think this is pulling the hair out , it feels more like it 's cutting it . When the hair grows back in , it looks like it has been cut , not pulled at the root . I used to use EpiLady and that thing pulled from the roots , you felt it and you could see the difference with the way the hair grows back . This seems like it is just cutting it really low . I would not really recommend this product if you are looking for something to replace waxing .
 Yes , this item does work to pull the hairs out at the root and hurts like nobody 's business ... but I found I had to use the darn thing almost every day for a month ! The hairs kept coming and coming . I 'd rather spend a lot less time shaving in the shower a couple times per week , than sit on the floor in agony doing this every day .
 I got this because I was tired of paying all of that money for razor blades . So , my mom and I did a little research and chose this product . It hurt a little at first , but after a little time , it was no big deal . However , this cut my hair instead of pulling it out . I ended up with stubble all over the place and had to shave anyway . I also had a horrible time using this on my knees as it literally ate up and cut the skin on them . After using it for 4 months , I gave it to my mom and told her she was more than welcome to use it . And of course she does , with perfect results . -LRB- PARENTS !!! -RRB- So , I guess it really depends what you ` hair type ' is . Mine grows back fast and is really thick . My moms grows back slower and is really fine . But for me , this was a waste of money .
 I only recently tried using an epilator for the first time . I borrowed a friend 's emjoi while on vacation and I liked it . I decided to get my own and purchased this instead because it had a lot more reviews than the emjoi epilators with a good average rating . I was disappointed in this . It does n't do as good of a job removing the hair . It seems to have some trouble removing some hairs and also cuts them instead of pulling from the root . Also , corded is more of a burden than I thought it would be . The epilator is harder to clean . With the emjoi , all I had to do was knock the head on the sink a couple times and it would be completely clean . I did n't want to return someone 's epilator with my hairs stuck on it ! The Braun on the other hand is a pain to clean even when I use the cleaning brush it 's still never clean . The hairs get trapped in the `` tweezers '' and you 'd have to pull hair out of each slot one by one to get it totally clean ... Not only that , but this somehow pulled at my skin when I did my armpits and I ended up getting blisters!I 'm returning this one and getting the Emjoi . I should have stuck with what worked for me but I thought this would be better . The only thing that makes this Braun better than Emjoi is that Braun is made in Germany and Emjoi is made in China .
 I bought this product because I had purchased the same model about 4 years ago , really liked it , and needed a replacement . I expected the style to have changed over the years but not the quality of the new epilator and shaver . It 's now cheaply made and the shaver is duller than the one I have been using for several years . I have returned this product .
 For those of us with sensitive skin , this is not an ideal product . While one can expect an epilator to hurt , especially for someone new to epilation , this one hurts pretty bad . For me , it became somewhat tolerable after a few uses , but I have a pretty high tolerance for pain . Also , people with sensitive skin may experience redness . The first time I used it , I looked like I had a giant rash all over . Not a pretty sight!Overall , this probably is n't a bad product for most people , but if you have sensitive skin , please try another epilator .
 Did n't remove all the hair . Quite painful . Redness lasted less than 1 hour . Overall , not impressed .
 The first time I tried the Braun , I was very surprised at how little it hurt compared to waxing . The next day , I realized why
 The light is great and the power/strength is fine , but the placement of the two rollers is a problem and will not effectively epilate in some places -LRB- forced to go at certain angles sometimes to fit -RRB- -- only an almost direct/flat application on the face of the rollers will work . Trying to use an edge or one side will not work . Also , the interchangeable cover would not stay in place after a few months and I just ended up using it open top with the rollers fully exposed . Recommend the 1 -RRB- Emjoi Optima or 2 -RRB- Emjoi Emagine instead .
 I am a woman that can deal with pain . If I could give this a -1 rating , I would . At first , I thought this epilator was amazing . It was the first time I had ever used one and even though slightly painful at first , you can get used to it . The pain seemed worth it for amazingly smooth legs . -LRB- The red bumps did go away after 2 days ... -RRB- Of course not all of the hairs were pulled because of the whole hair growth cycle , but after using it a few times during the week , I thought I was good to go . Really loved the product until about 1.5 weeks later ... DISASTER ! I began to notice that EVERY SINGLE HAIR ON MY LEG WAS BECOMING INGROWN !! Yes , I have read that this tends to happen more when using an epilator and to really exfoliate , which I did ... every day ... but to have this happen to every hair was a nightmare . Nothing worked except to go through each hair on my leg and kind of scratch the skin off so the hair could come through . This epilator ruined my legs for quite some time . I am sorry but shaving never leaves me with any ingrown hairs and I 'd rather shave everyday than ever deal with the nightmare of having smooth legs , but having ingrown hairs that you can see all over ... !!
 UPDATE ~ ~ 2 YEARS LATERI bought this product and used it all the time -LRB- no shaving ever again -RRB- for an entire year . It hurt the first few times and I really had to get used to it ... The pain DOES go away after a while I promise . What they do n't tell you though is that you will suffer from ingrown hairs forever to come . At least that is what happened to me.After stopping the use of the epilator all together for a whole year + I am STILL suffering and ca n't seem to get the hairs to grow the right way again . They grown down deep into my skin and will only emerge as a small comedone . When that comedone is extracted a 1/2 '' - 1 '' hair comes out with it . It is so disturbing to see it happening.I am NOT a sensitive person and my hairs are not extremely thick so WE -LRB- my dermatologists and I -RRB- ca n't figure out what went wrong . I have been to several different doctors who all agreed that they will NEVER let their patients use an epilator ... EVER . They were impressed that it was SO difficult to battle this bout of MAJOR ingrown hairs . They tried everything and finally my team of doctors told me that at this point with all of the scarring and suffering the ONLY solution is Laser hair removal . My once beautiful legs are so scarred from such HORRIBLE ingrown hairs from using the epilator that I am ashamed to wear shorts or cute short dresses anymore :-LRB- ... PLEASE PLEASE think twice before putting yourself through this . We all want silky smooth legs etc. . . BUT laser hair removal will save you in the long run ... I can promise you that.Good luck ; -RRB- Katie ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FIRST POST ~ ~ 2 YEARS PRIOROkay so I read the seven-hundred-some odd reviews on this product and decided to take the plunge . I bought it yesterday and tried it out for myself . All I can say is OUUUCCCH ! SO it DOES REALLY hurt and you almost have to hold your breath when you run it over your legs . After I was done my legs were SO red and even a bit bumpy but also VERY smooth . The bumps settled down after a few hours and the redness went away . Needless to say the product does work just leaves you a bit sore . I am praying that what everyone else says will eventually become the truth for me . `` It gets less painful after each use '' . I can only hope for that ; -RRB-
 Epilating is RIDICULOUSLY painful . While I 'm sure this might be a good product , I used it once with the epilation tip and that was it . I could barely do a square inch , let alone an entire leg . Has worked great though with the shaving head . That 's about all I 'm gon na be using it for .
 I purchased this product a week ago in hopes that I would be able to stop shaving , and be able to go longer periods in between hair removal . Both of my roommates epilate , so I figured I would try it again -LRB- it has been years -RRB- . I spent a good 3 hours of tooth-grinding pain removing my body hair . I did my legs , arms , underarms , and most of my bikini zone.This was a week ago , and my forearms still are covered in bumps ... . It looks like I have chickenpox or something similar . I have not gotten any ingrowns -LRB- yet -RRB- , but a few of the bumps on my arms pimpled up . It took multiple passes to remove most of the hair , which I then had to go at with tweezers . The bikini zone was torture , so I switched it up a bit and went to my underarms . At first it was n't too bad , then it started to REALLY hurt . I have a VERY high tolerance for pain , but this was really excruciating ... So , I took a few aspirin and waited about 30 minutes . It did n't seem to help at all and a large portion of the hair under my arms was still there , but the pain was too great . I decided to put the epilator away for the next day.The rest of that day , my underarms were a deep , vivid red color and I could n't put on a shirt . I tried deodorant . Big mistake - it BURNED ! When I woke up the next morning , my underarms were still red along with some scabbing . This continued for 3 days.I spoke with a friend about it that owns a spa , and she begged me to return the epilator , even though I was planning on actually giving it another try - because all the reviews say it gets easier . I have thin , light hair -LRB- being a blonde -RRB- , and thought about it a while - and determined that I never had a hair problem , so the torture really is n't worth not having to shave.I would say stick to shaving , waxing , Nair-ing , or laser removal - epilating is just not for me : /
 I used this for 6 months and LOVED it ! Then I noticed that my legs were getting bumpy . I was exfoliating regularly to try to ward of the ingrown hairs and thought it was working but soon my legs were covered in them . My legs were an unsightly mess for over a year . After not using it for over a year and using every ingrown hair product I could get my hands on my legs look OK . A few more scars to show for it but at least they are n't covered in red bumps anymore . So sad , cause I really did love not having to shave all the time . I know of 2 other people who I told about this when I loved it . They also bought it and had the same problem with the ingrown hairs and had to stop using it .
 After my old epilator died , I bought this one based on reviews and brand respect . I do n't mind pain with epilation , I expect it , but this one is far worse than necessary . The ingrown hairs were appalling and constant
 If you never use this before , imagine use a tweezer to pull hairs . The difference is this is 100 times faster but 100 times more painful because the motor driven roller has built-in mini tweezers . It is common sense . But again , if you have a hign tolerance to pain , it is cheap and can pull where it goes . I gave it three stars due to the pain to the point I quit using it at all.Also , the tweezers need to make contact with hairs to pull . So this is good for hairs longer than 2 mm .
 Let 's just say I HATE this product ! I 've been using it for almost two months , every 2-3 days . Not only do I have to use it as much as shaving , but it takes waaaayyyy longer than shaving ! Also , my normally smooth skin on my legs is now horribly bumpy and rough ! It 's NOT ingrown hairs , I 'm 36 and have had my share of ingrown hairs . It 's given me KERATOSIS PILARIS , or `` chicken skin '' all over my legs ! I 've used the expensive after epilation creams with growth inhibitor , but I 'm still having to epilate every 2 days . I seriously do n't see how other women claim they only have to use it every 3-4 weeks ! Do they enjoy having hairy Yeti legs ??? The pain factor is n't even a factor . The first time will hurt , no lie there . Maybe even the second time . But after that-not a problem . But you should n't have to use it as often as I have . I 'm not a hairy beast , I 'm a natural blonde with fine hair that is usually envied by my friends for the infrequent times I have to shave . When I SHAVE I usually only have to shave once or twice a week . This epilation thing is a sadly different story . It just goes to show the old saying IS true - if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is !
 I am not sure if the product is being more cheaply made now , but after 2 months of intermittent use and being put up in a safe cupboard -LRB- ie not dropped etc -RRB- it is not working anymore .
 I have been epilating for years using my trusted Panasonic , and it does not hurt much at all . However , since moving to the US , the electric voltage difference did not provide sufficient power to my Panasonic . So I walked into a store and bought this product through convenience , but to my big mistake.This product is painful , and the supposed pain relieving rollers do not help at all . In fact , it scratches the surface of your skin leaving it flaky . This product is not effective at removing hair from the roots . From my experience , it breaks the hair off at skin level , which means that you will see hair regrowth quicker.The light is also very annoying , and actually makes it harder to see the tiny hairs on your skin because it is too bright . And , you do not have the option to turn off the light . This comes on automatically when you switch on the epilator.The shaving component of this tool does not provide a close shave either , and you can still see the blunt edge of your hair on your skin . You are better off with your trusted razor than using this for shaving!As I said , I have been epilating for many years and have grown used to the pain , and for me , I feel little pain . But this product makes me feel as though I am epilating for the first time ever . DO NOT BUY IT . You are wasting your money .
 Bought this as a Christmas gift for myself off Amazon last December . Used it a few times , and then had to stop -- the shift from shaving to epilating created a GIGANTIC ingrown hair -LRB- ! -RRB- problem.It 's been over a year since I bought the machine , and about 8 months since I stopped using it . I still have healing areas on my legs which are red and angry , and severe scarring -- lots of discolored white areas that I 'm worried wo n't return to skin color.I do n't know if I have extra sensitive skin or something -LRB- would be news to me -RRB- but SERIOUSLY consider if the risk is worth it before buying this ! I was excited to save money/hassle , but now I 'm embarrassed to wear shorts . I regret using this .
 From the beginning , I knew that ripping the hair out of my body would be painful . I expected that . What I did n't expect is that all those hair folicles would also get inflamed and turn into ingrown hairs -LRB- even when I followed all the directions -RRB- . I stopped using this when I was getting a new scar on my legs -LRB- from deep ingrown hairs -RRB- every time I tried it . Using it on my neck and chin I looked like I had razor burn . I 'm not even going to go into bikini line . For now , I 'm back to shaving my legs and using Gigi Brazilian Bikini Wax Microwave Kit for my neck and chin.I hoped I could use the shaver for a while , but it dulled quickly and got really back clogged with baby-fine hairs . This product barely made it 6 months in the house . Wish I had n't wasted my money .
 The way this product removes hair makes for the perfect recipe for ingrown hairs , bleeding , scaring ... . horrible product and waste of money .
 It scratches my skin , and it is not as fast/powerful as others . I do not recommend it . It took me over 1hr to do both legs !!! When others epilators can do it in 20 or less minutes !
 If you 're considering getting this because you want to spend less time on hair removal than you would with shaving , you 're out of luck . It takes forever to remove all the hair with this . The first time I tried it , it took almost all day.That in and of itself would n't be a huge problem , if the only downside was that it took as much time as shaving . After the hair is removed , I 'm left with red bumps that persist 4 + days after using it . When they finally go away , and the hair starts pushing up through the skin again , more red bumps occur.Certain areas where the skin is soft -LRB- inner thigh -RRB- are a horrible experience . Pain I could deal with if the results were okay . But the skin actually gets caught in the machine and gets scraped , red , and bloody . This only happens in areas where the skin is malleable , for me it 's inner thigh , back of knee , underarms.I thought this would work well considering all the good reviews . However I am inclined to believe most of those reviewers are not representative of a random sampling of the general population . Draw your own conclusions.I gave this 3 sessions , a week apart , over almost all of my body . After the first time it is less painful . It 's still not worth it though , because all of the red bumps and all the hairs that snap off above the root . You also ca n't wait a month between uses as some say . After a week , there is a lot of hair visible , and the hair is less even and uniform than it would be if I had shaved it.In short : MUCH more irritation than shaving.Takes a VERY long time.Fails to remove some hairs.Painful over dense or deep hair or areas of sensitive skin.Don ' t believe the hype . I did .
 I bought this after the tweezer head on my Emjoi started `` grabbing '' my skin after a couple of years.I have used an epilator for a few years , but stopped for about a year after my Emjoi went out.So , keep in mind I used the Braun after just shaving for a year . It worked great on my arms , but I used this to do a `` Brazilian '' wax too and it was horrible for the bikini area . I tried leaving the hair longer , I tried trimming it a bit , and the darn thing would just grab hair , pull it enough to be painful and then either break the hair off or leave it there.I breezed through my arms in about five minutes if that . The `` Brazilian '' wax if you will , took , no joke , four hours , and the area still felt stubbly!I 'm either going to buy a replacement head for my Emjoi and just know I need to replace this part every couple of years , or upgrade to the latest Emjoi.I am going to use this unit on my arms , arm pits , and legs . It 's tweezers are half metal and half plastic while the Emjoi 's are metal , so I do n't think this unit has the pulling power to ` pull ' out strong willed hairs .
 I bought this over a year ago and have had to stop using it because it was just too painful . I tried every method to make it less painful and nothing worked . I tried doing small sections and taking breaks , big sections , taking pain meds , rubbing , etc. . Nothing worked . I had red spots that covered my legs for days after using . I am going back to regular waxings . They hurt less and the pain and redness goes away in about a day.The light is nice and the electric razor part works well . It would be better if it was battery operated so you did n't have to haul out an extension cord every time you wanted to use it .
 I have been using Braun , I love it , I decided to purchase a new one , read the reviews and bought this one.If you have coarse hair , please dont ever use this , after 3 months , I have had extremely bad ingrown hair and infected follicles.I had to actually pay so much to go to a salon and she removed the ingrown hair for me , and I still can not seem to get all of them . . I stopped epilators . . I am scared to go back . . I now shave and use Tend skin . Please dont buy this one . . you will have ingrown hair issues .
 Yes it hurts and Yes it works . I though this would be the solution to all my unwanted hair but I am really disapointed because the reason I bought this is because waxing breaks me out and this did the exact same thing ! Every spot I used the epilator has red bumps on it that looks like acne and then it turns into acne ! I used this on my face and on my lower back , so its either have unatractive hair or have unatractive acne . . I guess you really should just use on your legs but thats not where I need hair removal : -LRB-
 This is the first time I 've purchased and used an epilator . Although it was not as painful as I thought it would be when using it on my legs , I was disappointed with how many times I had to pass over the same area . I 've tried both beginner and advanced settings . The light was a very nice feature . The main reason I purchased an epilator was to try using it for my bikini line , but that was too painful . I reverted back to shaving .
 Dont get me wrong but it hurt like hell . I thought maybe I was doing it wrong at first but I wasnt and it just hurt so bad I had to return it .
 I 've been using this product for about 4 weeks now instead of shaving my legs . It has never made my legs feel silky or smooth , the way that shaving did . It can not remove the very short hairs that irritate me the most , but it does remove the longer , visible growth . So if tiny stubble does n't give you problems , then this is a good product . But if you 're looking for great smoothness , stick to shaving or another hair-removal method .
 It seems to shave and not pull the hair out . I have the right head on it.Braun 5270 Silk-pil X'elle Body System Epilator
 I 've been waxing for years . eventhough I 've never professionally learned how to wax , I 've learnt on the job , and I thought it would be the same with the epilator . I found it to be easy to use , but it 's extremely painful , and my hair grew back a week later , where as with the waxing , it was much less painful , and it does n't grow back for at least three weeks . really not worth starting with it .
 I was surprised at how much hair it left behind . Really it 's just a torture device . I endured a lot of pain and kept going but it left behind a lot of hair .
 i bought this with really high hopes , and i was highly disappointed . I 'm really sensitive to pain but i read a review that said it barely hurt at all so i tried it . OWCH . i cried while i was doing this it hurt so bad ! I do n't think that waxing is too awful but this thing was one of the most painful experiences of my life ! i tried it on my lower calve and it got maybe 3 or 4 hairs and that was it . i kept going over and over but it would only get about 3 every stroke . it was a waste of time and money and it really hurt ! i do n't normally listen to reviews like this but trust me it 's awful !
 I have a high pain tolerance but this epilator is far from painless . Very time consuming to use ! Use disposables it 's much faster & easier .
 I bought this for my friend who had a Braun epilator from Europe . She could not use it because the power requirements here were different to Europe and so decided to buy one here . The unit looked well made but on using it , did not pluck the hairs on her leg from the root but it was as painful as her European model . She attributes this to the fact that one side of the pincers was made of metal while the other side was plastic unlike her European model which had metal parts to both sides of the pincers . In less than a week , her legs were rough again unlike 3 weeks when she used her European model . She was disappointed that it did not do a good job like her European model and so returned it .
 this is the first Brown I got & have been using Epilators for 9 years ... when the plastic frames is on the roller , there is a cavity between the roller & the frame that once in a while is dragging my skin in and causing the machine to stop & my skin to be red and sometimes bleeding a little ! when I use the machine without plastic farms , it leaves light visible scratches on my skin as it moves .
 Bought this epilator because it was so highly recommended . Back in the day of coiled epilady machines , it took me 20 min . My previous epilator was Epilady and took ~ 30 min . This one requires a solid hour at least ... You can go over the same area over and over and over again and it still leaves hair . It does n't grab well the well-visible hair , let alone the small stuff . I especially hate the fact that you have to repeat an area so many times to get all the hairs in the more sensitive areas , which by the time you are done , are all red and irritated . I honestly ca n't figure out how others could have given it such high rankings . It is the worse epilator I have had . For my part , I am going back to Epilady . Good luck .
 I hope this review saves someone from the disaster I am experiencing.I 've owned this product for 8 months , and at first it seemed a great solution to spending so much on waxing . I 've been waxing for years and never minded the pain . I did not find the epilator to be painful as others have , perhaps because my hair is rather fine from waxing so long . Now I have terrible , terrible ingrown hairs on my legs that are sever to the point of embarrassing . I have tough skin so I thought it was just me . I exfoliate with salt scrubs and use tend skin or vanish and was still getting hundreds -LRB- no exageration here -RRB- of ingrown hairs . I did a lot of research on-line reading reviews and chat room posts . Apparently , this is a common phenomenon . The epilady seems great for about 6 months and then causes terrible , horrific ingrown hairs.I wish I had known . I wish I had never used it . I wish my legs did n't look like an extra in a disaster movie . I wo n't be selling mine on ebay because I do n't want anyone else to experience this . After 8 months , it is probably too late to return it.I did read several recipes to help after the fact . Most go like this
 It appears this product works extremely well for SOME hair/skin types . BUT , if you 've never epilated before I strongly urge you to begin with a small test patch first . Thoroughly epilate one patch of one leg , perhaps just to the outside of the shin bone or wherever the hair grows thick . Then shave everywhere else . WAIT several weeks until you get re-growth on the test patch . I did n't think of doing this when I bought the Braun epilator . I followed the package instructions and other reviewers ' recommendations carefully to epilate both legs completely . I did not find it at all painful , by the way . I exfoliated often , and waited . I encountered two problems . 1st , the machine did not successfully pull all the hair from the root . Some hairs were broken at or near the surface , so I had a fair bit of ` stubble ' immediately . I kept epilating until eventually all the hairs were ` pulled ' . But that was n't the deal breaker . After a couple of weeks I noticed a strange , mildly unpleasant tingling sensation on my legs . After a few days of this I noticed that my legs were covered with hair . The re-growth had come in . The problem was that most of the hair was growing JUST UNDER a very thin layer of skin . The hairs were completely visible but impossible to shave OR epilate , protected as they were under that thin layer . I had to tweeze each hair -LRB- and there were many -RRB- out from under the skin . Once the hair was growing normally again , I decided to give the epilator another try . I thought the problem might improve over time . It did n't . After 3 full rounds with the same results , I stopped using the epilator several weeks ago and my legs still have n't recovered . I 'm still struggling to get rid of the cycle of ingrowns , and the unsightly red bumps some of them caused . I think this problem probably occurs only for certain hair/skin types . I strongly caution all new users to test a small patch to see how the epilator works for your hair/skin .
 I really really wanted to like this product , and thought it would be the answer getting the smooth skin I would like to have ... I was wrong . I am a MALE amateur bodybuilder , and I am fairly hairy which I try to keep under control . . usually with electric clippers and a razor shave . I saw this product , and after reading all the good reviews , it sounded great , no razor burn , no itchy re-growth , ect ... I am not at all squeamish and I feel that I have a high tolerance for pain , but this device was epic in the amount of pain it causes . I literally almost vomited at one point from the pain , no I am not kidding , I also felt at one point that I might pass out . I am sure this device works very well on a womans fine and sparse body hair , but for guys with thick dense body hair like me , forget it . No amount of gritting your teeth will help . I want to stress that I am NOT exaggerating here , it hurts worse than any pain I have ever felt . I managed to do one full thigh and half of my abdomen before having to give up out of shear horrific agony . Now my skin feels rough and very sore like a bruise and a bad sunburn mixed together , it hurts to the touch . Awful .
 I purchased this thinking it would be better on my sensitive skin than waxing , but found it to be very painful and made my skin puffier and redder than waxing . The pain and puffiness may have been tolerable if it worked for longer and did n't need to be used so frequently .
 I am a veteran user of epilators -LRB- over 15 years -RRB- and have a high pain threshold , or so I thought . I had 5 different epilators and this is one is the worst . This product is a torture device . It works okay on legs , but when I tried it on armpits and bikini area , I ended up with ugly and very painful scars . The only nice feature that earned the 2nd star is the small light that illuminates the area being worked .
 Not quite medieval torture , but darn close . I tried this in order to avoid shaving every day and just could n't stand it . It is simply too uncomfortable to entertain the notion of using on a continuing basis . Put the money towards laser hair removal instead .
 I 'm updating my review . I have n't even had this epilator a year and it 's broken . My previous emjoi last 4 years.I 've always used dual-head emjoi products , but thought I 'd try to save a few bucks . This Braun is so much better ! The hairs do n't break , and take longer to grow back . I thought the light was a little silly . But it 's wonderful ! Helps me see the little hairs I missed . The cord is plenty long .
 I was so excited about this product because it sounded like a great alternative to shaving -LRB- which I have to do everyday if I want to stay smooth -RRB- . It sounded like it would really work , not to mention the reviews were mostly very positive . Let me warn you , this product has been a HUGE letdown.Plain and simple , it just does n't work like it says it will . It does pluck hairs out by the root -- but not nearly all of them . I was left with tons of stubble and I had to shave over it anyway . I tried everything I could think of -- going over areas multiple times , different angles , different pressure , and I just could n't get smooth . Huge disappointment.The pain was pretty bad , too , especially in sensitive areas . I thought I would be able to handle it since I had a child and seemed to manage that okay , but this thing really hurts and it 's a totally different ballgame when you 're inflicting the pain on yourself . I might have been able to handle it better if someone else were epilating me , but who would want to do that ?! : -RRB- Also , it takes FOREVER to do . I thought it would save me time not shaving , but it takes an hour to do both legs . If I epilated once a week , it would still take longer than just shaving in the shower everyday.Overall , this product did not do what I thought it would , or even close to it . Major buyer 's remorse here !
 I followed the instructions in the box and when that did n't work I followed another reviewers advice . Either way , the hair just broke off and left stubble . It also took too long and was slightly painful.I returned it and got a Panasonic ES2207P electric shaver and that ended giving me a shave comparable to using a disposable razor .
 So , I received this product as a `` gift , '' which was fairly insulting , but I was still a little excited to try it , as I love beauty products and enjoy bragging about my high tolerance for pain . After reading this review , you will likely think that I am a big wussie , but I am far from it . I have lots of painful hair removal experience . I 've even been a training model for estheticians who have never performed a bikini wax . -LRB- That sucks , by the way . They do n't realize how hot the wax needs to be until it 's too late and your crotch is cemented to the bedspread . -RRB- So , as you can imagine , I assumed this Epilator would be a piece of cake.I decided to try it out on what I assumed would be a low-sensitivity area
 First I thought that this thing is great because of the good reviews , but it was not -LRB- for me -RRB- . Maybe it is good for the technology not for the `` performance '' , that 's why I gave it a 2 . This thing hurts ! a lot ! A lot more than waxing . You can feel your hairs being tweezzed one by one , not like waxing . WHen I first used this on my legs , the hairs got cut instead of pulled off . I thought I did something wrong , so I did it on my other leg and still the same result . Maybe for the other people who rated this with a 4-5 stars , maybe they are just comfortable with it . I have been waxing since I can remember having my first armpit hair , and using this product is not like that . For those who have been waxing , I suggest that you try this first or other cheap products like this epilator , so that you would know if this one is right for you . For me , I will stick with waxing because it is less painful and I 'm not scared to use it . I will be sending this back . I hope this review would help anyone who would want to shift from waxing to an electronic epilator . The pain factor for this is very high , maybe higher than that of waxing for those who have not yet tried it . Ouch ! really .
 I decided to try this product because I was tired of constantly shaving and did n't want to spend a fortune on waxing . I got thought the pain of using it alright -LRB- it 's about on par with getting a tattoo -RRB- , but post epilation I had 2 different types of negative skin reactions . First , despite a rigorous course of exfoliation every hair on my calves became painfully ingrown to a degree I had never experienced.Second , the sensitive area on my upper thigh broke out in an obnoxious rash that has taken a month to heal.This type of negative experience may be due to sensitive skin but I would recommend that anyone whose skin is temperamental steer clear of this product .
 do n't know if its because of my skin , but it cause lots of ingrown hairs which appear as ugly red bumps everywhere . it 's really a pity because expectation was high . though the pain is bearable .
 This epilator removes hair very well and the pain is not horrible like some have stated . It actually feels kinda cool ! The problem starts a week or so after hair removal . INGROWN HAIRS like crazy . I exfoliated every day and still had major ingrown hair trouble ! My legs look horrible now . Wasted $ . Am going back to shaving . Too bad , because this would have been really convenient .
 I have a lot of hair . Always have . I look for new better ways to get rid of said hair reguarly . A few years ago , I purchased an excellent well-reviewed epilator machine that worked like a charm until it finally died on me . I replaced it with this Braun epilator , and wow . I had not felt that kind of pain since using the original models of the Epilady about 20 years ago . I do n't know what it is about it , but every rotation , ever hair grabbed , is too much pain that one should be having with such a machine . Also , the cord is just too short . I do n't know how to return it , but wish I could . It just lays there now , collecting dust . I 'll be looking for and replacing with the original if I can , with its completely reasonable pain level and option to go cord-less .
 Just could not switch it on!Will buy from a department store because this one has the best reviews .
 Ugh . Too painful to tolerate for more than 3 seconds at a time . Stick to shaving and waxing - this product was a major waste of money .
 I did n't receive this item ! I really want it , but I do n't know more what to do ! How can I get it ? Is it in the post yet ? That 's terrible !
 i ordered that 1 month ago . . something went wrong with the shipment and they refun me teling me to purchase the item again and that they would have refund me the shipment fee.so i did and this time they charged me twice , like if i bought the item twice . . once again i never recived anything and isended email to the customer service asking fr a refound but nobod replyed ... and now the ask me for a review ????
 I thought this device had laser hair removal to it . Mainly because I searched under laser hair removal ... Once I got it ... I noticed it had no laser and that hairs grow back within three weeks . It says it 's like using forty tweezers ... This may be good for the legs ... . But thats all ...
 It hurts ! I ca n't stand the pain , my skin gets red and stays like that for another week . I do not recommend for women with sensitive skin .
 I have a hairy chest and stomach which was the main area I was going to use it on . My hairs are dark and thick . I followed the instructions and went on with usage . The machine does work as I looked at the hairs it was pulling out and could tell they came straight out of the root - However , my hairs are just to thick and deep and I ended up getting really red , irritated skins that lasted for a few days as well as blood coming out of a lot of spots where the hair came from.If your hair is thick like mine I would suggest waxing . I believe it works great on women 's thick hair but not guys horse hair like mine .
 I just recieved my epilator a few days ago . Today , I was so thrilled to finally get to use it ; I wanted smoothless skin everywhere too ! So , after reading so many reviews , I first thought , maybe everyone who said it hurt was just wimps , but no , they are not . I am a wimp ! This sucker hurt so bad , I am not even kiddinG , I could n't even finish after two minutes ! I have no idea what I am to do with this ` satan ' hair remover . I am so scared to try it again !! I will say the one tiny patch I was able to do , is hairless and smooth , but I honestly must say it was terrible and felt like an hour !!! I really ca n't say if I will ever be able to totally complete my bikini area . I have never been so frightened in my life . Let 's just say , that a tattoo on my side was a piece of cake compared to the epilator . One perck , is that the shaver worked very well . Another purchase you may consider is the `` Princereigns '' - Ingrown hair serum . . I bought both product together , and after going through the nightmare with the epilator , I must say that the serum really soothed it . I hope someone can give me some advise on getting through this . Good luck !!
 I BOUGHT THIS EPILATOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO AND IT WORKED FINE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT THEN I USED IT AGAIN AND THE POWER JUST KEPT TURNING OFF
 It does n't hurt , actuallly it is quite nice to use -LRB- on legs -RRB- but it does n't do a good job at taking the hair from the root . It cuts many hairs , so those hairs come back as if you have shaven them . I was n't able to use it for underarms . It just does n't take anything out . Bikini line , tried once , but I need to get more courage to try again . it takes about 5 strokes to get it right.Nice handle , would n't buy the same one again .
 I found this product disappointing . It works well on my armpits but that 's about it . The process is incredibly tedious when it comes to the legs and , since my hair grows at different speeds , my legs are NEVER completely smooth . It is impossible not to miss spots as well . So , if I want somewhat smooth legs , I 'm having to pull out the epilator every other day , waste alot of time attempting to find new/missed spots , clean up the epilator , vacuum , just believe me . . it 's tedious . The ingrown hair problem can not be overlooked either . I 've gone back to shaving my legs b/c it works better and is less annoying . Yep , it sucks to be a girl .
 I recieved the epilator and decided to return within the same day . I bought this because I wanted longer lasting smooth skin . I have blonde hair , but I read some reviews saying that it worked on blonde hair , but alas , no . I ran it repeatedly over the same spot , but it did n't lift the hair . The pain was n't too bad -LRB- but maybe that 's because it was n't working ? -RRB- , and I really liked the smart light , but I could never imagine using it on the bikini area . Definite cons - the the noise ! and the short cord . It would have been even better if it was a wet/dry type one -LRB- and if it worked on blonde/soft hair -RRB-
 Despite the fact that the reviews said you could hardly feel anything , i felt EVERYTHING ! I do not get regular waxing done , so maybe that 's a prerequisite . After a couple of really solid attempts and a lot of screaming i gave it up . If you 're like me and you do n't like pain this might not be a product for you . Plus it left ugly red bumps on my legs that did not go away after a couple of days . I did use the shaver portion for about 9 months , but then that broke and now it 's completely useless .
 I decided to purchase this product based on the reviews that I read on Amazon . Well , they led me astray . Enormously ! This product created ingrown hairs on every inch of my body . PLUS , this product hurts so badly !!!! I am very tolerant to pain -LRB- I ran , training for a marathon , with a broken foot for over a week and did n't even know it was broken , but knew my foot hurt -RRB- . Anyway , this product is absolutely impossible . I am going to stick to Nair and my razor thank you very much!I used this product on my legs and arms with the same , very painful , results from both locations . I was really hoping that I would be able to use this on my underarms . NEVER EVER !!!
 Based on opinions from others , I purchased this Braun Silk epilator 5270 . The pain is tolerable but the problem is , is like when I tried getting waxed , my hair breaks instead of being pulled out . I ca n't say it 's the fault of the product but I wo n't be using it anymore . If my hair did n't break , I think it would be a fine product .
 I started using this product on my legs at the beginning of last summer , and at first I loved it . I have very dark and fast growing leg hair and just hours after I would shave my legs they would start to feel prickly . After using the epilator my legs finally felt smooth and I was really excited . I used it about every other day until winter when I decided that it was a little to time consuming and I went back to shaving.Well , now I really regret ever using the epilator , my legs are covered in red spots where the hair has become ingrown and some spots are infected . It looks awful , almost like I have chicken pox all over my calves . I 'm glad that this epilator is working for some people but if there was even a chance that this would happen to someone else I definitely could not recommend it !
 Ouch ! Ouch ! Ouch ! Ouch ! Ouch !!!! Did I mention ouch ? This is one of the most painful things I have ever experiences and it did n't even get all the hair .
 Hurt like crazy and did n't get the hair out . Was horribly disappointed . It would be perfect for someone is masochistic who prefers having hairy legs and pits and is just into pain .
 Based on all the positive reviews , I decided to get the Silk-epil to see if it was any better than my Emjoy Optima and it 's not . It was a big disappointment . Whether using it on the epilator setting or on the shaving setting , it misses the majority of my hairs which makes it a waste of time and a waste of money . And I 'm not new to epilating , so I know how to use one and what to expect via results.It could be that I got a defective product but some how I do n't think so . My advice is to skip this one and go for the Emjoy Optima .
 I think this product does an okay job . One thing I dont like is that I still have red marks on my legs where the hair was torn out and that was a week ago . Maybe it will just take some time for my skin to get used to it . I sure wish I could afford a nono -LRB- an at home laser hair removal system -RRB- though .
 The attachments fall of as you are using it and you spend more time picking up the parts from the floor than using it . I returned it .
 This was definitely not designed by a woman . I have never experienced this much pain , I have 3 kids and tattoos all over , but the pain this caused is wayyyy worse . Just imagine 40 pairs of tweezers pulling the hair from your bikini zone all at once . OUCH !!!
 I 'm not sure what the difference between this and my old Epilady is , but it just does n't work as well.I noticed the little tweezers , one size is metal and does the motion , the other side is a stationary plastic wall . This is different than the Epilady which has a full-on tweezer action where both sides come together.All it does is cut off my hair - I might as well be shaving.I gave it more than one chance and it 's just not doing what I need it to do so I 'm returning it even though I will only be getting a partial refund.I am Asian , so I have pretty strong hair follicles , about medium to thin thickness . I would not recommend to anyone with similar hair .
 I can take a lot of pain , I have plucked my leg hairs and my mustache with a tweezer but this `` braun epilator '' was a whole new level of pain . As painful as waxing , but more direct pain.I do not think this amount of pain is worth not having to shave in `` 1 week '' . It doesnt even get that close and it misses hairs . And i can not imagine putting this on my bikini line.The rollers go so fast , that i felt like a was going to give myself an electric shock . Girls , this is not worth the money . As much as i wanted this to work , it is too painful for live humans , for cadavers it might work ok.Dont waste your money like i did . No epilators work well , unless you can deal with extreme levels of physical pain.It has been months now and I still havent the courage to try to use this machine again . I really am not exaggerating , i really wanted this to work , but it was torture.I wasted $ 50 that I wish that I had back . I wish someone told me , please , dont buy this product . So , im telling you , think about it , read more reviews , do more research . Or youll wish you had your $ 50 so you could eat at the Olive Garden .
 I purchased this item awhile back because I was tired of shaving and waxing all the time so I research and looked at reviews for good epilators to put my money in since epilators do n't come cheap . I ended up buying this one and I was planning on it to be painful because it is pulling from the hair but I am disappointed at the results I received from this product . It did n't take long before my hair grew back , within a week and I understand that there 's different cycles that hair grows but this product is not efficient and wastes my time . It works well in the underarms better than my legs but to do my underarms , it takes five minutes each because I have to go over and over the same area for this epilator to pull my unwanted hair . On legs , I take up at least 45 minutes and I 'm a very small girl and even when I go over and over making sure I get every part of my leg , the next day , I would notice a couple of hairs that the epilator did not get . Epilating in my opinion is the most painful thing I have ever done on my body , even getting a tattoo does n't surpass . I bought this product expecting good results and less time spent on removing unwanted hair but it 's only decent for my underarms and another thing is that it leaves ingrowns on my legs and underarms where I never had before epilating . This is the first epilator that I bought and I 'm not sure if I plan on getting another epilator from another brand because this product let me down .
 I wanted a product to get rid of my fine hairs after my No No device died . And let me tell you , I was scared from the minute I turned it on . The noise , the pain ; this thing is a monster . Please someone suggest something that will work on fine hairs on the body as well as the face .
 Bought this product because of some so called `` good '' reviews . This epilator quite simply does not remove hair easily . In order to remove the hair , it must be pretty long and I found that I had to go over the same area repeatedly . It 's just not that good . Do n't waste your money . Amazon was great in allowing me to return this product and get a full refund . GO AMAZON !
 Yeah , it epilates ... but I found that it would grab my hairs and my hairs would break in the middle instead of being pulled by the root . What a disaster . It hurt like a mofo too .
 I got this epilator almost 2 years ago , and I use it every so often to see if it 'll magically work for me . Two years later , still no luck . I got it to use on my legs and I was so disappointed with the results . I followed the instructions exactly , but it still only broke the hairs instead of removing it completely from the root -LRB- I can tell because I ca n't see the rounded root of the hair it ripped out -RRB- . I was n't left with smooth results at all , even after doing it several days in a row . It really is painful , but you 're ripping hair out , so that should be expected and has nothing to do with my rating . I just could n't get this to work for me . It 's a shame because it was extremely expensive.By the way , if anybody has any tips in case I 'm somehow doing this wrong , please respond to this review . Again , this was really expensive and I hate to waste money .
 I always used a braun epilator . They are great but this time Amazon disappointed me as I received a faulty piece . I had ordered one for my travel purposes and had carried it new . I didnt get a chance to open it while I was here . It never worked . The plates were not aligned well -LRB- probably -RRB- as it kept getting stuck and didnt pluck hair really well . I stopped using it immediately . I didnt have a chance to return it as I was travelling . I am sure Amazon will take better care in shipping products . Please be careful with what you receive and check your order as soon as it arrives .
 First off , I 'm a guy who happens to be extremely hairy . I end up spending 70 dollars a month to get my chest and back waxed in order to keep the wife happy and from calling me ` Wolf Man ' . My wife ordered this product thinking it would be a ` fun ' -LRB- by fun I mean getting the chance to torture me -RRB- , and inexpensive way to remove my excess body hair.I did all of the proper prep . I took a hot shower , and ensured the hair on my chest and back was trimmed using a Wahl trimmer . The first pass of this thing on my back was unbearable pain . The second pass on my chest was n't any better , and I put a stop to it after that . Of course my wife is rolling on the floor in laughter at my pain and excessive use of profanity.I ended up returning this product , and will just stick with waxing once a month.I have a whole new respect for women , and what they go through in order to stay beautiful .
 When I started looking for a product to remove hair from the bikini area , I went between this and the Philips bikini hair removal system . I went for this -LRB- initially -RRB- because it got slightly better reviews . Huge mistake ! HUGE . I lost hair and skin using this on the bikini area and it was horribly painful . I am used to the pain of waxing so I consider myself to have a high threshold . If you want this for the legs , I think it would be wonderful . But for the bikini area , go for the Philips .
 I have thin blond hairs on my legs . I tried this and it hurt quite a lot and it did n't remove very well at all . -LRB- I had to run it over the same area on my leg several times and even then it was not completely smooth -RRB- . On top of that , i got the most horrid red bumps on the areas i used this product on , which was thankfully remedied with severe globs of jergens lotion . I think this works best on people with thicker hair maybe ? because then the device can really grab the hairs . Anyway , you will be pleased to know that I returned it and got a refund -LRB- at least i was -RRB- . Hope this review was helpful ; Happy hair removing !
 Okay , so I saw all the wonderful reviews and thought I found a cheaper way to `` wax . '' Boy was my head high up in the clouds . I guess one thing I should have looked for in the reviews was the thickness of the person 's hair . My legs rival a brillo pad . I have my legs waxed but the hair still grows out pretty coarse and thick . Guess I should thank my parents ' genes for that one . Anyway , right off the bat I realized I made a mistake purchasing the silk-epil . Not only did it hurt like `` insert word '' , it barely took any hair with it . You have to hold it at a complete 90 degree angle and pray with every stroke for it to nab just a few hairs . The rest of your skin is left looking like you took up giving yourself lashes . Mind you , I was n't pressing into the skin at all - following the instructions to the letter . I , in my brilliant state of mind , decided that `` gee , I must be missing something here '' and tried my other leg . Heaven help me ! I am so sorry for all the wrong I have ever done . Please make the pain stop ! My legs are now burning , red and ready to walk away from me on their own . I have a very high tolerance for pain but this broke all barriers . Moral of my experience
 I bought this braun 5270 and I thought I made a good choice but I was wrong.It doaes n't do its job very good leaving short hair behind . I do n't recomend this product to anybody . It was a gift and the person did n't like it , she said philips are better .
 767 reviews and 4.5 stars . you automatically think it 's an awesome product and put aside those reviews with one star or two star rating thinking those negatives happen to few unfortunate people . But then that unfortunate things happens to you and then you realize the importance of those bad reviews.This products is amazing . I have been shaving my legs for almost 10 years now and few weeks ago I thought `` why not go for epilation which will leave me hairless for few weeks ? '' I googled the best epilator and read dozens of articles and zeroed in on braun silk epil x ` elle . I tried the product . It was amazing . The pain which I dreaded so much after reading many reviews turned out to be bearable.I felt I truly loved this amazing product . It left my legs so smooth and hairless that I just loved it and thought I finally found the ultimate method of hair removal . For the next week and half I ended up admiring my `` new '' legs a whole bunch of times in a day . After a week and half , it all began ... one red bump -LRB- with an ingrown hair in it -RRB- after the other erupted until in a few days my legs were covered with red bumps . I panicked and researched like crazy about remedies to ingrown hairs . After trying like crazy to tweeze the ingrown hair out with tweezers , I bought B & C skin tight ingrown hair solution and tried it for two days and ordered prince reigns solution online . I stopped using prince reigns -LRB- very expensive -RRB- as after two applications there was only 3/4 remaining in the bottle.Its been a week . Now although the red bumps have decreased in number , my legs have tiny hairs all growing right under the skin making it look like I have n't shaved . So it pretty much looks like I have some rash on my legs covered with hair . In my ten years of shaving I never had ingrown hairs . I just hope the hair frees out of the skin so I can happily go back to shaving . Am never using this epilator again!If anyone knows what to do about these ingrown hairs , please help me out .
 Well , I used the product for several weeks very happily . After that , I began getting really disgusting ingrown hairs all over my legs . I mean ... ALL over.That was March 2010 . It is now February 2011 . I still ca n't wear skirts or shorts because of how horrible my legs look . They 're still covered in ingrown hairs that ca n't be cured by any amount of exfoliating , lathering in lotion -LRB- 3-5 times per day -RRB- . I 've seen a dermatologist and he 's given me medicated lotion . No avail . I just want my legs back !! This is a horrible , horrible device , DO NOT BUY .
 I bought this because I was tired of hair-removers that did n't work and shaving.I tried it knowing that it was going to be uncomfortable . Uncomfortable is not theword to describe how it feels . It is PAINFUL and may leave little dots of blood behind.It also misses some of the hair even though you go over the same area a lot!I would not recommend this product to anyone but those with reptilian-like skin.It is PAINFUL and DANGEROUS !
 Purchased it this afternoon , took it home & was SO excited to use it ! I have been growing out my underarm hair for weeks-just waiting for this day to come . I read the instructions -LRB- keep at 90 degree angle -RRB- and plugged it in . The first thing I felt was a tiny pinch , the hair being pulled out obviously . Then , everything after that was the most horrendous pain I have ever felt ! I have given BIRTH , had over four tattoo 's , waxed , shaved , threaded-you name it ! THIS , by far , was the WORST pain I have ever felt ! I tried it in every darn direction and it SNAGGED my skin and ripped it to shreds ! Both of my underarms are red and tender from where the skin got torn off and it 's been 8 hours already -LRB- it 's 11 pm and I did it at 3 pm -RRB- . Other bad things
 I purchased this product in May 2009 , as an alternative to waxing . I was using it every six weeks or so , and by the end of the year , my legs had turned into this monstrous web of hairs growing under a thin layer of skin . The ingrown hairs cause bumps , sometimes become infected and as a result , my legs are all scarred with dark spots everywhere . If I need to wear a skirt , I need to apply leg makeup even under pantyhose.I have olive skin with medium dark hairs , and I do n't know if my type of skin has a tendency for ingrown hairs . If you are going to buy this product , test first ... or you will risk paying $ 60 on the epilator plus $ 100 on creams and lotions , a couple thousand on permanent hair removal -LRB- which does not entirely solve the problem -RRB- and a few other hundred on skin treatments to minimize the scars .
 I bought it accoding to its higher review value . Now regret.Itself looks nice , but Very noisy ! Always break the hair into shorter , instead of get it out.Won ' t recommed it !
 I heard really great reviews for this , but to be honest , I was n't completely satisfied . I was ready for the pain , that was n't really a big deal . But if you are thinking about buying this product because of the little rollers ; DO N'T - they 're useless and scratch your skin . Also , it felt like it was cutting the hair rather than actually pulling it all the way out , because I have had to use this everyday for nearly two weeks and my legs are still not completely smooth . The shaver is useless as well , even if I went four-five days without shaving , I 'd still be smoother than I would with that thing . I 'm really not impressed-I expected a LOT more out of this than what I got . The reviews were what persuaded me into buying it , but I was very dissapointed .
 I was very excited to receive this product and start using it . And it worked great in the beginning . The pain was a little strong at start , but it got better with each use . I even did my underarms and bikini area!However , 3 months after using it weekly it started to take longer to epilate each leg . Two weeks later I notice it was n't grabbing any hair . It did n't matter how slow I moved it along my leg , nothing was pulled out . My only hypothesis is the hair was growing back thinner and the epilator could no longer grab it.A call into customer service left me even more disgruntled . I was told my 60 day money-back guarantee had expired . After going through my user 's guide , nothing about a 60-day guarantee is even mentioned , so how was I to know I was under a deadline ? I was told I could buy a new head for it , but it works fine for others who do n't use it on a regular basis . And I do n't want to invest any more money in a product I lost faith in.I hope it works better for you than I , but remember if you do n't like it you only have 60 days !
 i 'm not a review writer , but wanted to say that this epilator is awful . i 've been epilating for years and years ... it is much better than shaving , hair grows back much slower and much thinner over time . HOWEVER , this machine is awful . it definitely gets rid of the hairs , but mostly be breaking them at the base , and not by pulling them out from the root as it should . i might as well be shaving since the hair grows back right away . definitely would not waste your money with this machine .
 I purchased this product after reading about ADD and ADHD which I believe my son has . His teacher said he was more restless than usual when I put him on this product . Maybe he just reacted badly , but it did n't work for us .
 did the opposite of calming , felt like I need to run laps , just wound me up more . Not worth the money
 The Futuro brand is a better option , period.I thought I would try a pair of these to make sure I did n't have a better option in the same price range . The top band is too tight around the top of your calf , and the whole area of your foot , including the ankle , is way too loose . No pressure in the ankle area , which is kind of important in these kinds of socks . None of those problems with the Futuro 's , which I wear with khaki 's to work every day now.I 've purchased 5 pair of theFuturo Dress Socks for Men , Brown , Large . My shoe size is 11.5 medium to wide depending on the shoe .
 The pressure seems to be fine from these particular compression socks , however , during the day , it has a tendency to roll down your leg causing uncomfortable pressure points mid to high calf . I only have problems with one leg , so I only need to wear these one at a time , which I do n't think makes a difference in how the top rolls down.Otherwise , they seem very sturdy and have a decent amount of foot room . I have a large foot -LRB- 15 -RRB- and wide too -LRB- 2E -RRB- and it fits in the foot and the ankle quite well . It 's just during the day that these really do n't live up to my standards , they do n't last all day long without adjusting them .
 Worst pair of socks I 've ever owned !! Supremely uncomfortable , makes my feet itch till it also bleeds !! Biggest waste of money ever !!
 I retain ALLOT of fluid in my legs ... many days I have not ankles and they have kangaroo pouches under them !! I 'm a female weighing 220 and 5 ' 5 `` I ordered the XL sizethe first time I tried wearing them my legs cramped up after 6 hoursthe second time I tried them well my legs cramped up after 2.5 hours !! Andsaying they do n't constrict at the top !! WRONG !!!!!!!! YES THEY DO!sorry NO GOOD In my bookif you ca n't tolerate wearing them they do n't do any good !
 I ordered these really thinking I was on to something buying only the moderate compression as opposed to say medium compression socks which are just too restrictive and intense for what I put my socks through . Unwrapping the package and slipping into these babies was not the warm apple pie feeling I had envisioned . They are just normal tube socks with a fancy name . 20-30 mm ? Yeah Right . More like 18-25 . Try again Activa .
 these socks are not medium support . although they look like athletic socks , possibly due to cotton content , the compression is not there . you are better off buying a socks with high nylon or spandex and then just putting a regular pair of socks over them . this works great too , for airport travel , when you need to take off your shoes at security . put compression socks on first then your regular socks so when you get to security you can take off your shoes , walk on the bacteria filled carpet there and then remove your outer socks and get back into your shoes with your clean nylon socks . excellent for infection prone folks who need to protect their feet .
 The socks are not as advertised . They are crew-length , not Over the Calf length.If you want true `` Over the Calf '' or `` Knee High '' socks , these are NOT the ones to buy .
 good construction but ran small and didnt do well after a was even though I followed instructions . Might be taking a chance here .
 they are nice . I really like them . They get dirty though so make sure you wear them with slippers or foot covers . They do n't clean back as white as you might like them .
 I 've been looking for a good cleaner for exterior vinyl siding that is eco-friendly . This is not it . Tried it at 5 times the recommended strength and it still did n't do much .

 I 've had a wrist issue for years , and in the past I had a different -LRB- and much better -RRB- wrist brace . I was hoping this would be a replacement , but it is simply cheap and uncomfortable . Yes , it braced my wrist , but it hurt with any prolonged wear period . I returned it and bought the one I needed -LRB- made by OTC -RRB- that is much higher quality and aligns my wrist properly .
 I found this wrist splint to be of poor designand low quality materials . It did n't help myCT at all . There is almost no padding and theneoprene is a little stiff and makes youwant to itch . There are much better wristsplints for the same price or less . The oneI have currently has very nice padding and iswell designed with very nice materials , and Ionly payed 14.00 for it .
 This Black Hair product did not cover my wife 's Gray Hair at all ... It did , however turn her Gary Hair a nice bright coppery orange ...
 Please do n't waste your money . This product if horrible . This product says 2 bags , it actually means that they 're are two bags of product to use in one session . It takes alot of time to use this product . Over 4 hours . You apply the first bag of product and time it , then rinse it , and apply the other bag of henna , time it , and rinse . It claims to cover grey . It only tints it slightly . But you do n't read this until you get the product and its in the instructions . Nothing wrong with the seller or their service .
 I was excited to see that you could achieve a brown color with a henna product . Or so I thought . The information on the web site does n't contain important points that would enable you to make an informed decision to purchase this product . There is a very detailed color chart included with the product that is not provided on the web site . This would be the first step in making an informed decision to purchase . The color chart revealed that in fact , this product will not produce light brown results , but a variety of reddish tones.The web site also does n't explain the lengthy , cumbersome , messy and complicated process involved in actually using the product . Well at least I think it is all those things , because frankly I wo n't even be trying the product based upon the instructions . It was n't that expensive so it is not worth it to return it , but I hope that better information is provided in the future to avoid someone else having a disappointing purchase experience .
 Pros :1 . Usually accurate2 . Tracking software works wellCons :1 . Poor quality2 . Pressure button gives different results based on where your thumb is positioned3 . Unit freezes occasionally4 . Much too expensive for what you getThis little machine would be worth the money if the company would have put a little more effort into quality . The unit feels cheaply made . Mine is a week old and already a button is broken . The unit also freezes occasionally and also sometimes gives crazy readings for no reason . However , the tracking software works as advertised and is useful.Save your money and frustration and buy a caliper from a different company and use that with the tracking software that is downloadable from the company website . This product is not worth $ 70 ; $ 15 - $ 20 would be more appropriate .
 I bought it several months ago but i did not use it . . first of all it tells you to target a spot around your waist and measures the fat . . but the next time you do it , the numbers are different . . It is almost impossible to measure exactly the same spot as you measured last time ... Not accurate and total waste of money atleast for me . .
 I sent back the Fattrack Pro and luckily got a refund . It was a total hassle to even put in the date and time ! This product , in my opinion , does not lend itself to convienent , easy home body fat measuring . See my review on the cheap , but terrific Accu-measure , for a product that 's reliable and easy to use .
 First of all , this stuff did n't help me sleep at all that I could tell . It was basically like taking nothing . But , I figured I shelled out a lot of money for the pills so I kept taking them on the chance that maybe they did help a little . However , after a couple of weeks I noticed that I 'd been feeling unuasually irritable and depressed . I figured maybe it was depression or maybe even a touch of midlife crisis . But why did it just hit me so hard and so quickly ? So I started thinking about what had changed in my life over the last couple of weeks . All my worries were the same worries I 'd had before . And then it occurred to me that I 'd started taking the Sleep MD. . I immediately stopped taking it and within two days started feeling much better . Coincidence ? I doubt it . After all , the stuff is designed to drag you down in one way or another.Do yourself a favor and save your money . It 's not worth it . Take a melatonin instead . It 's a lot cheaper and probably just as effective .
 I purchased a package at The Vitamin Cottage last week because they were organic . Like other organic products like Jasons and Toms , they did not do a thing for me . These are by far the most useless lozenges I 've had in 35 years .
 The documentation that comes with the product states a 220 weight capacity , not 250 pounds as described online . There is also a warning not to exceed weight limit . Back it goes .
 I bought this product to do my part with the environmental craze . I like using it around my daughter , as it has no harsh fumes , and the scent is very nice . I like to clean the tub before giving her a bath in the bath/shower that her father and I use everyday . When I use this product frequently -LRB- like every-other day or so , -RRB- it does a fine job . But if I have n't cleaned the tub in over a week , it does n't quite cut through the soap scum . I end up using the scrubbing bubbles , and having to have the vent on in the bathroom to get rid of the fumes before I dare to take my little girl in the room.I would say that this product is good for light cleaning , or a single person , but it is n't up to the task of heavier jobs , or multiple-person families .
 I bought this hair removal kit to use on my bikini area . Not only was it the worst pain ever , it also left most of the wax on my skin and did n't remove much of my hair . A couple of weeks later I figured I would give it another try and use it on my legs . Needless to say I had the same outcome as the first time I used it . Do n't buy this product !!
 I bought this product because it 1 -RRB- had cloth strips instead of plastic , 2 -RRB- was cheaper than going to an actual salon -LRB- $ 60 -RRB- , and 3 -RRB- had all these promises of ginseng and lavender and whatnot.The Process
 I bought this product without reading its review , previously i had used sally hansen no heat gel so i thought to try this one . I had purchased it at Walgreen . I had to microwave it for a total of 60 sec at 30 sec then at interval of 10 sec each before it was thin enough to be applicable . The wax was very very sticky sort of and it was good that i had placed a newspaper on the slab otherwise i would have been very difficult for me to clean . It did remove all the hair but it was little painful so i did n't try it on my underarms . The little traces of the wax on the skin did n't go away with soap and water and it was very sticky . Its water insoluble so does n't dissolve in water . I tried nailpolish remover to remove it but didnt work , then finally i applied almond oil n rubbed it . That helped only to some extent . In total i was dissappointed with this product . I would instead prefer to use no heat gel by same company rather than this one.The only good thing was it did remove hair but left me with a bigger mess to clean .
 I bought this product only because it was the last one , out of other brands I prefer , that was on the shelf . Went home , heated it up ... . its very gooey and drippy , and applied it . Not only was it EXTREMELY EXTREMELY STICKY , -LRB- good for legs , bad for hands -RRB- but the wax starts hardening in about 2 minutes ... . i had to keep microwaving it that i got soo sick of it and just threw it away !! it gets everywhere !!! i scrubbed and scrubbed in the shower to get parts off and even shaved the parts i didnt get and the wax was still there !!! i scrubbed soo much my skin was raw ! even the parts that i did wax had some hair here and there that the wax missed . THE BOX MAKES IT SOUND SO FANCY AND THAT IT SMELLS GOOD AND BLAH BLAH BLAH ... . BUT DONT BE FOOLED !!!! NEVER WILL I BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN NOR WILL I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE !!! save your money and buy something else ... . its $ 9.00 for a reason ! Its horrible !!!!
 the lavender smells nice . but be VERY careful not to over heat this.i accidently overheated it -LRB- i 'm used to a different kind of wax that takes longer to heat up -RRB- and spilled it all over . it got hot boiling wax on my arm and all over the microwave and stove and the floor.i would n't of boughten this if they did n't have the other kind of bikini wax i wanted.i tried it on my legs , and it kinda works . i never have much luck with waxing my legs.the kit is pretty good . sally hansen is a good brand to buy.i hope you have better luck than i did with it . and be careful heating it up .
 The single WORST product i have ever used in my entire life.i heated it , applied it to my legs and it wouldnt come off , the strip would only pick up half the wax and the rest remained stuck to my skin . and nothing would make it budge , not the purple oil , not baby oil , not body lotion , nothing . half a bottle of pharmacy alcohol and an hour of rubbing left a residue which took a week to disappear . and the cherry on top of the cake was the massive ugly unsightly bruise it left behind ... not to mention the fact that it picked up 3 strands of hair and left the rest.i threw it straight into the garbage which is where it belongs.DONT WASTE UR MONEY . its awful . the person who invented this thing should be full body waxed with this product . that might teach him/her not to foist disgusting stuff on the unsuspecting public .
 This stuff SEVERELY irritated my skin . The whole area i waxed , even after 2 days is still all red and rashy . this better go away or i 'll sue . TERRIBLE product !!!
 After reading the directions carefully , I applied the wax hopeful that I could wear a swimsuit the next day with confidence giving my skin enough time to adjust -LRB- which the directions stated was possible -RRB- . That was not the case . After applying the wax exactly as instructed and pulling the strip , it made me immediately bleed ... a lot ! What I did to one side , I must do to the other . I continued to use it , hoping it would result in a better outcome . That was not the case . Not only did it make me bleed after every pull , but it ripped my skin as well leaving large , splotchy , red marks all over with no solution to disguise.Not only am I not happy with the results , but the mess it left behind was horrendous ! It is water soluble so it does NOT come off with soap & water ... I knew that , but there was not nearly enough removal oil in the box in came with to take off all the sticky wax it left behind . I literally was in tears trying to get the wax off of me , my counter and sink.I have a really difficult time trying to understand how a product like this has been approved for consumer use . Save yourself all the hassle and STAY AWAY from this product !!!
 This is the messiest home waxing kit I have ever bought ! Just pulling the lid off started the disaster of purple wax all over everything . After spending 20 minutes trying to get it off my skin I spent another 30 getting it out of my sink . Super Glue was easier to remove from my skin and counter then this stuff . Do n't waste your money !
 I 've waxed at home before so I jumped right in and spread it on the bikini area ... IT TOOK ME AN HOUR to get it off my skin . The worst part is that it is so sticky and tacky that it did n't really remove the hair . Not a part of the body that tolerates the struggle to remove the wax . Spare yourself .
 Product will remove hair but only comes with a tiny bottle to remove the wax from anywhere it remains . Even then , I always find I miss a place . So when I remove my pants for bed , I 'll find black fuzzy splotches all over my leg where the pants material has stuck to the remaining wax.Sally Hansen 's wax products have really declined . They discontinued their two best wax hair removal kits
 This product was a big waste of money ! I did not know that `` spa '' wax would be so sticky ! The directions say to use a thin layer of wax ; obviously I do n't know what thin is because when I use the strips , I end up pulling off SOME of the wax and no hair and the strip is then useless . I have already gone through half the bottle of finishing oil just cleaning up my skin from ONE application . The mess this product creates is definitely NOT worth the money I spent or the aggravation .
 Worst wax i have ever used . It ripped a layer of my skin off and now i a huge brown mark on my thigh and welts all over the back of my legs . This should be taken off the market !!!
 This is the worst wax I have ever used . Not only does it not come off , but it tore my legs apart . It left my legs bruised from scrubbing the wax off with both the oil provided and soap and water .
 I generally like Sally Hansen products but have to concur with the other negative reviews here . It was so messy , so sticky and so ineffective that I actually came online specifically to warn other people off this product . I 've tried other waxing products and never anything so nightmarish as this .
 Admittedly , waxing your own legs is a messy process , but even with usual precautions , this wax GETS EVERYWHERE AND DOES NOT COME UP.WEEKS LATER I 've carried specks of it to the couch -LCB- from unknown bits on the floor ? -RCB- and I 've NO idea how to get it up . The bottle of `` remover '' is an unknown substance that was not much bigger than a perfume sample and nowhere near enough to clean up my own legs , much less the rest.Stay away , whatever the chemistry of these Sally Hansen waxes is/are , THEY DO N'T GO AWAY.I 'm afraid to put the towel I used in the wash for fear of finding those little bits on future loads of laundry .
 DO NOT BUY !! This product is the WORST ! It is very difficult to manage and good luck getting off of ANYTHING it touches , including your skin . It is so far from water soluble it is not even funny . Doesnt wash off of skin , remains sticky , I couldnt even get it out of the sink when I dripped a little . SO much work , a nightmare to clean up , and frustrating to use . Accidentally dripped some on my arm , and we had to SHAVE it out because it is like some horrible super sticky cement . DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!
 This is probably the worst wax I have tried . It does remove most of the hair , but it is impossible to get off of your skin ! The supplied oil helps some , but it 's still a pain . Do n't try with cloth strips as it wo n't rinse off the strips and will clog your drain ! There are MUCH better waxes out there . My favorite is NadsNad 's No-Heat Hair Removal Gel , 6 oz -LRB- 170 g -RRB- or Sally Hansen honey wax using CLOTH STRIPS -LRB- not supplied in the kit -RRB- Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Body Wax Women by Sally Hansen , 1 Count . Tip
 This is a really BAD wax . I have been waxing for more than ten years now and have never experienced what I did with this wax . My underarms were sore for almost three days.Dont believe the review of the 4/5 stars.JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT !
 I have been waxing my underarms and bikini area for years now and never have I had this much trouble with any wax I used . The product is EXTREMELY sticky and you can not wash it off with soap or water . They provide an oil to take it off the skin but the quantity is not enough and it doesnt work on other surfaces like countertops . Not to mention it doesnt pull all the hair off and it tore my skin instead . Beware , this wax is extremely painful , useless and messy . This is coming from someone who has waxed for years and never complained about pain .
 bought this for my 12yr old daughter . this was one of the most traumatic experiences that either of us have had . followed directions . trying to apply it was a joke ! sticky gunk every where ! when removing from area intended to wax , removed chunks of skin ! Thank God tried on small area first ! you may think result occured because she is 12 . she has been waxing -LRB- by professional -RRB- since she was 10 . this was a scene from a bloody horror movie . would not recomend this for anyone !!! For those concerned , my daughter has a condition that caused her to grow very thick pubic hair when she was 3 . She can not shave this area do to EXTREME ingrown hairs and irritation . Her medical specialist suggested we try waxing . I did alot of research and asked alot of questions . What i did not research was this cheap product . Very dumb i know .
 I have been using the Sally Hansen sugar hair removal product for years with good results -LRB- almost as good as the much more expensive NADS -RRB- . I thought I would try the wax and found it to be VERY effective for removing hair but almost impossible to cleanup . It stuck to everything it touched -LRB- sink , counter -RRB- and I could n't find anything to remove it . When I put the cloth strips I used and the wash cloths in the washer , the wax got all over the washer and on every other piece of clothing in there . I called the company to try to find some help and they had no clue and did not seem to care . I do n't remember any warning that this was a problem on the instructions . I felt it was my civic duty to warn others . Hope this helps
 I 'm new to waxing and bought this for my legs and bikini area . Regardless of how thick or thin I spread on the wax , it did a poor job and the paper strips did not remove all the wax from my skin . It was not as painful as I expected for a wax product , but left behind a sticky purple residue that would not come off with the oil included in the kit or soap and water . I followed the directions carefully and was left with a huge mess and little hair removal .
 I have been using home-waxing kits for a few years now . I 've tried a few products and settled with Nair sugar-based wax - it 's effective and really easy to clean . It has become impossible to find it in the stores , so I tried the Sally Hansen version instead . Never again . I got purple wax all over the place , and it 's really difficult to clean up . Plus , my hair grew back in oh say a week or so . I have never had this problem with any other wax products . Plus , it was really hard to spread on my skin and I ran out of strips . I will never buy this product again .
 I used this product twice -LRB- foolishly -RRB- , and each time it ripped the skin off of my body ! The first time was just a small bit so I thought I 'd try it again a month later . My skin is now open to infection and I could have permanent scarring . I have received no reply from customer service either . DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT .
 This stuff does a good job of removing hair , but as others have noted previously , it is an utter pain to clean up . The first time using it is the easiest as the jar that the wax comes in is clean . But after the first use , the wax gets all over the outside of the container , the lid becomes impossible to screw back on because wax gets onto the rim of the container , and it is nearly impossible NOT to get bits of the wax all over everything . While you can clean some of it off of hard surfaces , be extremely careful not to get the wax on any cloth objects.When I was cleaning up , I grabbed the jar of wax by the lid -LRB- very stupid in retrospect -RRB- because I thought the lid would be stuck shut on the container -LRB- this is what had happened after the first use -RRB- . Instead , the container fell and spilled all over some clothing . I 'm guessing that it 's going to be pretty much impossible to get the wax off.I 've used other Sally Hansen kits that had different kind of wax that came in a little block that you melt in the microwave . I found this product equally good at removing hair and much easier to clean up afterward .
 Per Mrs. John Kelly ... This product is thick and does NOT DISSOLVE with soap and water . It will not come off towels and washcloths . Must be scraped off of counters right away to avoid staining cultured marble . Yes , it works for waxing -- but getting it off skin requires scrubbing with the included oil -LRB- had to also use several ounces of grapeseed oil to clean skin -RRB- . The HONEY BARE wax product was much better . Will be switching back to Nad 's .
 Before purchasing this product I read the reviews , although the reviews were n't favorable . I decided to give it a chance and it was a big mistake . The wax is way to sticky , the strip removed two strands of hair and the wax was very difficult to remove . Although Sally Hansen has many good products in the market this one is a waste of time and money .
 I 've used many of Sally Hansen 's home waxing kits and they seem to get worse and worse . This one , just like their Brazilian kit were complete disasters . I would have rather gone to a salon and paid to have it done . I just want to warn others to think twice before using it . I think the company must be trying to make the wax stronger and stronger . If that is their goal , they have achieved it . But sorry , I am not a monkey in a lab and do not need super glue strong wax to take my leg hair off.It got all over my fingers , sink , shower floor and nothing but Commet seemed to be able to remove it . I tried all kinds of soap and wash clothes , a horrible mess ! My skin was raw from scrubbing it off and that barely accomplished anything . I used up the bottle of finishing oil it came with in hopes it would help to remove the wax , but thee amount was too little to do much . Finally , my fiance looked up on the Internet how to get wax off and he read baby oil works . I tried it and it really did work ! Thank goodness something worked . And of course , the directions in the box do n't even tell you that . BTW , I DID follow the directions . My microwave is weaker than some , so instead of heating it for 30 sec . I did it for 40 sec and waited a minute before using it , just like the directions said.If you want to use a at home waxing kit that works , if you can find it anywhere anymore , which I am trying to do online to no avail . Use Sally Hansen 's honey wax with cloth strips . Not those plastic strips that do n't work , and especially not the strips with the wax already on it . It was easy to use , got the hair off perfectly fine , and came off in the shower super easy , with just warm water . I do n't know why Sally Hansen ca n't stick with a product that works . Instead , they have to try to keep improving it , and to them that means making it as sticky and hard to remove as possible . It 's just a waxing kit . It worked the way it was , so keep it simple , and do n't change a good thing .
 I 've been waxing for over 10 years now with Sally Hansen products . Tried this one because I could n't find my regular go-to the Brazilian box.The wax was impossible to remove from my skin . Needless to say , i was left with hair in tact , a red rash and a sticky mess to clean up . I ended up getting in the shower to shave , clean and soothe my skin.Waste of money , trust me !
 I have tried this kit twice now . Hoping that over time that pain from this wax would lessen.Now do n't be confused my 2 star come solely from dissatisfaction . Not how well it works . If you use this for your eyebrows it work fairly well misses maybe a few hairs every once in a while , but nothing a tweezers cant fix . How ever use it anywhere else -LSB- for example legs or bikini area -RSB- its a disaster.I tried using the product on the lower part of my legs around my ankles bcuz I always seemed to miss a few hair when shaving . This product worked nicely , but was extremely messy and my hand were so sticky when dealing with the product . When I did more of my leg , the wax was not as consistent and I constantly had to re-heat it only to make a bigger mess . It hurt alot . More than I expected . It felt as if it was ripping my skin with it . But after a few coats it did remove the hair.When I tried using the product on my bikini area . Biggest Mistake . It hurt so much , ripping the skin . It missed a lot of hair , and made the biggest mess . I literally had to use a bottle of baby oil to clean up.SO overall it PAINFUL . MESSY . and Expected for the price .
 For the love of all that is holy , DO N'T buy this product ! My legs are bright red and screaming in pain . The wax got EVERYWHERE and you ca n't wash it off with anything except their `` special oil '' . It did n't even take the hair off my legs ! And now I 'm left with skin so irritated I ca n't even shave -LRB- in the middle of summer -RRB- because half of the skin on my legs is gone : -LRB-
 I bought this waxing system because I liked that it used cloth strips , and came with a pretty good sized jar of wax . But after using it , it 's clear why the product only costs $ 9 . It is the WORST thing I have ever used !! It took a full 3 minutes for the wax to heat up to a usable consistency , instead of the recommended 30 seconds . Even after it 's heated up , the wax is so STICKY it 's impossible to use without getting it all over everything . The only thing that will take off excess wax is the azulene oil that is included in the kit , and they only provide you with a very small bottle of it . I applied the wax exactly how the directions stated , and it still did n't even remove all the hair . It did n't even remove half of it . Then I was left with sticky bits of wax stuck to my skin that are nearly impossible to remove . I would highly discourage anyone who wants to buy this product , it 's such a hassle and the results are n't worth the effort .
 This wax is a painful sticky mess that rips off skin . I thought my technique was off , so I bought some hot wax because I could not stand having one waxed armpit because this wax ripped the skin off and it was too painful to continue . Needless to say the hot wax -LRB- strip free -RRB- was AMAZING ! I have one raw red armpit -LRB- from this product -RRB- and one baby smooth irritation free armpit -LRB- from the hot wax -RRB- . Buy strip free hot wax !!
 Sally Hansen makes some good products , but this is not one of them . The wax is super-sticky , and impossible to remove neatly . It left my skin super-irritated and red for days . Avoid at all costs !
 I 've been using wax hair removal products for years . I 've used Nads and other cold wax products similar to that . I 've used a few hot wax products as well , and I have to say that this one is by far the worst one ever!I have found that most of the hot waxes are made to rinse off with soap and warm water . So , if you get any on your counter top or floor its no big deal . But , this product only comes off with the oil that comes in the box . Even then , you still have to scrape and scrub to get all the wax off . And , depending on where its spilled you may be left with a stain.The bottom line is , this product is way more trouble than its worth , especially since its about the same price as the other hot waxes out there , and it seems to have the same results . If you want a hot wax do n't buy this one !
 I bought this after using Sally Hansen 's Warm Wax -LRB- with Peach Extracts -RRB- product thinking that it would be similar ... it 's NOT . This stuff is like using purple tar to wax with and takes a dozen or more cotton wipes soaked in cooking oil to remove . It tore my skin and took over 10 minutes to take off -LRB- having to rub my poor skin over and over with the wipes to do it -RRB- . It stick to the floor , it sticks to the tub , it sticks to the bottle , it sticks to everything . Do NOT buy this product . Effective , yes , but not worth the pain and mess !!
 I could n't find my usual SurgiWax Brazilian hard wax so I settled for this Sally Hansen product . I always do my own waxing and have never had any issues until I tried this product . It sticks more to your skin than your hair . So much that I think I actually ripped some skin off my inner thigh . It 's very messy even for me that I wax myself regularly . I do not recommend this product at all . The texture is super sticky . TOO sticky if you ask me . Do not buy unless you want unsightly bikini scarring . I hope they fade . I personally recommend SurgiWax hard wax . I should have been more patient instead of buying the Sally Hansen .
 This item is less painful than other products I 've used . I think because the wax really does grip the hair and not the skin . The problem is it is VERY VERY VERY STICKY . Wow . What a huge sticky mess this caused in my bathroom . I 've never had such a poor experience trying to clean up after waxing . I would reccomend the Nair brazilian formula wax over this that comes in the roll on , that rinses off easily .
 I wanted to try this variety of the sally Hansen wax this time . Sadly , I had a lot of problems with it , and I was only using it on my armpits and still could n't get it to work . It 's a shame really ; I recommend the regular Sally Hansen wax instead . That one works better .
 This wax was awful . The wax residue was so difficult to get off ; they provide an extra bottle of some strange smelling liquid to help remove the wax afterwards , but it does n't work well at all and I had sticky patches left all over my legs that I really had to rub at to get off . Good thing it was only my legs ; supposedly this thing works for bikini , too - that would hurt . Do n't buy this . There are much better wax kits -LRB- like Nair -RRB- that are so much easier and less painful to remove with just some water .
 I bought this product because I was tired of shaving not having long enough effects . This product does n't even remove hair . I attempted to use it on my legs and after following every instruction to the letter all it did was make my skin red and stinging . Also , the mess is insane . It took several minutes of scrubbing to even get wax off my hands and I still have n't been able to get it off the area I attempted to wax .
 Be aware when buying this battery ! The picture displays two batteries at double the average price for similar batteries . Reasonable to assume you are purchasing two batteries , but you are not . This is a single battery purchase . Having said that Amazon has amazing Customer Service and took care of this faster than it took me to write this review . I am sure this product picture will be change soon .
 2 D cells in a Maglight flashlight . The Ray o vac batteries leaked inside . Dec 2016 expiration date . It 's now only June 2012 . Ruined the flashlight . Thanks very much Ray o vac . : - -LRB-
 I bought these to use in my newborns swing . They lasted less than two weeks . I bought the eight pack of Duracell and they lasted almost twice as long . This is not worth the money . Plus if you get the subscribe and save of the Duracell , it comes out to almost the same price per battery . Do n't waste your money on these .
 I sent these to my child at sleepaway camp , and when she opened the batteries , they were leaking battery acid and the acid cut her finger ! Not good .
 I have an automatic wastecan and the battery took more than one week to work . I though that it was something wrong with my can , but it was the battery because it started to work a few days ago .
 3 or 4 of these were dead out of the box . The rest died within a couple months of light use . I would not buy these again .
 I have found , as several others have , that Rayovac batteries are more prone to leak than any of the other major alkaline brands . I 've had to throw away 2 Mag-Lite flashlights as a result . I was able to save a third which was still lighting , but I opened it just to check the batteries which appeared a little weak . Just in time ! The Rayovac batteries were leaking , but I was able to clean it up and save the flashlight.Stick with Eveready or Duracell . Best are Eveready Gold , followed by Duracell , then Eveready Energizer . All are excellent batteries . The Eveready Gold cost a little more , but they last longer , so in the end the cost is about the same .
 I have experienced problems with Rayovac Ultra Pro batteries leaking . When I first experienced the problem a couple of years ago , I assumed that it was just a bad battery or a bad batch . I understand that no product or manufacturing process is going to be perfect every time . So , I decided to give Rayovac the benefit of the doubt and I continued to purchase their Ultra Pro batteries for my electronics . Since then , I have continued to see the problem happen . It has now happened more than once with AA , AAA , and D cell batteries . I have never had the problem with their 9V cells or C cells , but I do n't use as many either . All of the batteries that failed were well within their expiration period , stored and used properly , and most were purchased at different times . Tonight it was my 3-Cell MagLite - and this is the last straw for me.Rayovac does provide a warranty/guarantee against battery leaks and product damage , but they require the customer to mail the damaged product and the leaking batteries to them . I think it is unreasonable and potentially hazardous to mess around with the corrosive batteries that are leaking in order to package them up for shipping . Warranty or not , with the frequency of failures that I have experienced , I will not be putting Rayovac batteries in any product that I own again.Update -LRB- 3/10/12 -RRB- : Last night I checked the batteries in my other MagLite flashlights . I was disappointed to discover a second MagLite ruined by leaky Ultra Pros .
 Mine were dated good til 2017 . Bought them in July 2010 . I had used a couple before to top off my flash light . I took them out -LRB- 15 April 2012 -RRB- to fill my Sirius CD/Radio unit . The last one I put in was all slimy , it was wet and some of the others were too . I cleaned up my CD/radio and washed all of the batteries off . Only one cell was leaking , but it was a mess . Never again with Ray O Vac .
 Hi I bought this item some time ago along with camping lamp used it ones and put it away for little while and last night I opened this little lamp and it started working weird , flashing dimming etc. so I opened battery container and all batteries where floating in it 's chemicals . Great !
 I 've always used , and loved , the Aramis Lab Series lip balm . Since that product was discontinued I 've been looking for an adequate replacement . I bought the Peter Thomas Roth product based on the one positive review on this site . It serves me right for buying a product with only one review . This lip balm is terrible . First of all it comes in a tiny little standard squeeze bottle that does n't even have a rounded tip for application . It 's basically your typical fat ended squeeze bottle . When you apply it you will notice that it is nothing more than a thick sticky oil , and that 's the way it feels on your lips . You 'll feel like your lips are coated with a thick sticky oil . A second later , you 'll notice that it tends to numb the nerves in your lips so they will feel funny . Even after I 've dabbed most of it off , my lips still feel greasy and numb . Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a good lip balm DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT . I just wasted $ 24 on something that 's going straight into the garbage .
 The attraction is the packaging and the evocative name
 Difficult to use and the tip is very blunt , round instead of pointed making them near useless . For $ 6.12 what did I expect ? Do n't waste your time buying these .
 Back in the 90 's , it seemed like I was able to use one needle a few times ; but these days I am lucky to get into one pore before the needle bends . Not to mention , in order for the needle to get into the pore , I have to glue the springs in place or else the needle retracts completely and never reaches root of the hair . I agree with other reviewers that these are too costly -LRB- as the product has n't improved any -RRB- . The electrolysis kit does work but the needles prevent the success I 've experienced in the past with this product .
 I 've never seen such a useless product . Very hard to get into the root of the hair and it never never worked even once for me . I would not recommend the whole Deluxe Electrolysys machine product and these tips are of no use .
 A few weeks ago I bought these for a total of $ 7 with s & h. Today they are $ 10 with s & h ! They bend sooooo easy , they should n't be so pricey .
 Product is way too flimsy !!!! Lousy a ! $ product !!!! A complete let down in my book . I would rate this at zero if I could !!!!
 I tried using an at-home electrolysis kit . It was AWFUL !!! Painful ! Icky ! I sent the kit back and these replacement styluses . I will NOT purchase a similar product again .
 I purchased the V2 supporter in hopes of relieving the vulvar varicosities that I suffer from during pregnancy . It gets so bad that walking can be agony and simple things like lifting a foot to climb stairs or tie a shoe cause considerable pain . After putting on the V2 supporter in the morning and wearing it all day I noticed two things . First of all , even though I bought the right size and tried different settings , it would not stay put . Secondly , it did not provide enough counterpressure to give noticeable relief .
 I tried this product in an effort to relieve the swelling of my veins due to pregnancy . Unfortunately I quickly sent it back.In theory this seems like a great idea and maybe it works for some people , but not for me . I know I tend to carry a little low and this supporter dug into my stomach just above my bikini line and hurt me . Everytime I sat down or bent over , it hurt ! Maybe this would work better for women that carry higher.I only wore it for a little bit because it dug in , but I never really felt that it did anything to relieve the swelling in my veins . So for now , I just have to deal with being uncomfortable until I give birth .
 My second pregnancy and I developed bulging vein in my groin area . It does n't hurt but does n't look hot ; -RRB- My doc told me about the V2 supporter and since I still have 7 weeks to go I wanted to give it a try.I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and my measurements are : PRE pregnancy , 132 lb , pant size 6,8 th months pregnant 167 lb , hips 41.5 '' , pant size-better do n't know ; -RRB- Anyway according to sizing and reviews I ordered medium . I just took a look at it and new it 's too big and it was , even with maximum adjusting.I exchanged it for small and it was still too loose ! I could n't feel any compression . Went down to petite size and still no compression and it sits too low.Go figure ! I do n't have specific figure like very boyish or super wide hips.I took close look at the supporter and IMO it should also have adjustment straps on the hips , not only on the butt part.So good idea but questions about execution . I 'm surprised because this product has good reviews.Last note
 I had to return it twice , first I ordered size Small , it did n't work at all , it was way to small around my hips -LRB- about 40 inches now -RRB- I used wear size 6-8 before pregnancy ... Sadly I had to pay restocking fee and shipping costs . Then size Medium sure feels ok around hips but it does n't do the job - does n't give you necessary support - no at all ! I wish it had adjustable belt around the hips . I still need help with my vulvar varicosities , but this product certainly not for measurements . I 'm 40 inches around hips , weight 150 pounds , in my 3-d trimester , wore size 6-8 before pregnancy .
 I read the product ingredients on the Amazon description and was excited to find a sunscreen product with so few ingredients . I was horrified when it arrived and I read the list of `` Inactive Ingredients '' the first three in the list
 You really do n't need to buy this if you are diabetic.It is simply an expectorant of 100 mg of Guaifensein.Ask the pharmcist for an over the counter version in pill form.The pills are easyer to take and do n't taste as bad.If you need an allergy medicine as well you can simply takeChlorpheniramine 12 mg which is over the counter as well asCHLOR-TRIMETON . Both are acceptable types of cold and allergy medicines for diabetics and much easyer to find.If you are seriously ill you should see a doctor for a perscription medicine anyways since diabetics have a greater chance for infections .
 It 's a cool concept , but the picture on amazon is very misleading . The paint job does n't even come close to as good as that.I had received this item with a broken horn , and an unglued wing . It was packaged very well , without even a scratch on the box . They had shipped it to me that way.All in all , what a waste of money .
 Maybe in working for a video game company , my standards are unreasonably high ... Like other reviewers , I bought this thinking it would be a great novelty conversation piece and way to freshen up a poorly ventilated room.The concept is n't bad . If I 'd found the blank mold at a pottery painting shop and whiled away an afternoon painting it , I might proudly display it.However , as a `` professionally '' finished piece , my initial reaction when it arrived was relief that I had n't paid that much . This followed with regret I had n't been able to find a satisfying higher quality option -LRB- even at a higher price -RRB- . Finished with guilt that this was a purchase that was going straight into a landfill -LRB- not quite worth the time and effort to repackage it and return it -RRB- . This does n't have the `` heft '' I thought it would . The colors were n't as complex and vibrant as I had hoped . The paint finish is dull and sloppy . In all , while it 's unreasonable to expect of a product in this price bracket , I secretly hoped it would have more depth of detail ; textured scales , eyes/talons made of a different material , something !
 I was so excited to find this product due to much pressure and discomfort in my third pregnancy . However , I ended up needing to return it . It fit everywhere quite well and had many adjustable straps , except the one strap that goes under your belly . This felt too tight to me and was uncomfortable . I definitely could n't sit down with it on and even when standing it left a visible impression under my baby belly.This may be because I carry very low and have a little extra belly fat , but still if they had only made it adjustable I would have loved to keep this product . Unfortunately now I am still unable to find something that works . My only suggestion would be , if you are a slightly bigger girl , try ordering one size larger than you think . I purposely did not because other reviews suggested to order your exact size . Anyhow , it was worth a try . Now if I can just find something else . This product would likely still work for your average or small sized woman .
 This is one of those rare times when the cheapest option actually turns out to be the best . I will set this up by saying that I carried low and large . I am tall and have a long torso . I had debilitating Pelvic Girdle Pain -LRB- including the pubic joint -RRB- by the end of the first trimester that never went away . I had swelling in my legs and ankles caused by pressure in my pelvis . I had lower and upper back problems and had ongoing chiropractic care through my entire pregnancy . I needed good belly support ! I purchased the Prenatal cradle and the Bellybra on Amazon . I already owned the McDavid waist belt -LRB- also purchased on Amazon -RRB- as I had been using it from time to time for lower back support before I became pregnant.The prenatal cradle was the most expensive option and simply a gawd awful contraption . It was not easy to wear under clothes or over clothes and did not offer relief . I found it to actually add to my discomfort . The elastic was too narrow and cut into my lower belly and sides . The criss crossing chest elastics showed even when wearing under my clothes . The vaginal support attachment was very stiff and dug into the tendons on each side -LRB- inner thighs -RRB- . Going to the bathroom with it was a drawn out spectacle . It was not adjustable enough to fit my dimensions well . I returned it.The bellybra was my second favorite support and is a product I would use again . It was comfortable for part of my second trimester , but by the end of it -LRB- second trimester -RRB- , the elastic was cutting into my belly and rolling / riding up . Though it may appear to offer breast support , I did not find that to be the case . A bra is still needed , but the combination was relatively cool and comfortable -LRB- before I grew out of it -RRB- My favorite was the $ 12 McDavid neoprene waist belt . I wore the McDavid off and on through my entire pregnancy and it was the only support that * never * cut into my belly and was adjustable enough to fit for my entire pregnancy . I loved it so much that I wore out the velcro on the first one and ordered another one . I sometimes clipped a pair of wide suspenders to the McDavid belt for extra support . -LSB- ... -RSB- This combination was adjustable and comfortable through the later parts of my pregnancy and could reasonably be concealed under clothing -LRB- though I would always wear the neoprene over fabric . . like maternity pants or a bellyband -RRB- . Once I put the suspenders on , I did n't have to take them off again and could put it on like slipping on a jacket . Just fasten the velcro in front and go . One additional advantage of the neoprene belt was that it kept the skin on my lower belly supported and moist . Combined with my religious use of Shea butter , I think this helped prevent stretch marks that would have been otherwise extensive.Was this review helpful ?
 I ordered 1 size up but still could n't slip this contraption over my chest . There is no way to open it all the way to put it on - you need to put it on like a shirt , which is completely ridiculous . It needs to work like a vest , especially with the extra curves and lumps of pregnancy . Notice that the woman in their photo is not particularly well-endowed . Unless you look like her , do n't even try to put this one . I was afraid I was going to get trapped in it .
 when youre pregnant and needing to use the bathroom every 30 minutes , the last thing you want to do is unstrap an entire body device . also , i got this for pelvic girdle pain and not varicose veins , but it didnt help with the pelvic pain for anyone who is looking to get it for the same reason .
 We purchased this thinking it would alieviate some back aches and other issues but once we put it on my wife she felt it was too much pressure and almost a digging in sensation . Would not recommend .
 I 'll update this if I change my mind , but overall I 'm disappointed.I bought it because I am having excruciating pelvic bone pain if I walk too much -LRB- a trip to the grocery store = too much -RRB- . I also have some bad ligament pain too , but it is nothing compared to the pelvic pain . Desperate for some relief , I coughed up the 80 bucks and bought this . It finally came today after 6 days of waiting on the couch since I could n't do much of anything else and I used it for the rest of the day . My tummy is now incredibly sore from where the bottom band was cutting into my skin . I did remove the crotch covering part , just to see if it would work without it , so maybe that has something to do with it , but that 's doubtful . It also seemed to make the ligament pain worse , especially when I was sitting down . I thought lifting my belly some would help the ligament stuff -LRB- I thought it was supposed to -RRB- , but the strap pressing around it just seems so strain it more . While I was wearing it , it did mildly help the pelvic pain , but not enough to be worth 80 bucks , even without all the other issues . It 's still painful to put pants on without sitting down , and stepping over things or basically anything that involves spreading my legs apart , hurts . The upper straps also cut into my skin ... and that 's not a place you want straps cutting into you.I will try to keep wearing it for a week to see if it helps my hips at all , but I need to figure out a way to make it stop cutting into my skin first -LRB- fleece patch where it goes against your skin -RRB- ? Some people did say they wanted to remove the crotch part but did n't because of the velco . If you love this product , you could easily get some velco patches from any craft store or craft section of a store and simply put that over it . It did n't really bother me , however.As for fitting , besides the cutting into me , it does fit right . By my pre pregnancy weight , I fell between a petite and a small , leaning towards the petite , but went for the small . At first I felt like it needed to be tighter and more supportive , but obviously with the cutting into my skin deal , it 's definitely tight enough.Oh , and it did n't keep the kid out of my lower pelvis either . I was kind of hoping it 'd keep her from wedging herself in there , but nope ... she 's pretty bound and determined to kick the crap out of my bladder ! : -RRB-
 I almost bought this item because it seemed like a good price . I had to enlarge the image and take out my magnifying glass to see that it is only single ply . One or two ply should be mentioned in the description . At this time , all the types of Cottonelle offered are single ply . Call me spoiled , but I wo n't be a customer until that changes .
 I bought this product and was angry that it was such a poorly made 1 ply tissue . Do not waste your money .
 The cutter broke during first use . The wheel came off and would not screw back on . The thread was wasted .
 The cutting wheel on the ring cutter I received is bent a tad but , making it difficult to turn the blade . After buying the same type of ring cutter on epay and getting a defective one I will live with the one that I have . I would not recommend this product .
 I have had my Sonicare toothbrush for about two years and it recently stopped working . I am assuming that the battery is dead . The Philips website says you can not replace the batteries . I paid $ 130 for a toothbrush that lasted about two years . Add on the replacement heads and it is well over $ 200 . Also , the brush is not environmentally friendly . I have the charger base but can not just replace the handle if I chose to do this . I would have to buy the whole set again . Philips should offer replacement options . What a waste to just throw everything away after a couple of years . Replacement batteries would be nice . The brush works well when it works but the quality does not justify the very high price .
 Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads .1 -RRB- The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months . That 's what prompted this review , because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence . However , I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months . -LRB- Do you think China would really do that ? -RRB- 2 -RRB- UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush . If you charge it up overnight , then unplug the base , the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month . Then , when it signals or stops , plug the base in to charge it.This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer . If you keep the base plugged in all the time , these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.A bonus , if you travel a lot as I do , you do n't have to pack the charger . Just make sure it 's topped off and you 're good for a month 's vacation .
 one year after my purchase , the top button made of rub wore away . so , water can flow into side ! Then , the switch randomly worked for electric problem inside . I 'd to seal the cleft on the button with tape , but no way to get back to normal function . now this brush seems useless to me.Try to protect the button with particular care .
 I have been using the sonicare for several years and I should have notified everyone with the trouble with this unit at an earlier date . As far as getting a good brushing it is fantastic but it has a design flaw that I would have thought they would have fixed long ago.Everyone I know who has this toothbrush has had the rubber on off switch collapse into the unit . After my third sonicare I will not purchase another until that design weakness is remedied.I love the way it cleans my teeth and I will miss using it.I hope other users write a review telling of this problem . Sometimes there is strength in numbers .
 I have had two Sonicare toothbrushes and they both failed the same way , the on-off button wore out in about 1 year . Does a good job brushing , but will send you to the poor house . Also , as noted in several reviews , once the batteries are done so is the unit.I wo n't be purchasing a third unit .
 I have used the Sonicare brand toothbrush forever it seems , I loved this thing and every time i put on a new brush head it was that great feeling you ca n't get from a regular toothbrush . But I have no idea what is going on as I have had to replace 3 of these in less than 1 years time . The first time I thought it was a fluke but after 3 times I am wondering what the heck brand of batteries are in these things . I was about to throw out the 3rd one until i pressed the button and held it down as if I were resetting it and it worked , but I need to do that EVERY time now . Done with sonicare going to try Oral B.
 I used the Sonicare Elite for several years , buying the hype that it was cleaning my teeth better than I could . But then my dental hygienist pointed out that it was also brushing away the base of my gums with its back-and-forth action -- she showed me the linear ridges it has made in my gums . I do n't apply alot of pressure when brushing , so this was upsetting , especially since the damage is permanent . She 'd been trying to get me to switch to the Oral B for ages , so when my sister-in-law -LRB- also a hygienist -RRB- recommended the Oral B , I went out and got one . The circular action does n't wear away the gum line , and my teeth are significantly cleaner . Even though I floss every day , I still had plaque build-up behind my bottom front teeth with the Sonicare . With the Oral B , it 's gone . And with the variety of brushing styles that automatically switch when you change a brush head -LRB- several options are included ! -RRB- , it 's a lot more bang for your buck .
 Actually , great brushing action . Very pleased with that.But product life is horrible . Spent over $ 130.00 and the on-off switch died in less than one year . Just plain bad quality .
 I bought the original Sonicare when it first came out -- 20 years ago ? I do n't remember . The technology clearly works . My dentist reports a significant improvement in plaque . I have never used any of the other `` sonic '' toothbrushes . I imagine they work as well.My original Sonicare just started acting up . It still works , but I think the battery is dying . So I bought the e7300 . First impressions are that Philips went for glitz over quality and has added all kinds of marginally useful or even useless `` features '' so they can engage in marketing hype and jack up the price . It looks to be more cheaply made . I would be surprised if this unit lasts even a fraction of the 20 years of the original unit . It looks to me like it was designed to fail.I was annoyed by the very first page of the manual . It tells me to make sure the handle is properly seated in the base , because if it is put in wrong , the charging light may still come on , but it wo n't charge . What kind of engineering is this ? If it 's not charging , do n't turn the light on . Do n't they have engineers smart enough to figure that out ? So I tested it . Sure enough , you can put the handle in any which way and the charging light comes on . This is just lazy or careless design work.Worse , the base is too small , too light , and too shallow . In the original unit , the handle goes well over an inch into the base and there is only one way it will fit . With this unit , the base only holds the handle by about a half inch so it 's easy to put it in wrong . And sure enough , no matter how you put it in , even half falling out , the charging light lights up . Looks like it was designed by the marketing department?Then there 's the idiotic 2-minute shutoff . I can see zero benefits and several disadvantages . First of all , why are they shutting it off after 2 minutes ? Do they think I might leave it on or am too lazy to turn it off myself . This is a clear case of terminal helpfulness.But that 's not the most annoying problem . You do NOT want to take the thing out of your mouth while it is running or you will spray toothpaste and spit everywhere . After a few uses , I am operating on autopilot . When I finish brushing , I click the on/off button to turn it off and remove it from my mouth in one simultaneous motion . If you happen to finish brushing just as the thing shuts off -LRB- after 2 minutes -RRB- , clicking the on/off button will actually turn it back on as you are removing it from your mouth . Now you will have a nice little task of cleaning the mirror , the sink , your shirt , the wall , the floor ... Nice . # @ $ % # $ @ !!! I have done this a few times . Not good.Personally , I find the `` timer signal '' every 30 seconds annoying , too . I just want a simple on/off button . It 's a toothbrush , not the control panel for a heart-lung machine . KISS . Actually , I have no problem with this `` feature '' if some people are unable to figure out how to brush without a built-in timer as long as the company provides a way to turn the infernal thing off . But clearly they think they know what I need better than I do.In the original model , I could at least turn off the 30-second reminders by holding the on/off button for a few seconds -- simple . With this `` improved '' model , they have added a `` dual speed '' button , but it only works while in the charger . Now that 's convenient . I have the charger at the back of the sink behind the radio and out of the way . Now I have to move the charger to where I can actually see it . My guess is that they are again protecting me from myself so I wo n't accidentally change the settings while I am using the unit . Did they test this on morons ? Did they test it at all?The ultimate insult to injury is in the instructions on recycling the battery . I am told to first deplete the battery . I am to do this by removing the unit from the charger , turning it on , and letting it run until it stops . But it stops every 2 minutes ! Since they brag that the unit can be used for 2 weeks -LRB- twice a day -RRB- on a full charge , they are really asking me to stand there for an hour -LRB- 2x2x14 minutes -RRB- and restart the unit 28 times . Like that is going to happen.On the bright side , it comes with a very nice travel case . I used to toss my old one in my dopp kit , which is probably why it broke and I bought this piece of junk.Summary

 Do yourself a favor and buy the Sonicare Flex Care . The newer Flex Care models are an upgrade without the screw-on design flaw of this Sonicare model . This model has a hideous design where the saliva and other brushing liquids seep down into the inner mechanisms of the hand piece and pool up in a really disgusting way and requires you to take it apart and clean off inner crevices made up of metal and plastic parts . The new design eliminates all that slew of slime . This brushing action is fantastic , just like the new one , but this design stinks ... literally .
 Following the recommendation of friends , we bought our very first electric toothbrush and have been very satisfied with the quality of the brushing . We have , however , been sorely disappointed by the shelf-life of this product . Had we known how short the product life is we would not have invested the money into a Sonicare product . The set with two heads cost over $ 100 . Every 6 months we bought two replacement heads for over $ 20 . Three years into using the product , the battery died . Upon calling the manufacturer , we were informed that the battery life should be 5 to 7 years ; the warranty is only 2 years ; the battery can not be replaced and all we can do is throw away our still-functioning base and purchase a brand-new unit . So beware , if you put your hard-earned dollars into this expensive product , it may only last three years and the manufacturer will not lift a finger to ensure you get the impression that this is just a buy and throw-away product . Based on this experience we have no desire to invest in another Sonicare product .
 We have owned 3 Sonicare toothbrushes ; each one wears out after about 15 months of use . What happens is the timer or the on / off switch seems to go bad . The effect is the unit shuts off after about 30 seconds of use ; holding down the on / off switch buys another 10 seconds or so ; then 5 seconds ; then nothing.For a product as expensive as this , stay away unless replacing it every 15 months is within your plan as it does do a good job cleaning your teeth .
 This toothbrush does a fair job when the brush heads are new ; however , they get `` mushy '' rather quickly and at $ 12.50 each you will go broke replacing them ! I have purchased a Braun Oral-B Triumph to replace it and it has been a much more economical alternative and functions just as well , if not better .
 I got this product in 9/2008 . It worked well but only for about a year . About a year after I got it , the edge around the green power button on the handle began to crack . Now the crack has almost made a complete circle around the button . All this time , it was still functional so I did n't give it much thought about replacing it . Today it just died completely and it has not even been two years yet . My old Sonicare Essence lasted quite a few years without any glitch until the batteries would not hold charge any more . I would go back to the Essence but I am definitely not getting another fanicer model of Sonicare .
 First we purchased an e7300.The timer did not work and the unit would turn itself off repeatedly.Called Sonicare who confirmed it did not work and I replaced it with an e5300.The timer did not work and the unit would turn itself off repeatedly.Called Sonicare who confirmed it did not work and I took it back for a refund this time.I suppose these are good toothbrushes .

It certainly was in the last razor I purchased .
 i 'm a dentist and luckily we only stock oral-B in our office . why ? many people i 've talked to have had the same problem i had with the sonicare elite and that was the battery running out . i received mine free as a promotion anyhow , but i 'm glad that i do n't have to repeatedly answer ` why did you sell me an expensive piece of junk ? ' great toothbrush otherwise , i think that it cleans better than anything else out there .
 The product , when it works , seems like a miracle , as at those times , it is doing a very good job and that 's why many dentists do recommend it.However , please read through many reviews and you will read about the same experience that I have had , namely , that they wear out -LRB- specifically , the battery wo n't hold its charge -RRB- so you have to buy a whole new unit after the very limited-time warranty expires . It would be so very easy to manufacture these units in a battery-replaceable fashion.Readers should also pay VERY close attention to the date of the review . If the review is a rave review and is within the last few weeks or months , just wait ... . till the battery fails.Readers should also pay close attention to the very large number of `` new models '' that keep coming out . I would feel better if they made ONE model that consistently performed well , rather than adding this or that needless bell or whistle.Also when the new model comes out , all of the reviews from the previous almost-identical product become unsearchable and the whole cycle starts from scratch again . Someone buys one and two weeks later they put up a five star review . Then more people buy them . Then , a few months later , people start having a different experience . Time to introduce yet another new model ! Thus cleaning the slate with all the bad reviews missing .
 Be careful because you will waste time and money ordering replacement heads . You wo n't be able to tell what kind of toothbrush you have , because Philips does n't indicate it on the toothbrush , so you have to guess when you reorder . Philips wins on this , but you lose .
 works very well , but its a freakin toothbrush , unless you have teeth problems dont spend $ 100 + dollars -LRB- or ur rich -RRB- i mean its really not that great or worth it , just get a $ 20 one instead if you want to blow your money ...
 This is my second Sonicare Toothbrush the first one lasted for five years of daily use . The new 7500 is much lighter and smaller which makes it easier to use and more effective in reaching all the surfaces of your teeth . I 'm very pleased with the product and how well it removes plaque and food bits from between the teeth . My dentist always remarks about how little tarter I have during semiannual check ups and cleaning . I highly recommend this product .
 Sonicare is FAR inferior to INTERPLAK brand electric toothbrushes with rotating bristles . Get the Interplak toothbrush with the rotating bristles , not the round `` Oral B '' style head.My family has used Interplak brand since the 1980 's and we have had fantastic success - imagine cancelling your curettage appointment and reducing the number of cleaning visits you need ... etc. -LRB- Do n't tell my dentist that I do n't floss - I just use my Interplak ! -RRB- We tried a Sonicare & were horrified . These are overpriced and they do n't leave your teeth with the same clean feeling you get with an Interplak .
 I bought this for more than $ 150 at my dentist . It worked well for about a year , though it does get pretty disgusting beneath the top half without fairly intensive cleaning.After about a year of use , however , the switch broke . It would n't turn off or on reliably . Now I 'm SURE Philips would have happily replaced it under warranty . The problem is , I ca n't be bothered with a toothbrush that adds that much complexity to my life . An iPod breaking is bad enough , a $ 100 plus toootbrush breaking is the proverbial straw.It also did n't magically prevent the age related recession of my gums -- if it had I 'd suffer the time drain . As it is , it 's back to the old toothbrush . I 'll spend the time I save dealing with the warranty on better gum care.It gets two stars because it does have a warranty , I just ca n't stand to deal with it .
 I bought my Sonicare about a year ago , and only used it maybe 6 months of that year . Batteries are dead , and completely non-replacable , toxic , and a pain in the ass to get to a recycling plant . I 'll never buy another Sonicare product .
 The use of ultrasound for this application sounds good in theory , but my two-year experience indicated that it did not work in practice . Plaque build-up was , if anything , worse than with manual brushing . It was only when I started to use the Oral-B 3-D Excel that we -LRB- my dentist and I -RRB- noticed an improvement .
 If it were possible to give this toothbrush a 0 , I would . It 's a little pricey for a piece of junk that it is . A toothbrush that is way better is Cybersonic 2 . It costs less than this toothbrush . It also offers more . The Sonicare Elite 7500 cleans at 31,000 strokes a minute , but Cybersonic 2 cleans at 41,000 . Cybersonic 2 comes with a 2 tongue cleaner , 2 flosser attachments and 45 pre-strung flossing heads which are disposable , recharging stand , and best of all free replacement brushes every 3 months for free for ever . The Sonicare brushes cost more than $ 20 . With the Sonicare brush you have to brush for 2 minutes and with the Cybersonic 2 you only have to brush for 1 minute and the brush pauses for a second to tell you that a minute has passed . Plain and simple , Cybersonic 2 is the best and most powerful toothbrush in the world . So if you want the best toothbrush , do not buy the Sonicare , buy Cybersonic 2 . Check it out for yourself at Cybersonic2.com peace YO !!!!!
 I was surprise to discovered all Sonicare toothbrushes are disposable item . Its battery can not be replace what so ever . Like any other electronic products , its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program . Mine lasted about 6 months , at this rate ... we 're going to end up tones of these in our landfill . It is irresponsible to produce products like this . If I had known about this I would never have bought it.Forget about this hi-tech marketing stuff . Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention .
 I would n't normally buy anything marketed with `` Elite '' in the name , but I had some extra cash when I saw the top of the line on sale . It seemed too cool to pass up on impulse . Famous last words . My teeth did feel clean and smooth the week I used it , but they were not any whiter . The sensation seemed brought on by the noisy whir , numbing vibrations , and relatively long 2 minute brushing time . I was n't happy with being locked into buying replacement heads for something that did n't really work , so I did some research . Unfortunately , my instincts were dead on . Notwithstanding the pretty lights , beeping noises , luxurious case , and grandiose claims , the simple fact is that conscientious manual brushing is clinically proven to be just as effective . In fact , the only type of powered brush that offers any statistically significant benefit whatsoever over manual is `` rotational oscillation , '' NOT so-called `` sonic . '' All in all , I 'd say Braun has somewhat less brazen snake-oil salesmen than Philips .
 I was a loyal user for years of the original Sonicare before it was sold to Phillips who designed this model . It worked wonders as I had no cavities for 5 years and no gum problem . Since `` upgrading '' to the 7500 I have gotten 1 cavity -LRB- on a receding gum area -RRB- and a detached gum using the `` new model 7500 . I attribute this to a smaller brush head which is a poor design that `` overvibrates '' on a smaller area loosening up the gums causing them to recede . The original Sonlcare cleaned over a wider area with a flat brush to evenly spread out the vibrations . I wonder if the original inventor had a hand in this `` improved '' model ? If it ai n't broken do n't fix it ! If you are a dentist or gum specialist , please take notice !!
 Capitalism at its finest moment
 While the brush does brush exceedingly well , the battery in the brush holder can not be replaced . According to Sonicare the battery will last 3 to 5 years . Ours lasted only 3 years despite using non-peroxide toothpaste and only cleaning it with water and a towel . So be warned , when you invest $ 100 into a two-headed toothbrush set and another $ 20 every six months in new heads , this gimmick may last you only three years . You will be left with two perfectly good toothbrush heads , a well-functioning base , and a dead battery . According to Sonicare at this point all you can do is throw it all away -LRB- who cares about our growing mountains of garbage and future generations ? -RRB- and buy - a new Sonicare !
 All Sonicare toothbrushes have the same fundamental flaws . The design of the brush head allows water and toothpaste get inside the handle which must be cleaned out frequently or it will develop a foul odor . Brush heads are only changed every six months which is not very hygienic . There are two small magnets on the bottom of the brush head that easily come off . Sonicare continues to use NI-Cad batteries in every model . These same flaws are even present in the new Sonicare Intelliclean 8000 series which can only be bought at the dentist or directly from Sonicare . It is just like the Elite 7500 but you must buy these Crest toothpaste cartridges since the toothbrush despenses the toothpaste . So not only will you have to buy those poorly designed brush heads but you will have to buy those Crest cartridges too . The new Sonicare 8000 series will be in stores Spring 2005 . Go to Sonicare.com for more info . Unless Sonicare fixes these flaws I would not recommend any Sonicare model period !
 I loved this toothbrush . My teeth never felt cleaner and I was happy knowing that I was brushing my teeth for an appropriate amount of time . However , after treating my beloved toothbrush with kid gloves for about two years , it up and died on me!My dentist told me that I was brushing too hard and my gums were receding at an alarming rate . He told me to begin using a special soft-bristled brush that he gave me . It was a regular manual brush . So , my Sonicare sat on the bathroom shelf on its little charger for about 3 months . When I tried to use it after a 3-month break , it worked for about two seconds , and then gave a long `` beeeeep ! '' I thought that maybe I had overcharged it , so I let it sit off the charger for a day . No change . Three weeks of trying everything I could think of -LRB- replacing the head , cleaning it , various charger/non-charger positions -RRB- it still does n't work.I got two great years out of this toothbrush . However , I do n't think it 's the right match for me because my gums have begun receding so badly -LRB- my roots are exposed in all 4 quadrants and I am experiencing severe sensitivity to cold and sweets -RRB- . Besides , who wants to spend over $ 100 on brushes , special paste , and heads if it only lasts 2 years ? No , thanks !
 Owned an Oral-B for 10 + happy years . Attractive pricing on Sonicare caused me to defect . Totally regretful . It thoroughly puzzles me that a design of a medical appliance causes a colossal harbor for bacteria/mold . Consumer needs to take the thing apart each week and resort to Q-tips etc. to at least ensure visual cleanliness . Fact is , growth of the nasties commences immediately whether it 's visible or not and compounds with the number of uses in a given period . This same weird design accomplishes an ongoing revenue stream for the manufacturer because the screw-on brush head unique to this product is very expensive to replace comparatively ... especially on the recommended schedule of every three months . That said , the cleaning action is quite good . But then , so was Oral-B 's . And the closed design and cheap brush heads far exceeded their Sonicare counterparts .
 Yeah , it works great until ... the on/off button cover needs to be replaced . Sonicare says they can not repair it . Also , from what I 've been reading , you 'll need to throw it out when the battery will not take a charge . Greed engineering !
 This is a wonderful toothbrush , but I find it absurd that the battery life is 3-5 years -LRB- 2 1/2 in our case -RRB- , and the batteries are non-replaceable .
 I have purchased my Sonicare over the holidays and me and my spouse have used it for couple of weeks . I found it to be very unpleasant - way too much vibration for my liking . It seems that electromagnetic field in the toothbrush is quite strong as well - after regular for couple of weeks , we have found that it could cause you to become more easily irritated . This might not be true for everyone but was true for us . We have returned our Sonicare toothbrush , and did switch to manual for now - but likelly switch back to Oral-B - we used to have one in the past .
 I 'm rather disappointed.After reading the reviews and talking to a user I know , I bought a Sonicare for myself and one for my mother . After using mine for 3 weeks I realize I made a big mistake . I was given to believe that this `` ultrasonic '' technology would not only replace flossing but be better than flossing since , supposedly , the brush can remove plaque 5mm beyond the reach of the brush , besides removing 98 % of all plaque . Frankly , I do n't believe those claims anymore.After using 3 weeks , I 've found that the brush did n't clean any better than an ordinary half-as-expensive electric toothbrush . Actually , my teeth feel distinctly cleaner after using the much cheaper brush for 2 minutes . Also , much more important , the Sonicare left plaque that irritated my gums and could only be removed by flossing . When I finally did floss just now , my gums bled quite a bit -LRB- as much as they ever have after not flossing for more than a few weeks -RRB- , indicating that the Sonicare was doing nothing for my gums . Only flossing , it seems , can do what flossing can do.The Sonicare is over-hyped , it seems . If it is the last word in `` untrasonic '' toothbrushing , then that 's the last I 'll use an untrasonic brush.Back to flossing . And , with flossing , one can use any old toothbrush to do the full job , though I do like my old , tired Oral-B electric `` sub '' - sonic brush.I like the timing feature and will still use the brush . It does a decent job , just not nearly what is advertised!I would return it if I could .
 I have used a Sonicare that has the liquid toothpaste for about 6 or 8 years . It replaced another brand . I love it !! T has really improved my teeth and my visits to the dentist.This new one is really messy . I squirts toothpaste drops every where . Also , the plastic on the back of the brush hits your teeth and is not very comfortable.I am going to buy the Elite 9500 to replace it for my second bathroom .
 On the fourth morning of usage the toothbrush unscrewed from the base . I tried to screw it back in and noticed a crack up the side of the battery housing and a larger crack around the top . It 's very sad because my old electric toothbrush was this model and it lasted more than 10 years .
 This model , which replaces the Advance 4000 , does not have the essential pause feature to signal quadrant change in the 2-minute cycle . I sent it back to Phillips when they would n't replace it with a model that does .
 I bought this electric toothbrush to replace my six or seven year old Sonicare which I thought was broken -LRB- it turns out I just had a faulty outlet in my bathroom -RRB- . The thing I DO NOT LIKE about this particular model is that it does n't let me know every 30 seconds when it 's time to move to another part of my mouth -LRB- like my old one does -RRB- . My advice -- get the one that gives you this helpful little signal AND check your electrical supply before you replace a perfectly good -LRB- SEVEN year old ! -RRB- appliance !
 This is my second Sonicare 4100 Sonic Power Toothbrush . This one is faulty , in that it does not have a 30 second timer to let you know when to change positions in your mouth . I think that I just have a bad product and probably should have sent it back but was leaving town for an extended vacation and did not have time . I miss the timer very much . The product itself is excellent and does a very good job on teeth and gums .
 Do n't expect the Sonicare to last more than one year MAXIMUM . The Ni-Cad batteries are designed to fail and CAN NOT be replaced . They are actually molded into the case and the unit will be destroyed upon removal , which they reccomend before disposal , since the batteries are TOXIC in the landfill . Do n't expect any support from the company , since they are owned by Philips , which has one of the worst customer service records on the planet . Even contacting their website and clicking on their e-mail icon only provides a dead link . What a joke . The replacement heads are obscenely expensive . Save your money and you could buy a hundred decent regular toothbrushes in the same amount of time .
 I bought this toothbrush a year ago . It has been good except it needs frequent charging . Now it is dead .
 I used my sonicare toothbrush for about 2 weeks then it just stopped working for no reason . I tried to call sonicare but have yet to get through because everytime I call I have to wait to speak to someone . It was fine while it worked but I am a bit annoyed that I recieved a defective product , and I wonder if my situation is rare or happens often .
 I agree with a few of the previous reviews that it works well , but do n't expect it to last . My last one lasted a little less than 2 months . It is a very poorly made product . If you take steps -LRB- i.e. using tape for waterproofing to supplement for poor construction and completely drying the unit off and charger off after every use -RRB- you may be able to get a longer life out of it . I am looking for a better unit as I love the performance of an electric toothbrush . I am done with sonicare though . Also , they do n't back up their product . I have contacted them several time to no avail .
 At first , this product was great . I loved how clean my teeth felt afterwords . But after a few short months of owning it , I ca n't get it to charge anymore , and the entire casing is cracked up the front of the toothbrush . The detachable tooth brush part has cracked up so bad it barely even attaches to this toothbrush anymore.This toothbrush was a complete waste of my money , and now I have to buy a new one . I certainly wo n't be buying another Philips .
 I ordered the Sonicare 4100 , the old model , because I have used one for six or seven years and loved it and I know that the new models -LRB- the ones with the skinny neck -RRB- are not as good -LRB- for me anyway -RRB- because they are very rough and noisy whereas the 4100 is very gentle and quiet . Unfortunately what I received was a 7000 series model . I no longer have the packaging so I ca n't even return it . I am very disappointed .
 I am disappointed with this product because I tried to purchase an upgraded toothbrush but was informed it was too late for me to cancel the one I purchased even though it was not shipped and had only been purchased the day befor . I did not want to go through the hassle of a e-return so I keppt the original purchase . Your system is a bit inflexible !
 I purchased this toothbrush for my family in December . We enjoyed using it but when we went to the dentist for our checkups this summer we were shocked . My 23 year old daughter had her first two cavities in her life . I had two cavities . And my husband had five cavities , soon followed by an abscess and an emergency root canal . I was extremely disappointed and called the company . They agreed to refund my money -LRB- $ 99.99 -RRB- if I returned the unit . I did and I 'm still waiting for the refund . In the meantime I bought a new Braun , which was the toothbrush we 'd used for the two years before the Sonicare , with much better results . What a costly disappointment the Sonicare turned out to be !!
 I was surprise to discovered all Sonicare toothbrushes are disposable item . Its battery can not be replace what so ever . Like any other electronic products , its battery and IC board are toxic and can only be dispose by your local electronic waste program . Mine lasted about 6 months , at this rate ... we 're going to end up tones of these in our landfill . It is airresponsible to produce products like this . If I had known about this I would never have bought it.Forget about this hi-tech marketing stuff . Use a regular toothbrush and get your teeth clean regularly is the best prevention .
 This item was never received , but upon calling Amazona replacement was sent right away
 I ordered this toothbrush close to 2 weeks ago and I have not received it yet . The info read that they would ship within 1 to 2 business days.I am very disappointed !
 Amazon did not send the item to the zip code they had in their database ... item went to the wrong address and was refused.I was not notified until the order was cancelled , and was told I could reorder.The free shipping and discount for new Amazon credit card was not honored , so I did not reorder . Disappointing .
 i loved - LOVED - my sonicare for about 12 months or so - i knew better than to leave it on the charger , it would last a good 10 days and then about a week and then suddenly it only last 2 days . then seemingly overnight it didnt last even one brushing session ! I let it die and recharged , I left it on the charger , i tried anything and everything to get it back to at least doing a full brushing - nothing . I 'm been trying for a few weeks now and am giving up . I 've read the steps people have taken to open it , cut thru the packing and sealants to change the batteries , and then re-seal - it seems a lot of effort for something that should bloody WORK after only one year!VERY DISAPPOINTING .
 Battery lasted less than a year , brush replacements are bulkier & more complicated than need be and are too expensive
 Was surprised and disappointed this model does not have 30 second automatic timer to indicate when to change brushing areas . I was n't aware of this when I made the purchse . Will probably give this one away .
 I have read many reviews complaining about the short battery life of the Sonicare toothbrushes . I have two of the Sonicare Advance toothbrushes . One lost all battery life within one year . The other lost all battery life within two years . I emailed Philips Sonicare and they had me call customer service to resolve the problem . I called and here is the solution that they gave me :1 . Put the toothbrush on the recharge stand and hold the power button in for 5-7 seconds until you hear/feel two beeps . Release the power button . Keep the toothbrush on the recharge stand .2 . Hold the power button in again until you hear/feel one beep . Release the power button .3 . Keep the toothbrush on the recharge stand for 24 hrs.This process will reset and recharge the battery.Other than the battery problem they have been superb toothbrushes.Update
 My husband and I used SoniCare for our toothbrush - bought our first one in 1994 . Well - this year the toothbrush finally died - no longer held a charge . Ours was the only SoniCare model sold at the time we bought it - it worked VERY well for a very long time . We changed brush heads every six months , we kept the unit well cleaned . We really loved the heft of the base unit and the 30 second beeps.So we ordered another `` basic '' -LRB- to get the HEAVIER base - we did not like the lighter weight model with those SKINNY brush heads -RRB- . This SoniCare arrived a week after we ordered it - well packaged - all items in tact . We ` pluged ' in the charger - charged the brush unit 24 hours - and then - proceeded to use it.COMPLETELY CHANGED - - - now , NO 30 SECOND BEEP - the unit does work for the entire two minutes , but gone is the very handy 30 second timer.I do believe we will change to the Braun Oral-B when this piece of dreck dies . It 's not pleasant spending a weeks grocery money on a toothbrush - and then discovering that the ` trusted ' company decided to make a few pennies more per item and killed the 30 second timer on ` low-end ' items.Shame on you Phillips/SoniCare !!!!!!! -LRB- Sure hope those few pennies saved make up for the LONG time customers you are going to lose . -RRB-
 To keep from splattering while brushing it 's recommended to keep your mouth closed around this brush . Because of the size of the brush head & short neck that 's impossible if you have a small mouth . I also find it very loud , difficult to use , overall a disappointment .
 I received one that did n't work . As soon as the initial charge wore off it stopped and would n't recharge . I sent it in to the manufacturer and received a refund . I then ordered a Braun which works OK .
 The Philips sonicare advance series is a piece of junk . On my first purchaseI noticed that the replacement heads never lasted the six months they aresupposed to last , cracked in less than 3 months.When the handle cracked -LRB- after about 18 months -RRB- I bought another.The new one , the handle cracked within 3 months , and lasted less than a year.the heads cracked and did not last even remotely close to the6 months they are supposed to . I 've tried this brush twice , I 'm throughwasting my money , I 'm going to Oral B -LRB- Braun -RRB-
 Got two years tops out of the battery which can NOT be replaced . Bad for the environment and it costs a fortune . My Ultrasonex and Braun do as good a job if not better . I like that the Braun swirls around and seems to do better getting under the gums and between teeth . As a matter of fact I read a report comparing these three brands and the Braun won out by a good amount .
 The Sonicare works well and has improved the check ups for all of us . We have 4 units and the oldest failed just after 2 years . -LRB- just out of warranty -RRB- We think it is the NiCad batteries which have limited life and always develop a `` memory '' . Checking the manual , website and contacting Phillips we were told they cann not be replaced . We were told how to remove the double AA batteries , but the unit is designed so you destroy it in the process . So the bottom line is you can not change the batteries and it is an expensive `` throw a way '' product which could easily be designed to have replacement batteries . So if you buy one be prepared to replace it every 2-3 years . This also means more waste and many will be thrown away with the batteries which is an enviromental disaster .
 Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads .1 -RRB- The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months . That 's what prompted this review , because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement.They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence . However , I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months . -LRB- Do you think China would really do that ? -RRB- 2 -RRB- UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush . If you charge it up overnight , then unplug the base , the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month . Then , when it signals or stops , plug the base in to charge it.This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer . If you keep the base plugged in all the time , these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.A bonus , if you travel a lot as I do , you do n't have to pack the charger . Just make sure it 's topped off and you 're good for a month 's vacation .
 Replaced old 4100 with new one BUT they neglect to say that this model no longer has the 30 second timer . It does shut off after 2 minutes but the 30 second timer is only in more costlier models . I would not have purchased and used this one if I had known .
 Every bad review I 've read for the Sonicare 4100 seems to be about the battery life lasting only 1 year -LRB- or the hilarious one about the root canal ! -RRB- . Unfortunately , I ca n't get that far ! In the past year , I 've gone through 3 of these toothbrushes and they keep vibrating themselves to pieces!Mine develop tiny cracks that then spread like a car windshield due to the vibration , resulting in the brush falling apart -LRB- and no , I did n't drop them -RRB- . My 3rd brush just fell apart tonight ! I 'm assuming that there are microscopic faults in the plastic that are susceptible to the vibration , and then spread.I really like the brush , but so far , I 've spent over one-hundred-fifty US dollars in the past year on them and I hesitate to buy another one.Has anyone else had an experience like this or am I just cursed ? Please add a comment and let me know . Thanks !
 I bought this toothbrush after hearing other people 's recommendations and TV ads . After using this toothbrush for about 6 months , I 'm done with it . After brushing with it I feel like I need to brush again . I get better results with a manual toothbrush.It 's also very messy . In the trash it goes . I 'll stick with the Oral B electric toothbrush.I think the only good thing about it is that it stimulates your gums really well because of the vibration , but unfortunately a toothbrush needs to do more than just that .
 i had sonicaire complete . Mold builds up horribly inside . Take it apart weekly and dry it . Still gets mold . Clean with bleach , carefully clean it so as not to get water inside , still gets mold -LRB- wifes too -RRB- . Finally after about 8 months or so mine stopped working . it just lets out a weak little buzz . This was my second Sonicaire device . Last ones dies too . Do n't think their made in Germany anymore .
 This is a VERY over-rated product . I really do n't feel my teeth are any cleaner than using a standard toothbrush , and I may just abandon this thing when the head gives out - I just ca n't see throwing good money after bad . I liked the Braun electric toothbrush better , and the refills are much cheaper .
 I researched this item after the enthusiastic recommendation of my dental hygienist , and found out that many of my friends owned one and absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED it . So I went out and bought one.I do not like using it . For the longest time I was the only person I 'd ever heard of anywhere who dislikes it for the following reason
 Sonicare is our trusted brand for decade , but both Replacement Brush Heads broke -LRB- inside metal arm broke and no longer vibrate -RRB- in 1.5 month of usage . We used Replacement Brush Heads before and never had a broken head except for worn brush . These suppose to last at least 5 months . We thought something we did , but the second broke right after replacement . They do look flimsy . Do n't think we 'll order this product online again .
 I have purchased over 500 items on Amazon and have never felt compelled to write a review until now . Philips must have bought out Sonicare but their so called `` newer '' replacement heads are deficient compared to the older Sonicare models . These are much smaller with an extremely tiny brush head . I 'm supposed to pay the same price for crappier hardware ? I ca n't find the older models anywhere so I am stuck with this unless I replace the whole model . Might look for another company now for my electric toothbrush needs .
 I 've ordered Sonicare replacement toothbrushes from Amazon twice . The first time , the magnet fell off one of the toothbrushes within 3 days of usage , so I sent the item back as defective . A few months later , I braved the chances and ordered from Amazon again . This time , while the issue is not as bad as a defective magnet , so the toothbrush head is still usable , it has enough issues for me to not be completely happy.I 've been a Sonicare toothbrush user since 2002 , and I have n't had any issues with toothbrush heads purchased in a regular store . I 'll let you judge for yourself whether two defective purchases in a row is a fluke , but I can tell you that I am not ordering this item from Amazon again .
 I bought these replacement heads for my Sonicare elite e7300 . The first one broke within the first month 's use . -LRB- One of the two metal legs that hold the magnet snapped . -RRB- The second head is working better , now that I 've discovered why the first one broke . It appears that the head magnet is too close to the handle motor magnet . This causes the head magnet to vibrate loudly and eventually shear . The design flaw is either the magnet being too close or the plastic tighten cap not fitting properly.If you purchase these heads and the cap portion vibrates loudly , unscrew and re-screw the cap on until it does n't vibrate so loudly . This will prevent the metal legs that hold the magnet from snapping .
 I bought my first Soniccare toothbrush about 4 years ago and loved it . I finally had to replace it as the battery finally gave out . It would go a week without needing to be recharged , using it twice a day . I bought an e-series to replace it and I am so dissappointed . The battery lasts for one brushing , thats all . Even if it is charged and taken on a trip , being out of the charger for half a day the battery is dead . I thought paying $ 100 for a toothbrush they would n't skimp on the quality but I was wrong . Then assuming I must have bought a defective one , I bought a second and it is exactly the same . Also when I brush my teeth in the morning , the battery is n't charged up again by noon . For the price , they should n't have skimped on the battery , I am so dissappointed in Soniccare , I will never buy another , in fact , if it was on sale for $ 2.99 next to a childs toothbrush I would n't buy it as it is totally unusable ... Do n't waste your money .
 This last order was such a dissapointment . Both heads started to shred and have long unfolding strands start popping out within the first few uses . Already worn down after three weeks . Not a all like the old , better quality in the past .
 So true about water collecting in the base . Ca n't be good for longevity . Maybe that 's why it has been substituted . I have always taken the original system apart every day and so I know water did not collect in the base as this one does .
 This is a sad day because I was a Sonicare fan . I recommended it to my patients who needed the extra care and really talked it up because it does help but I just recently went to a continuing education seminar on homecare devices and found my beloved Sonicare was not the one that did the best job according to the research . The research was done by independent folks , was funded independently and was carried out such that the results could be taken seriously -LRB- valid results -RRB- . It was done over a long period of time -LRB- over years , not weeks -RRB- and on very large groups of people . There were other researchers who compared all the research that has been done with rigorous standards to see what their results were too . In all the research presented , they compared all the electric toothbrushes that were out there and Sonicare did not fare as well as the top of the line Oral B -LRB- sorry folks , the most expensive model -RRB- . The research said that the combination of sonic and rotary action over time -LRB- within a month or two of use -RRB- demonstrated a greater effect on reduction of plaque and gingivitis scores -LRB- the plaque and gingivitis levels were lower for the sonic rotary devices -LRB- Oral B -RRB- compared to the sonic cradle-rock devices -LRB- Sonicare -RRB- -RRB- . I you are on a budget , it is still acceptable to use the battery operated toothbrushes as long as you can change the head , the head spins around and you can either recharge or replace the batteries . The sonic action is the greatest in the Oral B top of the line model and that is what helps reduce tartar and staining . It is worth making the switch . I 'm sorry if I burst any bubbles but mine was burst a couple of months ago and the findings were significant enough to spread the news .
 I have been using the Sonicare toothbrush for any years and am pleased with the results -LRB- though I recommend that you not press too hard as it may damage your enamel over time -RRB- My gripe is that they could n't figure out that the brush head is not sealed well . This quickly causes a gunk build up in both the brush head base and the unit . It is almost impossible to get it into all the crevices to clean it thoroughly even with Qtips and other implements . Eventually , you see mold and bacteria developing and this is not sanitary.I do n't know if the Oral B product is designed more effectively but I 'm going to check .
 The newly re-designed brush heads allow build up of gunk inside the toothbrush . The seals are not that great . I can get them clean , but others have expressed they have trouble cleaning them . My issue is that because of the buildup , mold develops inside the brush , and even after cleaning , the smell will not go away . I threw out the rest and currently using a different brush until I find a replacement sonic brush . The old style was just fine . I do n't know why Philips had to change it and ruin a good product .
 TWICE THIS YEAR I HAVE RECEIVED DOUBLE SHIPMENTS OF THE PRODUCT AND HAVE TRIED REPEADTEDLY TO RETURN ONE OF THEM BUT COULD NOT DO SO . PLEASE CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP IN THE AMAZON AUTO RE-ORDER PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY . IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT AMAZON BY PHONE OR EMAIL TO CORRECT AN ERROR.Philips Sonicare Advance -LRB- A-Series -RRB- Replacement Brush Head , Standard -LRB- 2-Pack -RRB-
 Its been over a month and I still have not received the product even though I have written Amazon customer service and the UPS tracking says it was delivered ! I ca n't get anyone from Amazon to help !!!
 Beware of Sonicare 's Buy 2 Get 1 Free Brush Head Offer . I bought 2 Sonicare brush heads and sent the original UPC symbol to Sonicare . They sent me a postcard stating that it did not receive the original UPC symbol or proof-of-purchase tab.Although the Sonicare brush is okay , I definitely would not buy another Sonicare product again based on the company 's incorrect handling of its promotion offer !
 I was very disappointed in that I could not find the correct item number that I wanted -LRB- regular sonic replacement head -RRB- and therefore they sent me the compact - I do n't know what item that number was because I could n't find any item numbers . I therefore returned the product which I got refunded but it did not include the shipping . I am upset theat I did n't get credit for the shipping and I had to pay shipping to return the item .
 Unable to evaluate because I bought the wrong sonicare brush head.The sonicare company does not make the package easy to open . I ended up ripping the plastic cover and to my chagrin , it was the wrong brush head for my electric toothbrush . I needed the sonicare intellicare brush head . Needless to say , since I ruined the hard plastic cover , I figured it would be inappropriate to try and exchange it . Be sure you know your sonicare toothbrush series or name before ordering . I thought I knew mine ... I was dead wrong . My fault . If I would have kept the box that the electric toothbrush came in , I would not have made this $ 27.00 error.The intellicare toothbrush
 I am disappointed with the Hx700L/30 E-series toothbrush replacement heads from Amazon delivered to me on November 26 , 2011 . I do n't find the bristles as soft as the other E-series replacement heads purchased by me . As a matter of fact the new bristles are so hard that my dentist informed me that I was brushing my gums away :-LRB- The problem is that since the brush heads should be replaced every 3 months I ordered this item as a repeat order . I do n't know why these brush heads are so different and what to expect from the next order . If the future brush heads bristles are of the same quality , please cancel my order.Thank you .
 The brush head is too small , almost like a child size . The product description does not state that prior to purchase .
 The only complaint I have with the brushes is that they do n't always prevent moisture from seeping into the screw-on assembly part of the brush . That results in mildew and goop building up in the base of the brush assembly even after rinsing . It basically makes cleaning a bit harder.The annoying clamshell packaging does not have any perforations to open it easily so you must use a box cutter to open it which is somewhat irritating .
 I 've been using a Sonicare brush -LRB- handle -RRB- since November , 2007 . I 'm on my fifth brush head . See , these brush heads used to be good for six months -LRB- 5 brushes = > 2.5 years -RRB- , and now these new versions supposedly are only good for three . And they are the same price ... It seems there are three possibilities for lowering the replacement time to three months . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Sonicare relabeled to make more money by increasing turnover . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Sonicare found that their products did n't live up to what they originally claimed -LRB- in my experience they lasted six months -RRB- . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Sonicare redesigned these brushes to wear out faster to make more money.I 'm on my first brush head of these `` three month '' heads , about four months in . Yes , I ignored their three month suggestion . The brush head seems to be lasting about as well as the others but I 'll report back again in two months if that is n't the case . So my guess is that Sonicare 's decision was based on -LRB- 1 -RRB- . If it was -LRB- 2 -RRB- , I suspect they would have modified their six month label to suggest 3-6 months , not just having the time to three months.On the brushes themselves , they work well . The heads never fit the handle as seamlessly -LRB- or quietly -RRB- as they probable could but this is n't a major problem . The new versions have a blue strip of color in the brush that does partially wear off in about four months ... Sonicare trying to tell me to replace the head , no doubt.Overall , 4 stars for the brush head , minus 2 stars for what I interpret as Sonicare trying to scam its customers by an extra $ 20-25 / year . When I do look for a new brush handle , I definitely wo n't be looking at just Sonicare and will have a bias to buy another brand .
 This model has to be the worse electric brush I 've ever owned . It is the only one that developed black mold . After buying new brushes , Phillips ' sanitizer , and sanitizing the base , I had to toss another brush after six weeks . The only way to keep this brush clean is to break it down , clean it , then air dry it every time it is used.The plastic used appears to be a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and mold . I wonder how many people have been made ill or had allergic reactions to mold.Don ' t waste your money .
 My Package arrived with only one brush head . The advertised unit is a two pack . The frustration free packaging is easy to open .
 Phillips Sonicare works as well , but no better than the Braun Vitality . However , the Phillips head replacements cost , per year , what I pay for dentist 's cleaning . Definitely not not value for the money .
 I have only had this product a month and it stops after 30 seconds . I restarted and it runs about 10 secs and stops . After a couple times of that , it wo n't run at all . Very frustrating .
 I think Phillips has stopped making the original brush head . I do n't like the feel of these replacements , but I 'll use them until I can afford a new toothbrush .
 I love the toothbrush , but these heads just do n't last nearly as long as advertised . I feel like after a week they are soft and feel the same as the do after 3 months .
 As other reviewers have mentioned , the inside of these things becomes coated with mold . The only way I manage it is to either soak the base of the head in mouthwash , or thoroughly clean it out with a q-tip -LRB- or both -RRB- . Either way , the mold just accumulates again pretty quickly . Also , my harsh cleaning methods have caused the metal part at the bottom to rust , which creates a whole new set of problems . Even with all of this , I still ca n't clean every part , so the mold is never completely gone . It is just so disgusting to think that I am putting these things in/near my mouth ever day . I love the Sonicare , but these brushes really need to be designed better .
 I owned an old Sonicare for many years . It was a great product.After five years , I purchased a new one . This was after Philips bought the company . It failed in a year . They replaced it , but with another model , which they said at the time was better . The replacement has now failed after a few months . They refuse to replace it again.What 's interesting is that I had inadvertently called the professional customer service line -LRB- for dentists and the like -RRB- a few minutes before that call . There I was told the replacement model they sent me had a known history of failures and they would replace it with an improved version . We started to get the replacement information and he found out I was a retail customer . He said he could n't do it and gave me a different number where , he said , they would take care of it . A that line -LRB- retail customer service -RRB- they told me that there was no problem with the unit and they would not replace it . This despite the fact that it was only nine months old and had a documented history of failures . When I told them what I had been told by the other guy , the response was that he was wrong , that no one at Philips would ever say that . But the fact remains that my junk replacement unit failed and the guy I spoke with knew exactly what I was talking about and could describe the failure . There is no doubt that Philips knew full well they were sending me a junk product that they were clearing out of their warehouse because they had to get rid of them.Clearly , there is one company line for dentists who shill these things and get freebies for their staffs , and another company line for consumers who actually buy them . Buy Philips Sonicare products at your own risk .
 The bristles are too small so they do n't cover much area and are not effective . I had to buy another set at a store and dump these . Save your money !
 i 've used other electric brushes and this one pales in comparison . the heads wear out quickly .
 Have you ever tried to clean the sonicare ? All the crevices and places for water and germs to seep is too much . I 'm a public health nurse and I think it 's a haven for germs . I tried to clean it and the brush was still good but I could n't remove the mildewy smell despite 20 minutes of scrubbing it with -LRB- yes -RRB- an old regular toothbrush to get into the crevices.I 'll look for another but wo n't be surprized if I can not find an electric one that does n't have similar problems.One more thing - this electric brush also is n't the best for people with disabilities who rely on others for cleaning their toothbrushes.I 've wondered if there will be a tooth brush disease to be discovered like legionnaires someday.Hello tooth brush companies - if you tout how easy it is to clean your electric toothbrush people will sit up and listen.Julie - Public Health Nurse from Minnesota
 Like printer ink these little bits of plastic and magnets are total rip-offs . Look that them . $ 12 each ? Give me a break . And then they `` recommend '' throwing it away after three months . I used my last one for two years . When the handle goes , I will NOT be buying another one of these .
 This item is a standard refill and the product itself is fine however not a good deal . Costco has them for $ 10 cheaper and it includes 4 refills rather than 3 .
 I highly recommend Sonicare and the replacement brushes . However , I ordered these replacement brushes not knowing there was a difference in brush head sizes . The notation `` compact '' refers to the smaller brush head size . Note in the photos you can see this is a smaller brush head . This size is very difficult to use and does not provide the same cleaning . The `` standard '' refers to the larger brush head size which came with my Sonicare . I recommend this size . A little more cost but worth it . Great product and I would have given 5 starts but wanted to note the size issues .
 We have an Advance model brush and was told the `` E '' series would work . Maybe for some it does , but it kept coming off of our brush handle . Also , they are way too expensive as noted by others in these reviews .
 The `` E '' series brush head leaks into the base , and can also vibrate loose . I found the old `` A '' series on line , and purchased them . They do n't leak , nor come loose!I contacted Philips direct , and told them of this problem , and they said that they knew about it , but was not doing anything to correct it .
 The replacement heads for the Sonicare Elite are not as shown or described . The ones I received are not the `` slim angled neck '' they are straight . Yes , they fit the elite unit but they are not the ones I ordered .
 I have received a counterfeit product . One out of the two replacement brush heads were not of Philips Sonicare quality . I am a long time user of these products and noticed a dramatic difference in the two replacement brushes . Also only one of the two replacement brushes actually had E-series printed on it which demonstrates that it was not authentic . Hope this review help future buyers . Thank you for your time .
 This is the first time Amazon Subscribe & Save has sent me this kind of brush head . Previously Amazon sent Sonicare Advance heads , and I never had any problems with those . The newer brush heads fit the handle but are of much lower quality . One of the metal posts in the bottom of the brush head broke after a month of use . Black mold began growing after a few months and is difficult to get rid of.I want the old brush heads back .
 Beware of the word ` compact ' ! This may mean that the teeny tiny brush will fit even your newborn 's mouth . Would have been perfect if not for the size . Also , while purusing Costco , the larger brush version of these brushes were there in a 6 pack for $ 49.99 . Just a thought !
 I liked Sonicare E toothbrush so much and that is why I ordered this replacement head . Well , , , the bristle is not as soft as the original one . It is so rough and stiff . I know that most of the bristles , in the beginning it is not soft . However , I think it shoule have the softness at the beginning considering the expensive price !!! I think the bristle in the beginning is just same as dollar piece ones . I am disappointed . I will change to oral B electric toothbrush once this one is worn .
 I 've been using an E-series brush for 3 + years . It has always been great and I have just had to clean the inside a little here and there . But with my newest replacement brushes , the black piece has be shedding itself all over the inside of the brush with little pieces of black rubber or plastic . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 The design of the brush leads to a lot of gunk build up and a constant need to take the head off and scrub the inside . I got a new Sonicare toothbrushPhilips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with Sanitizerand the design is much better .
 was not the right toothbrush head - returned and have not received confirmation of return or a credit
 I 'm a bit upset that I go through these brushes so fast , but they do a good job with cleaning . The box says they should last for several weeks , however I 've found that any longer then a month or a month and a half and I 'm very disappointed with performance as well as feel .
 I have a small mouth and end up using the smaller brush heads . The company needs to improve the quality on this item . They do not last very long at all . I have had to replace 2 heads in UNDER 6 months !
 I received my supposedly `` new '' sonicare replacement toothbrushes that were not in the original packaging and had been put in new packaging . Given that this is an item that goes in your mouth I think it is unreasonable and unsanitary that this item be re-sold without its original packaging . I never would have ordered this item if I known that you repackaged a dental tooth brush.I now know why you picture the two replacement toothbrushes without being in their original package
 the heads are half the normal size , as if they were for children . i will never purchase again
 I was disappointed in the size of the replacement head . It was not clearly stated in add that it was a smaller version of the original toothbrush head .
 Dear Amazonians , The brush-head that came with my toothbrush is starting to get frazzled , and it 's time to start looking for new heads . -LRB- My father always said he wanted to see me get a head ... -RRB- I 'm completely unhappy about having to spend $ 10 per head . I do n't believe I 'll be getting what I pay for , because : The heads are small . I 've never chosen a `` compact head , '' but that 's all that 's available for the Sonicare.The bristles are a combination of soft , extra-soft , and uselessly-soft bristles . I assume that extra-soft bristles have a shorter lifetime than normally-soft bristles , which aggravates the megaprice problem . Maybe the first couple of days using the Sonicare delivers an overwhelming experience -LRB- not really -RRB- that 's best overcome with extra-soft bristles , but at this point , I would be happy to have a head full of normally-soft bristles . Unfortunately , dissatisfyingly extra-soft bristles are all that 's available for the Sonicare.The fat bottom of the head disallows putting the Sonicare far enough into my mouth to brush the back of my tongue , so I wind up having to keep a real toothbrush around , anyway . Even if I could fit the head back there , it would be too small for the job , due to my big tongue . Pardon my tangent.Because the Sonicare is so effective , neither the head 's softness nor smallness is much of a drawback . By leaving the scrubbing motions to the device , I 'm able to spend more attention to aiming accurately and evenly , to avoid overscrubbing , to avoid falling asleep from boredom , and it does a better job than I could . If I could do it all over , I would choose the Sonicare again over the old method , but I 'm still sickened by the single-option of expensive , minimum-value and minimum-lifetime heads . -LRB- The real sticker-shock will happen when I have to throw away the Sonicare because the integrated Ni-Cad batteries can not be replaced , but only mutilatingly removed for recycling . -RRB- I give the heads 2-out-of-5 Amazonian stars because although they work , they take undue advantage of the customer.Best luck,-Neil -
 BUYER BEWARE ! This product has no follow up service . I have a faulty and defective brush head which has caused mold to grown inside the unit . I contacted customer service and they told me to send in the Model Number and they would replace the unit and brush heads . When I replied to their email I received a non-delivery status , FOUR TIMES ! When contacting customer service via telephone they stated they could n't replace anything because I did n't have proof of purchase . I suppose owning the unit is n't enough . Do n't expect anything from Sonicare if you have a problem . Buy your toothbrush from another manufacturer . When I finally contacted another representative she told me the email is sent out by a person who has no control and just returns emails and says whatever it is they want to say . Caveat Emptor !!!
 One of the brush heads stopped working in a week . I have just started using the second brush head and do n't know how long it will last . I have been using Sonicare for a few years and have bought brush heads from other retailers and this has never happened . I am not sure if the one I received is defective or was damaged by Amazon while preparing their `` Frustration free packaging ''
 I find these replacement heads are poorly made , I am not sure why . I thought at first it was one that was defective but with every replacement head the brissles come out which is one very annoying and uncomfortable when brushing my teeth . I will cancel any future orders .
 brushes were not of same quality . do not fit properlywould not buy again.prior purchases were ok . looks like they changed purveyors
 For me - The counter-top cleaner causes a horrible eye burning , nose running , throat irritating , multiple sneezing reaction every time I use it.I 'm frustrated because there is not a full ingredients label , so there is no way to know what is causing my horrific reaction .
 I suppose you get what you pay for . Usually I can get a pretty good deal , but these batteries just do n't hold up very well . My small , tiny flashlight and laser pointer just eats up the power in these batteries . The original batteries that came with my laser pointer lasted about five times longer than this product . You wo n't find me buying this product again .
 I suffered severe side effects from taking MSM . My stool changed color , lost weight , and my vision , sense of smell , and hearing became distorted . If you look at the information on the web it says that MSM is completely safe , however most nutritional supplements are not subject to rigorous study to determine their safety . Thus , the paucity of data with respect to the long-term safety of MSM . According to my M.D , MSM acts to suppress amino acid production in one 's body , and is extremely unsafe for that reason . As amino acids are essential for nervous system function , etc. . I had to withdraw from a semester of college due to taking MSM . I would highly recommend not taking it , and if you do using extremely low dosages and consulting with your M.D first . As taking it is not like taking a multi-vitamin . Which I did not know to my great regret .
 The bottle says Pure MSM in big letters , but below this is says `` 99 % pure No Heavy Metals ! in red . I thought I was buying pure MSM . This brand does not pass the sink test . When I put the powder from the capsule in warm water , it dissolves slowly , but the water is cloudy . I have only been using it for three days , so I do n't know if it will help with joint pain or not . Why does n't TriMedica put in big letters , 99 % pure . 99 % is not 100 . Hope I did n't waste my money . Make sure if you are going to buy MSM make sure you read the whole label . When I typed in 100 % pure MSM , this TriMedica MSM came up . I was told pure MSM is what I need , not 99 % . TriMedica did n't lie , it says on the bottle 99 % pure ; they just put that in smaller letters .
 Pure MSM should sink to the bottom when added to a glass of water , this fails the test miserably , what ever is left floating on the water is NOT pure MSM as described.I should have tested BEFORE I started taking it , I did n't and a week into it I FELT ILL , I did the float test and I have no clue what is floating around but it aint MSM , do yourself a favor , give this a miss .
 I really wanted to like these socks because of the price . It is about 1/3 of the price of a top brand I had for 4 years . Unfortunately , the second time I wore them , after a full day at the office I got home and found out they had dropped to my ankle . This is totally unacceptable if you have serious circulation problem like I do . Too bad .
 Save your money until you can buy a shaver that works . The battery lasts about 3 days , if I 'm lucky , but you ca n't wait more than 1 day between shaves or the thing wo n't work . Again , a piece of **** -LRB- you can fill in the letters -RRB- .
 I bought this on a whim , just to see if I 'd like to use an electric razor or not . After using it for 6 months , I do n't think I do . It never did shave as close as a safety razor -- I usually use a Gillette Sensor , and have been for fifteen years -- and if my skin was the tiniest bit damp -LRB- from sweat or a fresh washing -RRB- it stuck to my skin , so I had to use it only at certain times of day when my skin was in just the right state of not-quite-cleanliness . I could have started buying pre-shave lotion , but I 've never had to with my regular razor , and it just seems to me like an excess expense . Especially since , after a nice hot shower , my Sensor does n't even require that I use shaving cream.Also , if I push too hard or shave too often , I get razor burns that are so bad they bleed . And since it does n't shave as well as my trusty Sensor , I have to shave a lot more often . It also fails if you do n't shave often enough -- long hairs never enter the mesh , they just get pushed out of the way . I found one hair under my chin that was an inch long before I noticed it . I know that you 're supposed to be able to use the trimmer to catch hairs like that , but even that often failed to cut well . Several times I ended up using my Sensor to finish up , because this razor just did n't do a good enough job.Now , I do n't have that thick of a beard , so it should n't be this hard to get the razor to cut smooth and close . I do n't want to think about what damage this razor would do to the skin of a thick-bearded man .
 I began shaving daily with this shaver on February 13 . The foil has a hole in it -LRB- which renders the foil useless -RRB- as of March 30 . The shave quality is so-so . It does get close , but it misses a lot of hairs on my neck . This being my second Remington that has sucked , I 'm going to try some other brands . Maybe a rotary . At least it was cheap ...
 The device shaves BUT its has some major engineering flaws unless you can tolerate shaving with an electric cord attached or keep charging the thing everyday .1 . When charging , the green LED will go on for a while and then off for a while . This cycle repeats . I find it very confusing and wonder when it will be fully charged . The owner 's manual does n't have any explanation about this behavior . I later found some explanation at the manufacturer 's web site under MS2-300 manual .2 . After 24 hr . of battery charge as recommended in the owner 's manual , the charge only lasted 2 shaves -LRB- < 5 min . -RRB- for me as opposed to 55 minute of running time per charge . My old Braun can last me for weeks with one charge .3 . When the device runs of of charge , within 5 seconds it will drop from full power to a level that is very slow ; and it feels like the shaver is plucking instead of shaving . I hate it ! I have used several Brauns , Panasonics , etc. with AA or integrated battery . None of them will drop so quick when running out of juice . For example , Brauns will allow me for at least another week of shaving before I recharge the shaver with plenty of warning -LRB- red light blinking -RRB- and no surprises .4 . Like other commentators , I do find the shaver noisy and specially bothersome when shaving close to the sideburns .
 Full charge can only support one time less than 5-min shaving !
 I paid $ 25 for this . It hurts . I have had it for 4 months replaced the blades once figuring that maybe I got a bad set . I 'll replace the shaver next . It leaves my face black . It 's worth the price for a throw away razor . I 'm going back to Norelco .
 The fully charged shaver lasted only one day . Also , very noisy . I would not buy it if it is $ 10 .
 I got suckered into the cheap price for the electric razor and the good reviews on here . But after two weeks of using this thing , I think I 've had enough . I have sensitive skin and thought that an electric razor would work better than my Mach 3 . I was horribly wrong . Everytime I use this thing , my neck looks like a bad case of leprosy , complete with a couple missed hairs ever inch or so . I 'm not a shave every day kind of guy , so after two days of growth , this thing is useless .
 I did n't like this shaver . No matter the frequency of use I still had razor bumps and never had a close shave . The shaver did n't do much other than chap my skin .
 Overall performance is so-so , but the rechargerable battery has really limited capacity . Had better keep it plugged in even when you are not using -LRB- you will notice it produces a lot of heat when you recharge it , I am not sure whether this is normal or not -RRB- .
 This razor does an adequate if unremarkable job of shaving your face . The battery recharge life is the shortest of any electric razor I have ever owned - after three shaves you definitely need to recharge . The darn thing even quit mid shave on me once - not a thrill when you are getting ready for work in the morning . It 's also by far the loudest electric razor I ever heard . If you can live with the noise and constant charging then it 's okay for the price . Personally I doubt I will wait too long before I replace it with a higher quality razor . I 'd have given only 1 star if the price was n't so low . I should n't have been so cheap & gotten something better to begin with !
 I gave up on this one and Remmington after 20 years . This series of razors
 i bought this shaver because i had had several of the round blade shavers in the past , and had good experiences shaving with the microfoil style in the past . however , when i shaved for the first time , i was very dissappointed . for some reason , the shaver seems to cut 9 of 10 hairs in any particular area , leaving very sparse untouched hairs all over my face . after going over and over my face for close to 10 minutes , the hairs were never cut . I had to finish it off with a disposable razor . having experience with many other electric shavers , i dont think my technique was lacking.Also , this shaver seems extraordinarily loud . dont plan to use it while your roommates or neighbors are sleeping.I wanted to return this item , but apparently my packing slip was thrown away ...
 This would have been a great shaver , especcially for traveling , if it were not for two big problems.First , the battery does not always seem to hold a charge . On my last vacation I had to recharge the shaver 3 times in 1 week!Even after a full charge I would go to use it the next day and it would be totally drained!Second problem is the useless cover that is supposed to protect the head when not in use and when traveling . It is very loose fitting and does not stay on and this is a real problem.Even at the low price paid I would not recommend it . I am eventually going to have to replace it . A real shame ...
 Having worn a hole in the screen of my MS2-250 after 2 years , I found found that a replacement head was more expensive than a new MS2-370 so I ordered a new MSR-370 on sale for $ 19.95 plus shipping . The running time per charge was the 55min advertised for the 250 but I could only get 2 shaves at a total run time of less than 10 min out of the 370 which also has a run time advertised of 55min . To remedy the problem I switched the new head and blades off the 370 to the 250 and now again I have a decent razor . I do n't understand these razors being sold with inferior batteries . If it 's a case of you get what you pay for , then they should n't advertise 55min run time .
 Shave is OK , not great . But be warned that , like other low-end razors , this only works on battery . I.e. if your battery runs out , you can not plug it in an outlet and continue to use it . If you are half way through a shave - too bad . Given the rather terrible battery life on this thing , that happens an unacceptable amount.This is especially bad given that working direct from an outlet would not cost more to implement - and it 's absence is just done to cripple low end razors . Do n't be fooled - you 're going to have to carry a non-electric razor around anyway given this limitation - so I recommend just not buying this at all .
 Used the shaver for around a month and it simply stopped workign after taht . I think it works well , guess I was unfortunate taht it stopped working . Am looking to repair it soon .
 I bought this shaver and I thought it was a step up from the cheap battery operated one I had . But this was way more money and way less performance . I was just too lazy to send it back so I am stuck . I would feel bad about selling it another person . But I just might do that .
 The lights on mine do n't work , the trimmer on it is terrible . Spend more money on something better . This razor is cheap .
 This is my first time using a electric shaver , and i must say i 'm very disatisfied with it . I do n't know if this is the only shaver or every other shaver will give these kind of results . I tried every pre-powder and pre-lotion and there are still strands of hair on my face . It is never like shaving with a normal razor shaver and cream . I had to spent twice the time then normal razor shavers .
 i should have expected that for the price but it just dosent work at all . oh well , just another one in the pile of junk that dosent work as advertised

 Mine did not come with the lanyard shown in the product pic . Burt 's Bees is far better . Just go to CVS or Target and pick up a lip balm and save yourself the wait . It 's nothing special .

 I just ordered this product . When it arrived , I opened the box and took off the bubble wrap . The bottle I got was Lobelia extract ! This herb is also known as Asthma Weed , Pukeweed , and Vomitwort ... I do n't think it will taste much like Cinnamon.The bottle ships in a bubble wrapped bag . The bag had a sticker for `` Cinnamon Bark '' on top of the correct sticker reading `` Lobelia '' ... I would not order this item until Amazon fixes the warehouse stock labels !
 Following instructions got me no-where . I do n't like these and do n't use them . They are small enough that they are put in easily but getting them out is a tad uncomfortable . They do n't just slip out when releasing your muscles .
 I typically wear size 10.5-11 .5 US Men 's shoes . I have a fiberglass cast on my foot . The `` Medium-Large '' is at least three inches too short.Utterly useless.Now I 've got the hassle of sending this thing back.If you 're considering buying this thing beware.Seller

 This product caused me to have a severe reaction that resulted in a week of large blisters all over my feet . I had been using another tea tree product before this one without reaction , so I do n't know if it is the formulation or simply a much greater concentration of tea tree oil , but I would recommend that you try it on a small scale for several days before spraying it all over .
 When you look at the photo it is a package of 300 capsules . When you get to check out , it is only 100 .
 I was not happy with the item I purchased and tried to contact the seller , but could not get in touch with them .
 Disappointing !!! I had hoped to get more than one day of ` therapy ' from these socks but found that after washing , carefully , the socks would n't even stay up ! Let alone provide a bit of support . So not only lacking support but not even staying in place . Just warming my ankles until I could throw them away . Perhaps the company had these on their shelf too long ?

 I bought this because it was the closest formula to some of the older , better weight loss supplements . Unfortunately , this was n't a good replacement . It could be that my body does n't react as well to this formula as it used to , but there are other issues as well . When I opened the bottle , at least 20 % of the capsules had burst during shipping . Since it 's an oil/liquid supplement , it coated all the other capsules and made them slippery and difficult to take . I got some energy from JetFuel , but not enough to justify the price . I 'd skip this one and try something like VPX Redline Ultimate or Meltdown . With any energy supplement , it 's important to take a week every month for optimal results , otherwise your body can adjust and they wo n't be as effective .
 This wax was horrible . I have used many many waxes and this is just horrible . I do not recommend this product for anyone !!!
 1 -RRB- Melting point is very high ! It has to be very hot to reach the spreadable consistency which means it will burn your skin .2 -RRB- Does not stick to any strip -LRB- fabric or paper -RRB- which means when you pull it out the wax stays on your skin . You have to pull the wax out directly from your skin . Very painful process . It damages your skin , which exposes your skin to infection . It takes hours to do this , & IT DOES NOT REMOVE YOUR UNWANTED HAIR ! 3 -RRB- It creates a huge mess!WASTE OF MONEY ! DO NOT BUY !
 This stuff wo n't suppport your back and it does n't stay on the lower back , it keeps running up and down while I wear it , end up return this item .

 This particular back brace-support is made for men who are no larger than a medium.It does not adjust for waist size . If you 're a woman , size large , it might fit.It WILL NOT fit if you wear a men 's large , and if you wear an extra large shirt , it will noteven fasten . Not only that , but you can go to Home Depot and find a comparable , highquality belt with shoulder straps in multiple sizes for 1/4 of the price ... $ 14 !
 In spite of the research - No noticeable change . Seems like a waste of money .

 This is the worse hot water bottle product I 've ever had . I was excited when I found out the product was made in Germany , but was extremely disappointed when I received the product the mail . The bottle was thin with the same textured pattern on both sides -LRB- front and back -RRB- of the bottle . Usually good hot water bottles have a ribbed surface and a smoother side . When i filled the bottle up with hot water , the bottle had a strong smell like the plastic from blow up pools . This smell DID NOT GO AWAY and I had to wrap the bottle up in a towel so that the odor did n't bother me as much . Another thing that I noticed was that when the bottle was filled with hot water , the plastic of the bottle left a RESIDUE on my hands where I touched it - I 'm not sure what was going on there . At first I did n't think it was coming from the bottle and I kept washing my hands until I noticed that every time I touched the bottle , I had a waxy residue on it . The third thing I noticed was that the cap was fairly wide and shallow . The threading on other bottles that I 've had were about 1 inch long . The cap for this made in Germany product was maybe a little over HALF an inch long -LRB- not a very secure length when you 're filling something with hot water and do n't want it spilling anywhere -RRB- . I do n't know why these bottles has such high ratings for their low quality , bad smell , and defectiveness . My advise to anyone is stay away from these !!!
 While the hot water bottle looks like the picture , it does n't perform like I thought it would . I 've been looking for years for one of the old-fashioned hot water bottles . The kind that really warm up when you put hot water in it . Unfortunately , this one is like the plastic drugstore variety that really is n't all that hot . I thought since it comes from Germany and it was $ $ $ that it would work . Costly mistake .
 I received a bright red bottle and hung it up in a dark well aired pantry . Over a short time it turned a blotchy pink and never lost a very strong smell of rubber .
 Why are all the fashy bottles on Amazon child-size ? I bought this product because the one I bought earlier -LRB- supposedly the classic one -RRB- was 1.2 litre capacity . Well , so is this one !! Its not 2-litre and is so small that I ca n't see how an adult is supposed to use it . At least this one seems to be more flexible and better quality than the classic one . Somehow I think this seller is simply selling children 's fashy bottles -LRB- which cost less -RRB- for the price of adult 's 2-litre hot water bottle .
 BY THE TIME I FIGHT WITH THESE TO GET THEM ON MY FEET MY FIGHT WOUL BE OVER AND WOULD NEED A NAP FROM THE STRUGGING . AND IF YOU HAVE NAILS , ITS EVEN HARDER ,
 Disappointing !!! I had hoped to get more than one day of ` therapy ' from these socks but found that after washing , carefully , the socks would n't even stay up ! Let alone provide a bit of support . So not only lacking support but not even staying in place . Just warming my ankles until I could throw them away . Perhaps the company had these on their shelf too long ?
 I 've taken it everyday for the last 28 days - no difference that I can tell . Save your money and go with something else .
 This product no better than regular saline solution . Would I purchase the product again `` NO '' .

 I bought this product to give me more energy . I used it as directed for 4 weeks but saw no improvement in my energy level . I actually had some sexual side effects due to an interaction with my other medications . You can try it and see if it works for you . It did not work for me .

 I not only suffer from neck pain for the past few years . I was recommended traction by my doctor and spent several months at PT . The therapist did traction using her hands while also assigning me exercises to build the muscles in my neck . Overall , the muscles become better but I continued to suffer from vertigo and have pain . I started to investigate these gadgets for doing traction on my own . Of course the ultimate are the $ 300 electrical machines . Considering what I paid for in PT , maybe that would have been a better investment . This model had good reviews so I took a chance . I read that some users with TMJ had difficulty . Some users also tweaked the unit to reduce jaw pain . Following this advice I purchased a few parts at a hardware store . This reduced the pressure on the side of the jaw . That said , the unit is holding on to to the back of your head and under your jaw as it lifts up your head . I 'm sorry to say that even with my tweaking of the machine , I was having pain in my jaw . It does help the neck . Ca n't say it is a night and day difference . I proceeded to use the units several nights and worked my way up in weights . After 1 week my TMJ was flaring up . Bottom line
 I used this device once and it hurt my jaw so bad that I did n't use it again . My PT said these devices are dangerous , and should be avoided at all costs . There are other ways to do traction that are safer , more effective , and cheap . Using a big rubber band and a towel is the best way to do it if you do n't have a machine . These contraptions can cause jaw issues !!!
 ok . i actually liked this product at first . it was easy to use , and though it really hurt my jaw -LRB- which is now very messed up -- clicking , grating , feels dislocated -RRB- i was just itching to stretch up my neck , and when my neck would pop , it just felt great . addicting!then , one day , i 'm using it when IT FALLS AND CRACKS ME ON THE HEAD ! blood starts dripping from a gash on the top of my head . after i clean myself up -LRB- it did n't hurt too too bad -RRB- i become overwhelmingly tired , and realize that i may have a slight concussion.so i have my father take me to the emergency room . luckily i did n't need stitches , but was told that i did have a mild consussion . ruined my entire day!anyway , i 'm fine now . but there is a hole in the top front side of the door i was using . maybe the door was n't sturdy enough . seems it 's not a solid wood door , but hollow in areas -LRB- as i believe many doors inside people 's homes are -RRB- . but , still , i 'm anxious to have my neck stretched , and want to use it again . but between my fear of it falling on my head again , and my messed up jaw , it 's not worth it.but i know , if you 're gon na try it , you 're gon na try it . -LRB- i read reviews warning about it hurting your jaw , and falling over on you , but for some reason i just NEEDED it and did n't think any of that applied to me ! : -RRB- if i were to take out the falling on my head factor and messing up my jaw factor , it 's a pretty good product!so my advice is to check out the doors in your house and choose one that is solid wood throughout . go slow , and just use care . odds are , you wo n't be as unlucky as i was !
 Note , the product is as was specified . No problems with the seller ; shipped immediately . Thank you.But the product itself is a real pain in the neck or , should I say , the head . The structural manufacturing is lacking
 I received this product about a month ago and was excited at the prospect of relieving my neck , shoulder and back pain . When I went to use it I realized that the bracket did n't fit over a single door in my house . I know I should have measured the doors first , but I thought they were a standard size.I had to email the company twice before they responded that I could purchase a bigger bracket for $ 23 . I tried to give it NO STARS , but the site wo n't allow that.I am not pleased .
 Please spare yourself with this device . Save your money ... My entire family tried this and told me that I 've been had ... and i wasted my money . . It doesnt work . . it squishing your face thats all it does ...
 Rip Off ... returned product since it was not beneficial ... used for 5 minutes one time ... called customer service to request form to return ... no problem , will e-mail return form and use to return product ... nothing from csr regarding any limitations on returns ... a week later I get a form e-mail via Amazon
 This is a good Idea likely on paper , but not in real life.I 'm not sure if it 's made for people with smaller heads or what , but all it does is pull up on my jaw , my chin , and squeeze my face.The straps that suspends you is to far forward for traction , and the straps from the back to front is not strong enough.This is not worth the money , or time in my opinion , and can harm your jaw if used .
 I purchased this product because I have two herniated discs in my cervical spine and cervical spondylosis . During one 8-week course of physical therapy , after responding well to in-office traction , my therapist suggested that I get a traction device for home . I went on Amazon and found this product . I struggled with getting it over my head and felt that it really just squeezed my cheeks and chin . I put it over a sturdy door and ratcheted up the pressure . Again , just tight squeezing of my head , but very little pressure release for my neck . I thought I was using it incorrectly , so I took it to my therapist who set it up for me and helped me try several different positions -LRB- back to the door , facing the door , close to the door , farther out , stool , low chair , etc -RRB- and nothing worked . Finally , she worked with my doctor and my insurance company to get me a pneumatic cervical traction unit that requires you to lay down and pump air into the machine to relieve pressure on the discs . The doctor-prescribed unit works wonders and although it was frustrating wasting $ 50 on the over-the-door unit , as soon as I got the pneumatic system , this one went right into the waste basket .
 I bought this after reading all the reviews and by the recommendation of my physical therapist , and thought I would be able to deal with the discomfort mentioned by others , but found that I could only tolerate it for a few minutes at a time . That is not enough time to allow the traction process to work its magic . The pressure on my jaws was too much to tolerate , and they would ache for some time afterwards.I am trying the inflatable pillow device -LRB- 4 compartment -RRB- also advertised here on Amazon and see if its more comfortable . If not , then I will try to fashion the spreader bar mentioned by the other reviewer.Its a shame that Neckpro has n't dealt with this comfort issue .
 I bought this product just over a year ago and found it to be somewhat painful on the face . The material is too hard on the face . I put a sock on the front brace , under my chin which allowed me to hang for more time . But , the device started ripping apart on me ; first where the straps are sewed to the brace , then the straps themselves were ripped off from the entire device.Not sure I can get it repaired - but will try to contact the manufacturer ...
 The device is not very comfortable . Instead of pulling on the back of my head or upper neck , all of the resistence seems to be aimed around my jaw and chin . By the time I get enough resistence to feel any relief in my neck it feels like my face is getting squished . My wife tried it and said the same thing .
 The NeckPro item shown on the Amazon page is NOT what is being sold once you go to the regular website . There they are selling the typical bag-counterweight item . The price was too good to be true , so I thought I would check it out .
 The idea behind this product appears to be sound ... . provide traction to your neck and back ... but the equipment is severely flawed . This device puts so much pressure on your chin/jaw that I was afraid that I may have done damage to my jaw . My whole lower jaw and teeth actually hurt due to the compression on them . This item should be banned . It claims to have been designed by a doctor . . if so it was not thoroughly tested . Do NOT purchase it unless you want to do more damage to your body .
 In all fairness I needed surgery -LRB- went fine , thank you ! -RRB- so this product did n't help at all . But just be forewarned , any more than a few minutes in this thing seems to crush your head . I would have liked there to be a spreader bar to keep the pressure off my jaw . God knows when you have one thing wrong with you , you do n't need to damage something else . Use caution with this ... there are other devices to consider .
 The head harness mostly pulls on the mandible causing TMJ pain and extending the neck too much , which exacerbates foraminal compression . To be useful for foraminal stenosis and nerve root pain , it should pull mostly on the occiput and thus allow for neck flexion -LRB- facilitated by facing the door rather than the recommended position -RRB- . The harness is n't designed to do this effectively . It needs to be re-designed to traction mostly on the occiput . Also , he rolled seam at the chin could be avoided at manufacture . The seam is irritating at full traction .
 This was a bad purchase ! I was not able to find out enough information on foot size in relation to the brace size needed . I got the medium , but the heal did not fit properly . this made it unusable . I traded it at a hospital stroke rehab center for one that fit properly .
 We received the product on time , new , looks good quality , but it did not have the same size of other similar products that we got locally . Vendor has very nice people but it was too expensive returned under return product policy ; as a result was donated to the salvation army . Never try again this kind of purchase online .
 but tonight my face broke out in horrid painful blotches everywhere the cream was . I do n't have overly sensitive skin ; this kind of reaction is n't something I 've had using much harsher products . I 'm not sure why my skin stopped tolerating it all of a sudden . Regardless , it 's not worth it . I look like I 've had a chemical peel .
 I 've used the product for only a few weeks but havent noticed any improvement . . I have 2 brown spots on my face that show no change at all . . dont think I 'd purchase this product again . .
 I experienced a horrible allergic reaction to this product . Do not purchase if you have sensitive skin . Two trips to the doctor , two prescriptions of steroids , & missing work , not worth it .
 This product will clog your pores if your have big pores and you can get an allergic reaction to it if you have sensitive skin . This product is most likely better just for other body parts except the face . I bought this for my face and it was a big mistake .
 Product is too thick and greasy for face application . Left my face red and spotty.May be less IU would be better .
 I prefer the 5,000 IU creme over this 25,000 IU . I have dry skin , but this product is much too heavy to use on my face . It is good to use time-to-time at night when I need a heavy moisturizing dose . But for daily use , stick to the lighter-weight product . I also mix the two on my hand when I need a heavier application .
 Too thick and not easy to spread out the creme on my face . I would not buy this product again .
 Was quite satisfied with compact size but blades were extremely dull and had chips in them would not recommend buying them and certainly would never reorder if I lose these
 I have had a number of chargers . I am a photographer by trade and need a steady flow of batteries every day . This charger takes a loooong time to charge 10 batteries . If you need to turnover more than 10 batteries -LRB- AA in the 2500-2900 mAh range -RRB- a day there is no way you are going to do it with this charger and , if you do n't get the batteries in by late afternoon , you ca n't count on having 10 charged for the next morning . I understand that slow charges are better for batteries but I 've used fairly fast charges with no real ill effects -LRB- the batteries take a year 's worth of professional use . -RRB- The instruction sheet gives an approximate charging time of 13 hours but it has been consistently longer than that.The one page instruction sheet contains a `` waning '' -LRB- warning . -RRB- Seems they could have paid a little more attention to detail on this one.Craig
 If I could rate it lower than one star , I would . The product was very inferior and basically the quality was `` cheap '' .
 BY THE TIME I FIGHT WITH THESE TO GET THEM ON MY FEET MY FIGHT WOUL BE OVER AND WOULD NEED A NAP FROM THE STRUGGING . AND IF YOU HAVE NAILS , ITS EVEN HARDER ,
 Disappointing !!! I had hoped to get more than one day of ` therapy ' from these socks but found that after washing , carefully , the socks would n't even stay up ! Let alone provide a bit of support . So not only lacking support but not even staying in place . Just warming my ankles until I could throw them away . Perhaps the company had these on their shelf too long ?
 I ordered this same product . As in the previous review , the same thing happens ... the display only shows `` partial numbers '' ... and I tried 3 new sets of batteries . This product by Mabis is a piece of garbage . Do NOT buy this ; you will be disappointed . I thought maybe it was just one defective unit until I read the previous review and saw that that person had the same problems I had with it . Do not buy this thing .
 I was thouroughly dissapointed with the the product . The description said that the product was new , but it had scratches all over the place . Moreover , it never seems to work correctly , the display is a mess , with lots of characters missing on the LCD display . I ordered 2 units out of which one is started showing errors right from day 1 , and the other one fails more often than not . Pathetic quality and a total money waster . DONT BUY IT
 This company is an exercise in BS . I ordered a watch from them . They claimed it shipped but there was no shipping information . When it did not arrive anywhere near the date they said it would they agreed to ship me another one . When that one shipped there was shipping information available and it arrived on time . However it was the wrong watch AND it did not work . When I returned it I was not able to get a full refund . I gave up after trying several times and can not even get them to call me back . I will never do business with this company again and highly recommend you do not either .
 I 've had no success with the whole biolean system and in fact felt it made me ill , anxious and gave me headaches .
 This was a complete waste of money . This actually made me really depressed and suicidal . Just work out and eat right . I promise that will so much good to your body rather this drug .
 I spent lot of money on this product and it did nothing for me . I followed all directions but it did nothing .
 They 're batteries . What else is there to say ? Buy 'em if you need 'em . If you do n't need 'em , do n't buy 'em . Your kids wo n't have much fun opening their gifts on Christmas morning and finding a pack of four AAA batteries to play with.Besides , do n't you hate AAA batteries ? Everything in the world uses AA batteries , except for those rare items you stumble upon that use AAA . Then you buy a pack , and are left with a whole bunch of extras that you ca n't use in anything else because NOTHING ELSE USES THEM . ** This review is purely of a sarcastic nature . AAA batteries have their purpose and justification in life alongside every other type of battery . *** snicker *
 When I received the item the lid was cracked so it leaked all over and I was actually disappointed in the product . I purchased this because of the reviews I read that stated DMSO was very good for arthritis and I have been using it now for over a month and the product has not subsited the pain . I am using it on other things which it does very well , but everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for another.I just was very disappointed that the bottle lid was cracked and a lot of the solution leaked out !
 The item arrived and my husband and I could not understand what the awful smell was in our house . Needless to say , when I opened the box , the water had leaked out of the bottle . This rose water smells awful and does not do anything but make your face smell bad . I will not be purchasing again . Disappointed !
 I do not know how this product is made or whether or not it has anything to do with roses . It certainly smells NOTHING like roses . Who knows what it is ? I feel badly cheated and will never order it again .
 It was not at all helpful to my skin . I am a person that used to look for answers to skin problems and this was not it . I found my answer but , it is not Rosewater . This sits under my sink and maybe i 'll mix it with my Indian clay or something . May work for some but , not me .
 This is no longer manufactured by Heritage House -- it 's now manufactured by something called `` Seychelles Organics , Inc. '' and it 's no good anymore . There 's no rose scent whatsoever -- it 's just plain water . Do yourself a favor and do n't spend money on this now . It 's just like plain spring water in a spray bottle . Very disappointing .
 I bought this rose water because of the good reviews but I was shocked when I saw the ingredients and actually smelled the product . There is nothing natural about it . It does n't smell like rose water and it does n't feel like rose water.It was big disappointment and waste of money.I use real steam distilled rose water on a daily bases , so I know how it smells . The real rose water I buy has only one ingredient and that is steam distilled flower water . The Heritage Rose Water is not supposed to be called rose water at all . I have very sensitive skin and would not use this questionable product on my face .
 This is n't real rosewater . It is something called `` Vor-mag Water -LRB- water that has been vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration that we believe to be more beneficial -RRB- and Rose Damascena -LRB- Hydroessential Rose -RRB- Flower Oil '' as listed under ingredients . Seeing as oil and water do n't mix without a binder this is also a waste of money and false advertising.This would probably explain why this product has n't worked for me . I have used rosewater based products like Thayer 's Rose Petal Alcohol-free Witch Hazel toner which has rose water as the first ingredient with great success , but this does n't work form my acne-prone sensitive skin at all . The only thing I can say for it is that it does n't irritate my skin , but then again neither does tap water . If you plan on buying rose water and you are n't familiar with the brand or product I would suggest you look at the ingredients beforehand , otherwise do n't bother purchasing it at all .
 This changing table cover was okay . After first wash , it was still okay . Then after consecutive washes , the seams began falling apart . Maybe it was just mine , not so sure . I only have one changing table cover , when soiled , I use the larger/rectangular receiving blankets .
 I bought this changing pad cover because it was really affordable . However , I did not read the description closely enough where it states ` flat changing table cover ' . I have a Summer Infant changing pad that is the standard shape and size and this cover did not fit - it is way too small to cover the pad . Make sure when you purchase this you have a FLAT changing pad .
 Purchased this item for a Serta contour changing pad and it was n't until it was on the changing pad that I realized it did n't fit correctly because it was n't made for a contoured changing pad . I guess I did n't fully read the description so the ill fit was n't that big of a deal . However , the material seems kind of cheap and the terry tends to pick if you catch velcro - from a diaper tab or swaddle blanket - on it . Overall I like the Carter 's and Babies R Us brand changing pad covers much better - the better quality is worth the few extra dollars . I would not purchase this item again , even if it did fit the Serta changing pad .
 i figured this is something you can go cheap on . how hard is it to make a decent changing pad cover ?! this is poor quality terry , too small for the pad , and already has a hole in the seam after 2 washes .
 I chose this cover for the color and material . I was very disappointed when I put it on the change pad and it did not fit . Our change pad is a standard size by Summer Infant . It did not fully cover the sides and I put something in the center , about the weight of a baby -LRB- I am due next month -RRB- the corners lifted off . It is too bad because I really liked it and had to return it .
 I was excited to find a changing pad cover for $ 10 , but I will be returning this item . The material is SO THIN ! It 's a tad small for a standard size , contoured changing pad so it comes up a bit on the sides which looks very ugly . The purple is a dull lavender , I was hoping it would be a little more vibrant in color . The color I could overlook , but it 's so thin and small that there 's no point in having it . With a coupon I can get a yard of nice minky fabric in the color I want for less than $ 10 and make my own nice thick minky dot changing pad cover . Even if you 're not handy with sewing though , it 's worth it to spend a little more and get something worth having . Do n't waste your time or money on this item .
 i am very disappointing with this lotion . I have relatively dry skin , but The fat cream did not give skin the rich and soft touch , it 's hart to absorb . Do not recommend this item .
 Sorry but I did not find this to work any better then murphy 's oil . I only purchased -LRB- bought 2 -RRB- this because of all the positive reviews and was sadly disappointed . Save your money and just go get any wood cleaner that 's cheaper .
 Would not recommend this to my best or even worst friend . . Pads are not what they are advertised to be . They are thin and I felt wet each time I used them . Company does not back up this product because once you open it , look at how thin the pads are they told me that they would not make a refund . Funny that they would lose a customer who will need thicker pads for the next 10 plus years just because they do not want to refund you a $ 30.00 plus purchase . Went to another provider that sells a superior pad at same price and serves my needs .
 These XL-surgical knee high , open toe support stockings do not fit . -LRB- Please note that I am not an XL person , and do not have XL calves . -RRB- The wording on the package states that if the plastic wrap is opened , the item is un-returnable . How could I possible know the `` fit '' of the stockings without opening the plastic wrap ? So , I 'm out almost $ 50.00 since I can not wear the stockings , nor can I return them . That sucks !!!
 The product inside the tube is pretty good . It is not too much different than your regular brand toothpaste as far as texture is concerned . The reason why I bought this is because it is mostly all natural . I do n't want the harsh and harmful chemicals being absorbed into my and my family 's bodies . Although the disappointing this about buying this on Amazon is that the listing does not list the ingredients . You will discover that this product , although claiming to be sugar-free , does contain xylitol , which is a man-made `` natural '' sugar . There are mixed reviews and opinions about xylitol which I wo n't get into here , but I think it would be important to at least notify that this ingredient is contained in the toothpaste.The killer part of this product is the horrible tube it comes in . Over time -LRB- and it was n't long for us -RRB- the tube cracks and breaks open , causing toothpaste to leak out . Ours is almost completely cracked in half and almost useless and we 're only about 1/2 way through the tube . To me it seems like a poor decision to use the old aluminum based tubes . But Tom 's of Maine thinks it is more `` environmentally safe '' so they use them . I 'm not sure if there are health implications with using regular plastic containers , but I 'm not sure that aluminum is too safe either . Plus Tom 's has a plastic lining between the aluminum and the toothpaste anyhow . So what 's the point?I 'm not sure what the best solution is at this point for a toothpaste tube , but I know that I wo n't be buying Tom 's of Maine again unless it is in a different type of tube .

 I have been told by other relatives that this products works . So far my husband and I have noticed little or no effect . Will not purchase again .

 Not sure if it 's intentional but the seller has sent me a device that seems to be used/refurbished and or some type of return repackaged item . I tested it and it 's just not price worthy . It 's really over priced for it 's cheap parts . It 's light , and compared to the one I was replacing is just inferior -LRB- which was half the price -RRB- .

 I bought this product , making the mistake of not quickly checking the enormous shipping cost . When I did catch the mistake , the product was not yet shipped out . I wrote an email explaining this with no reply in time , and the item was shipped out anyways . A response was then sent to me after this item shipped . Beware of the shipping cost associated with this item , and the fact that you may not get a return email in time , until after the product mails out .
 I been taking it for about 2 months and i can not tell nothing ! but it costing me money it just is not for me !
 I was sent a LEAKING BOTTLE with oil coming out of the top . I could smell the oil before I even opened the package . Once opened , I noticed how there was an over-kill of tape around the top as if it was a used bottle that was filled by hand . Once I cut through this tape , I unscrewed the bottle top to discover the paper seal that protects most bottles of this sort was not secured or sealed and was sticking upward . Hence the leaking bottle with all the tape around it .
 I ca n't recommend this brand . The gelcaps are poorly manufactured and they leak into the bottle . You end up with bunch of gooey , foul-tasting capsules -LRB- foul tasting because black seed oil tastes foul by itself -RRB- .

 I almost picked capsules but could n't see the picture and it 's blurry . Clicked on the 90 softgels and it shows that they are vegetarian . I thought that was odd but possible.So sure enough I got the softgels , with gelatin and some other animal products . I can not use this product , wasted my money.FURTHER clicking on the softgels gives this description -LRB- notice it says capsules for when you click softgels -RRB-
 These are a great idea , a mouthguard that you shape yourself to your teeth . However , each time I have tried one , or tried to shape it for my wife , I have found that they tend to misalign your jaw when you bite on them . Then , if you use them while sleeping , you 'll wake up with cramps in your jaw muscles . I would not recommend these as a viable product .
 This mouthguard was too big and bulky for my mouth . There was no way I could sleep with this big thing ! It was soo uncomfortable .

 BURNT my mouth and seller would NOT refund me . I could not take this so I just wasted all my money on something that burnt the inside of my mouth and under my tongue and hurt horribly and is now sitting on my shelf . This should not be called a sublingual . I could call any vitamin a sublingual if this is the standard - just awful . DO N'T buy this product and avoid seller .

 It 's a clever idea but it does n't work as well as your standard lint rollers . It 's sticky but not as sticky as the tape-on-a-handle types . Also you only get a few swipes before its full & then you have to go wash it off & dry it before you can use it again . Regular lint rollers are pretty cheap and work much better than these things .
 The rollers do n't pick up anything more substantial than a piece of fuzz , and then after a swipe or two , they need to be washed under running water . What a pain . They can never be used anywhere other than next to a sink .
 having to wash off the cat hair after every use and wait for it to dry makes it impractical . Guess I 'll go back to the old way .
 I took a chance purchasing this product even after reading the not-so-good reviews . I used it maybe 20 times and threw it away since it was n't picking up the cat hair any more . It 's a waste of money .
 Works okay . Washes off easy . But found it to be a pain to have to wash it off every few strokes . Then ca n't use it right away bc it will need to dry .
 This product pretty much does what it says but to pick up anything bigger than hair , the stuff has to be laid out in a flat layer to pick it up . Hair and dust does get picked up but you have to clean it constantly . I have a bad cat hair problem and even with that , it is too much work , I have used it once . Now it sits in my cupboard .
 This item is NOT very sticky at all and only lasts a few strokes before you have to wash it off . . even if there 's not a lot of lint/etc on the roller . It does what it says , and i guess not bad for the price , but i 'd pay a little more to have more stickiness . I guess I was thinking it would be as sticky as one of those sticky rubber `` hand '' toys that stretch and grab paper and small things ... after they get dirty , you wash them and they are super sticky . not this thing . Oh well .
 Stay with the traditional lint removers with tear sheets . These pick up very little and fill up very quickly . Would n't recommend this item .
 I have pets at home and sometimes wind up at work with fuzzy pants . I loved the idea of a lint remover with a roll that did not need replacing . However , these fill with lint in just a couple of swipes , and need to be cleaned several times just to de-lint one pair of pants . While it 's easy enough to clean , it does require running water to remove the lint from this roller . It 's just not at all convenient for me , I 'm back to the masking tape roll .
 This mirror is a ridiculous price for the quality . It started falling apart 1 day after using it and never did work the way it was supposed to . It would not even stay propped up and then the mirror started coming unglued and falling off the backing .
 I travel quite frequently , and wanted a travel makeup mirror comparable to the one I have at home . The magnification of this one is good ; and , unlike other reviewers , I have n't had trouble with the upper , 1X mirror staying on . The light works great if the batteries are brand new - however , that level of brightness lasts maybe two mornings . I am very careful to shut the mirror off when not in use ; yet , I can not get top quality batteries to light the thing for more than one business trip before I find myself gravitating toward a light in my room to actually see . It does have a port for an adapter . But , first , it does n't come with an adapter ; plus , I 'm already packing charging cords for my phone and computer ... it would just be one more thing to forget . Oh , and if I extend the neck , it tends to slide right back down . Apparently , it 's a little too heavy for the design .
 This was bought for my wife as a gift , site unseen , which turned out to be a mistake.Mirror was too small for everyday use , but good size for travel . The 10x power was really too strong.Wife found it difficult to even see herself in the mirror so I tried as well and sure enough it was just too hard to see.Never even tried to plug it in to wall unit . Wife just did not like it , so I packed it back up and returned it.Kudo 's to Amazon for an easy and quick way to return products , even from third parties.Just not the mirror for her .
 I bought the mirror in June and was thrilled with the 10X magnification with light . I used it everyday until August 24 when the cord developed a short . Now all that I have is an unlit 10X magnification mirror . I am so disappointed in the quality . For the price and only 2 months of use this item is a rip off .
 I really like the size of this mirror , and its adjustable height & horizontal swivel . In that sense , it is really good for traveling . But it simply fails because only one of the two mirrors is actually lit . What a poor design choice . Note to Zadro
 mirror on top is only attached with double faced tape and fell off and broke . Made very cheaoly . When mirror falls off could break and shatter . Very dangerous
 I really liked this mirror when I first got it . I was excited that it seemed portable . It ended up being a pain . The weight of the mirror would collapse itself when I was using it . The weird design ended up being bad because you can not maneuver the mirror very well . The cord was really short so I could n't use the mirror in very many places . There 's a built in alarm that would go off every day and I never set an alarm on the mirror . The bulb eventually burnt out and almost electrocuted me .
 My wife really likes this make-up mirror and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars if they had n't changed what is included . This is the third one she 's had since she first found them . The other two came with the AC Adapter . So when I ordered this one I ASSUMED it would be the same . Stupid me ! They now makle you buy one separately ! And if you try to purchase from Zadro -LRB- the manufacturer -RRB- they will soak you more for the shipping than for the adapter ! -LRB- The adapter plus shipping is almost one-half of the price of the mirror ! -RRB- WHAT A RIP OFF !
 This mirror does a fine job as a mirror . However it has a serious flaw . There is a tiny alarm clock that you may not even notice . A couple of years after purchasing this , the alarm battery started going haywire . I could not figure out where the beep of an alarm was coming from in the middle of the night , and finally traced it to this mirror . The bad news is that the battery on the dumb alarm has now been going off intermittently for some time , but it is impossible to replace the alarm batteries . We have tried -- believe me.So it goes off at odd times all during the day and night . I thought it would run out of juice , but it is not doing so . I now have to either continue to listen to the stupid beeping , or discard this mirror and purchase a new , different one -- one without an alarm on it.Throwing it in the trash !
 I purchased this for my wife a few years ago . It lasted about 1 year before the glass fell out and broke . It still had the 10X mirror so she used it for another year or so until it died.So , I searched for a replacement , but this model won again , and I purchased another . It died after just a few weeks . I replaced it again , and that one died after a few months of use -LRB- after the warranty expired -RRB- . I wish they would fix their quality control issues . I am willing to pay more for something that works for longer than the warranty period . A great idea poorly executed.Let me know if/when you get the quality up to a reasonable standard .
 I find this mirror much too small and unless you are putting it on a shelf too low . The lighted mirror is the lower one and it only raises an inch or two up making it necessary to bend down to look into . If you have a shelf for it , that would work . I kept it anyway to use when traveling as it is portable and will run off of batteries . I just hold it so I can see !
 I read all the customer reviews for `` lighted mirrors '' on Amazon , and this one was given 5 stars by 2 people - so I bought it . The mirror 's 8x magnification is really great - you 'll see everything up close and in detail that other mirrors wo n't show you . The lighting is bright and pleasing . However , the quality of adjusting the height is pretty lame . It slides up and down easily even when it 's tightened to full capacity . Also , the clock/alarm in mine is messed up . The alarm goes off even at the slightest touch of the mirror , and the buttons are very stiff and it 's impossible to program the day or the time -LRB- and yes the alarm is still going off all the while -RRB- . I do n't want to buy another cell battery to see if that is what the problem is . I 've spent several hours already trying to make it work . I am sending it back for a refund .
 I just want to say that if you want a lighted makeup mirror , do n't waste your money on this one because it has `` bells and whistles '' . It apparently has an LED clock and alsrm clock , but I could never get it to work . The light does not work , but the alarm goes off every morning at 4am and I am not able to reset it . The magnification is very good -LRB- too good -RRB- but you could spend a fraction of the money for a drugstore cheap version .
 I bought this mirror based on the reviews here . The first issue I had with it is the height of it . It is so low that even if you bring your face low enough to actually see it in the mirror , you inadvertently get makeup on the mirrow -LRB- powders/shadows -RRB- since it is below your face versus straight forward , so shadows and powders fall on it and are then magnified . Second problem was the light was so dim that I thought it was a problem with the batteries -LRB- brand new batteries -RRB- so I tried external power , same problem . Another reviewer said she uses a tissue box to raise it . I had to do that but then I thought , why should I ? For $ 50 , why do I have to improvise ? Just not worth it . Also , in order for the upper mirror to be lit , you have to rotate it to fit on top of the base mirror for the light to shine through the outer circle which makes the lighting fainter than the base lighting . As a side note , I also had a problem with the built in clock/alarm , it just would go haywire with the digits flashing and not maintaining the correct time . A defect for sure , but I was willing to overlook that if the mirror was a good mirror but it is not -LRB- at least for me -RRB- . I sincerely think my cheapo $ 15 old Conair makeup mirror is better than this one .
 I loved this mirror the first time my husband bought it as a gift for me , so much that I bought another one when the first one went out within the first year . Well guess what , the second one did too and the company WILL NOT warranty it for more than 90 days . This is a great mirror while it lasts , but I promise you that I will not purchase a 3rd one .
 I purchased this mirror over others because of its functionality . However , a year later the bulb died in the mirror . The outside of the packaging indicates `` Lifetime Bulb '' . However , when I contacted Zadro regarding the bad bulb , they told me that the bulb is not replaceable , and they will not warranty it after 60 days . All I can say is
 I thought I had a winner with this makeup mirror , but was quickly proven wrong . To begin with , it would n't work at all with batteries . I tried plugging it in , and then I did get a good light . I was disappointed at that point because I wanted to take it on a cruise and use the battery . But because of poor performance with the battery , I had to take the heavy plug on the cruise . The second time I went to use it - nothing ! Nothing we did could get it to work . And it was too late to return it . I was so mad , I did n't even want to carry it home . Guess I can use it without any light at all , but that sure defeated the purpose of buying this lighted mirror . Buyer beware .
 I received this product as a birthday gift . The lighting was very poor.Further , when obtaining information about a return to this vendor , I received an email that said , if the mirror was in pristine condition and in original packing they would consider refunding the money less a re-stocking fee . Nowhere in the product information is a re-stocking fee mentioned . They did do a refund but charged a re-stocking fee of $ 10.00 . Additionally , I had to pay $ 12 in postage to return it .
 I received the Zadro mirror about a week ago . While I liked the quality of the light , I was disappointed in several ways . First , the height only adjusts a little bit -- maybe 2-3 . '' So even the top mirror was n't really high enough for me to use it easily for makeup application . Second , the hinged style of the mirror was annoying , because it would n't really stay in place . Third , only the bottom of the two mirrors -LRB- the magnified one -RRB- was lit . The top one was n't lit at all , and that was the one I really wanted to use . Overall , I was very disappointed . I am returning the item today .
 looking forward to the mirror arriving . It worked great for one day and then ... nothing . The light would not work , what a disappointment . The only good thing I can say is that the mirror itself was of good quality .
 this item would be perfect if not for poor quality . The lighging is very dim and the mirror does not stay in place when the height is adjusted .
 The order was placed with ease . shipping was fast . I was pleased with the ordering process and the item was delivered fast and on time . I would purchase from this store again.The tongkat ali was not what I expected . I stopped taking it after 2 days because I felt that itcaused me to retain water . But this is only my opinion , I am not a doctor . Try it for yourself .
 I ordered ten pairs of diabetic socks for my blind father and they were marked the right size , but were all wrong in the box . He is not able to return the two pairs that he opened because they are considered `` used '' and I was told that we had to pay a restocking fee as well as return shipping . He is out about $ 30.00 already , without the restocking fee ! No way to treat a blind vet on a fixed income !
 Adding CalMax to my retinue of pills did n't do anything to improve any aspect of my life .
 I have found one item that actually works for posture aid . It is called `` Shoulders Back '' and it works , but is a little constricting at times . I ordered nearly all of the supports on Amazon , and threw them all out .
 It is a cloth that picks up dirt , but is it special ? NO ! Gets dirty quickly and misses a lot of dirt and pet hair . Not the magic picker - upper other users describe . Not worth the money . Went back to my regular broom , which I do n't need to wash .
 Our Barber Shop had three old metal lather machines but decided to upgrade ... what a mistake . We bought three new Lather Kings . We 've tried everything to keep these things running in our Barber Shop . Distilled water , tap water , cleaner , no cleaner ... nothing seems to be any better than the other . We have finally found one thing that has been working the last few weeks , we use a full capfull of recommended soap , and very hot water . We need to refill 2x a day , but so far so good . Also , All three of these new machines have cracked plastic -LRB- top and sides -RRB- after the first year of use . We are not impressed with this machine .
 I bought this machine from Bowman Beauty Supply and it broke only after using it a few years . I had problems with the shaving cream flowing out smoothly ... it always seemed like it was clogged even when I used the cleaner . I followed all the recommendations of cleaning and maintaining it . I tried to get Bowman to resolve the problem but they would n't . Next I called the Morris and Flamingo company , they are the suppliers for Bowman Beauty Supply . The staff were rude , offered no help and informed me that if I wanted to have it repaired it would cost me around $ 100.00 . Do n't spend your hard earned dollars on this piece of junk ! It 's easily breakable because of the way it 's constructed . The suppliers that sell it wo n't even back it up because they 've had so many complaints on it ! Read the reviews on the internet ! Lots of complaints ! Poor customer service from both Bowman Beauty Supply and Morris and Flamingo ... both blame each other and have no concern for the consumer !
 I bought this lathermachine about six months ago and after many frustrating attempts , I finally got it to work somewhat by using double the amount of liquid soap and adding some English shaving soap to the mix besides some glycerine . it worked for a while then got clogged up even after using he clenaing solution . I asked my barber what he used nd he told me he just poured alot of the liquid soap into the machine , added water and got it work , Akso , the lather is n't really that hot so believe it or not the Norelco machines they sell at Christmas time are better than this .
 Do n't waste your time with this belt , it wo n't stay in place . Slides around way to much , straps are not comfortable .
 Everybody is right about the size chart . I bought this for my mother who is in great pain from her hernia , but now we need to have a replacement sent to us.It 's good that the company is replacing the item . However , they want you -LRB- the customer -RRB- to pay the return shipping + they charge $ 7.00 for the restocking fee . So now this &#34; $ 30.00 &#34; item has become a $ 47.00 item that is taking 3-4 times longer to receive , which is resulting in the user waiting in pain until the company &#34; fixes &#34; the issue with a product that they market at sizes fit for Shrek and Fiona .
 Poor construction . Had to sew it twice in 2 different areas . Now it 's tearing in a third area . Considered returning it but he refund conditions were sketchy at best . Partial refund , restocking fee ect . . Just decided to keep and repair it . Currently looking for a better product that holds up to daily wear . I would not recommend this belt to anyone . All I do is spend most of my time repairing it with thread and needle . Very dissatisfied . Would have given it one star but since I am still wearing it all patched up , gave it two stars .
 I understand no return of a hygiene item , BUT , they misrepresented the size . It is HIP size , not waist size . My 90 yo dad has a 33 '' waist size and a 35 '' hip size so it does not fit and ca n't work . Plus this company did not have the courtesy to reply to 2 pleasant e-mails and then declined the A-Z guarantee because the ad states no return ; no problem if the ad stated the correct size to order . A refund or the right size would be nice since I bought it using their stated sizing.So , Why are they allowed to sell a misrepresented item on Amazon ? Also how does a hernia belt stay in place if there is nothing to hold on to to prevent slipping ; sitting and standing would cause it to slip down the hips and apply no pressure.I will update my review if they approve my appeal but this purchase was in error due to false advertising and I made no mistake , except trusting them to state an accurate ordering size , and the A-Z guarantee to protect me from false and misleading advertising on an Amazon page .
 Shameful of the company to market the `` medium '' size of this product as a medium , then try to refuse to accept return of the produce because it is a health product.I have had the same experience as two other reviewers quoted above . My waist is 36 inches , which according to their statement should be `` medium . '' What I received , though labeled medium was grossly too large , probably extra-large , and does not at all compress the hernia . Then I ordered two of the `` small '' size and found them entirely too tight to wear.Richard , Charlotte , NC
 size chart on box says hip size 35 '' -40 '' is med ordered med came today tried it on way to big could not tighten ran out of velcro said they could exchange for a small for 6.95 plus I pay return shipping on the med sized one I say its not my fault thay make A med thats A xtra large got ripped off !!!!
 This is a premium-priced product due in part its vegetable-base capsules -LRB- instead of gelatin created from discarded meat by-products -RRB- . I have used about 3/4 's of the 250-capsule supply and have no issues except that I 've found that a significant percentage of the capsules - maybe 15 % - are only partially filled . I 'm not saying that they 're empty but I 'd estimate the fill on that 15 % as about 75 % . This raises an overall quality control question for me and I 'll be looking for a brand other than Solgar next time .
 The sizing chart for this product is completely off !!! We ordered the large as this would have been the correct size according to the size chart . However , the large is really about a small/med !!!! So needless to say we could not use this product at all . And since we opened the package we were unable to return or exchange it . We are comnpletely disatisfied with this product .
 What I have to say is pretty simple
 I ordered a 32-24 which the item was marked but it measured 28-30 . The replacment turned out to be the same .
 I have been carrying very low this pregnancy and the doctor suggested I get a support belt to help with the pelvic pain I have been experiencing.I looked online , and the reviews and price for this belt both seemed great.I was in so much pain that when the package came I could n't wait to get the belt on and feel a little bit of relief . I put it on and it was a JOKE ! I felt like I had just strapped some sort of chineese torture band around my body . The only way I got relief from the pressure on my pelvic was if I wore it really low , but then I could n't bend over , squat , pee or sit ! So , I guess if you do n't plan on taking long strides when you walk , bending over , peeing , squating or sitting-this belt is for you ! . . grrr I am so frustrated ! Look elsewhere-this ` support ' belt is completely unrealistic and uncomfortable !
 When I ordered the maternity support belt to relieve my back pain , DocOrtho sent me a different size than what I had ordered . Then , when I found the energy to get around to returning the belt , they refused to give me a refund . Worse , the customer service staff were unapologetic and snide . This was the last things I needed in my 38th week of pregnancy . When I worked in customer service I was taught that `` The customer is always right '' . DocOrtho apparently teaches their employees that `` It is always the customer 's fault '' . I will definitely never buy anything from DocOrtho again . Luckily there are lots of other , hopefully friendlier , options for places to buy these support belts .
 I do n't know what I 'm doing wrong but this belt is impossible to put on or wear . It came without instructions and you have to use your `` wild '' imagination to put 3 separate pieces together based on the picture on the box so it does n't fall off with the rest of your clothing . The material is tough and very hard on the body . Could n't return it as the seller does not refund money , only for other product replacement from the store . I really do n't need anything else , so will have to suffer the consequences .
 They sent wrong item . I called and sent it back the way I was instructed to do and I have NOT received proper item . could you please follow up on this for me?Thanks Roger
 I tried Bona floor cleaner and it left my hardwoods just plain dull . I had been using Perfect Kitchen from Bed Bath and Beyond -LRB- the dark blue bottle ... they have several other cleaners -RRB- and wanted more shine , so tried Bona . Sorry but I 'm back to the original Perfect Kitchen ... it leaves a slight shine , no buildup , and not dull , flat . I 'd recommend you try it.Works great on our oak kitchen table , too.Would welcome other suggestions , but suspect we 'll need to have floors redone and just will go with semigloss or gloss , but for now I 'm back to perfect kitchen .
 After several years using this product , and it 's cleaner/pads on the advice of the people who refinished our floors , recently when I had to clean up a spot using a paper towel for expediency , the result showed a lot of `` dirt . '' I checked the rest of the floors , and found the same situation , which confirmed our recent suspicions . It does not clean well , in spite of also vacuuming prior to cleaning the floors as we were advised by the product 's retailer.What we have since found out is that the people who refinished our floors also own the retail company that sells Bona here , under a different name ! Now , it is available everywhere but that is n't helping us . We have had all-wood floors for years , and now can not find the products we used all that time and raised 6 children on ! With only 1 person in the home now , there is no excuse for a product to not clean well !
 I just unpacked and tried this product . It cleaned the floor well but all the satin sheen of the verathane finish is gone !!! The floor now looks like a flat finish . I guess that 's why they offer the re-finishing product . You have to buy that to get your floors back to their original finish .
 I purchased this product because of the positive reviews . It left my floor looking dull and streaks are all over . I do not recommend this product .
 I purchased this product after reading the great reviews - those people must not like shinny floors as the product left a film that dulled my newly refinished hardwood floors . I had to re-clean all the floors and put several coats of a differnt product on my floors to re-gain the previous satin finish .
 What a smeared , dull , ugly mess ! At the advice of many , I purchased Bona Floor Cleaner . Just finished using it according to directions & my floors are worse than before I used it
 This product can easily be replaced by other mild cleaning products for your hardwood floors . It seems like watered down windex and mild dish soap in a spray bottle could replace it.On the other hand , the REPLENISHER offered by Bona is a fanatasic product to refresh the luster and shine to your hardwood floors .
 I love shopping on amazon , but I wish they would do a better job letting the best value float to the top in the search results , make sure to look at all the sizes and prices before purchase.BonaKemi WM700053004 64-Ounce Hardwood Floor Cleaner Refill
 I was going to order this until I found that it is damaging to aquatic life and SHOULD NOT enter the drain ... So HOW exactly do you wash and rinse out the mop without it getting into our water system ?? We are killing ourselves with what we are doing to the world and the chemicals we are dumping on it ... I also would not want my bare feet contacting the residue from this product either ... I am trying to find a natural option if there is one to be had . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 I have hardwood on all my floors including the kitchen . I have always used a very dilute white vinegar/water solution wrung out very well -- just barely damp . My floors were always beautiful . A house cleaning company convinced me to use Bona for hardwood floors -- what a mistake ! In the kitchen area the dirt and grease was being spread around but not actually cleaned up , and the floor looked like it was a century old . The rest of the floors also began to look dull with a film on them . I tried the refinishing polish Bona sells to fix it . What a disaster that was -- this product is like a floor wax , which does not go well over a poly floor . After 24hours it was still tacky and also turned white , with streaks everywhere . It took me 10 hours on my hands and knees with Krud Kutter and amonia , a plastic scraper , a box of 200 paper rags and a laundry load of towels to get that crap off my floors . At least then I was back to the dull finish , but that shows every foot print and water spot . I went back to my white vinegar/water and with three moppings today , followed by a microfiber mop buffing the floor while it was still wet and it now appears less dull and is looking pretty good . I am hoping that over time this dull finish will come off completely . While I was mopping with the vinegar and water I noticed immediately a `` slime '' of Bona and the water was gray . My advice -- stay away from this stuff if you do n't know what kind of finish is on your floor and if it is compatible -- I have an engineered wood floor -LRB- ash -RRB- with a poly finish . Try a small area first and be patient -- the film does n't show up after the first or second use and is very difficult to get that stuff off the floor .
 I tried the bona floor cleaner and saw nothing special in results - looked the same as when I mopped with soap and water - I guess there is no silver bullet .
 I 'm not impressed . For the price , I expected my floors to shine like the Gilded Mansions , but when I compared the section of my floor that I 'd cleaned with Bona side-to-side with the section on which I 'd applied Murphy 's Oil Soap , the Murphy 's won handily . Bona left my floor with a dull matte finish , and I had to re-clean with the Murphy 's to restore its shine . I 'd rather spend $ 3 at my local store for something that works much better than this junk .
 The company who provides this product has terrible customer service . My order was damaged in shipment and until I called them they were n't in the process of sending a replacement . I 've been talking to them for almost a week and they still have n't sent the replacement items but of course I was billed at the first shipment . I wo n't order this product from them again .
 When time came to refill my mop cartridge , I picked up what I thought was a cleaner refill . Packaging was striking similar to the cleaner , but what I picked up was actually hardwood floors polish . The Polish is PURE JUNK and RUINED the look of my new hardwood floors . It cost my $ 400 to fix . I gave this product a 1 star rating in hopes of saving someone else the heart-ache I went through with the polish . -LRB- see my review below -RRB- . The cleaner works fines , but BEWARE when you are looking for refills . Make sure it says cleaner on the bottle , and not polish.http : / / www.amazon.com/review/R1NRRS8GCNE9M3/ref=cm_cr_dp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B001CLBK32&nodeID;=284507&tag;=&linkCode;=
 I ordered this a month ago . It arrived damaged so I refused delivery and asked the company to send another . It still has n't arrived .
 How can BONA claim to be environmentally friendly when you can not refill the plastic cartridge for themop ?? This is unacceptable .
 I searched around for a way to care for my brand new bamboo flooring without finding any alternative . This stuff really works and leave my floors looking great !
 after using the Bona Floor Polish , my wood floors looked terrible . After calling the company I was told I must have applied it incorrectly and now needed to buy the Bona Polish Remover . The polish remover was also a huge let down . I do n't recommend these products at all .
 put a dull finish on the floor and I want a shinier look on my hardwood , so for that reason I was not totally pleased
 I am not impresssed with the hype on this product - mostly because of the the ` delivery system ' . As with all ` mop ' systems that this is designed for , too much product is left on the hardwood and it just builds up layer on layer , without ever being rinsed off . The cleaner and whatever stuff was on the hardwood that needed cleand off just gets smeared around on the surface.I have used this very sparingly only 2 times so far , and already there is enough residue on the wood that it feels sticky to dry bare feet , and soft-rubber-soled shoes stick enough to as to almost sound like dozens of tiny suction cups coming un-stuck with each step.So much residue being left on the surface also causes bare footprints to show up sooner , and since the detergent becomes sticky , it holds more and more dust on the surface that your soft dust mop ca n't pick up , so your floor looks dirty sooner , you use the mop more often ... and on goes the cycle.I have new , aluminum dioxide treated , low-gloss solid hickory ; I should imagine this problem would be even more obvious with hi-gloss & darker woods . It would perhaps work on older hardwood where a slightly worn surface could absorb some of the cleaner.I am returning the product this week and will go back to a small string mop barely dampened with plain , clear tap water .
 We had a gorgeous new dark maple hardwood floor installed in our bedroom about 2 years ago and have been using Bona exclusively . Just spent all Sunday afternoon using hot water and ammonia trying to get the dull buildup off our once beautiful floor . The floor retailer is trying to tell me I was using only `` Bona '' not '' Bona Professonal '' that 's why the floor is dull . Searching the web now for a better hardwood floor cleaner that wo n't leave a dull finish .
 I used this product to `` clean '' our bamboo floors . The floor looked great until it got walked on , and now it has an oily , milky look to it . It may work better on an oak or rougher-finished floor , but I would definitely NOT recommend it for bamboo .

 I do n't know what I 'm doing wrong but this belt is impossible to put on or wear . It came without instructions and you have to use your `` wild '' imagination to put 3 separate pieces together based on the picture on the box so it does n't fall off with the rest of your clothing . The material is tough and very hard on the body . Could n't return it as the seller does not refund money , only for other product replacement from the store . I really do n't need anything else , so will have to suffer the consequences .
 The Zewa MFM-007 is easy to use and inflates well and gives you a nice display of blood pressure that is easily read . Unfortunately it is not very accurate the readings are about ten units low making it pretty much useless . I work at a hospital doing critical care research so was fortunate to be able to compare it to an accurate monometer reading . In my opinion someone with hypertension may have a false sense of security that may have dangerous consequences using this machine .
 I ordered this item by mistake because the description was so poor . It is not a good value at all . Here is what you get : - ReNu MULTIPLUS SOLUTION - 12 0Z BOTTLE-1 ReNu MULTI-PURPOSE SOLUTION -2 OZ BOTTLE-1 BAUSH & LOMB REWETTING DROPS - 3 mL BOTTLE-2 ReNu LENS CASES-TRAVEL POUCHYou are only getting 14 oz . total of the Renu solution . I am going to return it and order the 2 16 oz . bottles for $ 28.88 . A much better deal .
 I did not find this product to be helpful at all . I found drinking Tonic water with Quinine in it more helpful .
 i received this 24 hrs ago and half of the time i get error codes . i called customer service -LRB- very friendly & helpful -RRB- and they informed me that they have had this problem before and recommended that i try it on my forearm due to the size of my arm . this worked a few time but if i checked after i was active it gave me a code 7 & 9m most of the time i got a code 3 . in the book it gives code 3-5 as something wrong with the cuff and code 7-12 as something about being calm . that right only 2 errors with 9 codes . also did n't like this `` D '' ring to make it easier to put on , it makes the cuff fold over no it self . this my work for some people but not me ! PS I HAVE AN 18 1/2 '' ARM
 The company sent the wrong item and then proceeded to tell me they didnt ' have it anyway . So item was wrong - listing was wrong and the procedure to return was left to me to figure it out - would never do business with them again .
 I have ordered this 2 times - needing the larger cuff . The cuff that came with the unit both times did not fit into the monitor itself . Too bad because it appears to be an excellent unit !
 I purchased this product for my son who still has a problem with wetting at night . These have leaked more often than not , and I still wind up doing more laundry . Not worth it .
 It 's like wearing a big boot into bed . I could n't even make it thru the whole night .
 Unless you have legs like a chicken forget this product . I woke up two nights in a row in terrible pain in my calfs -LRB- I work out a little and my calfs are 18 '' -RRB- Just terrible . A cheaply made piece of garbage and their customer service is simply terrible . Pass on this one . Not even one star .
 Did not work for me . Base is too flexible to keep the foot in a good position and the velcro strap across the top cut into the top of my foot .
 I really liked this product ... for about 2 weeks . But then I started noticing that when I woke up in the morning my foot would be extended out as if I hadnt even worn it to bed . my foot started hurting again . I tried fastening the velcro tighter before bed but I would just wake up in pain as the circulation was being cut off in my foot . The hinge is still in place so the best I can guess is that the strength of the plastic on the side broke down so it bends with the pressure of my foot and blankets . I do n't recommend .
 After suffering from mild to moderate pain in my heel and foot for six months caused by plantar fasciitis , I found this device and was encouraged by the positive reviews . Having already tried doctor administered steroid shots , stretching exercises , strengthening exercises , and orthotic inserts , I was excited and hopeful this would be the answer to my problem!Well the device seems to be made of good quality materials and is comfortable to wear . However , there are some design problems and in the end the thing just does n't do it 's job.One problem is the setting to set the angle of your foot . This is controlled by a screw in the ankle area . I found that while this does change the angle of the foot bed while it 's sitting there , once put on the foot , the foot bed is kind of flimsy and does n't hold your foot at the right angle . In fact , you can easily flex your foot back and forth and the Cub does n't do much to stop it . This is important to me because the way I sleep tends to extend my foot.In the end , this product just does n't do it 's job . After wearing it for a few weeks it made no difference in my condition . I 'd give it one star but instead I 'll giving it the two stars for comfort and good quality materials .
 I bought the cub for a bout of Plantar Fasciitis , and it worked really well ... for about 3 nights . The boot began to have too much give in it . It does not hold my foot in the propoer position any longer . It needs to have straps on the side , or a much stiffer piece of plastic on the bottom . The comfort of the boot is definately a plus though .
 I was given this exact splint by my Podiatrist to heal my Plantar Fasciitis but have since -LRB- 3 months of use -RRB- found it does not keep the foot flexed as it should . I agree it needs a side strap as the plasticis too easy to flex therefore you end up sleeping in the same position you would normally sleep in without it due to the weight of the covers and such . I would recommend one with side straps for the proper control needed to treat this problem .
 I just tried EnurAid and found it did absolutely nothing to solve the problem . I wonder if it 's just a placebo because it has absolutely no effect whatsoever . Please take this useless product off the market and above all , stop taking people 's money for it .
 This might have been a very nice , useful product . However , the tweezers are 3rd-rate
 I bought this tweezer primarily because it was so cheap -LRB- less than $ 5 -RRB- . While the packaging is great , and the concept ingenious , the end product is mediocre at best . With the light , the tweezers are quite heavy and did not meet to a perfect point giving me only a 1 out of 5 hair success rate . Also , the light is a very narrow , very bright , white light which only marginally made it easier to locate hairs . I thought it might be a fun gift but after trying it out for myself , decided against gifting it .
 You have to hold down the button to keep the light on . Not easy when you need 2 hands to tweeze ... great trying to remove a splinter - or a stray brow hair ... NOT
 I paid way too much for this lighted tweezer that does n't work like it is supposed to , mainly because the small watch-size batteries that came with it did not work . And if I try to use it without the light , the opening is so narrow that I ca n't grab the eyebrow hair to pull it out .
 This is the biggest rip off ever ! All it is , is a flimsy piece of cloth sewn into a rectangular sack with a velcro closure . It 's like a project made by a middle school home economics student . I 'm going to use it , because it does serve a purpose , but had I known what it would look like , I would have made this myself . This is worth about $ 3 tops .
 Before you purchase this product look around at other Wahl 5560 proudcts . Most concur that this product line is junk . I purchased this product because of the Wahl name . I own their plug-in electric hair groomer and it is powerful and well made . Unfortunately , this nose trimmer is not of the same quality . It is cheaply made foreign junk with the Wahl name stamped on it . The cutter actually did a decent job , for a week or two . Then started having trouble with the little motor , would n't turn or cut . I took it apart and the motor looks like a cheap motor from a toy in a happy meal . Waste of money . os
 The product was a bit thick for my razor , but it did smell very good . The pump did n't dispense well , either , which I think was because of the consistency of the lotion . Not wowed like the other reviewers , so I have n't really used it .
 I have very sensitive skin and was told this product would 100 % prevent razor burn . TRUTH ? ... It does n't ! I 've enjoyed using it , yet I do n't feel it 's much better than using shaving cream , in fact , it feels like conditioner . Actually , the bottle says you could use the product as conditioner . However , actually using lotion or conditioner in the shower to shave , I could have purchased that cheaper than Coochy Cream . Will not be buying this product for this purpose again . There are cheaper alternatives that work just as well !
 I have fairly sensitive skin and I still get a rash using this . I 've given it a chance and used it several times , but it just does n't seem to help at all . Does n't have much of a scent either .
 i do not enjoy the product . its easy to use but i can take a temperature in the same ear 10 times and get 10different readings . and i apparently have a fever daily , but not with a regular thermometer . user friendly , but for what ?
 THIS WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE SAME ANSWER TWICE . IT SAYS BETWEEN 99.7 AND 90.5 IN THE SAME EAR IN THE SAME 5 MIN .
 I ordered this thermometer about a week ago , when I returned from my doctor 's office with a sinus infection and a fever . I thought it would be accurate , especially based on the reviews . When I received it , I took about 10 readings . The temperature went from 103 degrees to 95 degrees . No two were the same . Last night I tried it on my husband with the same effect . This was a disappointing waste of money , to say the least . If there was a rating less then one star , I 'd give it that instead .
 I 've never written an Amazon testimonial before but I have to warn people that the smell and taste of these things is terrible . I take plenty o ' vitamins , and this sh*t is nasty . There 's no aftertaste , though . Besides that i guess it 's fine .
 This after I 've taken this formula exclusively for many years . One thing I will say is that the last bottle & this most recent one , not only had the label changed . . but the taste of them also changed . They have always been somewhat strong tasting , but not terribly unpleasant . They taste sickening now . I went off them a few days & my stomach was fine the very first day . I just took one & almost immediately my tummy hurts & feels very heavy . Almost a full bottle left . As yucky as I feel right now , I will never take another one . In case anyone is wondering , I took it about 30 minutes , or more , after a good meal . With plenty of filtered water .
 Thought they were okay , did n't do more than any others but did n't see negatives ... til , well , sorry for the TMI but looked in the toilet and realized they were coming out whole -LRB- and at one point really backed me up to the point of pain -RRB- . Not too helpful if they do n't dissolve , so not going with this brand again .
 Didnt work . Maybe I had high expecations , but it did nothing . Maybe I did it wrong , but I cant imagine how I misinterpeted &#34; spray twice a day &#34; . Lame .
 I know a few people who had success with this and quit smoking , permanently . After the first week , it has learned when you smoke . For the next three weeks , it tells you when you can smoke . At my job , I ca n't always choose when I can take a smoke break ... or I may be in the middle of cooking dinner at home . Did n't work for me .
 At first I thought this item might actually work . I have to say that like other reviewers have noted you must want to quit or really nothing is going to work . Things were going fine down from 2 packs a day to about 5 cigarettes a day then the Quitkey stopped working . It did n't even last 2 weeks before it broke . Waste of money for sure .
 For 60 dollars and it can only be used twice ? I had the original I still smoke . Nuff said .
 ... . convincing me that I was meant to die with a cigarette in my hand.All these good reviews must be for the original LifeSign from a couple decades ago because this QuitKey certainly does n't live up to the hype.I could n't wait to get my QuitKey . I was so full of hope that maybe this would be the thing that would finally work for me . I started the QuitKey program the very first morning after I received it . I followed the QuitKey program exactly , only had 2 cheat smokes in 3 weeks , and when I got down to Day 7 , it would buzz at me when I pushed the smoke button -LRB- just like it does when you have a smoke before you 're supposed to -RRB- . Problem was ... . the time had gone down to 0:00 and the smoke sign was on , so I should have been able to smoke and hit the smoke button and continue . I did n't smoke when I was n't supposed to but because the QuitKey malfunctioned , I got penalized anyway and ended up having to repeat Day 7 . It did the same thing when I finally got to Day 6 . Thinking it was just a minor glitch , I hit the reset button and started the program over -- a few days on Stage 1 and then on to Stage 2 . Again , I followed the program exactly . Everything was going well . Got down to Day 10 and it did it again . QuitKey said it was OK to smoke but when I hit the smoke button it buzzed instead of beeped and I got penalized for cheating when I did n't cheat and had to repeat the day . It did this every day and not one time was I cheating when it said I was . It was so aggravating and demoralizing to have to repeat days because of this stupid little machine screwing up that I ended up shutting it off.Go through the program . Do what you 're supposed to do . And when the damn thing malfunctions it 's already too late to return it for a refund . Nice scam LifeSign.I suppose if this thing worked properly it could help break habits and reprogram your brain to not &#34; need &#34; that cigarette and help people quit . But I considered this my last chance . In the last 30 years I 've tried everything else numerous times . Probably tried to quit smoking 200 times in my life . I should have just spent that 60 bucks on cigarettes .
 QuitKey is a scam
 It is a fact that `` most smokers '' that quit have done so only after multiple attempts . So this device should work as many times as necessary . But no - the marketing strategy is ingenious but very insidious . You get ONE ATTEMPT ONLY to quit . Then the device self destructs . No one can ever `` try again '' if they fail . No one can sell this device after they quit . That is why there are no Used Units for Sale on Amazon.The Seller is taking advantage of people in danger of dying and giving them just ONE CHANCE for life so that he can make more money.What is wrong with this Picture ? It makes me want to create a competing device that can be re-used as many times as necessary , so that more people will quit ... more lives will be saved ... and people can resell their device Used when they are done with it.The `` one use then self-destruct '' strategy to make more money is sickening and the Ad does NOT REVEAL THAT INFO !!!!!
 After only 2 days of use my QuitKey started having problems . When it came time for the QuitKey to beep and tell me when to smoke . . It never beeped ! I think for $ 60.00 it was cheaply made , and that 's to bad as I think it would of been a good tool to help smokers quit . I would not recommend this product .
 We bought two of these . One did n't light up correctly and the other worked , but it was so confusing on what was suppose to be going on and when , it was impossible to use .
 Al Behar - President PICS , Inc. , You should be sued for selling a product that self-destructs after two uses -LRB- AND HIDING THIS FACT -RRB- . How can defend your product by saying it would make you more committed to stop smoking . Most people know it takes many tries to finally quit and then sometimes after years of non smoking they might start again , -LRB- due to stress , divorce , loss of a loved one , etc. -RRB- . Like you say in your description : The QuitKey FAQsQuitting smoking can be a daunting prospect . Many have tried and failed , or tried only to return to cigarettes a few months , or even years , later . But do n't give up , there is a smoking cessation program out there for everyone , and QuitKey has been proven as an effective way to kick the habit . Here are the answers to a variety of frequently asked questions about QuitKey and smoking cessation in general.And also you state : What if I have finished the program and I start smoking again?It is not easy to quit smoking . Some people need a second or even a third chance.WHERE DOES IT SAY
 the pot is nice , but i specifically bought this kit because i wanted the hard wax ... which it says it comes with ... they sent me the `` original '' wax , which i ca n't even use because of skin sensitivity ... really annoyed
 I have a lot of pain when I get my bikini and underarms sugared , and I was excited to try this product . Unfortunately , it did not minimize my pain at all . I applied it an hour before my appointment , and even put extra on about 30 minutes before ... oh well .
 This may have helped a very little bit , but I was hoping to feel a big rduction in the pain . Dissapointing .
 I trusted this no scream cream for my second waxing appointment . Big mistake . It did n't help a bit . The pain was as intense as the first time with no cream . I followed all the directions too . Waste of money .
 Whatever you do dont put this cream on and think that there will be no pain . I really didnt notice any difference when I had my bikini line waxed . Take 2 panadol 30 mins before its much better ! My friend recommended this to me , she says it is brilliant so maybe it works for some . Ill give it another try and come back to you !
 Maybe this product is really effective in treating UTIs , and if so , that 's great . I did n't order it for that , so I ca n't evaluate its efficacy in that department . I ordered it -LRB- on the advice of a friend -RRB- to use as a candida-safe sugar substitute . I wish I had n't . It is so unbelievably bitter , like really cheap stevia , but unlike stevia , you have to use a lot to get your food to taste `` sweet '' . This product is so unappealing I can not use it and wish I could return it .
 I purchased this tub at the recommendation of a rehab facility , for a projected need . Things changed shortly after the tub arrived and I had not opened the box . I called to return it and the person on the phone rudely informed me that they could n't take it back once it left the store . This is very unclear in their return policy online . I felt ripped off . I would have waited for purchase had I known . The nonreturnable nature of this product needs to be specifically spelled out for this particular product next to the `` click here '' it 's yours button . Amazon is usually more trustworthy than this !
 This is the first over the counter retinol cream I have used . I did a lot of research beforehand by reading reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley . This retinol cream did NOT work for my skin . It caused acne and another red spot on my chin that has been there for over two months and will not go away . It caused a huge blemish on my chin and I now have a scar there . It has been there since July so I am worried it is now a permanent scar . I am now stuck with almost an entire tube of this product that I paid over $ 40 for . The money is n't a big deal , but a permanent scar on my face is what has me really worried .
 After applying it for 2 weeks , my eye area looks the same.It does not do anything for the lines at all .
 As others have stated , a large amount of blood is required to gain a readable test result . Even with the use of my lancer from my blood sugar test kit , blood from four separate pokes , the help of a pharmacist -LRB- my mother -RRB- and an RN -LRB- my mother-in-law -RRB- I could not produce a valid test result.Save yourself some money , go donate blood to the Red Cross and they will tell you your red type for free .
 I was excited about this product initially , because I thought it would save me money by not having to go to the doctor 's office . I read through the instructions twice , and followed them perfectly , but it simply did n't work . So much for saving money ...
 It would appear you need a lot of blood to tempt this to work , however , even on the first circle it did n't give a result . They were all impossible to determine .
 My review of the kit as simple as possible .1 . Ordered the 4th it came the 9th . Which is good since it was ups , but it did take about 3 days to be mailed out .2 . Kit came . I watched the video , read the directions over and over again .3 . The Lancet is a joke . Only one use and it does n't produce enough blood.I had to run down to rite aid and buy lancets WITHOUT the device for additional 5.99 . I must 've spent an additional hour pricking four fingers for enough blood to take the test .4 . Do n't waste your money .
 I got 2 kits to type both my children . My husband & I both read the directions carefully . We watched the video on website , but it cut off at the point where they started collecting blood on the sticks , so the information we most wanted was not on there . We each did a child & both of us had problems collecting enough blood for the stick . The lancet only works once , so if you do n't get enough on the first try , you 've wasted your money . Also , the circles where you put the water drop & blood look nothing like the results pictured on the instructions , so I have no idea what the 2 circles we did get reveal to us .
 Did not work and was a total waste of time and money . Followed directions and no definitive answer . I would not recommend this to anyone else .
 I brought 2 and neither 1 of them worked . The results were not clear . I still do not know my blood type . Waste of money
 I followed the directions and watched the online videos . I followed everything to a tee and guess what ? The only thing I got was a sore finger from the lancet and a card with no definitive answers to my blood type . What a waste of money . Now I have to actually go to my doctor and get it done . Cheaper does n't always mean better .
 We are both R.N 's , yet could n't determine blood type from this kit . Comes with only one lancet so buyer beware.If you do n't poke hard enough or bleed enough you do n't have enough blood to fill all the circles , and the test is then a massive failure . you do n't have enough time to go scurrying for a pin , but even if you are as quick as we were the reagent is n't enough . save your money .
 I tried to do this test . Did not work at all . Everything smeared and I had no choice but to throw it out .
 to watch the video on how to do the test is way overrated . could not down load because the website changed . once i downloaded the second choice i could not get the video to play . to watch the video is way over rated because there was no video to watch . i asked my daughter to help who works with computers and she could not get it to work . I am fustrated with this product and would have felt more comfortable watching the video before doing the one time shot . i purchased this product because of the reviews that said easy . Fustrating and confussing are more like it . A support phone number would have been nice . i wasted 2 hours of my life trying to figure out how to watch the video , what a waste .
 Video was not helpfull ended before it gave complete directions . Test went wrong . Should not have to buy two tests to get results .
 The instructions were fairly easy to follow , but the lancet was far from useful . There was not enough for even one of the 4 mixing sticks . I had already started the test -LRB- water over the reagents -RRB- per the instructions . I was relegated to using a safety razor to nick the fingertip and draw enough blood to complete the test .
 Did not work for me . I was only able to get enough blood for one circle . The lancet is a joke . They should put like 4 lancets instead of only one .
 I had such high hopes for this product , especially given all the favorable reviews for it . To its credit , it came nicely packed and contained all of the items promised . It was also fairly easy to understand how to use . The major downfall , unfortunately , was the lancet and blood collection stick . You only get ONE SHOT with the lancet -LRB- once it 's depressed , the needle will not come out again -RRB- , and the collection stick is TINY . Thus , the blood from the lancet prick basically has to come to the surface in a perfect bubble in order to be collected by the teeny tiny collection stick . Mess that up , and you 've just wasted your money because you can not proceed with the test . In our case , we understood this going in and were very careful with handling the lancet . Unfortunately , the person using it accidentally hit a vein and had a sudden , explosive burst of blood from the needle prick . Blood began pouring everywhere . There was no way to catch it onto the teeny tiny little collection stick -LRB- suitable only for munchkins -- very difficult for an average adult to hold and maneuver -RRB- and drop it onto the testing sites . Next , the bloodflow coagulated very quickly , and we then could n't squeeze anymore out . Without another lancet to try again , we could n't complete the test . Very frustrating . So , basically , we ended up with blood everywhere except on the testing areas and no way to prick the finger again . Too difficult for us to use , at least . Why they just do n't include a few lancets -- or a re-usable lancet -- makes no sense . Good luck to you with this thing .
 The instructions are cumbersome , and the results were not clear . Best to go to the local Blood Center in your area . They will blood type test you for free .
 I was not able to get this to work . I pricked my finger but could not get enough blood to do the mixing that the instructions required . I thought the instructions were a little complicated . I would not but this product again .
 We bought this test kit to determine my husband 's blood type since I am Rh negative and pregnant . The lancet was useless , it did n't produce enough blood for one circle -- and we only needed two circles -LRB- antigen D and control -RRB- . Save your money or get a lancet with deeper gauge -- that might work better .
 I choose it because it looked like the rest of the test offered . I have not tried to use it because it seems extremely complicated and intimidating . I would recommend it to a medical professional . My blood does not flow easily and to try and get my finger to bleed for a few minutes is impossible .
 The colors in the photo have nothing to see with the real product . IVORY ?? IT 'S ALMOST YELLOW !!
 I loved the TK waistband when i first got it , but after about 4 months the velcro started pulling away and it wouldnt stick anymore . A much cheaper one i had before lasted over a year.Its possibe I just got a lemon , i dont know . But i do love the TK knee supports . . As for the waistband , if your going to wear it alot , i say save your money .
 This is a fairly good quality product but the sizing information is completely wrong . It is advertised as fitting up to a 60 inch waist but it absolutely will not . The belt is 42 inches long and may stretch up to a 50 inch waist at best which would be seriuosly uncomfortable .
 This was a very short lived product . It worked really well for a short period of time then it just started losing power and not keeping a charge . I 've since gone back to the `` corded '' version .
 i happened to buy this trimmer at a ladies Beauty Supply Store . I really liked it at first . . but over time , maybe over a year , the charge would n't hold . This was even after weeks of keeping it in the re-charger . There is no indicator to let you know if the shaver is low or fully powered . . The last straw for me was while i was shaving , there was n't enough power to shave basic `` peach fuzz '' . . On several attempts the damn thing snagged , and pulled . I let out a yelp and dropped it in the toilet . . apparently where it belonged . . Fished it out , and vowed never to buy another one of these again . .
 While this would be an excellent prototype , it really does n't serve the purpose very well for what I needed .
 Before you consider this product check the other reviews for Wahl 5560 on Amazon . Most concur that this product line is junk . I purchased this 5560 product because of the Wahl name . I own their plug-in electric hair groomer and it is powerful and well made . Unfortunately , this nose trimmer is not of the same quality . It is cheaply made foreign junk with the Wahl name stamped on it . The cutter actually did a decent job , for a week or two . Then started having trouble with the little motor , would n't turn or cut . I took it apart and the motor looks like a cheap motor from a toy in a happy meal . Waste of money . Goes in the trash . os
 Only good for those that can figure out exactly how much hair will come off with the settings of the two trimmers . WHEN you make a mistake do not try to correct it . Time will correct everything and a steadier hand .
 I bought this scale a year ago and was very happy with the accuracy and the body fat measurement feature . Unfortunately I ca n't recommend it because it is not durable under real world conditions . I was cleaning my shower one day and accidentally left the glass door open a crack and a fine spray of water landed on it . Of course I wiped it off and then turned it on to make sure it was ok , but one of the buttons would n't work . I thought `` no big deal '' , I 'll just let it dry out and it will work again . That never happened , it 's permanently broken . Since you need to use the buttons in order to activate it , I ca n't use it properly anymore . I called Tanita to see about getting it fixed under warranty , but they say that it 's not a defect because I let it get wet . Well I checked the manual , and it does n't say that the scale should not be exposed to water , somehow I was supposed to magically infer this . Obviously it 's electronic and you do n't want to submerge or drown it , but it seems to me that an appliance which lives in the bathroom should be able to handle the occasional splash of water.According to the Tanita rep I spoke with , the scale should not be exposed to water in any way , even when you wipe it to clean it -LRB- I asked how you are supposed to clean it without getting it wet , I was being difficult -RRB- . I do n't know how they realistically expect anyone to achieve 100 % dryness in a bathroom setting , where every activity you do involves water . Their recommendation was to move it to another room with no water - not exactly practical for most people . Needless to say , if you are considering this scale for your bathroom I highly recommend you make sure you have a location that you can guarantee will not be exposed to water . If , like me , you do n't have a spot in your bathroom that is 100 % water-free , then maybe you should pass on this scale -LRB- and presumably Tanita 's other electronic scales , they did n't seem to think this was an unreasonable expectation on their part -RRB- .
 Please notice that this scale does not remember your weight from one time to another ! You will need a peen and paper to track your developement .
 I bought this scale because of the reviews . There is no way this scale measures fat . According to Tanita my BM is 28 , but even though I have lost 16 lbs the scale shows me at a healthy weight , but my fat at 41.5 , which is where it was when I started . I feel all I have is a pricey scale , not a fat monitor , which is what I needed .
 I purchased this product after viewing quite a few favorable reviews , while at the same time disregarding some of the unfavorable . Not taking heed of the unfavorable reviews was my error.My problem with this product is it 's consistency and how long the lubrication lasts once applied . This lube is basically the consistency of Baby Oil , I find extremely difficult to apply without making a mess.Not just that , but because it 's so thin , it literally drips EVERYWHERE and seems to lose it 's viscosity extremely quickly because it does n't stay in place . It 's sort of hard to explain ... Basically , I 'd classify this product as Baby Oil which is latex safe -LRB- safe for condom usage -RRB- . I definitely wish I had went with the ID Pleasure lube instead . -LRB- which I have used before and know is good -RRB- Think long and hard before you buy this item , if you already like the ID Pleasure version do n't even bother trying this out , it 's a waste of money .
 First , please realize that any review of a personal lubricant is going to be subjective because everyone has different expectations of a product like this . With that said , I do not recommend this product . I am working my way through all of the top brands of silicone-based lube in order to find the one I prefer . So far I 've tried 4 of them
 I did not care for this one because it is to thin to do any good and did ' t last very long .
 This is made of such low-quality foam that it flattens to almost nothing when you sit on it , so it gives virtually no cushioning .
 Well it is a foam rubber -LRB- egg-crate style -RRB- foam ring , but as for actual use it provides no support at all !! Do not waste your money !!!!!!!!!!!!
 Calling this a cushion is an oxymoron . It does not provide any cushioning whatsoever . I 'm only 140 lbs and this thing goes flat when sat on . Recently had surgery and was trying to get some cushion for my tosh .
 Purchased this after I had a baby and I may as well have been sitting on a board . It went right in the trash !
 It was on the bed for three days before it came off . Could n't sleep because I was soaked . At first I though I was experiencing early menopause . What a relief when I took this off the bed . Is this a problem with ALL allergy mattress covers ? I sure hope not!Easy to put on the bed , easy to take back off ...
 The Apple Cinnamon bars taste good at first ... then they start to get really disgusting . The texture makes you gag , but the taste is okay . I could n't get through the first box . This should NOT come in bulk .
 We tried this Monitor 3 times and it does not tell you when you are most fertile . After we put the fertility sticks into the monitor the display screened turned off . We had three intelligent people read the instructions to make sure we were following the instructions correctly . I would not recommend this item .
 please dont waste your money . this does nothing more than read the sticks you pee on and chart them on a ` graph ' , which has three levels , low , medium and high . it is extremely complicated and if you miss the ` window ' set up by the monitor for testing every morning -LRB- because you forget , or you wake up late , or in my case , you worked through the night ! -RRB- you mess up the whole month . stick to the ovulation predictor sticks , i feel sick that i wasted money on this . as for some of these reviewers who say it ` worked first time ' , that 's confusing . a monitor does n't get you pregnant , your partner does . i also believe there are some reviewers here who work for the company . please , please , dont buy this extortionate ` toy ' .
 The first cycle I used it was in August and it worked fine until 2 weeks later . After that day it marked a telephone , a square and a exclamation -LRB- ! -RRB- sign -LRB- that means it does not work any more -RRB- . I left some messages at the 1800 but I did not get any answer . I have been looking in Clearblue web page and I have not been able to find an email address where I can write looking for a solution . I wrote to BioMed USA Co. -LRB- the seller -RRB- Last week and did not get an answer . I am concerned nobody takes responsibility for this product .
 So , why two stars if this product does exactly what it says it will do ? Very simple - there are MUCH cheaper , and just as effective methods of tracking your monthly cycle . It is extremely important to track your cycle , as we do n't all ovulate on day 14 , and intercourse is recommended every other day during your fertile time -LRB- generally starting 5 days before you ovulate until the day you ovulate -RRB- . What this product does do -LRB- Pros -RRB- : Identifies the days leading up to and of ovulationWhat this product does n't do -LRB- Cons -RRB- : Allow you to review your historical cyclesTest for pregnancy -LRB- I know that 's obvious - but at this price range I would expect a product to be able to do BOTH -RRB- Get you pregnant -LRB- again , obvious , but the reviewers that say they got pregnant a few months after using this product did not know their cycles to begin with ! -RRB- Allow you to test outside the 6 hour windowSo , how to get to know your cycle . I highly recommend the fertility strips that amazon also sells that are about 25 cents each . Yes , 25 cents each . You do have to urinate in a cup and then dip the test stick in a cup , but this is a small inconvenience . You should begin testing once a day by day 10 of your cycle -LRB- maybe earlier if you have a short cycle -RRB- , and as soon as you see a faint second line on the product begin your every other day activity until you see the surge , and then perhaps bump it up to every day . I ended up using the Clearblue easy as well as these strips and got the EXACT SAME RESULTS with both products . In fact , I kept using the strips even with clearblue because I wanted to know exactly when my surge occurred to figure out my 24 to 36 hour window.Print off a free online calendar and keep track of the date , when your cycle started , when you started to see a faint line and then a surge , etc. . Then you can hold onto these to reference back to them . You can optionally also track your basal body temperature , but I do n't find this to be as convenient.This product really is gimmicky in my opinion , it does nothing other than test your LH , which can be done with the inexpensive test strips . I would recommend saving your money ! If you do n't have a regular cycle , I highly recommend trying the root vegetable Maca . After taking Maca for just a week I ovulated on day 14 when I normally ovulate on day 17-19 !
 The first month that I used this , I followed the directions exactly . It gave me a low fertility level until day 22 , when I got two days of high fertility , and then it dropped back down to low and never got to peak . According to the instructions , this means that I did not ovulate , so I assumed that I could not get pregnant that month . BUT , my period never showed up and it turned out that I did get pregnant that month , and I am now 6 weeks along . Most of the reviews seem to say that people got pregnant using this the second month , so maybe it just takes a month to figure out your personal hormone levels . Beware that it is inaccurate the first month !
 Buyer beware . This shipper is expensive to ship with and is very slow in shipping . Careful .
 to all women that trying to get pregy . dont waist ur money to buy this product ... plz ... . its not woth it . . tnks !
 Please , please , please do n't waste your money on purchasing this product . I know the path to becoming pregnant can become a frustrating , emotionally draining one , but this product does NOTHING more than the simple -LRB- and much less expensive -RRB- ovulation predictor kits . I feel the Company is taking advantage of those of us who are willing to do anything to increase the chances of getting pregnant . I was roped in by the claims of detecting not only LH , but also estrogen -LRB- which it does n't , that 's a BLOOD test -RRB- , as well as its claims that it somehow magically identified your most fertile days . But what I found was that the test sticks are simply `` read '' by the monitor to tell you if you are in a fertile phase or not , also depending on what day of your cycle you are on . If you 've been tracking your cycle , you are already fully aware of these things , and no little computer can outsmart you ! The instructions also say you can not read the sticks yourself , which is an outright lie . You can clearly see the control line and test line -LRB- during your LH surge -RRB- , so why does the computer need to read the stick and tell you that `` yeah , we see this too , you are fertile now ... '' Ughh !!! Do n't be taken advantage of because you want a baby ... save the $ 150 + for the diapers ! And if you are just starting out and want to understand your cycle better , spend some time reading online about fertility signs and the mentrual cycle overall . There is no replacement for your own knowledge !
 My husband and I had been trying to concieve for 6 months before buying this monitor . I had been tracking my cycle and cervical mucus religiously for a year , and had a pretty good idea of when I was ovulating . I bought this monitor to help me confirm when I was ovulating . Well , the first month we used the monitor , I had 13 high fertility days and no peak fertility days . I started freaking out thinking that I was not ovulating at all . We went to see my doctor . I had hormone testing done and it turned out that I was ovulating just fine , and my hormones were exactly where they were supposed to be . My doctor explained that there was nothing wrong with me , the monitor was just failing to detect my LH surge -LRB- which was in deed happening -RRB- . The second month , same thing . I used the monitor , I had 12 days of high fertility and no peak fertility days . I was more than frustrated with this expensive little gadget . As chance would have it , we ended up getting pregnant the second month of using this monitor , with absolutely no help from this monitor . I am glad that this monitor has worked for so many other women , but it did not work at all for us and it turned out to be a huge waste of money . Not only for the monitor , but also for the test sticks - it says you need 10 test sticks each month - that is a lie - the monitor told me to use 20 sticks each month . Not only were the sticks ridiculously expensive , it was difficult to find stores that carried them in stock . My advice ; save your money , this monitor does not work for everyone .
 For such a simple electronic product , they are WAY over-charging their customers.The monitor I received is defective . I do n't know if it 's because the seller shipped it in a paper envelope from overseas -LRB- the sticks were completely squashed upon arrival -RRB- or because the product simply does n't work . I also bought Ovuquick on the same day just to compare the results , Ovuquick works perfectly.I never understand why the ClearBlue Easy menu says if you hold it in a stream of urine , it will take 3 seconds . But if you submerge it in a cup of urine , it 's 15 seconds . Should it be the other way around?I think the only good thing about this product -LRB- and why some people have successful results -RRB- is because it forces you to start testing on day 6 . Sometimes I missed my ovulation day because I tested too late -LRB- day 10 -RRB- . But this has absolutely nothing to do with the quality of the product .
 This product did not help my system but everyone reacts differently . It just upset my stomach and tasted pretty terrible .
 Since when are liquids labeled in pounds ? This is not a lb of bentonite clay ! It is a 16 oz bottle of clay mixed with an unknown amount of water.I feel that it is deliberately misleading .
 Nowhere does the product specify that it is mixed with water . Ordered 2 16 ounce packages , got a 32 ounce bottle and was charged double for shipping . product did not work well for clarifying wine like the powdered pure bentonite products .
 Here are my problems with this :1 . Each serving is 886 Calories not 3100 as advertised .2 . It only has 37 g of protein per serving .3 . You need 5 scoops so it 's only 10 servings per package .4 . Most importantly , it tastes disgusting .
 Probably a good product but the taste is undesirable . Have n't used it much because no matter what you mix it with , the taste is always there /
 The actual product is great for detoxing and increasing your energy level . I orderd 2 bottles and only received one that is why I am only giving 2 stars . Not sure for the price if this is comparable to Acaiberry juice or other antioxidants with high orac value .
 I few weeks ago I made some negative remarks about this company 's product based on an experience I 've had with it . This product caused me to have a case of Diarrhea and based on that and the fact that no specific instructions is given on the limitations for how much you should drink in a given day . I left negative feedback and come to find out someone , somehow obtained my account information , logged in and erased my negative feedback I gave this company . This company like most companies do n't allow dissent towards it 's products .
 I have to agree with `` R.Katz '' They are incredibly chalky and cardboard like . They also have a strong dark chocolate taste . I do n't particularly enjoy dark chocolate ; those that do might enjoy these . The bars I received were well within their expiration date . -LRB- 10 months to go -RRB- OK but certainly not the best Balance Bar flavor .
 I suppose if you 're just looking for fuel for your body or emergency food to keep in your trunk , then these would be okay . If I 'd purchased this box of Balance Bars , I would 've brought it back to the store for a refund . The taste was pretty bad , and the consistency was gummy/muddy . It 's better if you have it with a full glass of water , although there 's a very strong aftertaste . My husband took a bite and spit it out -- the same with my six year old . My two-year-old son , however , seemed to actually like it and will eat a bar as a snack if I broke it up into small pieces . I just could n't get past the taste . I still have over a box left , which I 'll dole out to my son as snacks , but it 's defiantly not something I would ever buy or recommend . In fact , if someone told me they were going to buy them , I 'd ask if they 'd ever eaten them before and if not , I would tell them pick a different product . Big thumbs down on this one !
 Personally I found this bar to be very untasty . One bite was truly enough for me . They may be very healthy , which is great , but to me if I 'm going to eat something , it has to taste good , and this does n't meet that requirement .
 We did n't find these to be all that tasty . They had a mealy kind of texture . If you 're very very hungry they 'd be okay to eat . Perhaps they just were n't suited to our family 's taste buds .
 Overall , I did n't like this product . It has a very thick and gooey center that 's very hard to swallow unless I have a lot of water to wash it down with . The flavor was n't too bad , but if they could just change it so was n't so gummy ... I would n't recommend this product to my family and friends .
 The bars I recevied were past the `` Best when used by '' date by . Also , the bars were the original formula and not the new formula .
 I bought this 12-pack of peanut butter Balance bars and noticed some white stuff on the bars when I opened them before eating . I shaved them off with a knife . Then I went to look for Cliff bars at Amazon and noticed a bunch of reviews complaining about white stuff or staleness in the bars they ordered . Bottomline
 I am in the process of trying to lose weight , and this seemed a great way to skip lunch but still get all the nutrients I needed . When the Balance Bars arrived , I was surprised to get a whole box , enough for a two-week supply , plus one . My husband and I immediately pulled out that '' `` plus one '' '' to give it a taste . The bar looked delectable and smelled wonderful , but that was as far as it went . They are plain awful ! The chocolate coating is good , but whatever they have on the inside is sickening . It 's not very sweet , but it 's the texture that 's so bad . It 's like chewing wet sawdust . We immediately spit ours out , and the box of 14 is still sitting on my counter . I would definitely not pay money for these . Skip them and go on to Slim Fast , is what I 'd tell my friends and family . They definitely need to do some work on this product , not just that flavor .
 We returned this item because we thought it did not taste as it does usually . We buy them all the time and the ones we bought in our grocery store after this incident were normal tasting.With food you can not take risks
 At first I thought the Balance Bar tasted like sawdust , but I sort of got used to that after awhile . The bar is n't moist enough . I need a glass of milk wash it down or it 's hard to swallow . The taste was OK , but not something I 'd buy really . I 'd say if you 're on a diet and want a nice 200-calorie lunch , get a salad with a nice low-cal dressing instead .
 The only way I can describe these bars is with the word sweet . Too sweet , in fact . They have a good taste as long as you have a real sweet tooth . They 're good on the run , but unless you 're used to lots of sugar in the morning , I would n't recommend them for breakfast . Maybe in place of dessert though .
 The cookie dough flavor is okay , but not the best . The texture is a little too gooey . I have only eaten a few of these bars and I am already sick of them . I got them the same time as I got some Clif bar White Chocolate Macadamia , and those are by far superior to the balance bar.Hopefully the other flavors are better than this , but I think for now I will stick with Clif bars .
 I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars . They were terrific . But , they put them in new packaging -LRB- fine , who cares , right ? -RRB- but they also re-formulated them and it 's really sad what they 've done to them . They 're sickly sweet now , they have a cake-y consistency that 's not appealing and there 's barely a `` chip '' in sight.It 's all bad . I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast . No more . The new ones are so bad , I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them .
 I bought Yogurt-Honey-Peanut bars from DAB . What I received was not fresh , even though the expiration date was almost 8 months ahead . Compared to the taste of the fresh ones you can buy in your local stores , the taste of this one was really bad and it was really painful eating it . The appearance of the bar also suggested having some problems , before even tasting it.I do n't think the food is preserved in conditions that would guarantee freshness , and I do n't think I am going to buy from the same seller again.Note
 I eat these bars all the time and thought it would be a good deal and convenient to get them from Amazon . But , they were horrible . Stale and crumbly and deformed . I complained and customer service sent me replacement bars , but they were exactly the same - inedible . They refunded my money , which I appreciated.Based on this experience , I will never purchase food from amazon.com .
 I really did n't care for the product . It was very dry in my mouth . Not a whole lot of flavor , and the filling had a powdery feeling to it . The chocolate on the outside was good but again , not too much flavor . It needed to be sweeter , and the raspberry flavoring was weak . Tasted like I was eating an old candy bar , and a stale one at that . I had to keep checking it to see if it was old and out of date . I actually gagged on it a couple times while eating it . I did eat several of them -LRB- nine -RRB- . The wrapper looks too formal , not appealing to the eye . It made me feel like I was eating a health bar and not a fun item ! I thought the carbs were a bit too high also . It did give me a full feeling when I finished with it . Did n't fulfill the need for something sweet , though . If I 'm going to eat chocolate , I want to know I ate chocolate . I would n't recommend this to my family or friends . I 'd rather recommend Slim Fast Bars for the vitamins and health aspects .
 I 'm sorry to say that I was n't impressed with Balance Bar 40-30-30 . Quite frankly , it tasted horrible ! I could n't finish the first bar to see if it satisfied my hunger or sustained my energy . I would n't recommend this to my friends .
 I buy Balance Bar Nutrition Energy Bars on a regular basis so I decided to buy them online . They arrived in less than 6 days . The order was placed Jan-17-2011 , I received the Balance bars today , Jan-21-2011 , the expiration date is Jan-20-2011 - yesterday . I am NOT eating these . Unacceptable . I have read earlier reviews stating problems with the expiration dates . Maybe the reviews are worth taking into consideration .
 If you like foods that are VERY sweet , you might like these bars , but for many people , they may be overpoweringly sweet . They also have a weird crunchy-ness . I do like the fact that Balance bars contain lots of protein and vitamins .
 I love the peanut butter Balance Bars . People say these are good , but I thought they were horrible . My husband and older son did not like them either .
 While I do like the bars themselves , I feel that Amazon resorted to bait and switch . I signed up for a subscription -LRB- monthly delivery -RRB- , and the 2nd month they raised the price 50 % . Needless to say , I canceled the subscription , as I can buy it cheaper locally .
 The other Balance bars I 've tried taste much better -LRB- Balance Gold , with peanut butter , I believe -RRB- . These taste awful - chalky , cardboard-like . And it 's not just me - no one in my family likes them !
 I at these for years and really liked the way they taste . Then I did some research and found out that much of their protein is from gelatin or collagen which is 100 % worthless to humans for building/maintaining muscle because the amino acid is not good . Also lots of palm kernel oil in these which is n't too good for you . There are much better options out there . If you want something with better protein -LRB- but still has some palm kernel oil -RRB- and tastes great , try Metabolic Drive protein bars . If you are ok with eating something that is just ok tasting , then Zero Impact are by far the best bars out there . Great protein , healthy fats , low sugar , no sugar alcohols . I have n't found one bad thing about them . I just feel ripped off for the years I spent eating Balance Bars .
 I 'm very sorry but I do n't know of a nice way to say this
 I would n't recommend this product to friends or family . The taste , consistency , and texture were offensive to me .
 I 'm 61 years old , but I have EAGLE EYE Vision , and I 'm sick to death and very disappointed that the fine print on the ingredients of the BALANCE BARS `` ALMOND BROWNIE , '' are FISH GELATIN . IF I wanted FISH products in my protein bar I 'd buy a FISH BAR , but the fact that Balance Bars use Fish Gelatin in their ALMOND BROWNIE wishes I could SHOVE THE ENTIRE 6 box order up their noses.It 's so sad the ingredients and the junk that almost any company will put in your food . I will NOT BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN , and I doubt that although I 've been a huge balance bar customer , that I 'll EVER ORDER BALANCE BARS again , as they are FISH GELATIN bars in truth . SEE LABEL.I 'm done .
 I would have to say I was not very impressed by the quality and taste of this product . I guess I really expected more from this product , as they seem so expensive . The peanut-butter taste was very strong and the texture was very grainy and dry . I do n't think that these bars are very filling . You have to drink a lot of water with them to even get them down . I would not recommend this product to my friends .
 i am a first time user so perhaps this is the reason for which my mooming experience was less than satisfactory . i have never waxed or sugared before but i had tried -LRB- unsuccessfully -RRB- to educate myself on the proper techniques and procedures for mooming . i read the instructions and even watched videos online . however i never was able to get the product to spread on thin enough . this is a major requirement because if it 's too thick , the hair wo n't come off . i thought the product cooled quite quickly but i do not have a wax warmer , i used the microwave . the only thing i can really say worked was the reusable strips . i only used a few before i grew agitated with the whole process . some hair came off , but not nearly as much as desired . when i was through i used warm water and a little bar soap to get the product and hair off . then i let them air dry for next time . as for now , the product is not up to my liking , but i will try again and hope for the best since i 've already paid the money . i would recommend this type of product only to those who have worked with waxing products before and who are comfortable with them
 I have poison Ivy in my yard near my grapevines . Ca n't kill it without killing the grapes , so every year I get poison ivy picking grapes . I purchased this product hoping to avoid it . I applied it thickly , stopped after 4 hours and reapplied it . When I came in I immediately showed with Tecno poison Ivy remover . I thought I was covered six ways to sunday . I still got posion ivy , in fact I had the worst case I have had in years , and I landed up on medicine .
 I bought this product and it immedietely started to burn my skin . It was already nearly 100 degrees outside and I had to work . This product made me absolutely miserable for about 4 hours in the hot sun with my already burning skin . And guess what . . I still got poision oak . Maybe its cause I was sweating after I put it on .
 This is for relatively small to medium arms as the velcro is not very long . The padding could be thicker also to compensate for the rough material on the outside . I doubled them up and added velcro pieces to them to get them to be comfortable enough to put on and use .
 Service OK . Product does n't seem to be as effective as what I previously bought in a drugstore . I will probably search for it locally instead of ordering if I decide to try it again .
 Do n't order this from Amazon , 'cause you 'll get 1 , Not 3 bottles of this product-if you want to pay 18.23 for 1 bottle of this , then go ahead & grab your ankles-this is false advertising , not to mention I feel screwed . .
 While this product contains electrolytes and one would think would be good for hydration , the product also contains SORBITOL , a LAXATIVE . The laxative effect may actually be strong enough to off set the hydration effect and cause DEHYDRATION . This is an ironic product ingredient choice . Do not use this product if sorbitol has a strong laxative effect on you or if you are trying to keep a good electrolyte balance in a person who is ill .
 I have fructose malabsorption and can not have sorbitol , it kills me with pain if I have even a very small amount of it . This product review is not for the product itself , but for the way they advertise no sugar , when it does have sorbitol . Listing ingredients should be a requirement when sugars have been substituted . I wish I could return it , but they do n't take returns either.Thank you !
 After reading quite a few rave reviews about nuun tabs in general , I figured I 'd pick up a mixed flavor pack and see what it 's all about . This is kind of like Alka Selzer , only it leaves little flecks floating around in your water . It 's not a huge problem , just a little unexpected at first . The fizziness is fun and it makes your bottle of water make interesting sounds as the tablet dissolves , plus you could teach your kids or friends a little about the physics of gases in water -LRB- as the tab gets close to fully dissolved , the bubbles forming on it and stuck to it will lift the fragments to the top of the bottle -RRB- , but that 's really all I have to say good about nuun.I assume that , like me , you buy water additives for the flavor . In this , nuun falls quite short . The flavors are so mild as to taste watery , while still somehow managing to put an aftertaste on your tongue that lingers for a few minutes . The pitch about electrolytes is completely useless ; eat a salt pill and drink a sugared drink if you 're actually engaging in significant amounts of long-term exercise that makes you sweat . Otherwise , you do n't need electrolytes . I think I 'd like this more if it were a b-complex multivitamin ; I 'd also forgive the little floaty bits it leaves behind . This probably is n't worth your money unless you just find the taste delicious .
 Tastes like flavored Alka Seltzer . I tried a couple of the different flavors and just disliked them . I 've tried them on 3 occasions and did n't like it . The only time it was moderately passable was when I left it for a couple of days and then tried it.I 'm sticking to G2 .
 I guess as a hydration supplement it does what it says . Taste is average . Unfortunately , they have put MSG -LRB- probably listed as `` natural flavoring '' in the ingredients -RRB- . For me , that leads to a migraine headache when combined with exercise . I use CamelBak Elixir with no problems and it tastes pretty good , too .
 Because of a medical condition I am required to drink 3-4 liters of water a day . Due to consuming all of those fluids I have a tendency to get depleted of crucial electrolytes like sodium and potassium . I was looking for something I could keep on hand and drop in a bottle of water whenever I needed a boost . -LRB- I do not drink Gatorade or Powerade because of all the sugar and calories . -RRB- After some researching I came across Nuun which seemed to yield the best overall reviews for an electrolyte drink tab and thought I 'd give them a try ... Well I have tried all the flavors now and not one of them is enjoyable . I generally put a whole tablet in a 500 ml bottle of water and wait for it to dissolve . Sometimes it does not dissolve completely so I have to shake up the bottle a bit . The taste is just not good at all ... really watered down and has a chemical aftertaste . There is also a strange fizzyness that somehow makes the drink even more unpleasant . I also must say I am generally one who is able to tolerate less than palatable things quite well . These simply do not work for me and I have to force myself to get the whole bottle down . The only up side is that the tabs do make a difference - I feel much better overall after having one or two . They even raise my blood pressure a little which has a tendency to be low . My bottom line is that If you are looking for flavor , look elsewhere . I know next time I will . If you are one who can drink anything and only want results then Nuun is for you .
 What a waste of money this was . The brace runs about 7 sizes to small no matter what size you order and it has very little support and is very hard to get on and off .
 The glasses are waaaaaay to small for a man . I thought they would be good since the description says for both men and woman , but it is in no way big enough for a man . Very disappointed .
 The lens quality was VERY good , but the quality was bad tube , opened alone . And that is not highly recommended .
 Have three pair of these . Two of them have lost the plastic nose pieces . All of them have lost the pocket clip on the case . The two halves of the case quickly lose their snug fit and are constantly coming apart . On the plus side the optics are good and the size of the glasses and case are just right . Wish I could find something better in this style .
 The clip on the case of this product broke the first time I used it . The reason I purchased the product was because of the case and clip . Would not recommend .

 I only walk barefoot at home , never outside . I use a foot cream every night , and then put on a pair of footies . I also use a foot file in the shower a few times a week . I 'm not as concerned with price as I am with keeping my heels smooth as I live in the south and wear sandals and open-heeled shoes all summer.I 'm trying lots of different brands to find the best . So far , I have tried DDF , Gold Bond from the drugstore , Qtica and Kerasol . Qtica 's foot balm is absolutely the least effective of them all . I used it for 10 days , every night . My heels still looked , and felt dry.So far , the best product has been Kerasol . Second place is DDF .
 I bought another product from this brand and let me tell you its just water it has nothing in it . after buying this product and realizing that it was just water I googled it under KING BIO SCAM and what you know they were sued for fraud for false advertisment . do not waste you money ...
 I was in the market for clothes pins with holes . I found a photo of what I was looking for and ordered . I received the clothes pins but the package did not resemble the photo on the website and there were no holes in the clothes pins . I emailed them twice and have yet to hear from them . I 'm tired of waiting so am sending this negative response . I recommend you not do business with this vendor .
 I was excited when I bought these thinking they were the perfect compliment to the fabric softener balls that do n't help with static . Unfortunately despite the claims , these do n't help with static either ! I could be imagining things but it seems to have almost made it worse !
 These balls seem to be effective for one medium load of non towel/cotton laundry . Then there seemed to be a buildup of static in the balls and they became ineffective on the second load . After leaving them for a few days I tried them again and they again worked for one medium sized load of laundry . On the third and final time I tried , the towels were completely filled with static.It seems to take a few days for the built up static charge to dissipate and to be truly effective you would need several sets of these balls , which kind of defeats the purpose of the idea in my opinion.I have yet to find an effective version of this idea but I will keep looking , just not at these .
 It seems as if there is more static now that I am using the anti-static dryer balls , but in all honestly it could be just the change in weather . I do not see much difference one way or the other really .
 The Anti-Static balls might prevent cling but the resulting snags in your clothing are n't worth it ! The plastic ` cage ' surrounding the ball does n't stay together which creates sharp edges tumbling around with your clothes . I 'm a big fan of dryer balls and have turned friends and family on to using them but I 'm going back to the tried and true pink & blue balls for my laundry !
 They do very little to help your clothes in the dryer . do n't wast your money bying this product it dose not work .
 Do not buy these balls . They have absolutely no value and do not address any static issues . I 'm not certain how they even came up with the name ANTI-static : -LRB-
 I 'm so disappointed that even on the first wash without fabric softener these did not work at all for static ! My load of laundry had as much static as when I do not use fabric softener !
 Buyer Beware ! Amazon fulfills this order but the inventory comes from another company . The inventory must be mixed up because we received a * maternity * support belt , not a * postpartum * support wrap .
 The first time you use it , it 's ok but the second third day the top and bottom of belt roll to the center of you stomache -LRB- meaning it folds over -RRB- not so good when you have had a c - section . &#128532;
 The sizing on this item is completely off . I am a tiny petite person with a waiste size of 28 . I bought the small following the sizing listed on here but when I received the item , it did not fit me at all . I could n't even pull it close around my hip and waiste . Unfortunately I did not try this item on right away so now I ca n't even return it for a medium .
 I recently had my 5th c-section and was hoping to find a support band that would support my stomach as it healed from the c-section . I loved the maternity support band by the same company but was dissapointed with this one . Yes , it does support but it is very uncomfortable .
 This pillow has perfectly good construction and design but its size makes it unusable in a standard office chair or car seat -LRB- even in an SUV -RRB- .
 These pads do not have very much alcohol in them . After purchasing them , I determined I could buy the BD Brand -LRB- larger pads and much more alcohol on the pad -RRB- on the Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market shelf every day for $ 1.14 / 100 count box -- the same I paid for these . At Wal-Mart , I would not have had to pay shipping .
 Well the incredible proliferation of the corn industry marches into another aspect of our life ! We are threatened with 95 % of our daily intake already being Corn , and now America wants me to intake corn in more ways ?!?! Outrageous ! Thank you Corporate America , but I 'll stick with traditional pleasure toys , and not be another sheep lining up for your wares !
 This appears to be hand made one item at a time . Each unit is therefore slightly different with respect to fit , tolerances , dimensions . Poor design and manufacture . This looks like a cheap product . It is not finished . Wood is rough at edges , apparently not even sanded let alone finished or stained . Height adjustment not smooth . Very heavy , cumbersome , too large . Not at all pleasureful to use . Not even close to smoothness and efficiency of calf muscle exercise machines at gym . I `` used it '' -LRB- to the extent possible given flaws -RRB- once .
 very unusual brace . I had a hard time trying to figure out how it worked . Not very impressed . I would definitely try something else .
 I get back spasms sometimes in my upper back and good support will most timeshelp them to get better . This product was not easy to get on and it has much too muchflexibility to provide much of any support to the back area . It is like wrapping an acebandage around you ! You are better off to buy a good posture bra that hooks in the frontif you are a woman !
 I 've been taking multiple brands of MSM on and off for a while now and this is the first time my knee continued to hurt , no matter how much I took . Immediately upon taking my other brand , my knee was fine . You get what you pay for .
 These bandaids are really fun to look at , that is if you can get them open without ruining them . They open up by pulling 2 tabs in the middle which inevitably makes both sides of the bandaid stick to eachother and therefore un-usable . When you actually manage to get one open without ruining it , they do n't stick very well . Horrible !!! and a waste of money .
 The Good : They sparkle and shimmer like crazy and react with the light -LRB- in other words if you move it around the sparkles will move as they catch the light -RRB- . The Bad : These will not work on fingers as the movement will cause the bandaid to come loose and they can not twist.The adhesive does n't keep the area around the wound sealed off , so it should n't be used in an area that gets wet.These will not work on joints or near skin that must be very flexible , potentially a scratch on the shin far from any joint would be a place the bandaid could stay on -LRB- have n't had the chance to try there -RRB- . Kids should not open the bandaid as the placement for the open tabs are more difficult and can result in the bandaid sticking to itself -LRB- it is placed in the middle of the bandaid instead of at an end -RRB- . The verdict : I suspect in order to get the serious sparkle affect they use a very stiff product which makes application difficult and I question the ability to actually treat a cut with them . My kids ended up using them as decoration in the dollhouse - and if you are a scrap-booker these would be a fun addition to a broken arm page but there is no practical application for these .
 I got the HoMedics tri-fitness Health Station with calorie predictor from 24-Hour fitness . I never used it until recently.It appears to give a very accurate weight reading , one that is higher than the scale at my gym . Unfortunately , I think theHoMedics scale in this case is more accurate.Here 's my beef , when I ask for the body fat content after entering the info it tells me I have around 16 percent body fat.This is so far off it 's laughable . Even at the pinnacle of my training with the more accurate caliper measure I never gotclose to 16 percent . The weight part looks accurate , but I know the body fat percentage is terribly inaccurate in my case.It 's probably off by 4 - 5 percent . That means if I believed the figure I 'd think I was in great shape , but I know I 'm not.I tried it again and the same result under 16 percent slightly . Not correct , not even close . I would n't recommendanyone buy this scale for measuring body fat or other similar non-weight variables . On the other hand , it seems to bea decent scale and I think it 's probably quite accurate with weight .
 I do not recommend this scale . The enter and memory buttons stuck and were inoperable . I wanted to update my memory settings yet could n't . I only had the scale about 1 year . I just returned it to the manufacturer for a replacement . Wish me luck with Homedics 540 Health Scale .
 I fell for prevention magazine 's glowing review of this scale too ! This is a very expensive piece of trash . I have owned it for 1 1/2 years and it is never accurate , battery runs out quick , stores information and then `` looses '' it so you have to re-enter everything over again , so not worth the time or money . The worst part is when you weigh yourself and it weighs you 5 pounds lighter or heavier than it did yesterday , you never know your real weight ! First I have to thank Homedics for making this junk and second I would like to thank Prevention magazine for the fake `` review '' of the scale , it was a paid advertisement by Homedics not a real consumer review , so that makes you losers too .
 I bought a Homemedics scale about two months ago . The battery runs out about every two weeks . At $ 3.50 a pop , this scale has become very expensive fast . You call the 800 number and of course they expect a receipt and for me to ship it to them for replacement . Talk about lack of customer service ! Terrible company - terrible scale !!!
 I researched very carefully and the Homedics SC-560 was recommended and I find it is 3 to 4 lbs off .
 I got this for my daughter as a surprise , she was so excited UNTIL she actually used it . It showed her at one weight , she stepped off of it and back on , and it showed another weight . Better yet , she lives in the dorms and took it upstairs and weighed up there and it showed an even different weight ! Good grief . It also showed her at an acceptable weight , next then underweight , then the next overweight . So , needless to say after others trying it and getting the same errors , I returned it for my money back . Boo , hiss ... can I give it a zero ?
 After I saw this scale advertised in Runner 's World magazine , I set about finding one . I could not find it in the stores that the HoMedics website listed . Instead , I purchased it through Amazon . It arrived with the start button trapped in its slot and I was unable to even get it started . I was very disappointed with the marketing and the quality of this product . -LRB- Thanks to Amazon for letting me return it with a full refund and shipping costs . -RRB-
 This product came highly recommended for my chronic joint pain . I began taking the product and by day two I had a severe headache . Since I am prone to headaches , I continued to take the product for another four days . The headache never subsided for the entire five days , so I discontinued the product . Within 24-hours , the headache was completely gone . However , I do know this product has ` worked miracles ' for others . It just was NOT for me . I suggest you try this product but discontinue it immediately if you get an uncontrollable headache . Amazon did allow me to return the product for a full refund . As always , Amazon is THE GREATEST ! Thank you .
 This massager is alright , I bought it prior to buying a Homedics SBM-200 . I find that the stationary massage points leave much to be desired . For double the money you get a much better massage with the SBM-200 since it moves up and down your back .
 I wish I knew ahead of time that you can only use the heat when the massage is on . My husband for instance just wants HEAT and he ca n't have just the HEAT . If I would of known I would of purchased a different one . So I could use HEAT alone !!! Other than that I guess it 's ok .
 This is just a regular lighter . It takes lighter fluid . It was a waste of money . I bought it because I thought `` windproof '' meant a butane torch lighter . I was wrong . Save your money , get something else .
 Right out of the box , the product does not work . I took a chance on this lighter and I am sorry I did . Its nice that sparks come out when I hit the ignition but no fire . It means either this product was shipped broken or came with no fuel to begin with . Either way , this is not how a lighter should be shipped to a customer . I did not bother to ship it back as my time is worth money and for me to pay for shipping for a $ 12 lighter is not worth it . Besides how it looks , this lighter does deliver what it promises . At least the lighter should come filled with fuel or not broken . Do n't fall for the slick looks . I am bit suspicious that maybe all the past rave reviews are posted by the employees of the seller .
 I think people would do well to understand that this lighter was based on a design cobbled together in the trenches of WWI using a spent shell casing . They did this not because it was the best way to make a lighter but rather because the shell casings were all they had to work with.Now the production model , to make the shell casing idea work , has a lot of moving parts . Remember , the more moving parts the less reliable something is.Push a button on the bottom while pulling out releases half the outer casing , exposing a push rod , moving plate and a spring . You would do this to replace the flint . You would drop the new flint into a channel and close it up.Also , there is this little plate with hinges . It covers the striking wheel when not in use . Mine came away almost immediately and now slides up and down . It does n't affect the operation of the lighter so ... In the other half of the casing is the fuel . That comes in three parts . Slide out the middle casing , exposing the inner casing , pull away the middle casing , refuel , replace the middle and slide back into the outer . And the more you do this the looser it gets . At least a zippo has a cap that keeps the whole assembly contained so that it does n't matter how loose it gets . With this design sooner or later the whole assembly will drop right out.And yeah , you can use it as a candle but why would you do this?You can adjust the flame , with another sliding , moving part , which in low mode is about that of a wooden match . High mode yields a two wooden match flame . But , having said that , it is an adequate pipe lighter . One can reach the bottom of a bowl with it . And again yeah , if one cups their hand around it is wind resistant , better than a bic.If you can get this for $ 15 then it 's ok , buy the 3 pack at $ 45 , looks nice , nifty cigarette , adequate pipe lighter but at $ 25 you probably should look at something else . If you need something to last a long time or bet your life on then you definitely need to look at something else.As an edited add on ... If you want more flame pull out more wick then it would definately be an adequate pipe lighter . Also , my flint went flat in 7 days so , you may want alot of flint . Maybe my striking wheel will dull over time and change that.Another edited add on ... Granted , I lit it 30 times a day . I went through 2 flints in two weeks of earnest use . And apparently , upon the end of the second flint the flint was expelled . In any case , there was no sign of it when I went to replace . Everything was normal during the last light . However , now , I find that the new flint wo n't advance through the top of the little cylinder , flint holding chamber and that the striking wheel wo n't turn . And for the life of me I ca n't figure out why . I think my $ 25 lighter lasted two weeks . I have to drop my rating to 2 stars now.And my last words on this . Apparently , upon the end of the last flint the striking wheel damaged the top of the flint chamber blocking any new flint . I forced the flint through and now the wheel turns . But still , do n't bet you life on this thing .
 I received the Imco triplex in a mini brown envelope encased by cardboard . I should have read the description of `` not in original packing . '' That 's fine , but what I received was the lighter with 5 stars engraved on the flat spine side . This is not what I ordered . Do not want cheesy star engravings on my lighter . Price should also be cheaper without original packaging .
 This is simply not a very good lighter . Bought one for myself and my brother in law and we both have moved on to a zippo . For a couple dollars more just get a zippo .
 I purchased this lighter because I believed it would light in the wind as advertised . IT DOES NOT ! A light wind blows it out . So I would not buy this lighter again .
 first thing you notice is it smaller then it looked in picture . next wasnt that practical got very hot if lit for over 10 sec and moving peices got jammed easly . in my opinion just get a zippo , heck a disposable bic is better than this .
 I own several lighters for camping and this by far has to be the worst one out there . The lighter will not light and when you do prime it with fuel a small breeze puts it out again . All I know is the Austrian 's who are unloading this crap are probably using better lighters .
 So I knew this lighter wold have no fuel when I bought it , but it also did not come with a flint . Way overpriced for no fuel , no packaging/directions and no flint .
 This is an inexpensive lighter , and cheaply made , I think I would have preferred a Zippo . IT works but , MEH !
 It is an okay item but at the same time I had one big problem . I hear others saying something about fluid , and when I got mine I had constantly kept lighting it , all i did with the wick was just catch red , it never stayed as lit as near as close as the shown picture . It just came with the metal part , the flint , and the cotton thing to keep it lit . I did n't get any liquid in mine or fuel , I would at least have expected it to . And if it does it should at least say `` Product does not come with fluid '' . I do n't know where to get the cotton after taking it all out since the cotton it came with , after constantly trying to get it lit , had ran out . That is my current and possibly only reason for 2 stars .
 I purchased this lighter to replace the IMCO lighter that I lost . IMCO makes great lighters and I loved my old one , however , the one I received from this distributor was not acceptable.The lighter was shipped in a small brown envelope that was not even properly sealed . The package was labeled `` Austrian Windproof Lighter New '' which seemed sketchy to me . My suspicions were correct when I looked at the lighter and realized it is not the lighter advertised or the original IMCO Triplex . The lighter I was shipped has five raised stars down the side , not what I had ordered.I will be returning this item immediately and purchasing elsewhere .
 Decent lighter but I did see anything in the listing that it was not butane . It just says windproof so I Assumed it was butane . Good luch lighting it with even a slight breeze .
 At first this was a great purchase
 This is a nice lighter if you are a collector.It is not a good lighter at all though , not good for camping , not good for taking out anywhere . Maybe good to show off originality for a one time use only.The fluid dries up in just a few hours of non use.When used , it heats up very fast making it unusable and dangerous actually . . I was hoping to get a useful practical original lighter , got a useless lighter instead .
 lighter fluid dries up fast and by no means is it wind proof . With a 4 star rating i was expecting a lot more .
 I 'm going to review this in comparison to Zippo.Pros
 I do n't understand ; I tried the cool cayenne , and it was still hot hot hot in my stomach.Has anyone else experienced the same thing?I read somewhere that if your mouth experiences the hotness first , it somewhat prepares your stomach for the cayenne . I just swallowed the capsules because I did n't want the hot burning in my mouth .
 Brand new out of the box , it does n't work . The LCD screen does n't pass its self-test . Only a few random bars light up even though all screen elements should appear during the test.The 866 - service support phone number that 's listed in the instruction manual does n't work , at least not from my locale.Waiting for them to reply to an email . All this is making my BP go up and up and up !
 How big is this thing ? I 'm not going to order something I do n't know the specs of .
 first time i tried this brand . seems like it may meet average user standards
 I brought this silk eye pillow to replace a silk eye pillow I brought many years ago.This one is small compared to the item I was trying to replace . Not what I was expecting .
 Not so hot.I did n't feel the effects of Dong Quai , and I was disapointed ; because I was really looking for Dong Quai to help me with my hot flashes . But no , it did not .
 Watch out for this vendor . We ordered canes and they were never delivered . The vendor -LRB- MedSupply -RRB- called to make it right so I would remove the bad review . The canes still never arrived . Do not deal with MedSupply !
 The latest `` advanced formula '' version in the white tube is not nearly as effective as the older version in the yellow tube . This new version feels much thinner and your lips feel very dry shortly after applying it to your lips . Additionally , the tubes become very messy since the `` thinner '' vaseline tends to leak out of the tube in to the cap . After years of using Vaseline Lip Therapy for my lips , I no longer use Vaseline products .
 I always used Carmex and never had a problem . When I was out , I went to the store and they did n't have any so I bought Vaseline Lip Therapy . It made my lips peel like crazy and I 've never had that problem before nor am I in the sun much ! I stopped using it and switched back to Carmex .
 I measured myself and bought the size that was supposed to have fit me.First of all , this product is not meant for larger chested women - I 'm a C.The `` contoured '' part would only have worked if my breasts were closer together . Even when I smashed them , the belt did not fit properly . If I had bought a bigger size , the contoured area would have become even smaller as I would have had to wrap the belt around tighter . And if I bought a smaller size , the velcro would n't have matched up.Also , the elastic is super uncomfortable . I 'd imagine if I wore this for a day , I 'd have chafing marks around my ribs . It would have been nice if the outer edges were lined with a softer material .
 I combined with 5-htp and when I stopped and continued with 5-htp , I still felt good . So I 'm pretty sure 5-htp did all the work .
 I seen a lot of good reviews but bad results for me . I stuck with it for a week but progresivly felt worse each day with increasing pain . Maybe helps some people but not for me .
 This is supposed to boost your mental clarity.Especially when detoxing from coffee.It did nothing for me . And I bought three bottles!I should have bought a book or CD instead .
 Try something else . This does have wax and will remove some hair , but is not very good . There are better kits out there , or go to a pro . The roller does not work well and you end up in more pain with not much hair removal .
 I would n't give this product any stars . It seems to have been discontinued for a reason . The wax does n't stick to the strips that are given with it . I bought it trusting the veet brand , but this just turn out to be a big mess . The water makes the item to hot to hold long enough to roll on . However the wax is sticky , but it fools you .
 Tasteless - for someone with diet restrictions or allergies only , otherwise stick with another brand .
 I just put this on my eyes for this first time tonight - the pressure on my eyes was so great I had extremely frightening blurry vision for an hour after I took it off -LRB- only left it on for 5 minutes -RRB- . I guess I can try to use it on my head even though I do not suffer from headaches or sinus problems . There is no scent at all , so it 's no more relaxing than a plain old hand towel . Very disappointed . They falsely advertise this product .
 CONS : The beads are too heavy for my eyesslides out of placethe Velcro gets stuck in my curly hairnot soft enough for my sensitive facedoes n't block out all the lightPROS : like the brand
 I was so excited to see this on Amazon as I can no longer find it locally . Much to my dismay this one does have the lavender and chamomile , despite what the title and photo indicate -LRB- wish I had read the reviews before ordering rather than trusting the listing -RRB- . I have used the pillow with lavender and chamomile for years and loved it -LRB- this would have been my fourth one -RRB- . So disappointed this is n't it . I went to the Earth Therapeutics website and it appears they do not offer it any more . I 'll probably be returning this one , it just is n't the same .
 I can not actually rate the quality of this product as Amazon did not send me the correct one . I ordered the one above , with lavender and chamomile , but received a different one . Amazon will not offer a means to exchange this product , only the refund . I should have gone with another seller/company .
 As much as I wanted to love this product , I ca n't stand the nasty smell it gives off.It stays warm for about 15 minutes , which is fine , but the odor it gives off , somewhere between burnt popcorn and dead skunk , it just too much .
 THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED.This was ordered for as a gift . I suffer from sever migraines . Knowing that the heat combined with the scent of lavender and chamomile would sooth my migraines I was excited . Until I opened the gift and realized that Amazon falsely advertized the product . There is NO lavender and chamomile . Not only does the title mislead you but , the photograph does too . We tried to contact Amazon about their mistake , but found no way , other than maybe getting a refund .
 I specifically checked the listed ingredients to make sure this product did not have magnesium stearate . It does not list this ingredient on Amazon , yet today when I recieved my bottle of Spirulina , there it was . I am so mad and I am returning it unopened . I do n't know where I can find any that does n't have this . Maybe the powder form .
 Not the fault of seller . I previously ordered USNEA -LRB- barbata -RRB- and I did not know the difference to Usnea -LRB- Uva Ursi -RRB- . I was looking for a larger oz quantity not found with previous brand . Barbata had no taste and did help with congestion issues.If you can get past the taste of dirty dirt it might be a good buy for 4oz 's of product .
 This bedpan was recently purchased for me by my gradmother , folllowing my gender augmentation surgery . BIG MISTAKE . The first time I used it , the bedpan overflowed violently from the sheer volume of liquid feces I expelled from my recently augmented anal canal . The stentch was overwhelming , and caused my cat , Lord Ticklebottom , to vomit sardines uncontrolably all over my face.After a few days of this pattern , I decided to dismiss the bedpan entirely , and chose to instead void my bowels directly onto the floor next to my bed . It 's been a few weeks now , and my cat -LRB- Lord Ticklebottom -RRB- has become poisoned from ingesting so much of my rotten , fettid fecal mountain.Recently , I 've taken to bringing the bedpan on roadtrips in my 87 ` Chevette Hatchback , but due to my addiction with off-roading , the feces would slosh around in the bedpan , making my bottom very wet and odorus . Also , the faulty design of the bed pan caused the urine , pus , and feces to spray out between my thighs and onto the steering wheel . The excrement-covered steering wheel would become very slippery , and I often would lose control and would crash into trees , or playgrounds.I intend on filing a lawsuit against the plastic company , and the company that makes the color blue , for designing such a faulty bedpan . The fecal capacity is sub-par . And my poor cat may die from this experience .
 If you want to order a comfort pillow for the aromatherapy benefits then DO NOT order this . It is okay I guess in terms of comfort - although the material is relatively cheap and you can get something for the same price that is made much better . But there is literally , NO SMELL at all . I ca n't believe it . What a waste of money . I am not ordering from this company again , 2 negative experiences in a row . Save yourself money , please .
 I received this item as birthday gift . I was excited about the pillow and could n't wait to heat it up and relax . So I took it out of the bag and then realized that it had a dirty area on it . Not a big deal . I was unhappy because I now knew that I had to return it which was going to take some time to get back but I just wanted a clean pillow . Well I was very wrong and could n't be more unhappy with this company and their customer service . I called customer service and spoke to a woman named Maria . All I wanted was an exchange , not a return , or my money back . She said they do not except exchanges , only returns for defective items . I said `` This item is defective because I received a dirty pillow . '' She says , `` Oh , well I will have to ask my supervisor if that is ok and call you back . '' So I asked her why do you need to speak to a supervisor if it is just an exchange . That is the easiest possible request a customer could ask for . She then had no answer and told me she 'd have to call me back . I waited -LRB- 2 -RRB- days with no call back . I called customer service another -LRB- 3 -RRB- times with no call backs . I then emailed them and after several days she replied that I have to take pictures of the pillow in order to get another pillow . I could n't believe it ! So I took pictures and said how unprofessional I thought it was of them to make me take pictures of a dirty pillow that they sent me and then I have to wait for their reply . I have been buying things off the internet for years and this is the first company that has ever asked me for a picture before they except it back . Well it 's been -LRB- 4 -RRB- days with no reply . I am now taking it a step further now with the Better Business Bureau and going to write negative reviews on websites were you can purchase their items due to their unprofessional , ignorant , business ethic . DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY YOUR MONEY BECAUSE IF YOUR PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE OR USED , THEY WILL NOT BACK THEIR PRODUCT OR RETURN POLICY !
 I use therapeutic heat nightly . After having this for two weeks I got a different one . This product does not stay warm long enough to be any real help !
 Terribly sticky and waxy ... I ca n't believe it 's a lipstick !!! You can push it out but you ca n't draw it back ... it looks just like to contain too much water and ca n't be called as a stick ...

 This was tight in all the wrong spaces , not supportive at all . Waste of money , wish I had returned it
 We were in the middle of a heat wave when my probiotics arrived . The bottle was hot . Since this is a product that must be refrigerated I called the manufacturer who confirmed that it would be ineffective if it got hot . I called the Vitamin Shoppe and they gave me a refund for the product but not for the shipping . The person I spoke with was very polite and helpful . He said that they know the heat was an issue and they were discussing what to do . In light of that fact , why did they take my order in the first place and why did I have to pay shipping ?
 I 've had this charger for a few months , one day it was charging 4 Duracell batteries , and our power blinked off and quickly back on . I heard a hissing , and when I came in the room this product was SMOKING and HISSING battery acid . I grabbed it and ran out of the house before it could explode and/or burn my house down . I tossed it in the yard just as it burst into flames . I ca n't believe this would happen to a product from Duracell . I 'll never trust chargers again , especially not this brand !
 I bought this set along with some more Duracell 2100 miha AA 's , and none of the new Duracell batteries keeps a charge even half as long as the Panasonic AA 's that I was replacing . My advice - only buy Panasonic rechargeables and chargers !
 I have the European version of this charger -LRB- different wall wart , same charger -RRB- . It has a tendency to slightly overheat the batteries at the end of the charge cycle , which may shorten their lifetime and cause a painful suprise if you try to remove them too soon after the charge is over.After about a year and a half of sporadic use , my unit failed . Unfortunately it decided to go out in a memorable way and fried a set of my batteries -- overheating them so much that the plastic foil melted from the batteries .
 This is NOT the same as the 2.5 oz dropper liquid that you administer in small amounts . This is a suspension syrup that requires a few teaspoons or more . If you are buying this thinking it is the bulk version of the dropper liquid , IT IS NOT THE SAME SUSPENSION and therefore is NOT a better value . I hope Amazon separates these 2 products as they are very different from one another .
 This melatonin works , but the taste is one of the worst that I 've had . They should have put more cinammon in it or something . It really needs a better flavor , but it works .
 This product has grain alcohol in it . When googling the ingredients that have the word alcohol in it , grain alcohol is listed . There is no measured or documented amount so who knows how much is in it .
 My son almost threw up when I gave this to him ! It smells and tastes like alcohol . I do n't know what I 'm going to do with the rest of the bottle ...
 When I ordered this product , it said it was in stock . It took 10 days to ship , instead of 3-5 like it said ! Turns out they were back-ordered . I repeatedly asked to cancel my order . I stated over and over through e-mails that I did not want , or need it anymore . My requests were ignored . Then , I finally get an e-mail telling me that my order was picked up , and they did not get my request to cancel before it was picked up . THIS IS FALSE . So now I am waiting on yet another e-mail from the compnay telling me how to return my product ... which finally arrived yesterday . Almost 3 weeks after I ordered .
 I have an Autistic 5 year old son that has problems sleeping at night on occasions . I bought the liquid melatonin because I ca n't get him to swallow a pill . I 've tried to crush the pills and mix it in his juice , but does n't like the gritty taste.I thought a liquid solution of melatonin would do the trick . However , the 2nd ingredient in this product -LRB- after water -RRB- is Ethyl Alcohol . I would not recommend giving this product to a child .
 THIS IS A SHAM - IT IS FULL OF ALCOHOL - IT WILL GET YOUR KIDS DRUNK !!! Get Mel-O-Drop here...Maxi-Health Research Mel-O-Drop Melatonin Liquid , 2 ozThis is what you want - it is ALCOHOL FREE - GOING TO SLEEP DRUNK & STUPID IS NO WAY TO GET A DEEP SLEEP - NOTICE THE OMISSION OF THE WORD ALCOHOL IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION - USE THE MEL-O-DROP it is safe for kids :-RRB- I use Mel-O-Drops and it works - Just remember more than three droppers is overkill - too much - let the melatonin work on your system for a few days ... peace
 The taste is awful , I gave it 2 stars because it works but there are better products that taste good and work the same .
 As with the other bottle , this item did not work as advertised for us . It also was not flavored . It was the same as the regular bottle . I was very disappointed with the outcome but had to try it at least just to see if what everyone else said would also help us .
 I use Melatonin to fall asleep at night . I normally go through a bottle a month . When I saw this 8 ounce bottle I thought I 'd found a great way to save money ... I was wrong . And that 's because Natrol significantly dilutes the Melatonin . Their recommended dose is 400 % larger than other packages because its mostly water . I found that dose was n't sufficient and it took about 5 sleepless nights to get the right dose , which is roughly 30 mL . Normally I need 2 mL.This company has made the worst kind of mistake ; they think their customers are stupid and mathematically challenged . They 'd make more money by making a superior product with better packaging . Instead , they 've made the worst kind of cynical decision
 Ethyl alcohol is the second ingredient on the bottle , and it tastes like you are drinking rubbing alcohol . There are better alternatives without needing to subject anyone to drinking this . This is a case where cost should not win out , especially if you are using for children -LRB- unless you are trying to build a high tolerance to alcohol intake at a young age -RRB- . Ugh .
 Unfortunately for me this product did not seem to have any affect whatsoever.I was really hoping this would help me fall asleep but it did not .
 I ordered this liquid Melatonin because it was suggested by someone else with a toddler who has difficulty winding down and going to bed at night . I was excited because she said it really did work ... however when I received the product and looked at this label I saw it contains ALCOHOL ... duh that would make any child sleep . Ever heard of people giving their kids Nyquil ... cough syrup , etc to make them sleep . I for one do not want to give alcohol in any form to my little girl , so the bottle went into the drawer for me or my husband to use ourselves if we ever have trouble sleeping . Beware because this did not show up on the description online . I do see that lots of parents that are using this and praising it highly , have children with conditions such as autism ... I am not judging them at all , it is hard enough dealing with a `` normal '' child who has trouble sleeping ... I can not imagine what they go through and God Bless anything that helps out even a little bit .
 Well I should have listened to my Mom and not give this to my baby . It is written not for kids younger than 12 years though . I read other parents comments and based myself on pediatrician advice but babies have tons of melatonin . This jus made her sleepy at night -LRB- with the same 2-3 wakings -RRB- , drowsy in the morning and nervous all the rest of the day !!
 never worked for me i 've had others that worked for me and the taste better than this one . this i wo n't be buying again .
 I have been orderingSleep Soundly Melatonin , 2-Ounce Bottles -LRB- Pack of 3 -RRB- but it always seems to be out of stock . I decided to give this one a try . I went to take some and my Husband told me that my daughter had spit it all over earlier . Well , I 'm not surprised . The 2nd ingredient after water is Ethyl alcohol , a preservative -LRB- as stated on the bottle -RRB- . It smelled strong and burned my nose . I gave it a shot anyway . My stomach is still burning , and it burned all the way down.The Sleep Soundly Melatonin -LRB- linked above -RRB- has an odd taste but it 's mild and definitely dose n't burn . Plus , you only take 2ml for 3.5 mg of Melatonin , instead of 2t of alcohol to get 2.5 ml of Melatonin with this product.Melatonin in general is wonderful . It has brought calm to our house with my Husband 's crazy work schedule my little ones are all mixed up . Our Pediatrician suggested melatonin and I have found that liquid works quickly and is easy to administer -LRB- no wondering if the chewable was completely consumed -RRB- .
 I took these pills with eating a meal first and everytime I had a headache after taking the pill . I threw up twice when taking them . Needless to say , I stopped taking them .
 I 've been using this product for years but recently my doctor told me that the quantities of each vitamin were too high . Please check with your doctor before you purchase this . The new thinking is not to take more then 100 % of each vitamin .
 Nowhere could I find a list of ingredients before buying online . Turns out it 's got megadoses of vitamins and minerals , with some doses actually being possibly toxic !!!!! Upset my stomach and upset me even more . This is not right - somewhere it should say that some doses are 500 % to 1,800 % of DV . Four are over 1,000 % !!!
 After reading the reviews on Amazon , I tried these Twinlab Daily One Caps Multi-Vitamin . It seemed like a reliable company and a good idea to take a capsule to help with absorption.I read some of the reviews from people who had bad reactions but I never had any problems before with any vitamin , but I had exactly the same negative experience as others ! The first time it happened , I thought maybe I needed to take this vitamin on a full stomach after breakfast . I switched to taking them with food and lots of water . It helped . The other day , I took one before breakfast and the exact , same experience happened again - intense sweating and throwing up . I have given up on them and switched to an old reliable , Centrum for Seniors . I also noticed intense yellow urine color after taking this vitamin in the morning . I felt like some of the ingredients were not being absorbed.Very disappointed .
 I was using Rainbow light multi vitamin for years , but due to health reasons , I need to avoid plant ingredients . So I switched to Daily One Caps . I took the capsule with my breakfast and 15 min later I was so nauseous . I tried it for a week , hoping my body would adjust ... but it made me sick to my stomach . I switched to Nature Made Multi -- no problems .
 What can I say about this product ? It makes me sick to my stomach . Every time I would take it , with a meal I would feel sick to my stomach . Not like unbearable nausea but definately made being at work a bother . A lot of the capsules had broken in the container as well . I would not recommend this product . I have taken similar daily multi vitamins and had a great feeling during the day with no negative side effects . Take at your own risk .
 Got these for my wife , who has crohn 's disease . She needs a multivitamin and these `` seemed '' perfect.After taking them for a week her crohn 's symptoms flared up and she had to stop taking them . We waited until she was back to normal , then tried again , just in case it was something else the previous time . Nope . She had problems once again.Then I decided that I would take them , to use them up . A multi-vitamin is good for everyone , right ? Ha . First time I took them , I took it with a glass of water . I was sick to my stomach for 30min afterwards . The time after I made sure to take one with a big breakfast . I was still sick to my stomach and almost lost my breakfast.So I threw these out and will never recommend or use them again .
 Used as described and they did n't work for me at all . I actually got more often sick while using them then not using anything at all . Went back to my regular brand of vitamins as these just do n't do it .
 I 'm not sure why , but these multivitamins made me extremely nauseated every time I took them , to the point where I actually vomited . I have no allergies that I know of .
 The bottle of Twinlab Daily One Caps Multi-Vitamin and Multi-Minerals without Iron that I received will expire before I can even consume them based upon the recommended dosage and expiration date which are both stated on the bottle . Selling a supposed health product that will expire before consumed -LRB- by the producers own recommendation -RRB- seems both reckless not to mention wasteful . The issue was brought to the attention of 911 Health Shop -LRB- the seller , not the manufacturer -RRB- and my comments were ignored .
 I had a c-section and as soon as the steri strips were removed after surgery I began using mederma . I used 3 tubes of the product over 2-3 months and I have a very thick red , raised scar . The surgeon performing the surgery is very skilled and the wound was closed properly . We both expected it to be barely noticeable in a few months . Mederma just did n't help to prevent hypertrophic scarring . I will use silicone sheets next time .
 I have been putting it acne scars and surgery scars but no improvement . In addition , when I put on my face , dried gel comes off as if my skin is peeling off which is ugly and I have to take it off right away . I should have stuck with Maderma lotion one , which worked better and no peeling off .
 It did not work at all ! In addition , I caused my allergy and even made my scars obvious.Expensive and waste of money .
 I had purschased this product before and was very happy with it . The first cream I got only had to be used once a day.This second tube was the same size and cost almost the same , but had to be used 3 or 4 times a day . I guess there was not enough information about second tube .
 I bought these to replace the worn insoles of my shearling-lined Ugg shoes . The Amazon page shows four colors , but I was offered only Sand or Chestnut . Since my shoes and inserts were black , I chose Chestnut . What I got was `` Sand '' , with a note that `` For insoles , Chestnut is the same as Sand '' . I disagree.However , the color was a minor point so I tried them anyway . The fleece does not go all the way to the edge of the insole and is lower quality than I have seen from `` name brand '' liners . It is not as fluffy and large pieces were loose as they came out of the package . The sizing seems to be a bit small as well.Comfort-wise , I 'd say they are also not up to par compared to the originals or name-brand replacements . My feet feel cold and clammy with them and I feel a bit unstable when walking , probably due to the smaller size . A noble experiment , but I am going to keep looking . Unfortunately , for those of us with larger feet -LRB- I ordered Men 's 14 -RRB- , the selection is limited .
 I received a mismatched pair of inserts . The left one is quite thick with fur while the right one is sparse and only about half as thick as the left one . Also , there is a thick seam of folded fur that sits right beneath your toes . It 's disappointing because if they were both like the left one and the seam was n't there they would otherwise be a nice pair of inserts . I washed them once and they held up well but I wo n't be using them .
 Every time I took a pill , I got a bad headache and wanted to go to sleep right away . For hours , I had to try hard to keep my eyes open and stay alert . My urine also became bright yellow after taking this . Those side effects are probably due to too large dosage of certain vitamins/minerals in the pill , the quality of which are possible not good either .
 At first I took one of these with my other supplements , and I threw up five minutes later . Several days later I took it in isolation , with food , and I also threw up five minutes later.Obviously this does n't happen for everybody . Hopefully it happened to me because of my body chemistry , rather than bad packaging that made my batch bad for anyone taking them . I 'm not going to have a friend take one to find out ... Before this I took the Kirkland Multivitamins with no problems .
 Unfortunately , I will not buy any vitamin online that does not have the ingredients and amounts -LRB- i.e. the back label -RRB- listed with the product . I 'm going with the Kirkland Multivitamin because a consumer has posted the ingredients.Thanks if anyone can post the ingredients for Twinlab .
 Just received this product yesterday . I had high hopes that I 'd be able to mix it in with things like coffee , tea , yogurt , etc. . Do n't even think about mixing it with tea . It makes it kind of thick & it tastes bad . Tried it this morning with yogurt . It was better than with the tea , but it 's not tasteless . I realize it says virtually tasteless on the container but it really does have a taste . It 's sort of vanilla like but not really . It 's hard to describe . It has a weird aftertaste too . It does n't mix in as easily as I would like either . It leaves lumps . I seriously doubt I 'll be able to finish the entire container . Too bad I just wasted $ 30 + . Will not be purchasing this ever again .
 This product appears to have awesome nutritional value , but I do n't know how people could say it 's completely tasteless ! I mixed it with skim milk and it tasted SO GROSS ! Enough to almost make me gag . I think it would be fine in some kind of food ... They are right about one thing though , it does smell really good . I guess that 's something lol .
 I had heard so many good things about this product ... `` Ca n't taste it . '' You ca n't . `` Lot 's of protein . '' Absolutely . `` Can put it in anything . '' NOT . The label says you can cook with it , mix it into soups , etc. etc. . Well , I 've been using protein powder as a supplement for decades and I 'm very disappointed . This powder clumps and sticks together worse than anything I 've ever used . It does work well in cold drinks if you mix it with a blender but even after mixing it with water and a blender before putting it in hot soups or oatmeal it clumps and froths sort of like cooked egg whites . So sorry I spent so much money on this stuff . I 'll put up with the vanilla flavoring from my other protein powder from now on !
 I recently had weight loss surgery and could n't stand the ready-to-drink protein shakes they wanted me to have , so I asked about protein powder to make my own drinks and they recommened whey protein . I bought Any Whey 's `` virtually tasteless '' powder and much to my disappointment found it does in fact have a strong aroma and taste . The first time I tried it I added it to juice and could n't stomach the stuff . I then tried milk , soup , yogurt and many others , but it always added a taste . When added to just water , I was able to pinpoint the flavor . It tastes like liquid graham crackers . I normally love graham crackers , but I do n't want everything I drink to be tainted the sweet taste . I 'm on to try the next `` tasteless '' powder to see if it is any better . Overall not worth the cost . If possible , order a small size to be sure you like the powder before buying a whole 2.7 pounds . My mistake !
 Unfortunately , they only show part of their label -LRB- very clever -RRB- . If you can find it in a store read the label and you will be amazed at the additional products they include which is why I canceled my order . There are other more natural forms of Milk Thistle out there in liquid and tablet/capsule form that are better and cheaper . Hope this review helps confirm not to order this product or brand .
 I use this because of liver issues . Since I have not had a subsequent liver ultrasound who knows if it is working or not .
 I have no frame of reference because this is my first , only , and last glutamine product . I 've been using this product now for some time and I 'm submitting an updated review . This product has not changed my workout at all , or given me more results beyond what I would have had without it.My biggest complaint is with the outrageous price . The picture shown must be the 1000 gram bottle , but by default the little drop down menu gives you the 300 gram bottle . 1000 grams of glutamine for $ 26 is a great deal , but not ludicrously cheap . Instead I was sent this tiny bottle -LRB- about the size of a multi-vitamin jar -RRB- of glutamine for my $ 26 dollars . At 5 grams a serving , and a CONSERVATIVE 2 servings a day -LRB- you will more likely do 3-4 if you are lifting seriously -RRB- you are talking about adding another dollar PER DAY to your supplement stack.I love ON , and I love their whey protein . However , the speculative and controversial benefits of glutamine are not worth this price -- I 'd say save your money for better quality food , more protein powder , or at least a cheaper brand of glutamine .
 I decided to try glutamine because of all the articles of people swearing by it and for $ 10 , I figured what the hell ! People claim that glutamine helps you recover faster and get less sore quicker and while I do know that 's true but , you get the same benefits from your protein powders . I noticed that I got less sore just as fast with supplemental glutamine than I did with just taking my recovery drink and protein powders , there was no difference . So while I know for a fact that glutamine is an important amino acid needed for muscle recovery ; if you 're taking a protein powder though you do n't need to supplement at all ! I 'm just glad I paid for the small bottle to test , will not be buying a supplement that I do n't need .
 After 3 1/2 months of use , my husband and I have seen no results with this product .
 I have taken this as directed for the past three months . I did not see any real differences in my weight.You can try it out if you like , but my recommendation is to try something else .
 I 'm 51 years old and have a hard time losing weight since I turned about 50 . I saw an add for Tonalin CLA in an aarp magazine and decided to try it . I am on my third bottle . It alone does not make you lose weight , you have to diet and exercise with it . Diet and exercise alone without it makes you lose weight , so why bother to take it ?? I did n't lose weight taking them . I joined weight watchers and am having success with that . I feel I wasted my money on the Tonalin .
 Working on my second bottle . Have n't seen any real results . The pills are too damn big for one thing but I thought by now , there would be some evidence this thing works . Do n't think I 'll buy this again .
 I was interested , and checked it out . Its scary bad if you have heart problems and any history of diabetes in your family . So look up what the researchers are saying .
 This is a proprietary blend of CLA so you ca n't really be sure how much Tonalin CLA you 're getting per capsule and how much of the other stuff -LRB- stearic acid , etc. -RRB- is in each pill .
 I purchased this after first seeing something on WebMD related to men possibly being overweight because of lack of CLA . -LRB- I 'm female - but thought it might apply to me too ! -RRB- I have been working losing weight , eating Primal/Paleo and before I started Tonalin I was losing weight . Then I started it - did n't change my good eating or exercise habits and gained a few pounds - but more importantly , felt like I was getting fatter ! I tried for 3 weeks and then stopped . Since I 've stopped , I 've started losing weight again . I 'm not saying it wo n't work for others . I am a firm believer in everyone having different body chemistries . It just did n't work for me .
 I took these for 4 weeks and saw absolutely no change in my abdomen . I might try again later after I modify my diet a bit .
 I first heard about Tonalin CLA on Dr.Oz that it would help to reduce belly fat etc. . The first bottle I ordered , I took it according to what was outlined on Dr.Oz . I did n't see any result at all after that bottle . Then I came back on Amazon and read some of the reviews here as I wanted to know if others were experiencing good results . After reading the good reviews , I decided to try it again , this time ordering 2 bottles and took exactly according to the directions on the bottle . Well , the last bottle is almost empty and still no result . I have not lost one ounce . My stomach does not look any flatter . I wanted to speed up the process of losing an extra 8-10 pounds and since most of the unwanted fat is concentrated in my stomach area , I thought this would work along with the fact that I exercise 4-5 days per week for at least 2 hours a day . I did not want to go on a drastic diet because that is not healthy . NO RESULT from this product so I will just keep up my exercise , eat right and look around for something else as I concluded that this is was a waste of money .
 Save your money on this one . It does n't work . My friend and I bought one bottle to share , because we are sick of buying product that does n't work , and yes , this one is another miss .
 I have never had an allergic reaction to a product before , but every time I took this I got a very itchy rash and hives on either my palms or feet . After a total of four doses -LRB- three caps/day as indicated on the bottle -RRB- , I was having trouble breathing and a racing heart . I took a benadryl and it did n't progress further . I cautiously tried it again a few days later , one dose , itching and hives , took another antihistamine and that relieved the symptoms . I 've taken lots of supplements and this has NEVER happened . Please be cautious ! I was trying this based on the recent research about CLA and Crohns disease . Customer service at Natrol was helpful but there are no ingredients I have n't had before , so it 's a mystery , unless I 'm allergic to synthetic CLA itself . I just want people to be aware this could happen .
 I have been taking Tonalin for a few weeks , 6 pills a day , and have seen no results . How long does it take to see even the slightest benefit ? Needless to say , I am a bit disappointed , and if I finish the bottle , and still see nothing , I will not be buying again .
 CLA came pretty highly recommended by fellow dieters on a support forum , and after only 7-10days I could see some mild results . However , after the entire bottle was gone , those initial results now seem paltry in comparison to the rave reviews CLA has garnered -LRB- to the point I now question whether it was CLA as much as the change in diet & increased exercise -RRB- . This may be one of those ` works for some , not for others ' type things , so all I can say is if you 're REALLY wanting to try it , then the $ 12 price tag is n't too bad at all for the amount you get -LRB- avg out to 30day supply @ 3 caps a day -RRB- .
 This product is misleading , it does not contain 1200 mg of CLA.It 's a proprietary blend oils , so we do not know how muchCLA it contains . GNC had a better version .
 I bought this product hoping it would improve my running performance and after using it for 4 months , there has been no change . My 1600 and 3200 times have remained the same and my 5k time has actually gotten worse . I do n't know if there are any objective , measurable benefits to be had by taking this product . It seems that the placebo effect is all it has to offer.In short , I wish I had n't wasted my money buying this .
 As a cancer survivor who has had hormone therapy , I have no testosterone in my body , thus no energy . Endurox enables me to have all the energy I need to ride my recumbent bike , do extreme exercises , etc. .
 To set the stage , I am a huge fan on Pacific Health Labs / Endurox products . I have used and continue to use Accelerade , Endurox R4 , Accel gel , all with success.I bought 60 days worth of this supplement and have been taking them for about two weeks during my tri training . I have yet to notice any change in performance as suggested by the package . I have n't witnessed any noticeable improvement in performance during workouts or post workout recovery . If anything changes I will update this review but at this point I will not be re-ordering this product but plan to stick with the other Pacific Health lineup . My advice is to use Accelerade , gel and R4 instead of Endurox Excel .
 Purchased for use in home herbal mix as an alternative to purchasing pricier mixes . Not as clean as I expected -- found stems and other &#34; hard &#34; stuff . Lots of powder in the bottom of the container . Disappointed in the quality . Most of my money was apparently spent on packaging .
 The cream does it 's job well , it 's moistureisez my dry skin , but do not expect any wrinkle disappearance miracle . As long as you are not planning to go outside or into the warm room it 's good . It laves some film in the face and even if you do not perspire at all your face will be a little sweaty . It is not too bad as other creams though . Smell is ok , not roses but it is not stinky.Recently I noticed that i have headache all night long if I use this cream in the evening . I tried not to use it - no headache . Applied it again - all night long I was having a headache . I did some research and ONE of the side effects of pycnogenol is a headache . There are few other side effects the DermaE never mentioned on the product package . More information on the pycnogenol is here
 I bought this product because I had a credit from Derm-E I had placed a previous order , instead of sending me facial moisturizer they sent me body lotion . I tried to return it , but they would only agree to give me a merchandise credit . That made me mad . I placed the order directly through Derma-E , buying it through Amazon would probably have been better.Sice I had a `` hostile '' credit , I decided it would be better to redeem the credit and get something rather than having nothing and Derma-E having my money . I have sensitive skin , and they told me that the pycnogenol cream was their only facial moisturizer for sensitive skin . It did n't work for me at all.I do n't like their business practices either.Get `` Dermarest '' you 'll be happy and spend less money
 I have allergic to cold and this winter my eyes were itching very badly . I prefer natural remedies and bought this . I would take it as suggested . The itching did n't stop . This just did n't work . maybe it is too weak . Now , I take benadril and the itching stops for the whole day .
 I have seasonal allergies . hayfever , etc. . The symptoms are runny nose , red and itching eyey , sneezing , etc.This product is represented to aleviate these symptoms , but it does n't . I tried it for several days and then went with the drug store standards .
 I tried chaser 3 times -LRB- just to make sure it wasnt my fault or an error -RRB- and it didnt work any of the three times . I decided to try 2 other products that I got samples of at a local bar , one was called xxx3 and the other was called Beer Neutralizer . They both worked , but I liked the beer neutralizer better becuase it prevented the hangover and it also has a carb blocker in it so I can drink regular beer instead of lite beers .
 Puchased this because the website stated rhat it was good for oily skin but it did n't help and it made my skin feel sticky .
 The product did not perform according to the listed Vitamin C , E and A ; no difference in skin appearance nor feel .
 Product feels cool upon application , yet there is a lingering and annoying stickiness . I could overlook this if I thought Derma e 's Pycnogenol Gel was an excellent product , even mediocre , but no . The bottom line is this , there must be more research done into Pycnogenol before you claim it was the next natural beauty revival product . Maybe it was just my experience but this ingredient did my skin no favors , I ended up with discolorations , dead and dull looking skin . Kinda how the tree probably looks that this ingredient was extracted from . I am a man so I kinda liked the idea of using tree bark extract to make my skin look better but it just does n't work out well . Please scrap this whole product line Derma e. Everything else is excellent though .
 I was hoping that it will work for spider veins on legs , but I guess the formulation is designed for very tiny facial spider veins .
 I tried a few times and wasted lots of milk . It only partially worked . It was always very thin and did not set . I will not buy this product again .
 I have used other starters and I have a yogurt maker . I tried this product twice and the yogurt never thickened . There was a yogurt taste but it was thin like a yogurt drink . I will not buy this product again . I like Euro Cuisine or the Greek Yogurt starter , both work well .
 It 's a shame that this listing does n't say this , but the bottle does
 Waste of money . I do n't recommend taking 3 pills before bedtime like the directions say , you wo n't be able to fall asleep.That 's really all it does . It wires you up a little . You 'd be better off taking a vitamin supplement .
 The product never came in the mail . Customer service was not helpful . If you choose to purchase this product , consider another store other than AllStarHealth.com
 did not help me to lose weight or curb my appetite . Good-tasting mint though .
 I thought I was getting the Bona brand mop head . I have a Bona dust mop and it cleans the floors of almost every particle of dust and lint.This mop head does OK but not as good as the Bona fiber . I 'm disappointed .
 I have very soft fingernails and was hoping this product would help in strengthening them . that did n't happen . in fact my nail began to peel constantly . i used about 75 % of the supplement before quiting a throwing the rest away . did not work for me , in fact made my nail condition worse
 I have not noticed any changes in my hair . I can not give a honest comment . I have used it for the last 60 days . Will use until all gone .
 I started horsetail a few days ago for maintaining healthy hair but quickly found out that this is a product to be avoided at all costs . Personally I am allergic to this product but I did not know about the rest of the side effects . This product belongs in the garbage.Equisetum arvense , known as horsetail , is a weed used traditionally in Europe as a diuretic for treating fluid retention , or edema . People also take horsetail supplements to prevent or treat osteoporosis because it contains silicon , which helps strengthen bone . Additional purported uses are treating kidney stones and urinary tract inflammation and as a topical solution for healing wounds . The National Institutes of Health , or NIH , explains that most of these uses are based on anecdotal rather than scientific evidence . Several side effects are linked to use of horsetail.NICOTINE OVERDOSE : Horsetail contains traces of nicotine . If you are using nicotine replacement patches or chewing gum , the University of Maryland Medical Center cautions not to take horsetail supplements , as the combination may result in nicotine overdose . Large doses of horsetail can cause problems with excessive nicotine intake as well ; the NIH says horsetail should not be given to children . Symptoms of nicotine overdose may include fever , cold hands and feet , irregular heart rhythm , problems walking and muscle weakness . The nicotine in horsetail also may lead to seborrheic dermatitis , an inflammatory skin condition.LOW THIAMINE : Horsetail can cause a drop in levels of vitamin B1 , or thiamine . Chronic low thiamine levels can lead to permanent damage to the brain and nervous system , according to the NIH , with symptoms of confusion , memory loss , trouble walking and problems with vision and eye movement . The NIH recommends that people taking horsetail on a regular basis also take a daily multivitamin or a B-complex vitamin . Additionally , anyone taking horsetail should not drink alcohol regularly , as that is also associated with low thiamine levels.HYPOKALEMIA : Horsetail also can cause low levels of potassium , or hypokalemia . This may lead to muscle weakness and an irregular heart rate . If you have heart arrhythmia or are taking the heart medication digoxin , you should not take horsetail , according to the University of Maryland Medical Center , or UMMC . Additionally , taking diuretics along with horsetail can cause problems , because those medications increase the risk of dehydration and potassium depletion.ALLERGIC REACTION : As with any herbal remedy , some people may experience an allergic reaction to horsetail . Signs as listed by PDR Health include breathing difficulties , tightness in the throat or chest , chest pain , itchy or swollen skin , and a skin rash or hives . An allergic reaction to horsetail should be considered a medical emergency.TOXICITY : Another type of horsetail , Equisetum palustre , can cause poisonous effects . Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not regulate herbal supplements the way it does drugs , the UMMC advises only buying horsetail remedies from established , reputable manufacturers using standardized extracts to avoid the possibility of contamination with Equisetum palustre
 The product that was shown on the web page is NOT what actually arrives in the mail . The product that was mailed to me contained only one ingredient , while an actual product label and the web page description show that there should be about ten ingredients . I 'd call this false advertising .
 We thought we were receiving the green swabs with texture but only received the pink onces . Was not happy and could not return this order .
 My 8 year old daughter got head lice . `` No problem '' I thought . I 'll just go get some medicine to kill the lice and game over . After using this product exactly as described , twice , we discovered that her head lice are completely resistant , finding live lice every time we looked . Frustrated , I then started looking online and found that many lice in the US are resistant to the active ingredient in Nix and other over the counter `` pediculocides '' . The prescription strength medicines -LRB- Kwell , etc. -RRB- are potent neuro-toxins and I am not ready to coat my child 's scalp for hours in something that is known to cause seizures , paralysis , and death . We have now resorted to combing daily with a nit comb , hoping to get rid of the lice by attrition , and olive oilIt probably makes sense to try Nix once because it would surely be nice to have a one shot method to get rid of lice , but check carefully the next day for live lice since you probably wo n't be so lucky . If you find them , give up on the chemicals and start researching alternative ways -LRB- olive oil , etc -RRB- . And invest in a good , metal nit comb that you can boil to sanitize in between combings or between children . You 'll be needing it ... alot .
 There 's been a run on lice treatment in Wal-Mart so I only managed to get a couple of boxes of Nix as recommended by the pharmasist . The rest of the family had to make do with the Equate store brand.Despite carefully following all the Nix instructions there were still loads of live lice in the hair immediately after treatment . The store brand -LRB- much cheaper with more active ingredients -RRB- worked great and those heads were still nit free a week later.Treating a whole family for lice is very expensive so pick something that is going to work first time , and that is not Nix . Then comb , comb , comb and comb again , daily for at least 10 days .
 Yesterday , per our doctors recommendation , I used the Nix one treatment product on my 2 kids , husband and self for what I was told was a very mild case of lice infestation . I read the directions several times and followed them to the letter . Used baby shampoo to wash everyone 's hair , applied Nix to damp hair , rinsed Nix out after exactly 10 minutes , dried with clean towels , used individual nit combs and everyone put clean clothes on . We each wore clean shower caps after the treatment and spent hours washing and vacumming the house . This morning I showered and just wet my hair . Just before lunch I felt something move in my hair , I checked the kids and actually saw several ADULT lice . I think this stuff actually helped them multiply and mature ! Completely disappointed with the Nix product , $ 60 for 3 family packs down the drain.We are in the process of trying the Nuvo technique - cetaphil dried on the hair for 8 hours to smother the lice . Crossing my fingers this will work and cleaning the house again ...
 This lip balm is labeled as `` Coffee Roast '' but smells nothing like coffee and has no scent of coffee , either . Not much of a pleasant taste at all , just sort of cocoa butter , and slightly gooey in feel . Not impressed at all , but may be good for your lips . * shrug * Just do n't expect it to actually be what it advertises as to fragrance or taste . Not worth the extra cost for a very bland product .
 This is for GAINING weight , so make sure you dont misread or misunderstand what this product says , its not for losing weight .
 Disposable Bed Sheets is what I ordered , according to the picture on the website . Instead I got Sheet , Bed Tissue.After 3rd decreeing me , I was sent the RA in order to return my erroneous Bed Sheets , without much delay . So far , that 's all I can say . I wait to see how long it will take to credit my account .
 I was disappointed when this bottle arrived to find that the active ingredients are NSAID , commonly available , rather than `` old fashioned '' aspirin , acetysaliicylic acid .
 The tooth brush is different from what is shown in the pic . not a good buy .
 Not ONE trojan in the `` variety pack '' Just a bunch of no name brands , and 2 durex , whoopie!Very misleading . Get your protection somewhere else.Shipping took well over a week .
 The condoms I received were not of the same variety described or depicted . What initially seemed like a good value was instead a waste of money on use , ess , sup-par condoms .
 thy were great but the shipping was slow they said it would be here the 30th and its not here yet
 I spent $ 65 to buy the Samsung Cartridge . It turned out this is a rebuilt Samsung Cartridge . The box is a real Samsung box . But the cartridge was a rebuilt Samsung cartridge . I sure can get a rebuilt Samsung cartridge for about $ 30 . This is a misleading product . Be careful !
 This product was not what they said it was . The product I thought I was purchasing was an actual Samsung toner cartridge . It did not say `` compatible toner cartridge '' . Right on the box that they shipped it says compatible toner cartridge . What they said I was getting is not what I got . I wo n't ever purchase from them again .
 This factory-original cartridge was a real letdown -- it cost almost as much as the ML-2510 printer , and then it proved to be defective from the factory . The vendor did refund my money , but they made me pay the cost to ship the bad product to them and the whole episode convinced me that although the factory toners are usually about twice as expensive as the aftermarket `` compatible '' units , they are n't necessarily any better.When I installed the cart in my Samsung , the printer reported that it as a nearly empty demo-size cartridge , even though it was supposed to be a new , high-capacity version . I telephoned Samsung , and after having me run some diagnostics , they told me to take the printer and cartridge to a factory warranty station about 30 miles from my house . I did , and after a week they called and said they had fixed it -- the cartridge had a defective sensor and the printer was fine . The warranty station replaced the bad cartridge with a cheap aftermarket cartridge and charged me $ 60 for it . There was no charge for the warranty service call -LRB- Samsung paid for it -RRB- but I was out the $ 60 plus the cost of driving 120 miles plus about five hours of my time and the cost to return the bad cartridge to the Amazon 's vendor .
 I am very dissatisfied with this toner purchase . The toner lasted for about a week before it started spreading toner all over the roller bar and all over everything that is being rinted . I opened the 2nd toner , as I had purchaseed two and there was toner already on the roller bar . I returned both and will not be purchasing a compatible toner cartridge for my printer again . I contacted Amazon and they were very helpful in getting the toners returned and a credit back to my credit card .
 This is not a brand new cartridge . It shows up in what looks like a new box but has been opened and reglued from the bottom . The cartridge inside is a re-manufacutered unit , NOT new . TIGERSUPPLIES is ripping customers off !! I lost $ 20 with shipping as my shipping cost where not refunded and my shipping cost to return the item was not covered .
 This is a ripoff ... the price is exceedingly high , especially for one that is n't even made by Samsung . If you 're looking for a cheap alternative to buying an authentic Samsung cartridge -LRB- around $ 120 -RRB- , I would suggest this : Laser Tek Services Toner Refill Kit 3 Pack Compatible with Samsung ML 2010 ML-2510 ML2010D3 Dell 1100Only $ 25 for three refills that last a long time !
 The Samsung toners were not in the retail boxes as stated in the ad . They were simply wrapped in bubble wrap with no boxes . I talked to Samsung representative and was told that if not in specially sealed boxes , no guarantee that they were not simply re-loaded toners . I let amazon.com know and the dealer . I called and e-mailed the dealer to get a return authorization for the toners , but have never received any type of response from GREEN CARTRIDGE TECHNOLOGY LLC , 9009 CANOGA AVE STE B , CANOGA PARK , CA 91304-1540 . It has now been four weeks since receipt and the time for return has passed . Very unprofessional for a company to ignore customers . I own a business and would NEVER treat my customers so poorly . I will never order from GREEN CARTRIDGE TECHNOLOGY LLC again.Afraid to use the toners because tampering could have occurred . Out $ 100 . Also , amazon informed me that they would follow up on my request for return authorization and they never did .
 This is advertised as a Samsung ML-2010D OEM toner cartridge . OEM means manufactured by the original manufacture . It does not say `` compatible '' in the advertisement.This was offered by Unbeatable Sales Inc. -LRB- not Amazon -RRB- It is in reality a LD-2010UNIV . I brought 2 and could of saved $ 25 by buying it elsewhere IF I WANTED a `` compatible '' cartridge . I 've had bad luck in the past with non-OEM cartidges and chose this because it was a good price for the Samsung cartridge.BUYER BEWARE of UNBEATABLESALE
 This product took almost 2 weeks to get delivered even though it was listed as being `` IN STOCK '' . The savings was not enough to make it worth while . I do not recommend you purchase this product . Just go to your local office supply store and pick one up !
 I used this several years back for head lice and found it completely useless . The only product that actually worked was Kwell Shampoo , prescribed by my doctor . That worked amazingly well .
 Jury 's out on this product . My biggest quibble is that it is sooo expensive online when you factor in shipping . However it may not be less expensive than in the grocery store so you 'll just have to see how it stacks up in your area . 4 oz does n't go very far .
 I ordered RID for my daughter through here and I got a cheap generic brand that did not work and leaked in the box it was delivered in and now I have to go to a drug store to get the real thing !
 I 'm 18 years old and sometimes have breakouts . I had one that was really bad , so I bought this tea tree oil in hopes of eliminating it or atleast helping it a bit . This product is AWFUL ! Never again will I look at amazon reviews ; I will instead google what dermatologists think about certain products . This product made me break out so much worse and I wo n't use it again .
 I 'm not usually paranoid but I was very surprised to find out how many health professionals I spoke with were adamant against using talc based powders . The fine particles go deep into the lungs of you and the child . I 'm not sure I am 100 % that it 's similar to asbestos in possible harm but it 's enough to make me throw it away and go back to messy creams . I 've heard that corn starch is better as the granules are larger .
 shipping delivery great ! Not impressed with the product .
 I bought this product on the recommendation from someone else who liked it.I have arthritis in my knees and lower back . I put some of it on my back and legs and smelled like a mountain goat.It does n't relieve the pain , but gives a temporary sensation of heat . I would not recommend it for arthritis , but maybe it would help with sprains etc. if you can get over the medicinee smell .
 Totally agree with Jeanette.The warming sensation just temporarily disguises the pain and only for a short time.Very strong smell , also .
 It 's pretty much just Icy Hot in a spray bottle which I 've never found to do much for me other than make me smell menthol fresh . It does dry without leaving a greasy residue .
 This product states it `` Stays Longer ! than ordinary corn cushions '' Well , not sure how long the ordinary cushions stay on , but this brand wo n't even stick . Pointless product ! Going back to the store to try something different .
 I like it for the ingredients compared to other protein powders
 I will say that the protein shake tastes good but upon inspection one notices that the supposed protein from grass-fed cows is not from grass-fed cows after all . The package does not mention a thing about it , and if it was from grass-fed cows , rest assurred they would mention it just like a car mentions when it gets high gas mileage.Then , it tells you how `` superior '' the product is , but it really is n't ! It claims the cows are not given the hormone rBGH , but Jay Robb weasels out of this one by putting a disclaimer on this and stating that at times there are not enough rBGH milk supplies available and they 've to use US supplies -- translation US milk from cows filled with artificial steroids.Amazingly , Chobani yogurt , which is in virtually every supermarket in the US , is able to get enough steroid-free milk for its yogurt but little Jay Robb can not get enough for its company . Jay Robb is not even one of the leading producers of protein , much less a major player in the milk market . Basically the only `` cow '' product we get from this company is a lot of bull . I would venture to say that Chobani uses more milk in one day than Jay Robb uses in a whole year.Then on the company 's Website is more bull . They state that they can not use organic because there are not enough supplies available . Seriously ? Organic Valley and Horizon have organic milk in virtually every supermarket throughout the US , but surprisingly Jay Robb can not find enough supplies . Just how big does Jay Robb think his company is ? Again this is more lies from the company ... certainly there is enough organic milk out there but again the compnay is too cheap to cough up the bucks to use it.So what you are getting with the product is an insanely overpriced protein that may or may not be rBGH steroid-free and certainly Jay Robb does not say that his product is free from all artificial hormones -- which one should get at these ridiculously high prices for protein . Apparently , the product is not from grass-fed cows either -- another falsehood listed on the Amazon ad for Jay Robb Whey Protein . Finally , the product is shpped in the new tuna fish packaging , I 'm sure it 's done this way to cut corners for the company so they could pay less in shipping than having a nice container which would be easier to open and close , and would be convenient for customers.Fortunately , there are good alternatives out there like Biochem , Resveratage , Jarrow , Solgar , etc. . Companies that actually deliver what Jay Robb claims to deliver and they do n't try to weasel out of their claims -- unlike Jay Robb 's products . There is also soy lecithin in this product which is a known allergen and better products avoid it . Bascially , with Jay Robb 's products you are paying for a Lexus and getting a Chevy , but then again what would we expect from a guy whose last name is Robb !
 There are just too many pills that have to be taken for a good dose of wheat grass . I 'm not a pill phobe but I just ca n't take 14 plus of these pills a day . What I ended up doing was using my Ninja blender to make a powder out of the pills . Now I add them to my smoothies . Great alternative !
 How would I ever know a vitamin is or is n't working short of performing extensive scientific testing . My basis thus is limited . I do n't feel any differently taking these vs regular vitamins.My major problem is that the instructions are to take 21 tablets a day . Seriously ? 21 pills a day ? There is no way I am spending my time taking 21 pills of anything a day unless they are the only thing keeping me alive.So for practical purposes I would n't buy them again .
 I had jock itch that lasted for 5 months and I used lotramin ultra and many more over the counter treatments during that span . Lotramin Ultra did a great job of keeping the rash under control but it NEVER came close to curing it . After 5 months I stumbled upon Boudreaux 's Butt Paste , a baby rash treatment which some claimed to be a miracle cure for Jock Itch and other skin conditions and MAN were they right . The stuff works by not letting any moisture get to the rash and it will literally disappear and 2 or 3 days of heavy use . I was going insane so I want everyone in the same position as I was to know how to treat jock itch . Even though Boudreaux 's is the best thing I have found , the rash seems to come back if I stop using it . Still seeking a cure .
 He is trying to mislead customer to commit to buy with faulty picture -LRB- 2packs -RRB- I asked him for 2pack but he changed his picture instead of answering my mail .
 i used it to see if it would get rid of a dry skin spot and it did not help .
 The stitching on the small finger of the left glove was so far off it was unwearable . These were supposed to be size large but they barely fit my not so big hands . I 'm right handed and thus my right hand is a bit bigger then my left but , it was the left glove whose stitching was off enough to the seam ran along the top of my small finger and ground into my hand . I tried to `` break in '' the glove a bit but the skin wore out before the glove broke in .
 I bought this pack of 86 heavy duty scour pads , only to find out that it 's a pack of 12 `` model 86 '' scour pads . Very confusing label ... if you read the small print it 's clear , but definitely not what I expected .

 This product does not have a good taste at all . It did not mix well either as it claims to do
 In the past , I have purchased this same exact protein about a dozen times from a health food store . This time , I decided to purchase via Amazon.com . The first problem is I received this protein in a bag and not like the container you see in the picture . Secondly , when I mixed this protein with fresh bottled water , it tasted a lot different.I decided to smell the drink and it smelled like spoiled milk so I threw the entire bag away . I did notice how the protein in this bag was different from the way it normally looks . When I have purchased this product in the past , it was sold in the container -LRB- like pictured -RRB- . The protein was also very fine -LRB- granulated -RRB- . When I purchased this protein via Amazon from this vendor , the protein appeared to be caked together and looked like flour.Would NOT recommend purchasing this product from this vendor . If the product comes in a bag , advertise the protein in the exact container it will be shipped in .
 I 've purchased and tried a lot of protein powders over the years . This past year , I 've been trying to educate myself more on the ingredients and purchasing only those protein powders/shakes that are closer to being `` all-natural '' . I thought the Jay Robb product was a winner . I purchased the vanilla whey protein , mixed it with skim milk and a scoop of peanut butter . It tasted fine but man it was death to my stomach . I thought perhaps it was something else that I ate and stuck with it for the next few days varying my diet but to no avail , the bathroom issues kept reoccurring . So I stopped the protein powdeer and went to the Jay Robb protein bars and same result . When I stopped eating all of Jay Robb 's products , bathroom issues cleared up . Coincidence ??? I was also a bit disappointed when I opened the container and only half of it was filled with powder . Not cool .
 The bitter aftertaste of the Stevia made this undrinkable for me . I think it should be added to the description . I 'm giving it away to someone who can stand that stuff .
 This tastes like metal or rubber or plastic to me . Very bad unnatural aftertaste . I 'll be trying something different . Very disappointed after so many people said it tastes good . Maybe you need to blend it with a thousand things to overcome the aftertaste ?
 I know taste is subjective . What tastes terrible to me might be great to you . But I found this shake to have a terrible aftertaste that I 've never experienced with any other protein powder I 've used during the six or eight years I 've used protein powders.I know it is supposed to be made of high quality ingredients . I do n't know how much arsenic and other heavy metal might be in it as it was not one tested by Consumer Reports . Moreover , there is -LRB- as of this writing -RRB- nothing on their site about it and they do n't seem to have a contact number readily available . - Susanna K. Hutcheson

 I have never tried a protein powder that tasted so disgusting . I will NEVER EVER buy this product again . EWW !
 way overpriced , the gold standard or ON by optimum nutrition is a great deal , but this Jay Robb protein does n't work , i did n't even use it ,
 I have had this walker for almost one year . The size , appearance , and the under seat bag are excellent but the most important thing to me is safety and the brakes are constantly needing adjusting . I have had to replace both brake cables numerous times . Also when I called the company they were less than helpful - they told me to send the walker to them to repair !! I would not purchase this item again and I would not recommend it either .

 I love his strawberry , chocolate and pina colada protein supplements . They are delicious ! But this tropical dreamsicle stuff is awful ! I bought a small container of it and had to get rid of it . The taste is soooooooo strong ! It 's way too tart and I just could not drink it , even if I mixed it with strawberry.If you buy this , buy a very small amount of it first . Make sure you like it before you buy more . If you 're like me , you 'll hate this flavor .
 The shake is kind of watery and kind of salty and generally pretty disgusting to drink . I will stick to Spiru-tein .
 I purchased this rarely-used item almost one year ago from Amazon as quick-charger for my ever growing need for AA batteries to power my cameras and other electronic equipment -LRB- I am a professional photographer/videographer -RRB- . However , after spending a bundle , I 've been very dissatisfied with it despite reading the glowing reviews on Amazon.com . Firstly , the price . It cost way too much -LRB- $ 65.00 for a battery charger ! -RRB- . Additionally , it seemed to never fully charge my brand new Sanyo eneloop batteries . So , I got used to spending even more to carry around back-up lithium batteries because my `` charged '' batteries would always somehow prematurely wear out . There is a third and a very seriously flaw with this charger . While recently charging up batteries for an event , I heard a loud `` pop '' coming from the charger and next , there was the smell of burning wires . I quickly unplugged the charger as it was too hot to handle . Evidently , the charger shorted out . A very dangerous situation , needless to say . I was very thankful the unit did not cause a fire ! Stay away from this charger - even if this is the case of a `` few bad apples '' -LRB- which would indicate a quality control issue-a growing consumer concern , especially with imported products -RRB- . Surely , this charger is not worth the risk of a hazardous fire . Because of these issues , I would give it * zero * stars if I could .
 This charger has lots of nice features but I do n't trust it in terms of safety . I bought this model a few years back from another distributor and it actually caught on fire . I sent it to the manufacturer for warranty replacement , and the one they sent me caught on fire as well . Sent that one back and the third one did n't catch on fire , but I did detect that unmistakable odor of burning plastic . So finally I sent it back for a full refund . I am currently using a different charger from the same company -LRB- the MH C-9000 -RRB- and it works wonderfully . It simply appears that the MH-C808M charger is not one of Maha 's better models . My advice , do n't buy this charger .
 I thought this was a top of the line charger when I got it . I 've had it replaced twice by the manufacturer . The first one started smoking . The second had one charging port that would n't work at all . I kept the third one and use it to soft charge AA batteries only when I 'm around . There 's no way I 'd leave this thing unattended for the hours that reconditioning cycles require . I just tried a soft reconditioning of some AA batteries , and the unit keeps getting frozen in the discharge phase . I 've let it sit overnight with no change . Even when I remove the batteries , the display stays frozen until I unplug the unit.I have always loaded the batteries with the correct polarity , in the correct order -LRB- highest capacity > lowest capacity -RRB- , and always on a hard countertop with plenty of air circulation.I just got a MH-C9000 from the same manufacturer , and so far it 's working great . I may get another and dump the MH-C808M . This is not worth the fire risk .
 1 -RRB- This product needed a better manual .2 -RRB- It 'd be nice if the product had the basic info printed on it . That would explain what various actions mean - or even how to put it in soft charge mode . Some extra buttons would be nice too . -LRB- ie
 I 've had this charger for a long time and it 's been flakey from the start but not enough to notice . It did n't ever seem to do as good a job of fully charging my batteries as my cheap charger but I was n't too bothered until recently when I ca n't even get batteries to hold a charge from this POS . What 's worse is there 's no indication that there 's a problem , it just shows `` done '' as always . I put batteries into my camera from this thing and they did n't last 10 seconds . I 've tried many different nimh batteries and they all do the same . I wanted to love this charger and I thought it 'd be the last charger I 'd ever need but I was so very very wrong.Bottom line
 ran fine for a year , started acting flakey , display stopped working , and then it cooked it 's self , and four d cells
 Charger works great - but over a 20 minute time the display fades away and you have guess what the status is .
 I must have a sort of bad unit - not great !! but not the one to toast marshmallows with either.As others have mentioned this charger is very flexible in that it can charge AAA , AA , C and D batteries in any combination . But IMO for the price it should also charge 9 volt batteries.The interface is terrible ! After inserting a battery you need to press slow within seconds in order to activate slow charging . If you miss the window you have to remove the battery , wait and try again . It takes me about 8 attempts and pressing * really * hard to activate the slow cycle . I have gotten to the point where I no longer even try to use the slow charge . The condition light remains on all the time even though the condition cycle is not activated . Discharge symbology will be displayed when a battery is charging.Yes I did RTFM.Too bad the problems started after the warranty expired - naturally!Because of the flexibility of this charger and the MaHa reputation I am willing to give MaHa another chance.I would recommend this charger . But definitely hold on to the warranty information .
 I bought this a few years ago . It worked fine for the most part . I leave my AA and AAA batteries on the charger and let it tend to them . Well . . one Saturday I was at home and I heard a very loud `` BANG '' ... went to the kitchen where the charger was and I saw that there was a black burnt mark on one of the battery terminals . I found pieces of a rechargeable in a few places on the floor . It must have overcharged the battery causing it to blow up.Kind of scary . Glad I was n't near it when it went off . Needless to say , I trashed it and got a different one .
 I had been using this charger -LRB- uneventfully but with some annoyance -RRB- for about six months when this afternoon , it malfunctioned and nearly caught fire . I heard a strange sound from the other room ; upon investigation I realized that all eight batteries in the charger were bulging , sizzling , and smoking . Since it happened to all eight , I have to assume this was a charger problem , not a defective battery -LRB- I had used the batteries frequently for months -RRB- . The charger was too hot to handle with bare hands . I 'll be replacing it with some other brand.On the subject of using the charger pre-meltdown
 After warranty expired , 6 of the 8 AA slots do n't work while all the AAA still work . I 've been charging only PowerEx IMedion 2100 mAh AA and 800 mAh AA batteries . The company offered to replace with a 25 % discount , but that brings the replacement price down to $ 82.46 . I expected more quality for this lightly used charger , so I could n't recommend this model to others .
 I am 13 days outside of the whopping one month return window -LRB- if I 'd known that I would n't have spent almost $ 100 of my hard earned money on this piece of junk -RRB- and FIVE of the size D battery ports has already stopped working ! I only used this charger about 5 times total ! I purchased this almost $ 100 charger so I could charge 8 D cells at a time and now , guess what ? I have to wait a bare minimum of 15 hours now -LRB- three complete fast cycles which fast cycle is bad for the batteries I might add -RRB- in order to charge enough 8 D cell batteries to run a decent sized fan ??? I am hugely displeased . What a ripoff . A company with three B 's in its name is slowly springing to mind here ...
 We purchased this charger almost 2 years ago . We have had no problems with it - charged our Tenergy batteries with no issues . We did not use this charger daily - maybe once every 2 weeks . That being said , we tried to charge our C batteries yesterday and it was n't working properly . It had been unplugged , so I left it plugged in thinking it might need to cycle to start up . About 20 minutes later , our nanny said there was a strong burning odor in our laundry room , and sure enough it was the charger.Excellent product for the time we had it , but for the price I would expect it to last much longer . With that and the fire hazard it posed , we will not purchase this product again .
 I bought the Pink Camouflage Peanut Hair Clipper Trimmer as a gift for someone close to me who makes there money by cutting hair . I bought it then got a email saying that the product was shipped and on its way to my friends house who I bought it for , I waited and the ship dates passed by and I never received the product . So after a weeks I finally filed a claim and and was reimbursed the money , -LRB- WONDERING IF THE CLIPPERS WERE EVER SHIPPED IN THE FIRST PLACE ! -RRB- Long story short I never received any product , then the person I bought them for gets a phone call at home asking her to remove the review that I left from my account . I do not know how the seller of this product got my friends number when I ordered it through my account , very unprofessional in my opinion . I do not recommend this seller to anyone .
 On the description and picture it clearly suggest you are getting the pink breast cancer awareness clipper but it is actually a pink camo one . Which personally i did not want so i am not happy at all . Do not buy from this person !
 I received three kinds of these shakes and for some reason the only one that had damage and busted cans were the cookies and creme ... You could tell from the outside of the box it had busted cans but this product was sent anyway . The chocoloate and banana flavors were just fine so it was not a shipping issue . I do think I 'll buy these from here again as I lost three cans .
 The `` vanilla cream '' tastes god-awful . Medicinal and chemically . And I bought a whole pack of 12 . Ugh . Avoid .
 I purchased the Vanilla Shake on the recommendation and high ratings of the Amazon community , and I have to say I was let down for the first time . I did not enjoy the bland taste of this shake at all . I suppose if you like Slim Fast , this stuff is comparable but if you are looking for a tasty post workout RTD , stick with Labrada or Muscle Milk which are way way better tasting than this . It gets 2 stars for not upsetting my stomach .
 I bought the vanilla creme flavor . It tastes very bad . I bought a four pack about 6 months ago and I hve tried to drink three so far and been unable to finish any of them because of the artificial sweetness being overwhelming . I was suprised that this would be so bad having many other brands of RTD shakes that are excellent .
 The frosty chocolate tastes very metallic . I would compare it to drinking aluminum foil in liquid form . Absolutely disgusting . If you need a good protein drink , try a scoop of Body Fortress protein powder with milk . It tases better and has fewer calories and more protein per serving.Body Fortress Whey Protein Powder - Chocolate -LRB- 2 lb . -RRB-
 This one is not my favorite . It kind of tasts like kaopectate . The banana and the chocolate are much better ... but it is 35 grams of protein
 Be sure you want item !!!!! They wo n't prepay return label OR the personal cost to return to them . Buy local : -RRB-
 Above , under the heading `` ingredients '' , the sellers list the Nutrition Facts not the federally required ingredients list . After buying this product I see the reason for the sickly sweet taste . The ingredients for this product are as follows
 Having recently had gastric bypass surgery , I rely on these shakes twice a day to keep my protein levels up into the GREAT range !! I like the FROSTY CHOCOLATE shake the best -LRB- although I 've also tried the Strawberry , Banana and Vanilla -RRB- , and I pour them over some crushed ice -LRB- as I like my drinks ICY cold -RRB- , and it 's just delicious !! In the 89 days since my surgery , I guess I 've drunk 180 CANS of this stuff ! WHEW !! -LRB- but I 've lost 53 pounds too ! -RRB- I 've tried LOTS of other protein mixes , and I just really like the chocolatly smoothness of this product AND the fact that it has almost TWICE AS MANY GRAMS OF PROTEIN as a drink you mix with the dry mix ! There are 35 grams of protein in each 11 ounce can !! WOOHOO !! I give it FIVE STARS , and I reccommend it to everyone I meet !
 You can barely taste the chocolate in this drink because the sweetness is so overwhelming !!! Somewhat nauseating really
 I got this for weight loss ... did nothing at all ... NOTHING . It was worthless and I would not reccomend it ... and the costs ... I thought when I ordered it I was getting 24 cans ... I got 12 no there had to be a mistake ... I think I was ripped off ... but this had too much sugar in it for weight controll or loss ... and the taste was nasty . Not everything in the world is worth the money , and this was one of them .
 why should i have to wait 3 weeks for a box of cans to be shipped ?
 I usually get Vanilla flavours of protein since if they cant get the basic flavour down , then all the others will taste just as badThis was one of them , i could only drink it after blending with fruit to mask the taste of the product . The first time i tried it i just chugged it down but it left a bad after-taste .
 Do not be fooled by deceptive advertising . This product is bleach diluted with water . Plain and simple . The company can take any advertising angle they want , but it still will not change the product . Yes , chlorine does break down when diluted , just as well as this product does . There is no special ingredient to protect this mixture from doing so . That is , unless , the makers of Clorox can walk on a river of diluted chorine . Everyone has been successfully cleaning with diluted chlorine , probably since bleach became a commercial product . Do not let Clorox make you think their `` magic touch '' can make the mixture better . If they can not tell anyone the `` magic '' ingredient , than it does not exist .
 It may be easy on your stomach -LRB- which I ca n't tell personally -RRB- , but way too big to swallow for me - I am an average size adult -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' , 145lb -RRB- . I had to break it into halves each time . But then breaking makes the edge sharp and rough , so it is still difficult to swallow . I do n't recommend it .
 I have taken Calcium/D supplements for years with no tolerance issues . When time came to get more , the Rainbow Light food-based variety seemed not only like a great idea and product . After about a week of taking these , I had very `` sour '' stomach and could not figure out what the issue was . Then I remembered starting to take this supplement ! I immediately stopped taking it and within days my stomach was back to usual . While the cause may not have been the Rainbow Light Calcium , I am not taking a chance of experiencing that again ! I am not sure what is in it that disagreed with me -LRB- there are odd added things like stinging nettle , spirulina , betaine and horestail -RRB- , and I do hope this works for everyone else !
 While the shape and size of this product is nice , the on-off knob and battery conduit is very poorly designed . This product broke the 5th time it was used and I expect this problem is common among all of them.I would not recommend anyone purchase this .
 I ordered this item because of its small size . The diameter is good and if you experience pain with larger sizes , this one is for you . It has strong vibration . The problem is that the end to turn it on is also the end where the batteries go . It is not designed well , so if you are n't extremely careful , the end pops off , so the batteries are n't connected , therefore , no vibration .
 Decent review of allergies , but not necessarily a good thing to send you blood to some random place to get tested .
 As someone who knows about food allergies , I am concerned about the implications of food allergy testing with any product , including this one . Specifically , a positive food allergy test DOES NOT mean you are allergic to the food . It only raises the possibility of an allergy . This test only tests for one type of food allergy reaction - there can be other types of reactions people have that this test does not test for.If you are concerned about a food allergy , my advice is to talk to your doctor or someone who is experienced and trained in these things . Otherwise , a test is just a test . You need someone who can interpret it for you !
 I have n't been able to submit this test yet , because I ca n't get enough blood to fill the vile . I 've tried both lancets , but I 'm actually waiting until I cut myself to try to collect blood . Unless you bleed easily I would n't recommend this kit .
 Did this test before allergologist visit . Allergy testing in the doctors office showed 2 + -LRB- worst level is 3 + -RRB- result for one of the tests what this home test answered as `` negative '' . Very unreliable !
 The lancets for this product are extremely dull and short , and you ca n't re-stick . If you 're a `` hard stick , '' count on having to spend about 20 dollars more for lancets and a sticking device -LRB- I got mine from Walgreens -RRB- . Also , I thought it was difficult to actually close the test tube , and I 'm not sure that the blood did n't leak out on the way to the testing facility.My results were obtained so quickly after mailing that I wondered whether or not the sample had actually been tested , especially since my results were all negative and I 'm fairly certain that I 'm allergic to at least one of the substances tested.I am very dubious about this product .
 I know that I am allergic to cats . This test said I am not . Do n't waste your time or money .
 I would n't recommend this product unless you like a vibrator that does n't vibrate . Mine broke within a day , which was very frustrating . It is also too long and inflexible to use comfortably , and the supposed `` infa-red heating element '' was just a light!I was disappointed . Do n't make the same mistake ...
 Why does n't Amazon have the Ingredients label for all the vitamins and supplements ? I need to see all ingredients not just B12 and/or just the front cover . I need this to make sure I am not taking too much of one vitamin or supplement . I already take Twinlab Tri-Boron Plus and I need the B vitamins to add to it . Unfortunately I ca n't buy any of these items because Amazon fails to allow the customer to see , click to enlarge , the ingredient label . I 'll have to find it on another site for all my vitamins and supplements .
 Be very careful when buying vitamins . After taking one pill , I suddenly noticed my throat started hurting a while later . By the next morning , the pain was intense . Now , I have n't had a sore throat in half a year , so it really baffled me at first . The only thing I had n't done that night that I did n't usually do was take this pill . That 's the only thing that could have caused the pain.Also , I did n't notice a significant difference in energy or focus -LRB- granted , I only took one pill -RRB- , like I did when I started taking fish oil.I should have done more research looking into this one , as it appears to contain crosprovidone . After a quick search on Google , I found out that crosprovidone is basically a form of formaldehyde . By taking this pill , you are poisoning yourself . People have died from repeated crospovidone ingestion over long periods of time . Most people are n't sensitive to crospovidone , but if you 're allergic you could very well end up in the hospital if you took it for long enough . I do n't think it 's worth the risk to buy this and hope that you 're not sensitive or allergic to it . Even if you 're not allergic , do you really feel comfortable taking a dose of what is essentially formaldehyde every single day?This does n't even deserve one star . Avoid this product at all costs , along with any other product containing toxic substances like crospovidone . READ THE LABELS . I ca n't believe the FDA approves such toxic substances in such innocent products as vitamin pills . But I guess as long as the FDA approves it , there will always be some companies doing the bare minimum for safety standards in the name of profit . It 's quite insulting to be sold something known to be poisonous , but nonetheless `` approved '' . I am switching to organic vitamins with a company that respects its customers and does n't try to sell them poison.Amazon was nice enough to issue me a refund on this toxic product , without even requiring me to send it back -LRB- since it was an opened bottle of vitamins -RRB- . But I do n't really care about the money I spent . I 'm just a little shaken up by the fact that if I did n't research this , I would still be ingesting a daily dosage of formaldehyde . Please stop taking this if you already are . Switch to a food-derived organic brand without poisonous fillers . There 's a reason this is cheap .
 I guess the vitamns are ok , but the big capsule it comes in is the kind that gets stuck in the throat too easily . I just about gagged to death this morning -LRB- well , not quite that bad -RRB- but bad enough so that I 'd finally had it ! I threw the rest away and will find an easiler to swallow B supplement .
 You clearly see Stess B-Complex Caps . Well look carefully on bottle on right hand bottom it has Vit C in it . I can not take the acid of Vit C , thus had also ordered Ester C , non acidic . Greatly disappointed when it arrived to find the line under what you can see with any ease is saying VIT C also . I do well admit it was on confirmation of order but had to go back and read for first time . I look at what is on screen to order and seldom look at confirmation as most who order a lot on Amazon . Amazon , LOVE IT !!
 I bought mine a few months ago but only took them like 10 times or so . I only tried these because of the Rave reviews on here & I must say Im disappointed . Not only are they WAY TOO BIG , and have to take 2 which makes it a choir to take , a forgetful one at that ; but they dont really do much at all for me . It generally doesnt make me feel noticeably calm , relaxed , energized or anything . I expected so much better . Ill stick to my oneaday .
 I ordered the Twinlab Stress B formula , instead you sent me the Twinlab Vitamin C. I am not a satisfied customer ... In addition there is not a `` contact the seller '' selection on the tab for this product .
 This is a very powerful deodorant , and certainly does the job it was designed to do . Unfortunately , it also caused an adverse reaction for me , as I broke out the first day I used it . I subsequently used it for a couple of days and lived with the resulting rash , but stopped using it as soon as I could get a replacement -LRB- and the rash disappeared within a day , so I deduced a cause and effect relationship -RRB- . If you do n't have an adverse reaction from this product , it actually does work quite well and smells pleasant . I obviously ca n't recommend this product based on my experience , although others may have more favorable reactions than I did .
 I cant say if it is effective on sunburns or not . I can only say it was n't effective on what can best be described as a ` jalapeno pepper burn ' on my hands . Next time I 'll wear gloves when chopping peppers . Problem solved .
 This stuff expires in 2 months and has a 3 year shelf life . Returning this product as soon as possible .
 I ordered ester-c and received another type of c . When I contacted them to see what could be done I was told I could send back what I had received but that they did not have any ester c at this time . I did not want to go thru the hastle so I just kept the one I got . I will not order from them again .
 It wo n't stay in place if you move around alot so any activity is out of the question . If you are going to wear them to sit with your legs elevated they are fine . Otherwise they slide down to your ankles . I was able to get it to stay somewhat but I had to have it so tight that it was a bit painful.In short , I was disappointed with the product .
 I received it in excellent time . However according to the sizing chart it said I needed a 5x . This was huge !!!! As in could n't keep it up no matter how tight the straps were huge . So the sizing runs a bit big . Overall quality seemed ok but the primary reason it was returned was because the stitching on the side of one of the hinges was completely missing causing the hinge to pop out . Outside of that it appeared to be good quality .
 I was very dissapointed first the 4xs made by this company in the other models are larger then the 5xs in this model which did not seem to make sense . aslo the brace always sliped off after a few steps I had read this in another review but did not take it to heart .
 The brace will not stay up when I walk ... starts sliding and by step 5 it 's at my ankle . I 've tried everything I can think of . It feels good when it is on and I 'm standing but as soon as I start walking it starts sliding . There is a design flaw somewhere , I see others have had the same problem .
 This item worked fine only initially ; comfortable and stabilized my knee . In a short amount of time , about 2-3 months , it began falling down . At first I could adjust it and it might last 1-2 hours . That shortly degraded into not staying up at all . I would not recommend this item .
 broke after 2 months and not worth investigating fixing . thought it was too good to be true and - it was
 The huge motors dug into your legs and back . Horrible product . Needed more cushion to support the motors . Very uncomfortable .
 Not comfortable to sit on . Massage does not feel good . Do n't waste your money . Get a better quality massage cushion . It was cheap , and it shows .
 Took 2 weeks to get here , had item for 4 days . One of the motors is already not working . Returning
 My wife liked it while it worked . But after two days it quit working completely . It started when the various controls would randomly not function properly . Then it just stopped altogether . I 'll try a different brand .
 It 's not all that I expected
 did not work properly right from the beginning ! expected heat . from other reviews it sounded like there was heat involved.did not feel it .
 It was supposed to fit in our lazyboy but it 's not comfortable when you sit down in it , it does n't vibrate very hard and it 's definitely not for tall people . It 's definitely a cheap product .
 This product does not work properly . Not sure if i have to contact the company itself . First of all , the heat element does not work . The product claims to have 10 motors , yet only one is working . For the amount of money i paid , it should work .
 This is the WORST massage cushion I have ever had . It 's not because the massage functions are bad or that the heat sucks , no those were great ... when they worked.I got this for Christmas , So I have had it only a little over 1 month.Day 3 the display screen stops working ... . annoying but I figure I can use it without it.Week 2 the bottom seat vibrators stop working ... arghh , what next?Week 4 The remote starts to completely crap out on me , seat shuts off on it 's own after 4-5 minutes , display flickers and it won turn on correctly without holding the buttons down.I take good care of my stuff , it 's never suffered abuse or been dropped . This piece of crap isnt built to last , not for the price . I asked for a slightly more expensive one this time -LRB- it cost $ 50 -RRB- and it 's worthless , my Homedics one cast half as much and last 2 years of everyday use . : -LRB-
 Despite a 3 year warranty against defects , this heat/massage cushion from Comfort Products began failing , one massage unit at a time , within 1-2 months of receiving it . By 6 months it was not working at all . Also , since I do n't like a lot of heat , I did n't pay attention to those that complained about the level of heat . But really , most of the time one could not even tell if the heat was on . I made multiple attempts to talk with someone from Comfort Products about my issues with the cushion . I never once got a call back - you can never reach an actual live person to talk with , only ultimately a leave a message option . They try to refer you to their web site where they require a `` part number '' but no where on the cushion is their an obvious `` parts number '' . Truly they do not stand behind their products . I will never again buy anything made by this Company .

 Listen to the reviews . No padding . Heat is non existant . Uncomfortable to sit on . Does not stay on the seat . Garbage !
 While I like the mild motored massage -LRB- no deep tissue pain , please -RRB- and the timed heat function , the flimsy connector straps and the poorly placed control storage -LRB- who was it that decided the best place to store a handset was near the seat-to-back joint in a chair ; removal is n't bad , but it requires a bit of contortion to replace it -RRB- leave me in a position to either repair the product and continue to use it or else return it and try another brand .
 This thing smelled terrible . It worked fine , but it smelled like a skunk . It reeked so bad that it fouled up my whole living room . I had to eventually move it to another room and open the window and turn on a fan . Two days later it still smelled . I do n't know if I got something from a bad batch or what . I even called Comfort Products to discuss the problem but they were unhelpful . I eventually returned this item to Amazon . If you have a keen sense of smell do n't buy this product .
 Not at all satisfied . Product was not comfortable seating . W was most interested in the heat function which was almost undetectable so never even tried the massage . If you want heat and comfort look elsewhere
 The cushion is supposed to have straps that wrap around your seat and/or chair to hold it in place . One of my straps was torn in half when I received the package . I thought I would try it anyway but unfortunately , the `` massage '' was not much more than a minor vibration and the `` heat '' was much lower temperature than factory heated car seats . I would never purchase anything like this again .
 Not very happy with this item . Used it once and put it back in the box . I should have listened to the reviews .
 I chose two day shipping for this item because they offer it and i need it before xmas but they can not fullfill my request it will now arrive after xmas ! :-LRB- why have the option for one or even two day shipping when they can not get there product to me on time ? Horrible now my gf will just have to open her xmas gift wen it comes in the mail that will be so much fun not ! All i got ta say is it better work and come packaged nicely or its gettin returned
 Bought this 41 days ago , I should have returned it earlier as the returns were only good for 30 days . Some of the buttons on the controls do n't work anymore . So , I can no longer change the timer , the speed or the intensity of the pad . So , every 9 minutes I have to turn it on and change the rest of the settings . It 's really annoying .
 I have had it about 3 weeks the straps broke , the controls stick , and the power stays on untill you unplug it.Not as good as the old one which lasted about 12 yrs .
 Does not provide any back pain relief this is a terribly misleading name and it doesnt help with your pain . simple as that . DO NOT GET IT its worth shopping around for sum shiatsu stuff
 Is this a good product ? Only in one 's imagination . It 's really kind of a silly contraption when you think about it .
 I could never call this a massage cushion . There is some vibration but it 's very poor , even on the highest level . If you 're looking for a massager , I would highly recommend purchasing something else .
 I was very disappointed with this item . The various vibration points seem to be effective , but the hand-held controller is not very user friendly
 Does not measure up to the Shihatsu 110 AC messager , which actually works . This unit has multiple vibrating buzzers . I could not feel the heat . The motors turned on high create an odd noise much like the kids ' giant bass speakers .
 This chair is uncomfortable and have to consider people with different height . Taller people may not fit on this , shorter people may not reach the neck . Plus the cushion tends to move a lot .
 ????? does not preform as advertised . controls do not work constantly and massage is not what expected i do not use any more
 The massage cushion was claimed to be new , but it was sent to me not in the manufacturer 's box , and that is totally unacceptable .
 This site sucks , they do not have this product available and they still advertise it as if they are going to ship it . I ordered this Item in december and the ship date was Jan6 and now they are saying they will ship it in April this is really crazy who wants to wait that long , Amazon.com shud pull out this ad immediately its very much misleadingdont even bother to order this item its waste of time
 Timer shuts off after 14 minutes , unable to set timer for longer usage . Not user friendly . Overall a poor quality product . Would not recommend .
 I ordered this unit on February 7th . Every time I checked back on the status of the order , it read `` not shipped '' and the estimated shipping date got moved out . I really do n't think this unit is avaialble from the company anytime soon . I cancelled the order .
 The description of this massager is a bit misleading.The 6 motors in the back portion cover 6 rather small areas -LRB- more like being hit with small mallets than the sides of hands -RRB- and the only motion from side to side or up to down refers to the sequence that the motors thump . There is quite a bit of adjustment to the strength and character of the thumps , but I found the effect neither therapeutic nor relaxing , just curious.I could get the kneading to cover the upper part of my neck or the lower part by turning the control knob , but for someone taller or shorter , the coverage would be limited . The speed control for the kneading does n't really change the speed that much . The neck kneading nodes are made of rather hard plastic , and in my case they seemed too narrow apart -LRB- and there is no adjustment for width -RRB- , so after just a few minutes it was more painful than relaxing . Then it started squeaking intermittently.Within an hour of receiving the massager I decided to return it .
 I just purchased this cushion on 29th August 2006 . it is very hard , like a piece of cardboard . The massager is more a vibrator , which when working without heat , makes your teeth chatter . With heat which is barely warm , it works slow . i would suggest a memory foam pillow if you want comfort . I did not pay attention to the other reviews . But trust me It is verrrrrry hard.No support or comfort at all .
 The massager is just a vibration , and since the frequency can not be modulated , it is really much more of a buzz than an enjoyable experience . The heater is good , especially in the cold winter , however , a fine print on the tag that warns you `` Do not use over 30 min ... '' so ... go figure ... The cushion itself is hard and more like a block than a cushion ... and the fix strap is not very well designed so that it is very difficult to fix it on the office chairs , it tends to fall down or stay in a very awkward position that can only be summarize into one word - > Uncomfortable ...
 Vibrator worked two days then puked!JUNKDuane
 I tried this very briefly -- it made my back hurt worse , so I stopped ! Get a softer cushion instead .
 This cushion is far too large -LRB- 12.5 in long -RRB- for a lumbar support - it 's more like a too short back support . The top and bottom are not tapered enough , so leaning on it is like resting on a 3 '' shoe box . Yes , it is uncomfortable , but the odd posture does decrease my back pain . The vibration and heat are similar to that of other vibrating backrests I own -LRB- Obus forme , Howemedics -RRB- , but the price is about $ 100 less than the Obusforme . I purchased this cushion because I wanted a less bulky , more portable backrest , but I will now carry my Obus forme without complaint .
 I thought this would be at least somewhat like a lumbar ` pillow ' but it 's more like a solid vibrating brick . It vibrates so hard it makes my brain rattle . This is not a comfort product - it 's a torture device !
 Product is like a chunk of wood . No give , does not ccnture to back . Unusable !
 Buyer beware ! This product was intended for very limited use -LRB- 30 min max -RRB- . My father has been using this product since Christmas and for 30 days it worked . Now the motor in the unit squeals and makes a lot of racket . So for around $ 15.00 over 30 days it cost me 50 cents per day . I will now shop for a quality product !
 I bought this for my husband because he drives a lot during the day . He said it is very akward to lean back on and just makes your back hurt more because of the position you have to sit in . I would n't recommend it .
 Save your money and your time , this item does not do what it claims I was very disappointed returned it next day .
 This Lumbar cushion provided no relief to my back pain . I was planning to use it at work but once I tried it at home , I did n't bother . It 's not even soft and it feels like I 'm resting my back on a block instead of a cushion .
 I found this product to be very disappointing because it is -LRB- Uncomfortable to Use -RRB- ... -LRB- The Vibration Mechanism is a most Unnatural type of Vibration -RRB- and overall the effect I was seeking from the unit ... the unit is incapable of producing !
 After reading the positive on-line reviews , I boughtthis cushion for my 77 year old mother . However , after tryingit , she felt that the heat was not warm enough for her.Unfortunately the heat level is not adjustable . -LRB- She did not wish to use the massaging feature . -RRB- Also , the cushion was not pliable enough to allow it to beplaced on her front , as she would like to do whensitting in a couch with her legs stretched in front of her.Thus I am returning it .
 Well , maybe not totally useless , as an unplugged travel pillow it might work fine , but the `` massage '' is actually a high speed vibration , mainly on the front of your neck , I 'm baffled that anyone could find that to be a pleasant experience . You get what you pay for , I guess .
 I just purchased this cushion and was so disappointed ! It 's beautiful to look at , but when it comes to actual use , it gets a thumbs down from me . The controls offer 3 different levels of `` massage '' . I expected the control labeled `` massage '' to knead , it did n't . It just vibrated at a low , med or high speed . Kind of made me nauseaus after 3 minutes . It did have heat that did n't stay hot for long . I do n't recommend it . Sorry , do n't mean to sound negative ! : -RRB-
 Bought two of these . One as a gift and one for myself . Luckily I tried mine out before I gave the other away . This thing just vibrates . NO MASSAGE AT ALL !! After 30 seconds you get nausea ... its not worth 23.99 ... its a piece of junk . Trust me you are not getting a bargain . I guess you pay for what you get , but in this case I ca n't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub .
 The vibrating motors in this thing are encased in hard plastic `` pods '' and the cushioning between you and the vibrators is very skimpy - so it feels like there 's a walnut in the middle of the back cushion , pressing against your spine . Spend the money to get something better !
 I ordered 2 of these . Only 1 came with the AC plug . That was disappointing .
 This Flowtron machine did not work for us . I do not profess to be an expert , but with West Nile in Illois like it is , I needed something that would give us the freedom to be outdoors . I could not get the thing going and then when it did I caught 6 bugs in a month and a half . I took it back to Costco and got my money back.I went out and bought the Mosquito Magnet -LRB- for 2 times the money -RRB- . What a difference . I had to empty the net every 3 weeks or so . It is still going ! It did not get rid of ALL the Mosquitos , but it did give us the backyard back .
 It would not trap the Asian Tiger Mosquito that inhabited by back yard in Texas
 I bought the machine and lures last summer from amazon . had to buy a second box of lures as the first did n't fit the machine . bad info on the item . The second lure would n't stick - the old tape does n't completely clean up and out for the next one . We caught tons of moths but hardly no mosquitos.This is n't a great machine but then it is n't 300.00 either .
 I purchased this by mistake and Amazon will not take it back . I meant to purchase the six count which costs only $ 5.66 each which is less than half the cost of this single count product . I ordered this one in error and Amazon wont let me return it even for an exchange .
 I ordered the cod liver oil gelcaps along with the vitamin E gelcaps . When I opened them , they were identical in color and odor . I do n't know why vitamin E would smell fishy , unless there is something fishy about this product . It would seem that twinlab is a scam , I 'm not sure either product is safe to consume . Very disappointing to spend good money on a questionable supplement .
 I noticed my daily multi-vitamin did n't have any Vitamin E in it , so I was looking for an appropriate supplement on Amazon . While looking through product and reading current literature , I found the following : - Vitamin E does not decrease mortality in adults , even at large doses , and may slightly increase it . - It does not improve blood sugar or decrease the risk of stroke . - Daily supplementation of vitamin E does not decrease the risk of prostate cancer and may increase it . - Studies on its role in age related macular degeneration are ongoing as , even though it is of a combination of dietary antioxidants used to treat the condition , it may increase the risk . - It may also contribute to osteoporosis.The most concerning is a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine
 If hard plastic is your thing you 'll probably like this , but after charging 12 hrs . still no vibration . It 's not as `` advertised . '' Find something else ... this product is n't worth the price .
 This item never held a charge but could be used for about 15 minutes if it had been plugged in for the preceding 24 hours . 6 months after purchasing it , it died altogether . I had one previously that I purchased elsewhere that lasted me 5 years ! This one is a dud !
 I bought this after my old toy wore out . I wanted to get a rechargeable toy as I burn through batteries so fast on battery operated toys . I was very disappointed with this , it is so weak , it 's takes me forever to get off , and the heat setting really does n't add anything . I do n't have any desire to use this toy as I did with my old one . I just ordered a new toy , hope it turns out better than this weak piece of plastic !
 Any positive reviews of this are either placebo effect , or fake -LRB- feel free to down vote my opinion - does n't matter to me -RRB- . I took 4 per day , 1 with each meal . I 'm a male , 6 ' 1 '' , athletic build , 180lbs , go to the gym 3 days per week . Was just looking to get rid of a little bit of fat covering my lower abs so I can see those muscles . Did n't lose a pound ... and have n't gained a pound now that I 'm 3 weeks outside of finishing the bottle . Waste of money . Do n't bother with this .
 I do not know if the product is effective or not because I did not use it . When I ordered , I was not careful to make sure that the capsules were vegetarian and they were n't . As for Natrol products in general , they have always proven effective for me .
 I tried this product about 10 years ago and again last week . The after taste was horrible then and it 's horrible now even with the new flavors.I recommend nitrean or pro-nos over isopure .
 does not suppress appetite or do anything else . this product is just another waste of money . save your funds for something else .
 This product does a lot of things . My favorite is probably removing soap scum from shower doors and walls . It really works very well and it takes very little effort . I also use it for removing grime from paint , and miscellaneous other chores . My biggest complaint about this product is its short life . It disintegrates rapidly and really only handles one job . For instance , if you plan to clean your shower surround , it is likely to last only through that project . I 'm not sure what 's on this `` eraser '' , but it 's hard on the hands . Wear gloves .
 I mean this is a great deal comaring with the one sold in the supermarket . The service from the reseller is also great . But the effect after using this is not that great as I expect . I have purchased this particular item from CVS , Lucky or Saftway . It can clean my bathtub very well but after using this one , I have to double my time and usage to make the same result . I am going to try with advanced Magic Eraser to see it I can get better result .
 Maybe I am not using these correctly . But did not get the results I was hoping for . Rag and water work better for me .
 Mr. Clean Magic Erasers have always been a mystery to me . I 've tried to use them because I 've heard how useful they are on certain cleaning jobs , but every single time I 've tried to work with them they have either fallen apart and/or did not work at all . I read that they were amazing at cleaning stubborn scuff marks on floors , but I had no luck . These Erasers did nothing for my woodwork , my bathroom faucet , my bicycle , or my husband 's sneakers . I tried both the blue and the white side and was left with a mess of shredded Magic Erasers that had to go in the garbage.In the end I used my eco-friendly re-useable cotton rag withBiokleen All Purpose Cleaner , 32-Ounce Bottles -LRB- Pack of 12 -RRB- . Nothing went in the garbage and my woodwork , floors , bike , bathroom and husband 's sneakers were all magically clean .
 This product does a good job but has a very short useful life . It needs to be made more substantial in order to last longer while using it for scrubbing .
 I 'm wondering if I received a bad batch because everyone I 've used has fallen apart within three or four gentle swipes ... hunks of it , not small pieces . I contacted the main company and their email rep said basically
 Me too was fooled by the picture , and the fact that the description actually says `` switch '' . Just add a comma behind `` switch '' , and it is included.Bad practice IMO or just bad oversight.Amazon , I hope you read our reviews and update the description before others have to deal with that frustration as well.I even missed the deadline for return due to an extended vacation . Of course I probably need another lanyard one of these days , but who knows if I find this one then in the mess I call a garage : -RRB-
 After giving these sponges several chances to work , their tendency to break apart after just two or three uses means I 'll never buy them again . Odd that they are n't made to withstand normal usage .
 Bought a couple of these Magic Eraser at local retail just to check it out . Totally unimpressed . An ordinary sponge and water worked just as well , for the several different types of markings and soils I tried it on . For extra cleaning power , dampen the ordinary sponge with Simple Green , either full strength or diluted.The only thing `` Magic '' about the product , was how it separated me from a few dollars . Do n't waste your money on it .
 The magic in the magic eraser is that Mr.Clean convinces you that their product works better then a wet rag ... . It does about the same job but is much less durable .
 The very first time I squeezed water out , it broke in half ! Then while gently scrubbing a small -LRB- 5 `` x6 '' -RRB- leather purse , it simply crumbled away . When there was about 1/3 of one -LRB- of one 1/2 -RRB- left , it actually did begn removing scuffs ... but was crumbling so badly by that time the crumbles were getting all over the purse , which I had to rinse and dry with a cottten washcloth to remove . What a total waste of money , time and energy . NEVER again ! I have the pieces , do you want them back ?
 This product did not work for me in the least . It was an overpriced sponge that fell apart after one use . Did n't get any stains off or clean the grout . Did n't even clean the sink properly -LRB- I had to use a dish brush to finish the job -RRB- . The only thing this product was good at doing was inducing curses .
 I was not impressed . I would not order this again . They do not last long and do not do the job .
 From the product description , I see that this is primarily used to remove dirt , but how do you get dirt in your kitchen appliances like stoves and refrigerators?I 've used this eraser for about a week now to do some cleaning around the kitchen and bathroom , and I 'm not that impressed for the following reasons :1 . -RRB- The Magic Eraser is way too stiff and styro-foamy moreso than spongy . So , if you go around corners or anything with an edge , you 'll just tear the `` Magic Eraser . '' It 's nearly impossible to not tear when trying to clean things off from sharp corners . Any sponge with some soap will do a better job and get into those tight spots and corners without tearing .2 . -RRB- It 's just not that `` magical . '' Sure , it removes stains , but so does a normal sponge and soap combo . I also do n't find my kitchen noticeably cleaner from using this magic eraser.The only good thing about this product is that all you have to do is add water.I would give this 4 stars if the eraser did n't tear so easily .
 Dont waste ur money . Plastic cracks . Mop head stays dirty . Lasts only one week of light use . Avoid this junk like the plague !
 I saw no advantage of these cleaning pads over just the old scotch-bite yellow and green sponges . They fall apart much to easy and there is no advantage in their ability to clean .
 Completely worthless . I am amazed this is still on the market . Save your money and buy a $ .30 sponge . This lasts for about 2 uses .
 this was quite the little ingenious gadget until i went to use it the second time , stays on all the time , stays on one speed only , i have to remove the batteries to turn it off now . very dissapointed for how much it cost .
 This is the biggest piece of garbage for the money ... works great for 1 time . Then the second time it will only stay at the lowest speed ... changed the batteries ... no difference . . I see this is the second time a post for the same presoblem ... BEWARE JUNK !!! Also , these products are non-returnable
 It only seals if the bowl is al least 1/2 inch smaller , but then the edge hangs over making it hard to put in and take out of the fridge . I really wanted something I could put over a bowl and take to work for lunch -LRB- in a bag -RRB- so it 's useless for that . It is OK for storing stuff in the fridge . I have n't needed to try it as a cooking lid so do n't know how it works for that .
 I have been using Jay Robb vanilla for years because even though it was expensive , it was the best tasting protein powder on the market so it was worth it ... that is until they went to the new packaging . For whatever reason they seem to have decided that they needed to change the forumla as well . The powder is now more `` waxy '' and the taste has really fallen off . I am very disappointed that they would do this to such a great product . If you buy this based upon the many glowing recommendations of how great it tastes , only to be let down you 'll know why .
 I will say that the protein shake tastes good but upon inspection one notices that the supposed protein from grass-fed cows is not from grass-fed cows after all . The package does not mention a thing about it , and if it was from grass-fed cows , rest assurred they would mention it just like a car mentions when it gets high gas mileage.Then , it tells you how `` superior '' the product is , but it really is n't ! It claims the cows are not given the hormone rBGH , but Jay Robb weasels out of this one by putting a disclaimer on this and stating that at times there are not enough rBGH milk supplies available and they 've to use US supplies -- translation US milk from cows filled with artificial steroids.Amazingly , Chobani yogurt , which is in virtually every supermarket in the US , is able to get enough steroid-free milk for its yogurt but little Jay Robb can not get enough for its company . Jay Robb is not even one of the leading producers of protein , much less a major player in the milk market . Basically the only `` cow '' product we get from this company is a lot of bull . I would venture to say that Chobani uses more milk in one day than Jay Robb uses in a whole year.Then on the company 's Website is more bull . They state that they can not use organic because there are not enough supplies available . Seriously ? Organic Valley and Horizon have organic milk in virtually every supermarket throughout the US , but surprisingly Jay Robb can not find enough supplies . Just how big does Jay Robb think his company is ? Again this is more lies from the company ... certainly there is enough organic milk out there but again the compnay is too cheap to cough up the bucks to use it.So what you are getting with the product is an insanely overpriced protein that may or may not be rBGH steroid-free and certainly Jay Robb does not say that his product is free from all artificial hormones -- which one should get at these ridiculously high prices for protein . Apparently , the product is not from grass-fed cows either -- another falsehood listed on the Amazon ad for Jay Robb Whey Protein.Fortunately , there are good alternatives out there like Biochem , Resveratage , Jarrow , Solgar , etc. . Companies that actually deliver what Jay Robb claims to deliver and they do n't try to weasel out of their claims -- unlike Jay Robb 's products . There is also soy lecithin in this product which is a known allergen and better products avoid it . Bascially , with Jay Robb 's products you are paying for a Lexus and getting a Chevy , but then again what would we expect from a guy whose last name is Robb !
 This turned out to be great product my problem is I CAN NOT SEEM TO LOSE WEIGHT ON THE LOW CARB DIET ANYMMORE > I lost 167 pounds in 3 1/2 yrs just exercizing and getting my carbs below 25 grams at each meal . BUt anymore this carb diet has no effect on my weight . I have no idea why ... This protien shake could be thicker the best one I ever used was METRIX 25 grams of protien but they took it off the martket -LRB- idiots -RRB- and brought out a HIGH FAT HIGHER CALORIE drink which makes my heart race and all I wanted was the old one which worked wonders for us non body builders ... so Robbs is ok , but watery , METRIX was thick ... I hate watery drinks ... and still I lost no weight on this product either ... followed his diet to a T. . . dotted every I ... but lost nothing . Anyone have any suggestions WHY the low carb has no effect on my body any more ??? Maybe this has too much sugar ? I do n't know ... and it is very expensive . its more about ROBB making $ $ $ $ $ $ $ than it is about selling a product we working people can afford that WORKS !!!!!!!!!! two stars for taste and pckaging ... yeah , tell me about it .
 I was excited to try the vanilla flavor after reading all the positive reviews , but unfortunately , was not impressed . It leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste . Maybe the other flavors taste better . As another reviewer noted , it does not mix particularly well with just a spoon -LRB- mixes fine in a blender -RRB- . I give the product two stars because it does not contain any unnatural additives ...
 I was really excited about getting whey protein with stevia in instead of artificial sweeter . It had a soapy taste to it . It did not taste like whey protein at all .
 I bought this Impulse 7X Power because of 3 butteries for 1 motor - it have to be extremely powerful , and 7 vibration modes.I am very DISAPPOINTED of this device - it IS FAULTY . Only 3 vibration modes are working out of 7 and they turned on in random way without pushing the control buttons . The device is DEFECTIVE , this is in its electronics . I already red a review , where customer wrote the same things about another model of such a vibration bullet called Exotics Impulse Pocket Paks.Furthermore - I also bought Waterproof Gyro-G Spot Hydra Vibe Vibrator of this company.The batteries inside the product are old - vibrator hardly vibrates - i was need to install a new battaries . The additional 4 spare butteries inside the package are swollen - out of use.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY .
 I sent these back for the same reason I sent the matching mitts back - not enough lavender filling . Again , only heats one side of the foot . The way they look in the photo , it looks like the filling is surrounding the foot but it is n't . Very disappointed .
 If your Cross Century II has a yellow eraser it is a fake imitation and not an authentic Cross LT item . Cross uses a high quality blue eraser . There are other subtle differences between an authentic pen/pencil to these sold on Amazon but they are difficult to describe .
 I ordered this pen & pencil set on my birthday , which I was probably not unconscious of . A birthday present to myself.Bad choice . A clerk in a local stationer 's explained to me that Cross - formerly a reliable manufacturer & purveyor of fine writing instruments - had hit upon the idea of a single body for both pen & pencil - which presumably saves money in manufacturing - with only the insides different . A first disadvantage is that looking down at the two objects in my shirt pocket , a pen and a pencil , they are indistinguishable
 This product is 25 % chamomile by weight , as noted in fine print on the side of the box . Though it may be beneficial for many people , someone who is pregnant , asthmatic , or who has pollen allergy should proceed with caution and not consume chamomile without understanding potential health effects . A caution is given on the package
 Looks nice but has a big problem.This product had lavender fragrance at first but the fragrance went away after ~ 2 weeks and it smelled bad . . The bad smell started giving me a headache . Since the smell was strong even the cover could n't block the smell.But you CAN NOT return when you start noticing the bad smell because of their return policy.It smells nice only for two weeks and it smell bad after that !!!!!!!!!! And NO RETURN !!!!!!!!!
 I began taking this product over a month ago . I was really hoping for relief from my hot flashes , which I have had since I had a radical hysterectomy 5 years ago . I was even hoping for the `` placebo '' effect ... anything ! So far no relief at all . I started with their recommended dosage , but now I am taking 8 tablets a day -LRB- the recommended dosage is one or two tablets twice a day . -RRB- Still nothing . I am going to keep taking it for another month and at that time I 'll update my review . For now I am very disappointed.Update
 This is really cheaply made ; I did n't expect very much for the price , but it was far less than expected .
 When I received this product it did not work . The battery was tested locally and found drained . The light on the thermometer also did n't work . I paid to have a new battery installed and the thermometer worked but the light still did n't work . I notified the company selling this product and they promptly refunded my money . I must say they acted quickly and responsibly .
 I purchased this to use as a diaper cream , and it works fine for that purpose . However , I purchased this item in late July , 2012 , and the expiration date on the product is November 2012 ! That 's cutting it really close since the ingredients should have a much longer shelf life . This tells me the seller is keeping a lot of old product ... try another seller !!!
 I ordered this item specifically because it says one a day . That is not what I received . I received two a day which means you are getting half of what you pay for . 60 caplets last for one month not two . False advertising !
 I have tried everything including Estroven and nothing worked until Amberen . My symptoms were so sever I thought I was going to be the first woman to die of menopause . Estroven just did not work for me . I did the excelerated version of Amberen two doses twice a day and after 45 days
 The product has nothing on the label to help you know what is in it . But the box has some information . I found this and figured it would be helpful for people who want to know what they are getting . I tried the product and found that it has lots of extra stuff in it that is not needed for hot flashes and moodiness , etc. . I used to get a great product at half the cost from Walgreens called Estroven which was Walgreens version of this product and it was the best . Unfortunately , Estroven stopped anyone from competing with their products so they can charge a lot . Here is the ingredients and I hope it helps . Note that the `` other ingredients '' are all the fillers and junk that they put in the tablets . The tablets are hard as rocks and the fillers give me a stomach ache and are hard to digest . If you have a sensitive digestion , these fillers may be hard to break down in your gut . Anyway , ingredients : Supplement FactsServing Size
 I did not receive what is shown in picture . Not happy - Hope to have resolution ASAP . Picture shows One a day and I received a 2 a day bottle instead of the box shown .
 The product was shown as only needing to take one a day , but the bottle states needing to take 2 per day . I was very disappointed in this as I would not have bought them knowing this . I do n't believe they are the same as the one a day extra strength ones I buy in the store because they do n't seem to work as well .
 do n't buy amerifit , it is not working , buy other brand ! i purchased it because of the price but again the old proverbe - the chipper is more expensive ! i use it for a month - NOTHING changed ! , so , i 'm moving to another brand . i 'm experiencing severe hot flashes , on 1/2 -1 hour frequency , already 7 years ! , tried many different pills , herbs , some are working the first time , the second - not , so i decided to live with my hot flashes ... , then red on amazon.com , that a lot of women are happy with estroven , but one said
 My wife has asthma , and uses this when she has a problem with her asthma . She liked it , but in trying to replaces the batteries , the case cracked . She does n't have huge strong hands , but she managed to destroy it just in changing the batteries . I tried super glue , so we will see how it goes , but I 'm not happy with the less-than-stellar longevity.It 's compact and electronic , so it 's easy to carry in a purse or a suitcase . I 'm just not happy having to spend a fair amount of money to replace a device only a couple of years old . I expected more out of this product .
 The device appears to be highly reliable but the measurement is not calibrated properly and is invalid . I happen to know my PEF from two sources - another peak flow meter and a professional measurement provided by my allergist . They are similar and the difference between those values and what PIKO-1 provides is in the range of 50 liters/minute . This makes the devide entirely useless to me .
 This oximeter eats batteries . I ca n't even go 24 hours without changing batteries . If I take them out after everu use , and then reinstall them , I can get about 3 days from a set of batteries . The batteries care going to cost more than the meter in another week . Do n't buy this one .
 Title says 250 ea but then only 100 ea when you go to buy do n't buy till they make up their mind what we get ! Would be one of the best prices by $ 2 IF it really is 250 each like the title says but would be quite expensive compared to other deals for the same brand if you received only 100ea .
 we got this for my daughter for christmas and we filled it several times but the air kept leaking out . kind of a crappy gift . oh , well most things these days are junk and a waste of resources .
 My son loves this , but it arrived w. a giant leak , so I have a very sad 4 yr old : -LRB-
 I purchased this product to help me get to sleep . It does make me a bit drowsy after about 20-30 minutes , but nothing I could n't stay awake through . So , it is n't as effective as I had hoped . I will continue to take it until gone , but most likely wo n't reorder .
 Worked for a week then had to keep adding more and more . This tiny bottle didnt last long , not worth the money and time to count drops .
 This product induced severe memory lapses and black outs . After having tests run by a few doctors , it was determined that this herbal product did , in fact , cause me to experience memory loses , lapses in what memories I did have , and enabled me to do things during what seemed to be a period of ` black-outs . ' Be very cautious before buying this , discuss with a physician , first !
 I got this for my man for xmas and after letting the thing charge he used it once and said it was removing the hair my mostly PULLING IT OUT ! Now I 've got to find a replacement shaver . I got this cause it had five stars WTH ? I give it one star .
 As far as the supplier is concerned , I received this item promptly and without any hassles . But the massager itself never worked . It broke while trying to install the batteries . It appears that the battery compartment is actually too small , and the massager would not close with the batteries in place . Because the price was so low , I decided against trying to get an exchange or refund . I thought the shipping cost would basically eat it up , and a replacement unit would probably have the same trouble . I rate the supplier 5 stars , but no stars for the massager -LRB- one star was required , but not deserved -RRB- . And I strongly recommend NOT buying this item .
 Maybe someone else can get this soap to make lather that does n't evaporate before you set your brush down . I had to add 1/2 oz oil to it to get it to stop foaming . Perhaps taking a long time to build lather would make it work . But Van der Hagen soap works instantly and gives great lather . So why bother with Marvy ?
 My wife 's doctor recommended Glucerna shakes for her in-between meal snacks . She chose the Glucerna chocolate flavor and was very disappointed . Too heavy an artificial chocolate flavor . After tasting some I agree the company has to go back to the drawing board and come up with a better , normal , every day candy bar-like chocolate flavor like `` Glucoburst '' which is also available at Amazon.Com It is not a thick shake but is great tasting . Also , Victus.com has their `` Enterex Diabetic '' a thick shake which beats most diabetic shakes for flavor and has no fructose or corn syrup , check it out . Do n't settle for just any brand just because it says `` for a diabetic '' . Try at least three or four different companies before settling on a brand without fructose added if possible . Check out `` fructose & diabetics '' on the web also log onto the `` nutrition reporter.com '' , their article has some very , very negative information regarding fructose and corn syrup . Please read the article it 's very informative . Good luck in your quest for better tasting protein shakes.Vince & Helen
 I tried the vanilla and chocolate and both gave me diarrhea . The taste was tolerable , not wonderful . I wished it did n't make me sick .
 I took the recommendations of others and chilled this drink for two days before giving it a try . When I finally drank it , I almost got sick . It tastes like cold cardboard and leaves a horrible aftertaste . A few hours later , my stomach agreed with my mouth . The havoc it wreaked was unbearable.But , to be fair , I tried it again a few days later , giving it the benefit of the doubt , just in case I was coming down with some sort of stomach bug.Nope . Stomach was just fine ... until I drank another one.Stay away if you cherish your insides .
 This product is nowhere like the kind sold in the can which is unavailable . It 's thin even when shook and shook and shook . The taste does n't even remotely taste of chocolate . Pass on this one .
 this product is a total waste of your money . it is n't contoured correctly at all and is actually pretty uncomfortable . the batteries are an odd size and therefore hard to replace . Save the money and get something out of the Rabbit line instead .
 This arrived DOA , I tried to reorder but it was going to be a MONTH before it would be available ...
 This toy was great the first time , and good the second time ... after that it just died . Tried new batteries and everything , but no go ... would not buy again
 First off - if you decide to buy this product , be aware that there are 3 different sellers offering California Poppy Extract on Amazon . You can save yourself a few dollars on your order by picking the lowest price vendor.I puchased this product on the claims that it would help me sleep more deeply and to enter some very vivid -LRB- potentially even lucid -RRB- dream states . The fact that it was also touted as a painkiller was an added bonus , as I suffer chronic knee pain . After trying doses of anywhere from 20 to 60 drops prior to bed time , I think I may have felt slightly more relaxed , but I did not have noticeably more vivid dreams . Furthermore , I did n't feel any impact on my mild insomnia . I slept just as restlessly and still found myself waking frequently throughout the night.As for eliminating pain , I also felt no improvement while using this product .
 I saw the many positive reviews on here and read some various literature online touting the wonderful relaxing effects of California poppy extract . I ordered a bottle and I have to say it was a complete waste of money . It had a strong , bitter alcohol taste -LRB- considering it is mixed with alcohol -RRB- that was difficult to mask , even when I boiled it in water to boil off some of the alcohol and added it to my tea . Since I use herbal extracts to relax , I am always on the lookout for new , helpful herbal remedies . For instance , I find passionflower and valerian extracts to be very effective . After reading about California poppy being a relaxant , pain reliever , etc. . I had pretty high expectations . I have to say I was disappointed . Only after taking twice the suggested dosage did I feel a little relaxed , and even so , it was nowhere near as effective as valerian or passionflower . I did not have any interesting or lucid dreams , and it did nothing for pain . I suppose it works for some people , but it definitely did n't do a thing for me .
 I 've tried this product but it does n't have any effect whatsoever . I purchased a bottle and used the extract several times , but it never did anything . It did n't help me sleep better . It did n't make me feel relaxed . It did n't affect my dreams . There was no noticeable difference at all.I even experimented with using it different ways to see if that would make a difference . I tried putting the drops in plain water as the instructions on the bottle indicate . I also tried putting the drops in juice , and in tea as a couple of the other reviewers here mentioned , but it did n't make any difference . I also tried varying the dosage . The instructions say you can take 20-40 drops , so I tried 20 , 30 , and 40 drops . I even tried taking more than 40 drops . The extract still had no effect.My sister also tried some of the extract in her tea and it had no effect on her either . It makes me wonder if other people are experiencing the placebo effect when they report getting results from California Poppy .
 I bought this product since I 'd heard about the crazy dreams it gives you.I dream almost every night and remember the dreams , which are usually pretty vivid and wild . So maybe it 's just me but this product did n't really cause any changes.I gave it to others and they said they noticed an effect but it may be placebo . I would n't buy this again .
 Gave California Poppy to my 23 year old mare for a few weeks . She did not show significant pain relief . Dosage was prescribed by a homeopathic doctor .
 I 've been taking sleep aid for 5 years , every night and I bought this to try as a natural alternative . I was completely disappointed with the California Poppy . Maybe I just have a high tolerance but I used up the entire bottle in two days and felt little to nothing from it . Your experience will vary , of course . I have tried passion flower extract and that works really great . If you do n't try the poppy , considerPassionflower Extract 1 Ounces .
 I followed directions and gradually increased dosage to NO avail . I never noticed anything other than this stuff is foul tasting . For all I know it could of been colored water . Maybe I got a bad batch . What I do know is this company will not get any further business from me . Fool me twice shame on me ... ai n't gon na happen .
 Just because something is expensive does n't mean it is worth anything . This product is not at all effective for pain or relaxation . Instead of this , I recommend Valerian or Kava for relaxation . For pain , ibuprofen is helpful . This product is just a waste of money and I 'm sorry that I bought it .
 I ordered this because I saw a presentation on Dr. Oz . Overall , I would imagine it has some positive possibilities . My main concern is that since it is so easily accessible that our youth of today do n't add it to their list of party favors and beverages . I think the ingredients should require adult supervision .
 I 'm female , but I have n't noticed any change while I 've been taking this so I would n't recommend it for women even though they claim it can increase libido in both men and women . I 've actually read a couple books also saying that it has n't been tested in women and the claims are just from the suppliers who want to expand their markets , so I 'd suggest going another route .
 paid for a 2 pack and got 1 tried to cantact but no pesponce.so watch out they may rip you off to .
 I 've tried 3 crystal deodorant sprays
 I got a huge hole in them the first time I wore them ! So not worth the money I spent on them .
 I got a huge hole in them the first time I wore them ! So not worth the money I spent on them .
 I did not expect the fragance and grape seed in this product . The fragrance in it cause me to break out . I think they sent me the wrong product because I did not see that ingredient in the product I order . It smells good and it leaves a shine on our skin .
 I just received an email today from Hero Nutritionals confirming my suspicion that only the fruit portion of the concentrate is organic . The veggie concentrate is NOT organic . That means there 's a `` dirty dozen '' veggie in there
 I called the manufacturer and in addition to Fruit and Veg concentrates it also has various other chemicals/products such as Gelatin -LRB- made from Pork skin -RRB- . They also confirmed that Amazon description is incorrect . Only the Fruit concentrates are organic . Everything else including all veg are NOT organic.I also spoke with Amazon customer service and they have assured me that they will update the product discription.If anyone has a good recommendation for a whole food based organic supplement for a toddler I would love to hear about it .
 I was disappointed . This children 's multi-vitamin may be delicious but it only contains the Vitamins A , C & E. No other vitamins and no minerals.I need something with a wider spectrum for my children than that . My husband and I feel - with these few nutrients , this is more like a fortified candy .
 Only order these if you live in a colder state or during the colder months of the year . Amazon does not properly package these gummies . I received my first order and it was completely melted . I contacted Amazon about the order , told them about the packaging issue , they promptly sent me a replacement overnight . The only problem is , they still did n't package it any differently and that one was melted too . I finally gave up and requested a refund . Maybe I 'll try again when the weather is cooler .
 My five year old daughter is SO PICKY . She does n't like meat . She does n't like cooked veggies . She does n't really like dairy , unless it 's very specific things , like actual milk , SOME yogurts , and string cheese . She started preschool this year after having been home with me for her whole life . She was sick ALL . THE . TIME . Honestly , before Christmas break , she 'd missed twenty two days of school . Mostly it was colds , which normally would 've been okay to send her with , but her body responded with fevers every time , and that meant staying home . She got Mono - who even knew little kids could get that ? She got a fake flu - never even heard of that , some virus that acts just like the flu ie aches and coughs and fever , but not the actual influenza virus . Anyway ... I talked to a nutritionist and she recommended that with her not so great diet I should get her vitamins made from whole foods vs chemicals . She said the body absorbs them better and it 's obviously a more healthy choice to go with real over lab created . So I bought a bottle of yummi bears - her recommendation - at a well-known , overpriced health food grocery store . IN THE STORE , A 90 CT BOTTLE WAS 19.99 . So if you 're looking for yummi bears , Amazon is the way to go . FAR BETTER PRICED THAN IN THE STORE . Also , they passed the taste test - MY PICKY KIDDO SAID THEY 'RE TASTY . Having said all that - it 's actually a bit of a disappointment to see how LITTLE NUTRITIONAL VALUE they actually have . They 've only got VITAMIN A , C AND E , and if your child is OVER THE AGE OF FOUR , THEY ONLY MEET 50 % DV OF VITAMIN A AND E . You may as well just be giving your child a vitamin C tablet , and that 's one vitamin I 'm sure my child gets anyway , through her love of fruits . I will continue to look for a wholefood , more nutritional , TASTY vitamin . : /
 My Pro Twist mop has a stiff brush at the bottom of the mop for hard to remove spots , stains and stuck on matter from tile floors . -LRB- My dogs are 18 and 15 years old and accidents happen . -RRB- I use my mop daily and it works beautifully without much effort at scrubbing so I ordered this refill and was very disappointed to find that there was no brush at the bottom but rather a small `` scuff eraser '' which will not do the job I need it to do and is not that great on scuff marks either . If this information had been included in the description , I would not have ordered it .
 First of all 500 mg is too high of dose , and they should not recommond 2 -LRB- 1000mg -RRB- ... i took one , and felt a energy , headache , and could not fall a sleep ... it does not seem to be helping much with attention ... however it does gives you engergy if you are feeling like not getting up doing ur daily work ...
 Wanted to order but ca n't find a reprint on this product 's nutritional label on any site including this one . A self-serving statement does not suffice . Must be a reason , so I am passing on this product .
 I have bought this same kit TWICE just to make sure it was n't my mistake but no . This henna sucks . They provide pre measured essential oils to add to the henna powder and it comes out so runny that you ca n't do anything with it at all . It runs down the skin and is n't even a paste . If you are interested in doing henna , please get your henna from a reputable henna dealer , not from a box .
 This kit is ok for if you 're just doing henna for fun but its too loose and drains down ruining the art work .
 Ordered this for school the listing shows 12 per box , but you are only getting ONE ROLL , not a whole box , I would not have used the money out of my school budget if I had known . Its a Great Product but they need take out the 12 per box , completely take it out of your listing it is absolutely deceiving .
 The quality of HerbPharm is great . I used a small -LRB- diluted -RRB- amount of thuja topically . It took me two applications to realize my light head -LRB- lower than normal blood pressure -RRB- , slight nausea , and the strange taste in my mouth was from this product . WebMD lists the first two symptoms as possible side effects from oral use . If it can can pass the skin barrier , some of the same side effects can occur w / topical use . I 'm obviously sensitive to thuja -LRB- from a cedar -RRB- , though I have no tree allergies . I was fine after several hours . I urge caution when using this product . Herb side effects can be tricky to check out . Many medical sites do n't list them , and many herb sites gloss over side effects .
 I have a few skin tags now and saw ad on TV for tag away and came here to get it and found what I thought to be same thing in its natural form not called by &#34; skin tag &#34; the brand name . It is something you do n't apply to tags , but it says to dilute some in water a few times a day . I wanted to return it and find out I ca n't as it is classified as a hazardous material . Again with the deceptive advertising .
 This did nothing . There were no instructions so I followed what I found on the internet . Nothing has happened at all .
 this stuff doens ' t work and it smells horrible , waste of time and money spend a little extra money and get something that works
 I was trying to find an alternative to the fake , sweet tasting protein powders you find everywhere , this seemed like it would be the answer . The flavor is terrible , the flavor was more artificial than your standard vanilla or chocolate variety . It only takes a little bit to ruin a whole shake .
 This product was difficult to maneuver and impossible to completely empty . I could only figure that it 's made for using it while prone , gravity being what it is .
 I got this for my grandma to support her arthritic hand , but the cushoning was a bit hard for her .
 Received this item today and it had expired 2 months ago . Now I have the hassle of returning it .
 I have osteoarthritis in my shoulder as well as cartilage degeneration . I tried the Membrell for 30 days and did not notice any difference . It did n't work for me .
 I tried it but it does n't seem to be doing to much . . Maybe you have to keep using them for months . .
 I ordered this battery to replace a worn out one in an APC UPS . First the battery is n't labeled as being a BB Battery but appears to be of comparable size and build quality . The battery was delivered very promptly but the packaging was defiantly lacking . It came without a box and was simply wrapped in a US Postal Service bubble wrap envelope . Franky I could n't care less as to the packaging if the product arrived in one piece , but in my case when I opened the envelope I found that the battery had leaked in the plastic bag in which it was enclosed . I wiped it off with a damp paper towel and hope it did n't loose too much electrolyte , and that it wont leak while it 's installed in the UPS . Also the terminals are a little smaller than the battery it is replacing so you do n't get a very firm connection but it does seem adequate . Overall if the battery holds up it seems to be a good price for what you are getting.UPDATE : The battery lasted 4 months and is DEAD . I though I was getting a good deal . But its off to the recycle bin . This is definitely one of those items that you get what you pay for . Basically it appears to have been some sort of a cheap imitation and was a complete waste of money .
 I purchased a B.B. brand battery but was sent a generic , instead . the photo and item name both mention BB brand but what I was sent was not the type shown in the photo -LRB- same size and voltage but not a name-brand item , that 's my point -RRB- . I would not buy from this seller again .
 This battery will not hold up in the Rotax Kart . I bought 2 batteries and neither lasted for over 30 minutes . Both failed such that the voltage dropped to `` 0 '' volts under any kind of load and neither battery would take a charge . This battery is junk for the Rotax application .
 I placed an order for a 7.2 AH 12V B.B. Battery . Recieved a 7AH 12V B.B. Battery . Waiting on response from company . First experience with company not so good ...
 I just got these and they all expire 11/11 . What a rip off that the exp date was not put on sale site . These are for a first aid room and I will never use all of these by Nov. . I should have spent more money and got ones that exp next year . Never again
 Ordered 10 boxes -LRB- January 2012 -RRB- of the OneTouch Ultra diabetic test strips and one box had a 1/2012 expiration date and the others are 2/2012 . Buyers beware !! Sellers need to be honest enough to give expiration dates , this is a bad omission . Wo n't buy from this seller again .
 I ordered from this company because they had the lowest price on Amazon . I did n't read the reviews because I was in a hurry and it was very late . As others have said these test strips have a very short expiration date . My parents were borderline diabetics so even though I do n't have diabetes and my blood sugar levels are good I like to check it once a month as a precaution . These strips will cost me over $ 4 per test ! Walmart has a much longer expiration date on their strips . I will not purchase from this vendor again .
 I do not recommand it . It does n't give right reading.Don ' t waste your time and money . They have terrible customer service too .
 The 100 strips that I received had an expiration date of July/2009 which means this purchase was a waste of money . I was upset and disappointed .
 There 's always a catch on buying discounted items . Based from my actual experience , the expiration date is less that 3-4 months . This is not publish during the ordering process . Good if you will be using this product at least once or twice a day so that you can consume it within 1-2 month period .
 First of all , One Touch Ultra test strips are an awesome product . The one star rating is for Bargin OTC and their lack of customer service . BUYER BEWARE!I attempted to buy this product from Bargain OTC , but they completely canceled my order with out any reason given . When I inquired and respectfully stated my dissatisfaction for the situation and threatened to never do business with them again , the `` president '' , Bryson Burkholder , replied with a nasty e-mail . He called me `` slanderous '' and accused me of `` trying to capitalize on and not someone who was trying to establish a long term business relationship . '' I was attempting to buy their product ... How else do you establish business relationships?He also said , `` People like you who threaten small businesses is why our country and economy are in such peril today . `` So , if you do n't want your orders randomly cancelled without explanation , or want to be accused of the country 's problems ... Do n't buy from Bargain OTC . They obviously do n't believe in the saying , `` The customer is always right ! ''
 We received the item in what looked like damaged shipping
 ordered this for my mom and it came in a different color box.dissapointed that it wasnt even in english and didnt work . i had to pay to send it and pay to send it back . rally pissed .
 The product of 50 One Touch Ultra Blue strips NEVER ARRIVED!I was told they did and were returned ... no way.I have to go to the post office to receive my mail and talked directly to the Postmaster . . NOTHING CAME FROM Atlantic diabetic supply to my address . . Stop lying . . RETURN MY MONEY . . NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 One Touch Ultra is supposed to be the great solution to the problem of sore fingers . You can draw blood from the forearm , thus saving your fingers . B.B. King even tells us so , and his profession is professional musician and guitarist.Fine.None of this matters , though , if the unit is n't accurate in its results . One Touch Ultra is not accurate.Here is what I mean . You can draw three different samples within a minute of each other from the same finger or forearm stick and get three different results that vary by more than 10 % . This should not happen . Blood sugar does n't change that much that quickly . And if you are taking insulin on a sliding scale , basing the amount you inject on your glucometer 's result , a 10 % variation in insulin can have serious consequences.I 'm giving up on OneTouch and going back to Bayer . It 's results were right in line with my A1c tests . One Touch is not.It would be a good product if only it worked .
 I ordered this last December 25 , 2012 for my mom who lost the same unit when she went to Singapore . This was delivered last Dec 28 and I promptly shipped this to her in the Philiippines without checking the unit . I only found out that I was given a OneTouch Ultra2 which is cheaper and the only reason I found out is the lancet was missing ! It was my fault that I did not check it but I think the vendor is more at fault . They replaced this with a much cheaper unit . Now my mom can not even use it because the lancet she has is the ultra soft which is not compatible with this unit and the set that should have been included was missing . Never again will I buy from this vendor . BUYER BEWARE !
 the smallest bottle I have ever seen and NO it did n't stop nail from bleedingWould not puchase item again
 Ok , I love Claire Burke , but never tried the original scent . It 's has a strange , pine scent - very woody and weird .
 when I first read the reviews for this product , I did n't understand what other reviewers meant when they said that it did n't last . Well I do now . When I first got the box I was excited to plug it in because this was the only fragrance that both my wife and I really liked . So when it got here I opened it up and put it together and set it on # 1 , this way I would be sure that it did n't get to strong and if I wanted it stronger I would put it on # 2 . The first week it was really nice , people who came to the house would right away comment on the fragrance and say that they really liked the smell and that it was n't over powering and that they would like to try it out . This was great because it was validating my choice making and life was good . The following week I noticed that the fragrance was n't as strong and by the end of the second week my wife said that when she came home from the store and walked in through the front door that the fragrance had now decreaced by as much as 3/4 and so I put it on # 2 and nothing . By the third week , the smell was so light that I decided to plug it in the bathroom in hopes that it would at least be enough for that small space and that is where it lasted for an other three days and I finally changed the bottle with an other fragrance and plugged it back in the front room . Sadly the same thing happened to the second bottle and in fact died faster than the first bottle by 2-3 days . I do n't have any idea why this happened but I do n't think I 'll be paying that much for something that only lasts one to two weeks . So it gets two stars cause it lasted 2 weeks twice . I 'll finish what I have left but will not buy again . I hope this helps ?
 I tried to cancel my order and they refused saying it had already shipped -LRB- this was over a week since I had ordered it -RRB- , which was fine . But , when I checked on shipment , it did not ship until the day it was suppose to arrive at my house . I will NEVER use this company again .
 I was very excited to find a quality green tea extract . Unfortunately , every time I take it , I get very nauseous . I felt this way for 5 days straight after I began taking it so I stopped taking it for 4 days during which I had absolutely no nausea at all . The very first time I tried taking it again , I was extremely nauseous within the hour . I 've even tried taking directly with food , does n't help . I have read that polyphenols can cause nausea so I 'm guessing it is the high percentage that is to blame .
 just wish it had the caffeine for that jump start feeling . I 'm not sensitive to it so I definitely need it . I accidently purchased it without realizing that it was decaffeinated .
 I thought I was getting decaf coffee extract . I have been taking it as directed and do n't notice anything different .
 The product details for this product fail to state how many mg EGCG are in each capsule . How can anyone buy supplements online without knowing this very basic info ?
 I like the product , but I ordered the -LRB- 3 -RRB- RED mini vinyl shoes as pictured to replace one my dog had and got -LRB- 3 -RRB- black ones instead . My floor is dark and dog has black coat , so hard to find .
 One of the batteries lasted less than a day . Several others lasted a day . I e-mailed vender , but received no response .
 These appeared to be a very good buy , however , they are completely unreliable . Some will last an expected three days , some only a few hours , and many are completely dead upon activation . So far , I have encountered two complete cards -LRB- 6 batteries per card -RRB- that were dead . I still have several cards left , but I do not know how they will perform . I just can not count on them to work . This is , by far , the worst purchase I have made through Amazon . This vendor should be eliminated and no longer carried by Amazon . There is no quality or quality control here .
 the battery did not fit my hearing aid and got stuck in there for many days -- no hearing aid place could dislodge it.i finally took it to a watch repair store where they were able to.i got no satisfaction at all from the ` idiot ' i spoke to at the place i bought the batteries from -- after many e mails.finally gave up . am afraid to try a different battery in the hearing aid for fear it will get stuck also . i have never had a problem putting a battery in my hearing aid before this or since.i
 I was pleased with the price and delivery . However many of the batteries have not worked . I guess I should have stuck with a name brand .
 I will be placing my 3rd order for these and I have had no problems with them . As others stated it takes a few moments for them to `` power up '' , but other than that they are fine . Anyone that said they do n't last must be doing something wrong . On average they last the same 6-7 days that any other battery does . For the price even if they last a day less it is still a deal.Edit
 The reason these batteries are so inexpensive is their lack of life . Hearing aid batteries have lasted me 5-7 days in the past . These batteries last no more than 24 hours . It 's a darn shame .
 The battery covers must be left off for 3 minutes before they will be charged . Inserting them fresh will fail - not explained on the packets . Also they are strangely constructed - not lkike ohers . The anode and cagthode look somewhat similar . The help desk was courteous and explained some of this .
 I am getting one or two days from these . Previous batteries have given 4-5 days of service . In addition , although not a deal breaker for me , the tabs are quite short and difficult to manage .
 These batteries do not last more than a few minutes
 I have incurred $ 500 . in repairs due to the batteries I ordered from icell . They got stuck in my hearing aids and I have had to send thee aids out for repair to remove these batteries
 Garbage , last two day at best . many only last one day or less.worst battery i ever bought for a hearing aid
 I bought this brand because my wife had good results with her 312 batteries . Only a few dead ones now and then . With my 10 's I am experiencing about 30-40 % dead ones . I am going back to Zenipower .
 This the 3rd time I have purchased these batteries . They always were pretty good . This time I install a new battery in the morning and by evening it is dead . Not sure if it is a defective box of batteries or they have changed them .
 This product is manufactured poorly . The batteries are very difficult to remove from hearing aids . Many of the batteries only last a few minutes . I have discontinued use and will dispose of 90 of the 120 purchased . I will not purchase this item again . I have purchased from two other manufactures without any problem .
 How many mil . in thickness ??? How many gallons in capacity each?How many bags per package ?
 I took these years ago when I actually met Michael , well let me tell you these vitamins broke my skin outt really badly and it started to make my hair fall out . I would not reccomend ANY of his products to anyone .
 The product instructions state to take this product 3x per day but , I admittingly , for the most part , took it 2x per day . The pills were quite large & hard , so sometimes they made me gag . It has been over a month now and I have not noticed ANY improvements in my hair , skin , or nails . Actually , my skin seems to be very dry now . Not sure if it is from this product , but as of today , I am not taking any more . The last 10 pills have been flushed.Michael 's Health Products - Hair Skin & Nails , 90 tablets
 Got an energy boost the first few days but after that did n't even notice a difference and definately did n't result in weight loss . I have once again found that there is n't a magic pill - eat clean and the weight will fall off without any supplements required : D
 I bought this on the recomendation of my neurologist.I 've been taking it for 2 months along with B2 and Magnesium.I 'm actually having more migraines every month since I started taking these supplements.They have not been helpful for me .
 Never got a chance to rip the benefits of this oil . It smells just like a fuel -LRB- my friends confirmed -RRB- and I can not put in my mouth something that smells like a gasoline ... I using it as a moisturizer for legs for about 3 weeks , but do not see any change : -LRB-
 Another reviewer stated this this product smelled like fuel . I should have listened ; it is an apt description , though it also TASTES bad . I took a spoonful and gagged and gagged and gagged . Well , I finally got it down , I thought , and now I 'm done with it . NOT ! I belched the stuff for the next NINE hours ! Always a glutton for punishment , I mixed a spoonful with my morning hot oat bran . It made the whole bowl unpalatable and I had to throw it out . I have ordered some wheat germ oil softgels , but if they make me belch fuel like the liquid , I 'm throwing in the towel . Good luck to those of you made of sterner stuff ... 6/5/11 Addendum . I am now using the wheat germ oil softgels -LRB- made by a different company -RRB- with no undesirable side effects . No taste , no smell , no belching !
 Call me a dummy , this was not what I expected , the key word being &#34; Gel &#34; , it does n't harden , not good for cookies , and that 's what I do . I do n't know what I was thinking . My fault
 I succumbed to the temptation yet again - save 15 bucks , get the knock off , it 's all made in the same factory in China , I told myself . These Norelco replacement blades were half the price of `` official '' blades , so I bit . And found out they bite . They looked the same , they fit . I put them in , turned on the razor , and within 5 seconds they started rattling , a blade snared the guard and bent it . I tried shaving anyway , and it felt like a lawnmower , and left my beard as long as my lawn . I ended up throwing them away and buying a whole new Norelco razor !
 I grow stevia plants and crumble the leaves into my drinks . I thought this natural greenish-colored powder would have the same taste . Unfortunately , it tastes like dust , not pure stevia . I prefer Stevita liquid stevia , unflavored . This powder was a big disappointment . My daughter felt the same way , and it was she who passed the Planetary Formulas stevia on to me .
 Okay so I bought stevia before and it was in the white powder form and tasted pretty good . So I ordered this . First I was thrown off by its `` au natural green color '' but I figured hey it is good for me . Well this product is the definition of `` Bad after taste '' ... It simply made everything I added it to taste terrible . I have thrown away alot of ice tea and coffee I flavored with this ; than I just threw this way ... everything is better now ... yuckkkkkk . !!!
 The only reason that I bought this product was because I love the laundry softener and the dish detergent . This product really disappointed me because you can barely smell the scent . I followed the directions and then when that did n't create a scent , I literally vacuumed the beads up with the vacuum . That worked a little bit , but I would NOT recommend waisting your money . Go for the sheet spray and spritz a bit on your carpets after your vacuum and that works much better !
 Having used this brand of Cane for several years , I was disappointed to see that the latest rendition is much less sturdy , since the metal now has smaller circumference and does n't feel the same gauge . Gives feeling of being more fragile and less supportive.Also , the securing ` plastic washer ' -LRB- used to lock the setting after adjusting the height -RRB- cracks more easily than in older models.To keep costs down the manufactured product quality has significantly diminished in my opinion .
 Gave me night sweats so I stopped taking it . I do not have any thyroid conditions so maybe it was too strong for me
 After all the wonderful things I read about people taking Sea Kelp , I have to say I am pretty disapointed I experienced nothing but COMPLETE NAUSEA after taking this product . Sick , sick sick sick sick ! Upset stomach big time ! So I cut it in half , still sick . Cut that in half , forget about it . I thought I had an iron stomach . But I get less of a bad reaction taking iron . And we all know what iron does to your stomach . Blech ! Even taking with food does nothing to lessen the effects . And besides that , I notice no ` smoother skin ' or ` quicker metabolism ' like some reported on getting . Big fat waste of money.On top of that , I read there is major mercury in these kelp products . One woman suspects her own mom died of mercury poisoning after taking like 4 of these a day . I do n't know how anyone can stomach 4 a day , but apparently , if you look up `` Sea Kelp '' they will say mercury is in it big time.So , here it sits in my drawer . Another Dr. Oz recomendation gone to pot . I 'm starting to think Dr. Oz never met a suppliment he did n't like . Unless you can actully get Sea Kelp in real form , I 'd steer clear of the suppliments . As I said , I thought I had an iron stomach . Just thinking about taking this stuff is enough to make me nauseous !
 The vibration was too loud and the pillow was uncomfortable . I am going back to the inflatable pillow .
 This is too misshaped to be called a pillow . It was thrown out after two tries .
 This product came as it was promised ... I would definitely buy from this company again in the future . Glad it 's available online it just did n't work for me .
 I didnt realize the shipping would be 2 - 3 times more the product cost , only buy this if you going to buy in bulk , otherwize any other product from this store will do just as well , nothing special about this one , only that is did smell nice , but did I really need to pay so much in shipping to smell this for a momment or so , NO !!
 I just bought this today b/c I was out of a pumic foot scrub I love that I bought abroad and figured `` how much can can this kind of thing differ ? `` A lot . OMG - the smell is vile - when was the last time anyone served you Plum/Peppermint tea ? Never ! For a reason!But more importantly , there was very little grit in this `` pumic '' scrub - nothing abrasive enough to scrape off anything . Total waste of money . Will return if I have the time , though unlikely .
 This item did not do anything for me . This is not a review of the brand-name , but of the supplement itself .
 This is too thick for insertion for my partner so it is unusable , it is a nice material , however , so if you like it nice and thick and long , it is a good product for you .
 If you are looking for tips that are durable , do n't buy these . The edges start to fray in a week or so under moderate use and in a couple of weeks they are dangerous to use .
 These tips did n't even last me a month . They 're a very soft grade of rubber and just did n't hold up to any sort of standard use , much less extended use . I would avoid them .
 I 've gone through 4 sets in eleven weeks and I have not been very active with the crutches . Not only do they wear down quickly they have a tendancy to stick to tile or other smooth surfaces due to suction . I imagine if you have a cane and are sedentry they would be satisfactory but anyone that wants to get around and really walk you should look elsewhere . The end of my crutches came through my last set from carex after 8 days of use . The 5th set I have now is from medline and are definitely a better quality but I can see they are wearing down after 6 days of use although I anticipate them lasting longer , they are a bit firmer .
 I have had these tip no even 2 months ... and I went through two pairs already , JUDGE FOR YOUR SELF !
 Yes , I would like to make a comment about the Carex XL crutch tips ordered on Aug. 30 . One set is already worn out and needs to be replaced . He is used to them lasting much longer . -LRB- These were a new brand he tried -RRB- The man in question that I ordered these tips for lives in the Desert , near Tucson . He walks everywhere as much as the weather permits.If you are wondering , yes , we have well maintained dirt roads . He has never had a set of tips wear out so fast . They were ordered on the 30th of Aug. and by 10/1 a month later one set is shredded , literally . He has been on crutches for years as he has but one leg , the other lost in a Motorcycle accident , years ago . He is afraid to try and send back , as he can not afford any shipping .
 There is no credible mechanism by which homeopathy can work , no plausible reason to think it should , and the weight of scientific evidence is that it does not work beyond placebo.The following books are essential reading for anyone considering this quack remedy : Bad ScienceandTrick or Treatment ?
 This product did nothing to lower my blood sugar readings . However , it must work for some people as it is recommended by Dr. Richard Bernstein , the chief proponent of extreme low-carb diets . Dr. Bernstein . who likes his patients to maintain A1-C numbers in the normal range -LRB- not just in the `` normal-for-diabetics '' range -RRB- , writes that he adds it to diets of patients who are not quite hitting the target with traditional medications . Perhaps I will give it a try at a later date , but for now I am getting better results with other products ,
 I had a blood glucose level of 156 . After three months on taking this product as directed , it was only reduced to 152 .
 As a type two diabetic I was already taking prescription drugs that my doctor ordered and when I took this I brooke in a rash inside and out . Very uncomfortable . It sent my blood sugar through the roof via improved uptake then made me crash emotionally about 5 hrs later . It did not lower my blood sugar or make it easier to control . I quit taking it and will not start again . I did some checking on this stuff and there is not one real credible evidence about its efficacy other than the manufacture and there is some dispute about the technical details of the actual chemistry of it on the net . So i would not recommend this for any diabetic unless the doctors prescribed it for you . I should have never bought the bottle of what ever it is .
 Why take pills that are `` natural '' ? You can drop your blood sugars by removing from your diet the very thing that raises your blood sugar ... carbohydrates - even complex carbs are broken down into simple sugars by the digestive system . I have Reactive Hypoglycemia -LRB- and a father and older brother with diabetes -RRB- . RH is also known as pre-diabetes . I can fix the damage but I 'm not getting worse . In fact , I started following Primal Blueprint -LRB- Mark Sisson -RRB- over a year and a half ago . At 42 I feel better than I ever have in my life , I dropped 12lbs below the lowest weight I 've seen as an adult - and it was fat and water - no loss of muscle mass and with very little exercise . AND - my digestive system is getting better finally . Even the healthiest version of the Standard American Diet would n't fix my RH . A bowl of oatmeal and an apple had me shaking like a leaf 90 minutes later . Now it 's eggs and bacon -LRB- look up The Great Cholesterol Con and Ignore The Awkward
 I 've read a lot of good things about Insulow on diabetes boards . However , when I took it for about two weeks , it gave me severe indigestion and I finally discontinued it . I did n't notice any changes in my blood glucose readings , but it really did n't have long enough to work . As always , YMMV .
 This product 's active ingredients are alpha lipoic acid and biotin -- these are common ingredients in natural multivitamin formulas which would be a better value . I am type II diabetic and have found the following herb/vitamin formulas to be excellent : Nature 's Way Blood Sugar formula -LRB- $ 7 per bottle -RRB- Geromatrix Glucose Balance -LRB- $ 28/bottle -RRB- Life Enhancement Insulife -LRB- $ 24/bottle -RRB- Wild Tibetan Goji Berries for repair of tissues damaged by high blood sugar .
 Well , contacted this company because I did n't receive product in a timely matter , they responded that they would ship it out as soon as they received it from the manufacturer . I thought , okay . . I know this is a hot item now ... I understand . I waited and kept tracking the package after I was notified it shipped . I saw on the USPS tracking site ... incorrect address . I double checked the address that I entered , sure enough , I entered the correct address . Two bottles -LRB- 1 oz . each -RRB- were to be sent to my daughters address ... 1 for her and 1 for myself . I contacted this seller via e-mail once again , asking if they could correct the mistake . They responded that they would have someone contact me responsible for this , no one did . Today I received a call from my dtr . Only 1 2oz . bottle was finally delivered to her ... Not -LRB- 2 -RRB- 1oz . bottles that I ordered . SO ... I do n't get a bottle after all !! An enclosed note explained that they had to use a different manufacturer than their current one , and the 1oz . bottle is out of stock , hence the reason for sending out the 2oz . bottle . I looked up the manufacturer that they used ... the Electic Institute at Pharmaca . Currently , their 1 oz . bottle is selling for $ 7.49 , regular price $ 9.99 ... much lower than what I paid to this company !!!!! They do n't have a 2oz . size available on their site . Looks like Herb Pharm -LRB- Herbs Pro -RRB- pocketed and profited from what should 've been my savings !!!!! And ... I did n't receive a bottle for myself !! Very unhappy !! Needless to say , I ca n't tell you if the product works . I can only inform the next person of my personal experience with the order/shipment process . I have no other experience with this company , perhaps they have a good track record the majority of the time ... this time , they dropped the ball .
 I SAW THIS ITEM ON DR. OZ AND CLAIMS IT WORKS WITH STRESS ALSO , I READ A REVIEW FROM HERE AND IT SAID IT MAKES YOU SLEEPY . I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT NONE OF THIS WORKS FOR ME .
 Gave me a headache , I was disappointed . I bought 2 bottles so I would n't have to reorder , saw it on the Dr. OZ show
 Did not work for that purpose . Maybe it is good and is used for something else . It did not help me though .
 Maybe this just works for some but it did nothing for me or my daughter . It was sticky feeling and the smell was n't great either .
 After using the bottle , although I as lead to believe it would have an &#34; immediate &#34; effect , I never noticed any .
 TV doctors like Dr Oz and Dr Mike was hyping up this product . &#8220; Same effects as valium . &#8221; Thought it would relax me . This had absolutely no effect on me . Not just this particular Lemon Balm , I tried all 3 offered by Amazon . All 3 were a total waste of money . All 3 in the trash .
 First of all , make sure that you mix it with water ... do not try to take it on its own ! Did n't work for me or my husband -LRB- that we noticed -RRB- I have anxiety , so maybe it seemed to have no effect compared to the medications I take .
 Having had problems with my arches , I decide , after seeing many commercials , to order the orthotics . I placed the order by dredit card , they said there was A MONEYBACK POLICY . After waiting a few weeks for them to arrive -LRB- because I wouldnt pay extra for quick shipping -RRB- they finally came . I tried them for almost a week . my legs were hurting more than usual and so was my back . I decided to return them . Of course , if you return them you have to pay for return postage , by certified mail . I waited a number of weeks and when I checked my credit card charges , I noticed that they hadnt given me credit on my card . I called their laughable customer service number , i dont know how many times . The phione would ring a number of times then a message would give me another number and a message would say that the person who handles returns had a full mailbox and couldnt take any message.I called again , got a person who said they would transfer me to someone who could help.After that , I would hear a hang up.Frustrating to say the least . I had proof from the post office that someone had signed for the return , weeks before . Finally after utter frustration , I called my charge card company . They somehow got through and I got my credit . All in all , I paid for shipping both ways and in the end lost about half the money I paid for them . unless you want a lot of agravation , I would stay away from this place .
 Ordered WalkFit inserts for myself and my fiancee . Followed their instructions for about 10 days -LRB- 3 days past their `` break in '' period -RRB- . I could n't wait to get them out of my shoes by the end of the day . Foot adjusted somewhat , but not that much . Same with my fiancee . Decided to return them.Sent them back via UPS with deliver confirmation and signature . Walk Fit received them back in mid-September , 2005 . No refund given as of yet . No returned emails or phone calls to customer service.Bottom line
 Horribly uncomfortable and unable to wear for any length of time . Hard plastic cuts into feet and arches ached dreadfully after walking for only 5 minutes . Made second attempt to wear them days later and the pain was worse as my foot never recovered from the first attempt . Padding the hard plastic by wearing thick socks did not help . Flaws also noted in plastic .
 Buyer beware . I ended up with 2 pairs of this total junk of a product by mistake . Since I had two pairs - I tried returning the one -LRB- NEVER EVEN OPENED -RRB- with no reply , no help , and return from the company.Bottom line the product is REALLY really thick . It 's pretty hard , and it did n't help me . I tried to break in these orthodics - I really needed some arch support as I had heal pain and arch pain . It was n't even like I saw some hope after wearing the product after some time . They were awful and remained awful . I feel like I completely wasted my money.A co-worker had mentioned these you might be able to ` grind ' and shape to your own foot - which then might be an advantage . I do n't want to cut and ` grind ' my own though . It 's certainly not what I had purchased these for.Recently Dr. Scholls came out with a women 's sport type insole . It 's no orthodic - but it 's worth the $ 10 unlike this product . The Dr. Scholls has a gel type soft cushion in the front and heel of the foot AND it had a tiny itty bitty type arch support . Again - better than nothing - and has actually helped my sore feet . Still looking for the perfect one , but found something else that gave relief.Do yourself a favor and read as many reviews prior to purchasing this walk fit product . It might work for some - but did n't work what-so-ever for my feet .

 I 'm giving this product a two because it did n't seem to have any effect on me . My lymph nodes all over my body are always swollen and I 've seen several doctors over the years who have no answer or treatment for it . I am young and have no known health problems , but it just annoying in general . I thought I would try this product because I read it would cleansing your lymphatic system . I saw no difference to my body in any way except that my bank account was $ 26 lighter . Not going to give it a one because maybe it does work for other ailments . In general I take a lot of supplements , but I have a rule that I do n't keep taking unless i can see a real difference . This one is no longer in my cabinet .
 I thought these sounded * so * awesome and I was super excited to try them . It sounded like from the reviews the cherry flavor was getting the most positive reviews , so I ordered those.My 20 month old son was excited to try them and took a big bite . He promptly spit the bar out and proceeded to scrap the remaining bar off of his tongue with his hand . So , these were not a winner there , which was the main reason I got them.My husband also tried them since he is a huge fan of all foods cherry . He said it tasted nasty and would n't eat the rest of the bar.I think the bars are okay . They are slightly sweet and kind of have a funky after taste . I can taste the bell peppers in them and I hate bell peppers . They make an okay snack , not my first choice but I am stuck with a case of them so I guess I will be eating them . I am willing to endure a little funny taste it is is healthy for me : - -RRB- Our family is no stranger to a variety of strange healthy foods ; tofu is a big winner as are freeze-dried fruit snacks . Unfortunately these bars were just too yucky tasting . To be honest my son likes his vegetables better fresh . I was really disappointed because these would make great , non-messy , easy to transport snacks . I guess I 'll just have to keep my eyes open for a different great veggie product .
 The product certainly looks sleek and pretty when you get it , but as soon as it 's touched by moisture -LRB- which a toilet brush holder will , invariably , be -RRB- rust ! Got it two months ago and the entire bottom is now rusted and unsightly .
 They are about 2/3 the size of regular brushes and stands , but if you 're fine with it being smaller , then you 'll like them . -LRB- Esp . great for tiny cramped bathrooms -RRB- . You 'll find they 're cheaper than the silver ones you get at walmart , bed bath and beyond , target , etc , but you also get less of a brush and stand.the bottom section looks a bit stupid since it 's not totally in proportion to the skinny body of the cleaner , but I suppose to make it more sturdy they needed a bigger circumference for the base.If I did n't have to pay s & h ; it would have been well worth it . So instead of spending about $ 60 bucks for 4 stands , I spent a little less than $ 40 .
 I have now bought two of these cleaners . The first one came with the shaver . Within about a year , the arm stopped locking in place so I had to rig a rubber band to hold it in place . Six months after that , the cleaner stopped working altogether.So I bought a replacement unit . Within weeks , the machine started malfunctioning . Some times I hear it cleaning in the middle of the night . It just starts up of its own accord despite the fact that this is more than 15 hours after I shaved . Now it does not disengage and leaves the razor wet when I go to use it in the morning.Nice idea for a product , but the quality is lousy .
 Please note
 The motor still runs but no cleaning solution is sucked in through the holes . I checked all openings for clogs but everything is clear ... this must be my 5th clean and charge station ; all others continued to work until they failed to lock the shaver into position . At least they worked for a few years ...
 It took me awhile to realize that it doesnt work , it makes sounds like it is working but does not suck the cleaning fluid up and into the razor . After using it a week or two I noticed the shaver wasnt clean so I checked the fluid and noticed that it was perfectly clean , unused . I replaced it with a fresh cartridge to see if that is the problem but got the same result . It charges ok but i can do that without the system but simply plugging the razor diretly into the wire . I really needed it to clean the razor and it does not .

 I ordered this product after checking the photo -LRB- which is the correct one for me -RRB- and got a different brushhead , which does not fit my spinbrush . What a disappointment .
 Recieved a CURAD product instead of the NONNET07 product that I ordered . The CURAD product does not have the retention for reuse .
 I used to use the oral b toothbrushes and then decided to venture out and try others . After reading the reviews on Amazon , decided to give the Spinbrush Pro a spin . After 3 weeks , I am retiring the Spinbrush and returning to Oral B.The head of the brush is much larger than the head of the oral b brushes . The smaller head is much easier to use and reaches the various crevices that a normal brush and the spinbrush can not get to.The spinbrush is also very harsh on the tooth enamel - much more so than the oral b models . The powerful motor - a gas guzzler by all accounts - is too powerful for me . It 's also a little too noisy.If you really want to get this one instead of the oral b , would suggest giving the soft bristles version a whirl instead - the softer bristles might be a little less abrasive on the enamel than this is.But the price and the fact that it does do its basic job - cleaning teeth - keeps me from giving it a 1 .
 I have an older set of 900mAH Powerex batteries - 8 of about 80 rechargeables I own . I just got a BC1000 battery analyzer and went through all of mine . All 8 Powerex were bad - averaging about 620mAh after just a year of use . Enloops were all still at 95-110 % of their rated strength . You should n't be paying more than $ 2.50 each for a AAA , and that 's for the newer low discharge chemistry , which I do n't think these are .
 Bought these for a small Chinese MP3 player I found in a parking lot , and thought `` What the heck , I 'll get some rechargeable AAA batt 's and make it my gym rig . '' From the moment I used them , they had little juice . After a recharge , they had little juice . In fact , my battery power indicator on the MP3 player only showed one notch -LRB- out of three possible -RRB- every time I used them , and they died very quickly . I thought that maybe it was just the cheap MP3 player , so I went and bought the cheapest , crummiest alkaline batteries I could fine , and they held a charge WAY longer than these . I gave them two stars because at least I could recharge them and reuse them , even if they only lasted for a few hours .
 All of the reviews I read I thought what a great deal . I purchased 12 batteries ofPowerex AA 2700mAh NiMH Rechargeable Batteries w/holder - 4 Batteries Per Packthese plus the charger and I was greatly disappointed in both . Did not get the the charge lenth or power out put . I read the booklet and under stood how this system works . I found that Harbor frieght has better batteries , and do last longer and cheaper . thank you for read of this .

 This current fad of trying to heal many health problems by wiping out a supposed `` Systemic Yeast Infection '' is a scam . It preys on those of us suffering from certain ailments . `` Systemic Yeast Infection '' is bunk.And this product is garbage . I took only two does a week ago -LRB- with charcoal , as they recommend -RRB- and I am still suffering the side effects
 I used this about one time . I was so taken by the Jojoba line that I figured this would smell as nice . However it was totally disappointed . The cream makes your fingers soft but I myself can not stand the strong scent . It is overpowering . If feels like I sprayed on a gallon of perfume or something . The bag that came with this set was cheap - the gloves were okay - but of course you can find these anywhere . If you have never tried the La Source line I suggest you skip on this because it takes a special person to like this scent . All I can say is if you like smelling like a strong container of dried flowers this is for you . The smell of potpourri is great for the house but when you are wearing it - that 's a little too much . GUYS will run !
 I used this product for a few months and at first I was feeling really good , but after the month wore off I had to take more and more and it seemed like a constant expensive circleI did take the advice of one of your reviewers and went to the health food store and bought a good probiotic and that made a world of difference and I did save a lot of money and got much better results
 I would recommend caution with this product , just in case you are like me and have a reaction to it . I have a lot of trouble with reactions , so I cautiously took only a few grains of the powder the first time and immediately had some trouble breathing and felt ill . I waited several weeks to try it again and noted a similar reaction , although not as severe since I used less powder . If you have any concerns about reactions , do n't take it . I am going to send it back , because although it may work well for others , something in it bothers me -- I 'm guessing it 's the yeast . If they made this product without the yeast I woul try it again just to see if I could tolerate it.The oxygen drops were fine , but if you use the full dosage you may notice a slightly corrosive effect when you swallow it . Be sure to use the full amount of water suggested .
 I 've been taking this for 3 weeks and I still have Candida . This is a scam
 What I hate was that I did not get the other starch that I thought I ordered ... where it said `` buy both '' for a certain price . I got this one only and paid $ 9.00 for it which was ridiculous !!!!!
 I purchased these batteries to use in my automatic car door locks and they worked for about a day . I tried to use them in BOTH of my clickers and had no luck .
 I bought this magnifier & am disappointed to find that with very little use the plastic lens gets badly scratched . There is no pouch or cover , and the lens is flush with the rim , so just laying it on a table will cause scratches on the -LRB- much too soft -RRB- plastic lens . Real glass would have been a better idea , along with a rim that prevents contact with any flat surface .
 Amazon states that this product is a pack of 3 - 4.22 oz bottles . This comes to a total of 12.66 oz for over $ 13 yet the site also states that this price is $ .35 / oz . It 's actually more than $ 1 an oz ! This does not add up and is not a good deal . I typically take Amazon for it 's word and move quickly through the site purchasing what looks like a good deal . This however , did not take long to do the math and realize that it is not adding up . I hope that it is an oversight and not Amazon trying to pull the wool over on anyone .
 I 've tried other products - Tite-Grip , etc. - and have n't found the perfect solution , so I thought I 'd try this product . So far , it 's such a diluted blend of antiperspirant -LRB- mixed with I-don ` t-know-what -RRB- that it takes forever to dry , produces a nominal benefit -LRB- if any -RRB- , and is bulky , thanks to the spray nozzle . Yecchh .
 My order never arrived !!! they wrote from Milano and send me a lot of paper for customs , and so my order is in Milano ! I send the paper with all the information but my order never arrived !!! please write me what i could do!thank you a lot
 I purchased several of these braces to replace 2 that I 've used for several years . However , within 2 weeks the stitching is falling apart . They do n't look like they 'll last another month . I was highly disappointed .
 Not much more I can say ... certainly not worth the money . I 'm all about Nature 's Way , but it did n't do a thing for me .
 Been taking this product for a month now and I 'm still fighting glandular infection . My brother and his wife take it and love it . Will try it a little longer .
 After finding out about the flush free products , I tried them . It has no effect on wellness . I take the supplement in the winter time and 500mg in the morning and 500mg at night . It can actually save you money on your heating bill it activates the circulation and you feel warmer all the time . The flush feeling is not that bad and if it is a bother , than reduce the dosage by cutting the tablet in half .
 I bought this set for my 20 months old son . The finger brush is good . The finger case part is sturdy , so your finger wo n't get hurt too bad when your kids bite on it . And its brush part works well too.The toothbrush 's bristle is too hard . When I gave it to my son the first time , he immediately put it into his mouth since he had been very interested in a toothbrush for a while -LRB- I used to only use one finger brush on him -RRB- . He of course did not know how to use it to brush his teeth but just biting on it . A few minutes later I could see some pinkish saliva dripped from his mouth , so I pulled it out . I saw the brush was tilted and 2 or 3 bristles sticking out from the brush . I tried the brush myself , and I felt it was not soft enough , and that 2 or 3 bristles really hurt my gum . I guess it hurt my son 's gum badly and the pinkish saliva was from his blood . I never gave him this toothbrush again .
 The idea of this set is nice , but the toothbrush bristles are not quite soft enough for baby 's teeth/gums and a little large for baby 's mouth , and the gum stimulator -LRB- which is the main reason I got this set for my teething baby -RRB- is a bit too big for my baby 's mouth too , and he gags on it pretty easily . The finger brush is good - the same as any other . However , none of the products are BPA-Free , and they 're all made in China , which is always a red flag for me these days ; especially for something that I 'm putting in my baby 's mouth . If you 're looking for a good gum stimulator/massager , I suggest the other one we got which fits my baby 's mouth much nicer , is BPA-Free and is offered with free shipping by Giggle
 The quality of the changing pad is fine , but the colors are SLIGHTLY off from the rest of the set which I did n't understand . If you are ordering this to match other items from the nursery , you 'll notice that the colors look a little different eg . olive green polka dots instead of lime green , etc. . I purchased another one from another vendor -LRB- since I needed a backup anyway -RRB- thinking that the colors would match , however , there was no difference . In addition , if you are looking to use it on a standard changing pad cushion , the belt straps do not easily fit through the holes so you may have to rip into the fabric a little to get it in .
 After some research I think Profresh is probably a better choice . Closys uses only stabilized chlorine dioxide which is , in fact , not chlorine dioxide at all -- it is buffered sodium chlorite . Buffered sodium chlorite is activated by the addition of an acid and that forms chlorine dioxide . But the problem is that this only remains stable for about 48 hours.I proved this by adding vinegar to the Closys solution and it turned a yellowish color , THAT is chlorine dioxide and that is what you get in Profresh . I do n't recommend anyone do this because if you add too much acid you can cause decomposition to a hazardous gas . I just wanted to prove the point to myself.If you want to kill bacteria it is activated chlorine dioxide that you want and Profresh is probably a better choice .
 After reading all the previous positive reviews , it influenced me to purchase the Closys Oral Rinse . Unfortunately , the product does not live up its hype . In fact , I am disappointed that the product does not last very long , maybe 1 hour max of fresh breathe . -LRB- I did not even eat or drink anything after I rinsed with Closys -RRB- . There were no detailed instructions on flossing , using a tongue scraper , or any additional preventive routine . I ca n't believe other reviewers rate the product so high ??? Luckily , I found a much better product called ProFresh . The company gives a detailed preventive routine which only takes a few minutes to do . Even morning bad breath completely disappeared . However , there is a sight Clorox taste . To my amazement , I now have fresh breath all day .
 I used this product on one surface , and it left it shiny and oil . Nothing I use will get rid of it and I 'm really frustrated . Not even normal plegde will get rid of this oily residue .
 The price per ounce is shown as $ .13 / oz , but my calculator says it 's $ .64 . Strange , I thought sellers had calculators , too . This error may be inadvertent
 If you want to remove a layer of skin along with the hair you intended to shave off , then this razor is for you ! As for me , I 'm going back to my trusty Gillette Venus . If zero stars was available as a rating , I 'd have given it zero stars .
 as this might be a cute little item i used once . when i tryed to remove battery it stuck . i can not open therefor this is useless . i tryed to return and was told nonreturnable . . where does that say in item info ? also kinda weak
 They must have cheaped out on the design , they are not as powerfull as they used to be . Typical I gues now a days , cheaper product for more money . I 'll be looking for something else .
 Just got it and it does not work and has n't since i took it out of the package . Waste of money .
 These things stink , literally and figuratively . It actually smells when you open the package , and the patch itself has a sticky goo on one side that you are supposed to stick onto your skin . -LRB- You will get a light sticky goo all over your hands from applying the patch -- and your hands will smell strongly of bengay . -RRB- But worse than that , these patches never actually get hot . They just `` tingle . '' I have not found that stinky , sticky tingling provides any pain relief . But if you want your sore area to tingle , stink , and feel slimy for 8 hours , then this is the product for you . Personally , I will go back to buying Thermacare from now on . Thermacare patches are odorless , do not stick to your skin , and provide dry heat for 8 + hours .
 This product is a total waste of money , in no way did it aid in the arthritis discomfort
 VERY THIN MATERIALi THOUGH THIS WAS COMPARABLE TO LUVSVERY POOR QUALITYLAST TIME TO PURCHASE NOT PLEASED AT ALL
 I tried this for a while and after 2 applications -LRB- over the course of 3-or-so days -RRB- I noticed it not only left some white stains on my teeth , but they would also disappear the next day , making me think the whitening process was n't that effective .
 this product did n't work at all . left product in as directed and even stepped it up to 2 hrs . teeth never changed color . VERY DISPAPPOINTED !!!!
 I bought this item to get my teeth whiter for my sister 's wedding . I already had the mouthpiece from previously whitening with gel purchased from a dentist . The first clue I received that this product was not going to work well was that I felt no tingling , pain etc. when the gel was in . I remember when I used the product from my dentist , my gums would tingle and hurt by the end , and my teeth would have sensitivity . Not that I am promoting mouth pain ! But it means that there is a chemical doing its job . The level of this gel was higher than that I purchased from my dentist , and I felt nothing and had no sensitivity . I still continued to the use the product though , in hopes that maybe my teeth had just become less sensitive . But at the end of a couple months , I still had little change to the level of whitness of my teeth .
 was order this battery was expecting something different , not some chinese products whit no name on , package was cheapCR1620 3V Lithium Cell
 Unless you love the repeated taste of turmeric - do not purchase this product ... besides it is only 50 % turmeric rhizome - the say 250 mg and the remainder is Curcumin - 250 mg ... . I have taken turmeric for 6 months - 500 mg and had no repeat of it 's flavor ... however this product keeps the flavor coming long after you consumed the supplement . Save your money , purchase a better made product .
 While the item description is technically 100 % accurate , it leads the reader to believe that the 500mg of Turmeric is all of the same type . However , the bottle clearly says that each capsule contains 250 mg of Tumeric that is rated for potentcy and another 250 mg of Turmeric that is unrated . If the item description was accurate , I would not have purchased this brand , but would have purchased another .
 The picture shown is the newest NO Xpand , whereas the item I was shipped was in fact a much older NO Xpand product with a completely different design and an expiration date in a few months . The product I was given was not the one I expected and tasted absolutely disgusting , as opposed to the new product , which I 've tried before , and it did n't taste that bad .
 The idea of putting the `` scoop '' edge of the side is good in theory but this spoon is too flexible and the bowl too small to be useful . My mother wo n't use it . And almost $ 20 for a piece of cheap plastic ? Are you kidding ?! I got taken . This thing is useless and a waste of money . Do n't buy .
 Purchased from 99perfume , this has nothing to do with Dunhill d which I used long time ago and was very familiar with it . This did not even smell good . It burnt my skin for half hour and the smell lasted less than that . A real Dunhill d used to last a day and half and definitely did not burn . I called the Dunhill store in NY and they do not sell it . The last time I could buy it from Dunhill was over 12 years ago . I had some problems returning it to 99perfume , but they finally refunded the total amount I paid after I sent it back . They wanted to charge me for shipping , but they refunded the shipping amount after having to argue with a supervisor -LRB- or owner -RRB- on the phone .
 This product is very gritty and falls all over you like sand . Do n't like and very disappointed because I do like the sister -LRB- or brother -RRB- product for headaches -- the original HeadOn . Perhaps I got a bad batch but not trying it again .
 I normally love head on sinus but this time the product was old and griity ... . I 'm very upset about it . I use to rave about head on . Now I 'm very disappointed ... I ca n't find this product anywhere accept on line . So where can I find head on ?????
 Was looking for a safe , non-medicinal headache relief for my pregnant wife , and stumbled across HeadOn . `` Do n't know why , do n't know how ... '' piqued my interest , so I did a little digging : One of the active ingredients is a known carcinogen -LRB- potassium dichromate -RRB- which commonly causes contact dermatitis -LRB- strange for a product applied to the skin -RRB- , and the company making HeadOn -LRB- Miralus -RRB- seems to have no basis for its claims of relief - it makes no hard claims about what the product does , instead relying heavily on testimonials -LRB- for which the company is of course not responsible -RRB- to describe and endorse the product.Search for `` HeadOn '' on Google -LRB- or your favorite search engine -RRB- and decide for yourself ... I 'll pass .
 although the main idea of this product is good , the quality of the materials is inferior . the plastic is flimsy and does not hold its ' shape when attached to a wall , and the top does not have any kind of way to snap on to the bottom so when it is in use , the pressure from the vent keeps popping the top off . if possibly i am missing something as far as my installation or use of this product please let me know because at this point i feel i have wasted my money.I have been offered to return the product but i infortunately have thrown away the original packaging and shipping papers .
 Very comfortable if only it would stay elevated on the chair to fit the contours of your back . Has a very weak elastic band to keep the heavy cushion up on the chair , always slides to the bottom where the cushion does the least good .
 I recently purchased the Obus Forme Lowback Backrest , along with the Seat Cushion . Although I have heard people rave about the excellent support , and they felt comfortable enough to me , I ca n't give them more than 2 stars . The material used in their construction drove me to distraction . This is obviously a personal preference type of thing . Other folks may have no issues with the material at all . These are just my feelings on the matter : I found the texture of the fabric to be a little rough and it did n't allow easy movement when sitting on/leaning against it , which would drive me crazy after just a few hours at work . Also , when making any movements , the compression of the foam , and the friction between it and the fabric covering , made really annoying noises . It reminded me somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it . The Backrest was even worse than the Seat Cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping -LRB- looked sort of like shrink wrap or Saran wrap -RRB- around the foam inside , which made loud crinkling noises every time I even twitched . It was awful ! However good the science behind the backrest and cushion is , the sound effects and unpleasant texture were distracting enough , to me at least , to return both items .
 I got this to help transform a set of uncomfortable truck seats into something I could use on long trips . Unfortunately it does n't do it for me . I think that together with the seat pad this costs about $ 120 or more . Upon inspection I 'd be surprised if anyone paid half that if they bought it in a store after checking it out.In my case it was too narrow , the frame edges are felt and padding is pretty minimal . It must work for those with strange back ailments , but for me it did n't . It also lacked a good system for attaching it to a seatback , so you 'd have to reposition it every time you use it.A tiny person might get some use out of it but I ca n't imagine what 's in it that costs so much to produce . It 's a frame , foam and a cheap thin cover that looks like it 'd wear through with time.Thankfully Amazon accepts returns on these items . It seems to work for many , but it felt like I was sitting with an ironing board behind me . Literally .
 The Obus Forme Ergonomic Low Backrest did n't provide much support in my lower back . The small pad for the lower back could n't be placed comfortably to provide lower back support without irriting other areas of my back . It 's size is very cumbersome . It takes up too much space on any chair it 's placed . At its cost , I expected more .
 Back rest does not stay on seat when you lean back against it . Slides off back of seat and you have to keep readjusting it .
 Was initially impressed with the backrest ; however , because the straps are not adjustable , it dose n't stay in place . The one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place .
 I am a larger male who bought this product to help with support for back pain . The sides are contoured and were too narrow to fit my body comfortably . Did not use as a result.The vendor was prompt in delivery and billing .
 Not too good of service ... from the company who was to ship it out . . So I got this brand from a another place ... Product is great !!
 I am not joking ... this stuff makes your house smell like you live with a hundred cats . It smells like when you walk into someones house and they have urine soaked carpets . This smell is foul .
 I got this and these do n't smell like they should be ... also the color of the liquid in the bottle fades after 2 days and no smell either ... stay away .
 Agree with the other reviewers - this scent is horrible . And it 's strong too ! I have my plugin set to the lowest setting and it still manages to fill my entire 2 br 1000 sq ft apartment with a strong scent .
 The air freshener smells like cheap cologne . I just sprayed it in my room and I had to walk out it smelled so strongly of such a nasty smell.Moral of the story
 I thought this would be perfect , as our daughter was having lots of tummy aches and was obviously uncomfortable . I could n't get it to stay on her . She 's very active , so this might not be a problem for less active babies . Overall , it did n't do what we hoped .
 We 've tried this a number of times and we just do n't think it works -LRB- for our baby -RRB- . Of course , it 's hard to know what 's * really * causing a baby to cry frequently , so I was skeptical that it would work to begin with . But one * should * buy this with a healthy dose of skepticism . Of course , if you 've got a baby that cries a lot , it 's probably worth trying anything and everything .
 This product is ok . The herbs smell good but I did n't see a difference in behavior . I was able to use the outside as an ice pack for me later .
 I did n't see this work for my son . He had a lot of gas pains when he was first born and nothing really seemed to help him . I did n't really see any change in him when he wore it . In fact it often times made him pretty angry.It did have a funky smell but it was n't terribly offensive . The minky material is soft and it was well made . I just wish that it would have worked .
 I was hopeful this product would work wonders and I 'd have a happy baby in my arms in no time . Well , it did n't . It 's easy to use - just microwave the little pouch and put it inside the belt , put the belt on the baby . Easy , right ? Well , the belt is bulky and looks like it could be uncomfortable ... and my baby just screamed louder when we got near her with it . In fact , when we took it away we had better luck with her calming down . I got rid of it since it did n't work .
 Good in theory , but it did absolutely nothing for my son and the velcro does not stick very well , so it had to be held on . A waste of my $ 20 !! Would not recommend unless you simply want a heating pad for other reasons .
 I was really excited whne I received this product . I wanted not only to help my infant but myself as well . I was dissapointed in it 's performance for a number of reasons . My baby still cried for hours on end . She hated the belt being around her tummy and would stiffen up . The product needs a warning label for certain microwave temps . It does tell you to check the product before putting it on baby , however the `` seeds '' in the scented pouch get warmer the longer you hold them against your skin , by then you 've already attached it to your child . My infant had little red marks on her tummy for a few hours after I 'd tried it ! I think this is dangerous especially for new mom 's like myself . Do your self a favor , spend the fifty buck and buy a lullaband , or some collic tablets or gripe water !
 This waistband caused a second degree burn on my 4 month old.With a blister larger than a quarter . We followed direections precisely and had used it successfully 4 previous times . This product is extremely dangerous and needs to be pulled from the market and that will be my goal !! PLEASE do not buy this product or give as a gift . I am also a very experienced mother of 4 and NICU nurse . I repeat this product is very dangerous !!!!!
 This item smells nice , but only aggravated my infant more . It is a good concept , but if colic is gas then I would n't want something warm on my belly either .
 Todas estamos desesperadas cuando no sabemos porque no paran de llorar nuestros bebes . Pero tengan paciencia !!! una semana y se les pasaran los c&oacute;licos . Esto no lo necesitamos !!
 Our little girl has the worst gas pains , but this waistband did n't help at all . I was also worried at how hot it got -LRB- following the instructions -RRB- , so we would n't heat it for as long as it said . For gas , I recommend Hyland 's Colic Tablets over anything else -LRB- and we 've tried everything-having 2 gassy , gassy babies ! -RRB- . They instantly soothe her stomach so she can sleep , and they 're a natural , homeopathic remedy .
 My infant daughter was a little gassy so we tried this . She did n't like sleeping with it around her waist so I returned it . I tried gripe water after that and it helped .
 It 's very soft . The lavender smell is very nice . It did not provide relief for my baby though .
 I really have no idea why I purchased this product . I think it sounded like a good idea , and my newborn had such gas and GI issues that I was pretty desperate . But I think a hot water bottle or a warm towel could have done the same thing .
 This was too big for our baby , would fit a toddler better or a chunky 9 + month old . Not sure if it works as it was just too big when we needed it .
 Was disappointed with my most recent purchase . The caplets are all individually wrapped . Previously , it was a bottle with 60 caplets in the bottle . Much easier for dispensing .
 I gave it a really good long try . My husband started it the same time as me . . It did n't work at all for my knees and it did n't help him at all with his hip or back . I wo n't buy this one again .
 I have nerve damage . This is supposed to be good for joints . I took a whole bottle as prescribed , and although I do have one very stiff joint , the stuff did nothing for me . Very expensive , no value .
 made me nervous and i got sick af . kwfow efwefwe fwefwef wef weffew wefwef wefwef wefwef wefwef wefew wef wef
 This is not needed for most testing equipment.A hanging drop of blood applied directly to the application area eliminates the middleman -LRB- capillary tube -RRB- . I 'm a physician and have used the units both ways .
 It seems OK at first , but starts to smell like vomit after lingering in the air a few seconds .
 Misleading information . Web site sales are many times unclear . Requested 1 tube , instead was sent three tubes packaged as one unit . Instead of being charged for one tube was charged for three . Will not deal with this company again .
 I purchased this product for a child who is fatally allergic to dairy , so it was extremely important that I confirm that dairy was not used to produce the probiotics.No one ever answers the telephone . I called at least six times and left messages three times . I also emailed them . I explained the seriousness of the inquiry in all the messages and email . That was about a month ago -- and I still have n't heard back from them.I wo n't do business with people who provide such a lack of customer service . How can I trust the quality of the product ?
 I would not buy this product as the wrong item is being pictured . I want RxOmega-3 not what is being shown . Ca n't be sure I would receive the correct product
 I could not tell any difference , will not reorder . It does taste ok but is hard to &#34; measure &#34; the dose .
 My husband and I saw absolutely no results from this product . I am sure it works well for some , but did not for us .
 The label tells you not to get this product on your skin . They are not kidding ! The product is a liquid , not a gel , so it 's easy to accidentally splash yourself when you squirt it on . I made the mistake of getting some on my hands , and although I washed them immediately with soap , it burned like crazy and it bleached the color out of my skin . Two of my fingers are noticeably lighter than the rest of my hand . It works well , but I would n't use it again without rubber gloves . My guess is this is why they are n't marketing it anymore.The old Spray N Wash solid stick worked just as well and was n't nearly as caustic . Not sure why they stopped making that one , but it 's still available online .
 Apparently , when they say there are 20 wax strips , they mean that when you pull apart the * 10 * wax strips , there should be wax on both sheets . This was frequently not the case . Either all wax was on one sheet , or only a small section of wax was left on one of the sheets . And of course , after you have warmed the entire strip in your hands , and after you have used one of the sheets , the other sheet has cooled off.That issue aside , the wax just did n't work well on my legs . Each strip left a LOT of hair behind , no matter how many times I waxed the same area . I do have coarse , thick hair , and I 'm sure that 's part of the problem . But I have used other waxing kits before , and they did work on my legs , so this brand is suboptimal . I tried heating a strip in the microwave as one reviewer suggested , and it made no difference . These wax strips just do n't work well for me .
 The only pro to this product is how un-messy it is . It barely even stings , but that is because it barely pulls any hair out ! I could only get one use out of each strip . By the 2nd it did n't pull out any hair . There is no way you could do the job with one box . Especially since on go over does n't get all the hair . My hair was with-in the recommended length . I followed the directions . Oh , and the finishing wipes ? A joke ! I had to really work and scrub to get the remaining wax off and it left my hands and leg feeling so oily ! I will be continuing my search for a good waxing product . This is no where near it .
 I have used this product many times over the last couple of years . However , the two boxes I purchased were defective and did not peel apart properly and stuck to my skin . It took two to three times the number of strips to do the job . I hope this was an isolated incident as I do enjoy the convenience of waxing at home .
 It does not work at all . The sheets of wax were so thick and so brittle that it seemed like the product was way passed its expiration date -LRB- not sure if wax has that -RRB- . I do not recommend it at all . For that price you can get a much product from your local drug store , I still have the unused part and it is so bad !
 Only takes half the hair nads works better too bad its so messy . This product is easy to use and would probably work if u hadent shaved or waxed in forever .
 Pathetic and disgusting . Got stuck to my legs and had to remove by putting my legs in hot water and then removing by knife . Worst experience ever ! > . <
 Pulling apart the sheets resulted in wax being unevenly shredded across the `` two wax strips . '' After I applied the one with more even wax on the strip and ripped it off , half the wax was stuck to my legs and fingers , and all the hair left behind ! Worse yet is that my box did n't have the wipes in it ! Scrubbing was not a fun job and left my legs red and irritated .
 I should n't have wasted money on this crap . This particular Veet wax strips is ineffective . I have tried using other Veet wax strips for the legs and they work well but not this one . This is useless .
 I was really looking forward to this product because of all the good reviews , but it did n't meet the hype . I have very thick curly hair and have had lots of trouble finding wax strips that work for me , but for some reason I thought this was it . It only removed about 60 % of the hair from my underarms , and that was after going over them twice . I guess the search continues .
 I have tried many wax stripes over several years and this is the worst of all.I used it so many ways , but every time I got the same poor results . The wax sticks to everything but the wax paper itself , so the entire wax remains on your skin , after you pull the paper.I have to say that I used the same brand for sensitive skin -LRB- the blue packaging -RRB- , and I did not have any problem with it . Only this product -LRB- with the green packaging -RRB- did not work for me at all .
 I had high hope for these since the box said they work well even for short hairs . I tried them on both my bikini and legs , I also had my boyfriend try it on me as well -LRB- he has warmer hands , I thought perhaps I had n't warmed the strip well enough -RRB- . It left about 1/2 the hair on my legs and did n't work at all on the bikini zone . We also tried leaving the strip on a little longer , but then the wax pulls off the paper and sticks to your skin.The finishing wipes also do n't seem to take away the sticky residue . Since all the other reviews for this product are so glowing , I was surprised by how poorly it preformed , so perhaps the box I had was defective in some way . I just know that it did n't really work for me .
 Used this product for legs and underarm hair . Leaves more hairs than it takes out , and leaves sticky wax behind . the wipes are messy and do not help . For those of you who have had similar problems , i have found the best way to remove left over wax is by mixing some sugar and baby oil , gently scrubbing the wax off . The sugar removes the wax and the baby oil prevents irritation and soothes the skin .
 I followed the instructions exactly and it did not work . I tried it three separate times before I could get it to remove any hair , and it did not remove nearly as much as it should have . It pulled out maybe 10 single hairs and left a thick , sticky , wax residue on my leg that did n't even come off in a hot shower . I had to SCRUB and SCRUB ! Shaving is easier than this ! Stay away from this product . You are better off using Nair or getting a professional waxing . SUPER DISAPPOINTED !
 This product is terrible !! I was so excited at the thought of not having to shave , so I read lots of positive reviews and then went out and bought some for myself . I got them at Walgreens for $ 8 . I let my hair grow to a proper length for waxing and then I read the directions VERY carefully . And I followed the directions VERY carefully !! These things suck . They hardly removed any hair and left wax behind . So I had to wipe the spots I waxed with those wipes and now my calves look like they have razorburn ! Ugh I 'm SO disappointed !! I tried all kinds of tricks to get these things to work . I warmed them up with my hair dryer for a few seconds instead of my hands to make sure that the wax was warm and that did nothing . I tried everything . No matter how concisely I followed the directions I got very poor results . DO NOT waste your money !! Total rip off .
 I wrote a bad review for Threelac originally . At the time I took it for only 3 weeks , however I did end up taking the whole box , as well as the Oxygen Elements recommended with it . Still I have no good results . I still suffer daily with Candida , and after more research I havent found any product that has such good reviews as Threelac , so I 'm going to try it a second time . This time I guess I 'll have to up the dosage . I 'll review again and let you know if it works or not .
 I found a peace of slim plastic inside when I was taking the amount I needed for my shake . I was lucky that I looked inside it before putting it in the blender . Imagine what could have happened If that peace of plastic gets inside the blender and then inside my stomach.I am going to use an strainer any time I use it , and I do not think I am going to get the same product in the future .
 ` Studies showed organ lesions , altered liver and pancreas cells , changed enzyme levelsIf you use protein powder for health reasons , why would you eat this or feed this to your children ?
 Overall a good product for being a > 90 % protein whey isolate at reasonable cost . The whey isolates market needs more competition.There are a couple flaws with this product . The first is that they ADDED GENETICALLY MODIFIED SOY OIL as an ingredient . Soy oil is not a natural byproduct of producing whey protein - they ADDED it intentionally . It makes no sense why the manufacturer would go out of the way to willfully add this garbage into the ingredients while at the same time promote their product as some sort of pure whey isolate . If they need to add oil to enhance flavor , fine , but they should at least be honest about this to the consumer . And if you must add FAT , please select a better fat than genetically modified soy oil , or else you may as well use partially hydrogenated soybean oil.Secondly , this product claims to have 106 calories , 25g protein , 0g carbs , and 0g fat per 30g . Isopure Zero carb has 105 calories , 0g carbs , 0.5 g fat per 30g . Something does n't add up when Dymatize has 106 calories but claims to have everything else equal , except for LESS fat . It seems like they 've taken advantage of the fact that < 1g of fat does n't have to be listed . So if it 's actually 0.6 g of fat , then technically they can just hide that fact and list it as 0g fat .
 I tried the dymatize nutrition whey chocolate as a replacement to my muscle milk chocolate , I was not at all happy with the switch , the dymatize was more chalky and powder tasting and it certainly did not have the sweet chocolate taste as the muscle milk does , I will be using muscle milk again next time .
 When I first opened the bottle , I swear it smelled similar to spoiled milk . I do n't know if the company sent me an expired product or it spoiled in transit due to the heat -LRB- ca n't find expiration date on it -RRB- , but the diarrhea from drinking it is kind of tolerable .
 I USED this product for a while and it seemed fine . Then i began to feel and look bloated continuously . After talking to my doctor he said my body did not react well to this product . The company i purchased from said they would be glad to give me a refund if I returned it . I had already paid shipping and now another 12.00 to return it . I called Dymatize and they said they would give me a credit on their web site . Since I can use nothing they sell they basically said thats just tough . I would think a company would be more gracious but , they certainly were not . There are many other good products on the market and my suggestion is to choose one not made by DYMATIZE
 This does not remove hard water stains . It does clean well , getting soap off . Use it for regular cleaning , not hard water spots .
 I tried this on a heavily soiled -LRB- not rusted -RRB- tub . I had previously used other products with limited success . This product had the same effect as spraying plain water on the tub . I even used a sponge to scrub along with the product . NOTHING was removed . The product is totally worthless . The manufacturer should be ashamed .
 I have been so happy with &#34; The Works &#34; cleaner for toilet bowls -LRB- best product ever -RRB- that I had high hopes for The Works Tub & Shower Cleaner . Unfortunately , it does not work at all . I am beyond disappointed . I am considering trying to use the version for toilet bowls on my tub and shower .
 The toilet bowl cleaner worked great , so I decided to try this for the shower . It left huge streaks that took many scrubbings with other products to remove . We thought it had etched our beautiful tiles , but fortunately , it buffed out . There was a warning about that on the label , but I did not know there was overspray I did not see .
 This wo n't even break up light lime deposits . Trust me folks , it does zilch . This has to be a scam . The five star ratings have to be shills working for the company . Do n't waste your money .
 I got the works cleaner today opened the humongous box -LRB- what a waste of paper -RRB- they packed it in only to find the bottle only 1/4 full of cleaner . There werent any leaks in it . The bottle 's labels looked 10yrs old b/c they were all faded . What a rip !
 This was extremely disappointing as the other products that we can get right here in town and not have to order 12 , would have done just as well . Previously it had phosphoric acid in it and it would take away our super hard water stains and make the stainless steel sink shine . If it had been advertised that it no longer had phosphoric acid I would not have bought it . Just be aware if you think you are getting what you had from several months ago with a different colored label , that it is not the same formula .
 These vitamins were expired and over a year old!Its ashame people are so devious!But they did almost arrive in two days !
 This brownie mix was so very disappointing , and I 've been eating low-carb for years so my expectations are pretty realistic to begin with.First was the amount of butter
 While everything is relative and this might be a terrific brownie IF you worship at the Temple of Low Carb diets , this version of Brownies was a monumental disappointment . The process requires 3 eggs and lots of butter -LRB- read Unhealthy -RRB- , then requires cooking in a water bath -LRB- dish within a dish of water -RRB- , requires glass square dishes , and comes out as a thin brownie with a crust . The process was laborious and the result was very unsatisfying , being thin like the height of bread , poorly textured , and poor mouth feel product . I ca n't say too little about this product , except that this product makes one savor and fully appreciate the genius and deliciousness of Ghiradeli and Betty Crocker box brownies .
 I do not know what is in these brownies to cause these reactions , but hear and heed my warnings . I wish I 'd read the truth , the naked truth , the unvarnished and ugly truth :1 Brownie - strange tummy rumbles . Sounds like thunder . Caution , you want to be near the plumbing fixtures .2 Brownies - Thunder , plus the most unexpected gastro warnings . Think a high wind on the Sahara . You might want to move the chair closer to the bathroom . Start practicing your prayers .3 Brownies - You should just make your bed in the bathtub . You 'll be there all night.More than 3 Brownies
 I agree with all the other reviewers who say these are just like `` regular '' brownies , with a rich chocolately flavor and great texture . I agree , they taste great , and go down really easily . However , it 's what they do to your body after eating them that I object to -- you will get really awful gas ! It 's not just me , it happened to my entire family , my husband , and both boys , teenagers . Not pretty . I do n't think it was the sugar alcohol that caused the problem , but what was it ? Who knows ? I am so glad I did n't go crazy and buy a case before I checked them out . Just be cautious !
 Hello Brownie Lovers ! Unfortunately I love brownies , and unfortunately I have dietary restrictions that forbid me from eating the Sugars . So unfortunately I found myself in possession of a box of Doctor Carbrite Diet Brownies . My Moms-in-Law gave them to me for Christmas . So with the whole family over , I decided to mix up a batch of these devilish delights.Well , let me tell you , I do n't know what Doctor would recommend the intense intestinal distress caused by these brownies . Holy Hell ! Myself and my Christmas guests were utterly disgusted by the brown , methane cloud that resulted from my consumption of said brownies . I have since discovered other foods which contain Malitol -LRB- artificial sugar-izer -RRB- and carry a warning of `` may cause possible intense intestinal distress '' . Well let me just cut to the chase for you
 I want to see a product label I can read !!! If I do n't read ... I do n't buy . That danged thing is so small even ctrl plus ca n't make it readable .
 I ca n't get enthusiastic about these . They did n't taste exactly like brownies , and both my husband and I had stomach problems with them . We were not gorging on them , either . They lasted 4 days . Doubt that I will order these again . -LRB- never say never ! -RRB-
 The taste alone deserve all the accolades I found from fellow reviewers before I bought this product -LRB- 4 Boxes -RRB- . There were only two reviews , one for 5 stars and the other for 4 stars . Not one mentioned the after effects this product causes in the human body . Who said gas is expensive ? With this product is free and long lasting ! The first time we did two boxes , which is not much in quantity , and the whole family had a go at it . I bought it for selfish reasons , the fact I am not supposed to consume sugars and lots of Carbs , but more importantly because the two reviews sold me ! Who else can I trust these days when everyone claims they are the best but the actual consumers , the everyday people of this great land of ours ? Yes , I am that naive , I fully trust the opinions of the majority . In this case they were only 2 reviews and I should have been more cautious . The taste great but after eating this product the body undergoes severe swings , all adorned by long lasting gas and in the end by several visits to the `` throne '' . I have always been blessed with a reliable stomach but when I eat something that is not quite right I suffer like everyone else . Another member of my family suffers from a very delicate stomach and almost no will power when it comes to treats like these . There must be some kind of ingredient that promotes this reaction and my question is
 I have never paid so much for a box of junk in my life . I would have returned it but did n't want to pay more . I would not buy this again . Why does it cost more to leave out the sugar ? back to the drawing board manufacturers . I hate your bownie mix .
 I am sorry , this product does not work.I had to go back to colchicine
 There are two things the buyer would not know about Amazon 's Hoodia from the advertising until it 's too late -LRB- after the product has been delivered to your door -RRB-
 The first hoodia product I used was Mega-T with hoodia , which worked really well so I decided to try this product . I figured it would work just as well , if not better , since it contains more hoodia than the previous product . However , with this product my appetite did not decrease at all . I was still hungry all the time and I started to gain back the weight I lost while I was on Mega-T .
 I took this product for about 6 weeks and I did n't see any change . If anything I was even more hungry . I would not reccomend it .
 Amazon has always been excellent for pricing . However , I expected to get at least 2 bottles of sprinkles for $ 6 . I just got 1 . They are under $ 3 in the stores . I wo n't be ordering sprinkles again from Amazon , needless to say .
 I was so excited about these sprinkles for my cupcake decorating needs ... that is until i tried a cupcake that i had LIGHTLY dusted with the glitter.It feels like tiny razors in your mouth and absolutely ruins the texture of your baked goods . Go natural , dump these `` edible '' flakes .
 I used this sparkle for my daughter 's birthday cake , but the sparlkes did not show at all so its just a waste of time unless you are putting it on a dark color cake .
 The head portion of this brush is enormous , I have trouble moving it around the outside of my teeth where my cheeks are . The brush also feels like it lacks power compared to other electronic brushes . This was recommended by my dentist , but I still have no clue why .
 The head is OK but the brushes are overpriced and they are crappily made and designed and do n't last .
 Failed after a year or so . THey replaced it . But now it failed again and they want exorbitant shipping charges to replace it . DO N'T tell them it corroded then they charge you even more ! Do n't get the charger replaced , then they charge you even more.The brushes do n't last long and are very expensive to replace!This uses regular plug contacts so in a wet sink area they corrode badly . Must scrape off the green rot regularly to get it to work.Poor construction . Ca n't open it to replace batteries or to clean the contacts .
 The package was sealed and the toothbrush and accessories appeared brand new ; however , the toothbrush ceased working after approximately one month of use .
 I bought a rotadent through my dentist because it seemed to be a great product to take care of my teeth . I was also told that it came with a lifetime warranty . It was expensive so I was willing to make the investment if I was n't going to have to replace it . I have had it for a little over three years and the unit has stopped being able to charge . I plug it in overnight and the next morning it has little more than a few seconds of charge.I called the company and they found my warranty and told me they would replace the charger for $ 17 shipping and handling . I said that I was not going to pay for them to replace their broken item.I am very disappointed in this company that does not stand behind their product . I have read reviews by other saying that this charging problem is a known defect , so I am frustrated that the responsibility is mine to pay , not theirs to recall and replace or at least replace at no charge when the issue is brought to their attention .
 The device does what it actually says it will do , and it does it well . But it costs way too much , because it eventually becomes disposable electronics . Its battery is Ni-Cad so eventually it is not going to hold its charge anymore , and since most people are not going to keep the brush running to wear the battery down properly , the battery will fail sooner rather than later . And here are some facts : Electro/mechanical device + damp environment -LRB- your sink area -RRB- = corrosion and failure . The connector to the wall wart WILL get corroded quickly . Count on it . It might not be so bad if you could actually exchange the ni - cad battery but you ca n't without breaking the device violently -LRB- the instructions actually tell you to hit it with a hammer to DISPOSE of the ni-cad properly -RRB- . It has a so-called `` lifetime guarantee '' so IF you bought it at a dentist , still have a receipt , register your warranty and pay for postage to ship it back , you should get a new one , but if any of the above is missing you are out of luck . As we were . The device and the company were just a big pain in the tail . I suppose if you are getting braces and need something to really clean your teeth you could do worse , and it probably lasted as long as 5 of those cheap power brushes you get at the market , so I guess we broke even , but in the end for my family , the hassle was n't worth the expense .
 I bought this worthless system in January , 2011 . I received a replacement Rota-Dent body from the company in September , due to the first one quit around April 2011 . I am very unsatisfied with this so called Rota-Dent toothbrush ... Very time after using it my teeth are still not clean and I have to re-brush manually . My husband refuses to use it and says it is a waste of time and I agree ... This product is so low impact and has no power and is like being at the dentist and getting a fluorine treatment to polish my teeth . I have had other electric toothbrushes in my past and they were wonderful , I ca n't say this about this product and would not recommend it to anyone ... waste of money that I did n't have . I am now going to have to purchase a brand I am sure of and know will clean my family 's teeth the first time without having to do a manual second brush , which the kids hate . Also , replacement heads are hard to find and wear out fast.I am returning , as this product it definitely does not do anything it guarantees and we are very disappointed in it . Do n't buy you will regret it .
 I have had 2 of these since the beginning of the year . both have had bad on/off switches , which apparently can not take any moisture . over time the switch simply fails . so how do you stop the handle from getting damp/wet when brushing your teeth and rinsing the brush afterwards ? I got the first one replaced by the vendor after several weeks . even after returning it , they hesitated to replace it . then they insisted that I send them the original box too . who saves original boxes ??? it was like pulling teeth . this brush is truly worthless .
 My dentist said I needed this and charged me $ 155 which is more than I 've seen elsewhere . I noticed in my last 2 visits that all of their patients seem to `` need '' this toothbrush as I heard them telling several around me on both occasions . The dentist office 's name and number is also printed on the brush as well . I had just bought a sonicare which I thought was great and very effective after using an Oral B for many years , not to mention much cheaper and easier to use . Dentist 's assist . said Sonicare is n't a good brush at all -LRB- Only because they do n't sell and ca n't make money off of I 'm sure -RRB- . Does not seem very powerful . Have to plug in to charge instead of a base like most other rechargeables . My teeth did n't feel very clean at all compared to my other power toothbrushes . Went back to using my Sonicare . This brush just plain out sucks and is way overpriced . Even one of the Crest Spin brushes you can get for a few bucks does a better job than this one . Would n't recomend to my dog , let alone a perfect stranger .
 Before you buy this toothbrush , try to find replacement brush heads -LRB- plastic piece and brush tip -RRB- ; or just the brush tips . You can find the brush heads on the internet for $ 17 - $ 25 EACH . While the brush tips are easily replaceable , and Rota-dent makes them , they are impossible to find , even at Rota-dents website . -LRB- I know they are made by the manufacturer because a dentist gave my wife two packages , because he was discontinuing carrying the product . That should tell you something ! -RRB- My wife bought this toothbrush from her orthodontist . She likes it , but I 'm ready to throw it out the window ! It is fast becoming an expensive doorstop . The price for a brush head is ridiculous . Consumables should be much more readily available for an item that is this expensive initially , and should be reasonably priced . Rota-dent fails on both counts .
 This product is not on par with either the Sonic Care or Oral B electric toothbrushes . In my opinion , it is under-engineered , under-designed , inadequately manufactured , and overpriced.I am a product designer and have manufactured electronic and electromechanical products for over 20 years . I have been a technical expert witness as a medical device designer , testifying in Federal Court.I went to a new dentist and was talked into paying $ 130 for this Rotadent wonder-brush . I was using an Oral B electric toothbrush at the time and had no problems with the brush , but was told my teeth and gums were not in good shape . -LRB- I am not so sure that was n't part of the sales pitch . -RRB- Unlike the Sonic Care and Oral B products , the Rotadent has a slide switch , which is not sealed - the instructions suggest popping the switch cap off of the switch to clean around it . This is not a waterproof , or water resistant , or sanitary switch.The Rodadent does not have any visual indication of either when the battery if fully charged or needs recharging - both the others I have used do.The Rotadent has a simple power supply that plugs into the wall and I do not know if there is a charging circuit or whether it merely trickle charges . Both of the real products on the market monitor their charging.The Rotadent charger requires plugging into the bottom of the toothbrush . Both real products use an inductive coupling , which allows the case to be sealed and waterproof.The Rotadent is not waterproof or water resistant - it is possible to blow air into the charging plug out the motor shaft . I use my toothbrush in the shower - and this would not last 2 days in that environment . Again , even the switch would not be able to withstand being used in the shower . -LRB- Even the disposable Crest electric toothbrush has SEALED push button switches , rather than the cheap and improper slide switch with a cap . -RRB- When I used it , the Rotadent seemed to slow down and speed up as I brushed different areas , based on the pressure I was applying . I think that the motor and the battery are probably under-rated and not up to the task . I have not had this experience with any other electric toothbrush I have ever used.When I purchased it from a dentist office , they said to be sure to register it on line IMMEDIATELY - THE SAME DAY . They knew of cases where the warranty had not been honored because it was n't registered ` right away ' . When I opened the Rotadent package I was immediately aware of the name of the dentist office from which I purchased it printed on the handle . Although this is probably a marketing gimmick and a way of being sure the brushes are not returned to the manufacturer , the printing job not is sub-standard quality -LRB- angel hairs of ink trailing off of the printing . -RRB- Within a week , I tried to return the Rotadent to the dentist office where I purchased it . I was told they do not take returns and do not offer refunds . I said that the product was not a quality product and they said they would do what they could . It took about 2 weeks to resolve the matter with the dentist . Apparently ZILA , the manufacturer , has no return policy . I was given a credit at the dentist for the price of the brush , and given a new Rotadent as well . - Why ? Because they had thrown my original one out ! To me this means that they are very inexpensive for the dentists ' offices to purchase.Bottom line
 As the previous reviewer says , I think you can only get this from your dentist , or at least I was told that by my dentist . So I 'm a little surprised to see it listed here . I was satisfied with my old Oral-B but it was getting old and my dentist recommended the Rota-Dent One Step . So I bought it . I find it uncomfortable to use . It either tickles or causes an uncomfortable vibration that I can barely tolerate . It does clean well , but I 've gone back to my old Oral-B .
 I got this toothbrush because my dentist , who is also a friend , recommended it to me . My sonicare was about 5 years old and was starting to have trouble holding a charge , so I was in the market for something new . This toothbrush , rather than automatically recharging while in a base , has to be plugged in and is already -LRB- 3 months old -RRB- starting to not hold a charge . We have to fully recharge it about every 7 days . You can not use it while it is plugged in.A bigger issue for me , also something that was not a problem with the Sonicare , is that when the toothpaste foams and drips on the handle slides down and gets between the brush head and the handle . So now there is gunk all over the place that you are supposed to put the brush head and inside the brush head . It 's a mess . And it was expensive !
 I 'm one of those very unlucky few -LRB- or many -RRB- who persistently have had to deal with cavities and gum disease.Initially , I gave this toothbrush high marks and recommended it to others on this website . Now I regret I had hastily done so , and rescind my recommendation.This toothbrush did a decent job at cleaning dental implants -LRB- crowns , bridges , etc. -RRB- and gumlines ; I used it faithfully for about 2 and a half years . Nonetheless , I still continued to get an occasional inflammation -LRB- once every 6months or so -RRB- of the gums -LRB- with nasty bleeding , sores , etc. -RRB- . So I decided to give my old OralB a try . Surprisingly , I 've had better dental checkups -LRB- with no cavitis , far less tarter build up - my dentist noticed the difference and asked me what I had changed to my daily cleaning routine -RRB- and have not had any gum inflammation ever since I switched back 2 years ago.Rota Dent 's black head is presumably very effective in cleaning the teeth and gums , but now I 'm not so sure . Maybe the bristles are too soft . From my experience , it seems that other more accessible and affordable electronic toothbrushes are just as good , if not , better , for oral health than this one .
 This toothbrush has been cleverly marketed directly through the dentists ' offices at extremely high markups that are shared with the dentist by the manufacturer . Unlike the `` razor blade model '' that gives away the razor for free to lock you into purchasing expensive blades , this is a double whammy
 I bought this overpriced -LRB- $ 21 -RRB- arm band to help in my tennis elbow treatment . It is uncomfortable and did not really provide relief or support . The velcro wears away quickly and after a few weeks will not hold . Also the gel pack never gets cold . I put it in my freezer overnight and the next day wore it with no effect . Go with a different brand like the McDavid tennis elbow band . It only costs about $ 10 and does n't have the worthless gel pack . It does have a comfortable foam band under the velcro . It also seems to last longer .
 There was no issues with shipping or receiving the product . I wore the product for 4 weeks and have come to the conclusion that it does not work in relieving pain .
 When I purchased the iRobot Dirt Dog Workshop Robot , this cleaning solution was recommended as a product to use with the Dirt Dog . However , the Dirt Dog does n't have a cleaning option so this solution was a wasted purchase . Be careful when ordering recommended products !
 A great product , but after waiting 2 weeks for amazon to ship , I checked irobot.com . They sell a box of 9 bottles for $ 39.99 -LRB- = $ 4.44 each -RRB- , shipping and handling is free , the item is in stock and they ship in 1-2 business days .
 I have no problem with the product which I have used for years . My problem with this purchase is with the seller . I start all my online shopping at Amazon as I have never had a bad experience with anything purchased through Amazon.com . This was major exception . I spent $ 49.00 for this purchase assuming that it was for 6 bottles of solution as that is what I had previously paid for the product through other sources . Imagine my surprise when my order arrived and contained only one bottle ! After looking for a second shipment , I rechecked my order and discovered that the seller had sent exactly what they had advertised . It was my mistake to assume that the price that had previously been charged for one case would now be charges for 1 bottle . I was so comfortable with my Amazon experience , I forgot to be very careful in my purchase . Wo n't make that mistake again . I was able to send the order back , but it cost me shipping and handling . I hope that Amazon will be more careful in who they choose as secondary sellers so that I can go back to trusting the Amazon experience at all times .
 49.99 for a bottle of cleaning fluid is crazy . This originally retailed at 3.99 at roomba 1 year ago.I SPRAY PINE SOL WITH WATER OUT OF A SPRAYER onto the floor AND let the roomba suck it upMUCH CHEAPER !
 From all the reviews , I thought I was getting a pack of cleaning bottles for $ 50 . Nope . Just one.It 's effective , but there have to be cheaper options !
 This product from this vendor is way overpriced . For $ 50.00 , I thought I was purchasing 6 bottles of the cleaner because I have purchased it from other sites at about that price . To my surprise only one bottle was shipped . Check IRobot directly and you will find it much more reasonably priced . $ 50.00 per bottle is ridiculous . I wo n't be buying anything from this site again.Granted , I 's my own fault , but they should make it clear the price is for one bottle.Bob FPhoenix
 These people bought it at $ 8.00 a bottle and now they are selling it at $ 50 . a bottle . It 's a great product but not that great . Save your money .
 I bought this product thinking that I was getting 9 bottles of solution . It does n't say in the product description how many but in the first review it says that IRobot has 9 bottles for $ 39.99 . Therefore I assumes that I would be getting 9 bottles . Imagine my surprise when just 1 bottle showed up .
 Have enjoyed my Scooba and have always used the vinegar option . Had a bottle of this product , so I finally used it since I had a new puppy coming to the house . The next time I used my scooba it would n't emit water . Tried all the online suggestions and nada . Online they refer to the pump valves as the source of the no water problem . I do n't know what the valves are made of , but I find this to be a very strange coincidence . Now I have a scooba which runs but does n't emit any water .
 Hopefully the beware of rip-off reviews will short circuit any other victims to this seller.Try something like this instead - it works for me . Get a non-soap based hospital grade cleaner like this : http://www.amazon.com/Citrus-Hospital-Germicidal-Deodorizing-Cleaner/dp/B0002XIYVC/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1297451746&sr;=1-2There are other non-soap based hospital cleaners out there that will work as well at keeping the Scooba from slipping . There 's no reason to buy any cleaner from this individual or iRobot for that matter.I use the same amt of hospital cleaner in the Scooba as this Clorox cleaner . Floors stay clean . Hope this helps !
 do not have to smell the vinegar smell . There is no real vinegar smell when you come home.We roomba the room first . Then scooba it . The roomba keeps the vinegar cleaner and the scooba cleaner .
 I ordered this identical item a year ago and for this price got a case with 6 bottles of the cleaner . This time I ordered and for $ 45 got ONE bottle . That 's crazy !
 Just received my iRobot Scooba 330 today , I was wondering if anyone else has found that finding the Clorox Scooba cleaning solution very troublesome to purchase ? I am unable to find it anywhere , either locally or online ... The only place I am able to find is here on Amazon , and Amazaon wants to sell it for $ 50.00 for a 32oz . bottle . Just does n't seem right about that price . If anyone can post any sites of where it can be bought at , I would greatly appreciate it . I believe the 5 bottle deal would be very cost efficient . I just do n't want to have to use white vinegar and have my kitchen smelling like salad dressing . Did perhaps Clorox discontinue this brand ? Help !
 Not sure what is more idiotic , the person that would price this for ONE BOTTLE , or any idiot that would pay this price . They do n't make this anymore and this company probably does n't have it .
 too expensive for everyday use . instead use 2 oz of white vinegar with lots of water , fill tank ... works beautifully
 Does not clean that well -LRB- leaves a film , streaky -RRB- . Vinegar , which iRobot also recommends , works great for a fraction of the price . The vinegar smell evaporates in several minutes plus it 's all natural.iRobot used to sell this Clorox solution for $ 4.33 a bottle including S&H. ; Plus , what you 're buying now is -LRB- years -RRB- old stock that has been discontinued .
 This is a super product that works well with my scooba . I can purchase the same item for $ 6.99 at many other sites on the web , I mean why pay $ 49.99 if you do n't have to . This was a real letdown for me as far as Amazon 's pricing goes .
 I recently purchased the scooba and they are NOT using the clorox solution , but have a different product . They also said not to use any bleach products as it will eat at the rubber parts . check their website for more details on their cleaning solution . Also , it is the cheapest way to buy it , as far as I have been able to find out .
 Product great , but seller is a rip off . I have had the scooba for many years and love it . I too used Amazon , I have never had a problem with their products . When I received the single bottle , my pkg . insert said that it was a partial shipment to ensure quicker service , the other items will ship seperately . I used the bottle and now realize that it is not part of a case as I had expected . Boy let the buyer beware for sure ! Amazon do not use this seller , they are stealing from your customers !!!!! -LRB- I rate this seller with a -5 stars , ERNEST FATA -RRB-
 I took Unisom before I knew I was pregnant and then read that the active ingredient , doxylamine succinate , has been linked to birth defects , including oral and cleft palate and missing limbs -LRB- !!! -RRB- I spent months in total terror -LRB- baby is ok , fortunately -RRB- . It can also be dangerous if a mom who breastfeeds takes it and her baby has apnea . So do n't take it if you 're pregnant or nursing !
 I bought this mask as a backup for my child , the other ones we own are the standard green and one that looks like a dog . I thought the dragon face would be a cute and appealing option as the dog mask is getting on in years.Every other pediatric nebulizer mask I 've owned , as well as all of the medicine cup parts , have been able to tolerate sterilization in boiling water . In fact , this is the sterilization method recommended to me by my child 's pediatrician so naturally I did n't think that this kit needed to be treated differently.I boiled some water , took the pan off the burner and dropped in the mask and medicine cup along with the mask and cup I already owned . The medicine cup was very flimsy crystal clear plastic that immediately warped out of shape in reaction to the heat , and the mask got very soft and rubbery . The paint on the mask softened and transferred to the bottom of the pan as well as the other mask when they touched . The dog mask and medicine cup were fine . I threw out the dragon medicine cup and let the mask cool completely , and it still has a slightly sticky feeling to it and is much flimsier than the mask I already own . I kept the mask as it fits the medicine cups I had previously and have yet to use it , but from what I can tell it 's still functional . My child thinks it is cute.I would n't recommend this kit . I would definitely recommend the dog mask -LRB- which I do n't see available on Amazon right now , though I have seen it in the past -RRB- as it 's a thicker , more durable material and can stand up to heat sterilization .
 I only bought these because they were cheap and I needed them at the time . They do n't last too long . You should probably try a different brand .
 Not much of a shelf live here , you 're much better off making the conversion to rechargeable batteries that will save u money over the long-run & are much more eco-friendly .
 Kind of expensive , and short life . Not as it said Super Heavy Duty batteries . I only used it for my wireless mouse , but very short life .
 This is a quality product FOR THE PRICE . but as far as shelf , life and actual quality you would want in a battery . Look elsewhere
 Panasonic batteries are low quality dreck that explode and destroy the devices in which they are used . Buy them if you hate your consumer electronics and want an excuse to get new ones .
 Extremely poor capacity , my mouse last for 2 weeks with those ! Dont buy , and buy another brandnot worth the price
 Opened package and placed them in my digital camera to take pictures on Christmas Day . Message came up that said `` BATTERIES EXHAUSTED '' . Brand new batteries that had no charge ! Got ripped off on a product that did not work ! Buyer Beware
 I have been buying this aftershave from Amazon for several years , but this latest purchase is a great disappointment . I noticed right away that it did n't even look like it used to -LRB- more green now than blue -RRB- and it had almost no scent as I noticed both by sniffing the open bottle or after applying it . It just seems to have some alcohol and coloring and not much else . Very disappointing especially as I bought two 8oz bottles .
 This product was and is too harsh on my stomach . As soon as I take it I had to go to the restroom . Not good when you take it before you go to the gym .
 This is the worst buy I have done , It does not work at all , it does not have any power and it is unconfortable . It 's a waste of money . I try it once , and never used it again . Not pleasureable at all .
 The part where the straps are latched to the plastic of the butterfly broke the first time I used it , vibrations were decent , very hard to get the straps adjusted to the right size .
 The vibration works well enough , but the plastic housing is hard and painful . The seams scratch and it 's not comfortable at all , not to mention navigating the straps takes some considerable skill . Not worth it , get a silver bullet type stimulator instead .
 I purchased 3 of these items . Guess what you get when it eventually gets delivered ? A really huge , ugly red stop sign embroidered on the backrest with a bunch of writing on it in white letters-NOT BLACK AS PICTURED ~ ! . my husband and I used them to drive on a 9 hour trip and it did not help at all . I bought 3 . two to use and to give one as a present . they are refusing to take them back when on the packing slip it instructs you to email them and they will give you the return protocol . DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH DEALYARD !!!!! buy your product elsewhere !!!!! false advertising and zero customer service and satisfaction . and maybe stop using amazon since they wo n't be able to solve any service issues either !!!!!!
 You have to have the perfect type of car seat for this to fill well in . Chances are you carseat wo n't fit this perfectly . I had a 2012 Honda Civic and it did n't work out to well .
 It did not help me at all . I am sorry . I spend 120 Euros and it wasnt of any use ! The old obus forme I have its much better and I use it a lot .
 One issue is the width of the chair back and that of the back rest 's straps . I did buy a slender ergonomic chair and adjusting its chair back seems to help more overall than the slight pressure of the bottom bulge of the Obus on a lumbar region that has herniated discs , a narrow canal , spondylothesis , spondylosis , etc. . Opiates , TENs , and Spine Worx work where I can feel results .
 i bought this because my car seat forces me to hunch over . i drive 2 hrs a day and have constant pain by the time i get home . i have a small frame 5 ' 6 , 130lbs with a small waist . whenever i sit down , i never feel like i have enough lower back support . i purchased this thinking it would help my problem . first of all , i was excited because it was n't hideous but once you get the thing in , you can no longer rest your head . i liked the back support at first and then noticed much more back pain once i got to my destination . simply put , there 's not enough lower back support . i ended up using my memory foam pillow until i can find something better . would love some recommendations if anyone has them !!
 DO NOT buy anything from AB Marketers . They are a joke . This pillow cost $ 100 dollars and the zipper on the cover is cheap and flimsy so it broke off when washing . So the claim that it is washable is a complete joke ! What 's worse , you can not purchase a new cover without purchasing an ENTIRE other $ 100 pillow . No one sells one that fits , including the company !
 This pillow was disappointing . If I 'd been able to try it prior to ordering it , I would not have purchased . It is just too steep a slope up from the bed . I 've tried to sleep on it both on my back and on my side and there is just no way . It 's not the fault of the pillow , just that I should not have bought an item like this without trying it first . I will look for another that 's not so high .
 I waited excitedly for this bed wedge support pillow to arrive . When it did , I absolutely could not believe it . It did not come anywhere close to looking like the picture . It looked like the little pillow that you wrap around your neck when your on an aircraft . I was so disappointed . I called the company to find out if they made a mistake . If they did , they did not admit it ; I sent the little tiny pillow back.Bed Wedge Pillow - ** Ships UPS Oversized * 2 piece set comes with Half Column Pillow
 This does n't stay on too long , is kind of hard to apply , and looks funny on me . There are lots of other choices out there , so I probably wo n't use it again .
 I bought this for my newborn a few months ago . I do n't like that the outer layer and inner layer are not attached to each other except at the edges . This makes drying a wriggly baby a bit more difficult because you move one layer and the other does n't move with it . I 've settled on the one layer thin hooded towels -LRB- BabiesRUs/Target varieties -RRB- . The thin towels make it easier to dry in all those little creases .
 I purchased this item and it is supposed to be a `` snap-on '' handle as shown in the picture but that is not what I received . Instead I was given the standard handle . I have written the seller but have no response as of a week . I will never buy from them again . Hopefully Amazon will come through and make good.EXTREMELY disappointed .
 This product only comes with 2 refills , which is not specified anywhere . The picture shows several refills . This is misleading .
 I ordered a package deal including a Proxabrush handle and two containers of snap-on refills . The handle does NOT accdomodate the refills . Duuuuuuh !
 I have ordered this item twice and have not yet recieved the correct one . Amazon promptly refunded my money . Wo n't use site again .
 This is obviously a cheap imitation of the real Beaver and likely from some cheap factory in China because not only is not nearly as powerful but makes such an obnoxious mechanical noise that it 's distracting . Should 've sent it back but kind of a hard product to do that with ! Do n't waste your money on this . Cough up a few more bucks and buy a better manufactured Beaver which normally is awesome .
 My husband bought me two of these , the first I broke after three weeks of use the second after two nights . The mechanics are great for arousal but they are not strong enough to withstand muscle pressure without breaking . I loved the feel but the price was too high for the use .
 The girth is very disappointing , how about something for us moms out there.Clit stimulus is a little too strong , but adds a great feel.Batteries are a bit hard to get in , not going to do this in the darkor quick.Rotating beads are a great feature .
 I was n't very impressed with this . I wish I could return it . For me , its too long and when my husband and I used it together it hurt ! The hummingbird part is too flimsy , does n't stay in place and the control section is heavy and bulky ... personally I was looking for something that would n't require so much work ! I did n't notice much of a change either from the low settings to the high settings . I have showed it to a few girlfriends who were curious and looking to buy -LRB- hey do n't judge ... we 're army wives and sex deprived for a year ! we share tips ! -RRB- and they did n't like the look of it or the weight . Would n't not recommend .
 This item did not work when I took it out of the box . It is not returnable to Amazon so I tried California Exotics and was advised they will not return Amazon sold items and that the items from Amazon are not legit . =-LRB- I bent over and got screwed .
 After purchasing a few of these . This one was the most expensive & the worst of the group . I wasted $ 50 /
 This is my first vibrator and maybe I did n't use it properly - but it hurt ! I think that it was too big for me ... Also the `` hummingbird '' attachment was too sharp and uncomfortable for my own personal preferences . It left me feeling numb down there and a little sore . Maybe this just is n't my thing . I would n't recommend this as a first toy .
 of all the products that I have tried this was by far the worst one yet . It does nothing at all I would n't waste my money on this again if it were the last product on earth .
 Item arrived ahead of schedule . All is well at our household now and hopefully I will continue to use these items on a daily basis .
 Do n't ever review products , had to for this so other do n't waste money and get disappointed !!! Used this 2 months religiously , used sunscreen and whatever else was needed to block `` darkening '' from the sun . I 'm of Indian ethnicity , from India NOT apache . Medium to dark brown street with uneven spots due to acne , this didnt do ANYTHING !!! NO GLOW , NO FAIRNESS , NO LIGHTNESS NOTHING ... I really had my hopes up , only to get them shattered !!! DONT WASTE UR CASH !!! THIS DOES NOT ... . I REPEAT ... DOES NOT WORK !!!
 This product did n't work for me . I took it for two months , I 'm sure I would 've saw some progress by now . It actually started to make me darker . I took vitamin C to increase the effects as well . Still nothing
 I used the oralight pills for almost 2 months . Which was a waste of money they do n't work . I did n't see any changes in my skin .
 I started taking these and my skin started breaking out . I 'm not sure if this was the cause , so I have stopped for a little while . I do plan on taking them for no other reason than they were expensive and I dont want to waste my money . What I did notice is that when using the bleaching cream to try to remove the brown spots caused from the breakouts , I didnt get the normal light spot in those areas . The brown spots are going away but the surrounding skin is staying relatively even toned ; that 's new and I like that . If I take them and I dont break out again , I will probably buy them again but reduce the daily dosage to make my money stretch out a little bit .
 I waited for two months before giving my review because i noticed most reviewers did n't give any follow up reviews.I am black with a light brown complexion so i did n't expect the results to take too long to show as i am not really considered dark for my race . I take two tablets a day religiously for the past two months at first i did n't see any results but i now appear to have gotten two shades darker . Now am stuck with 6 months worth of tablets which appear to be doing nothing if not making me darker , i did n't even get the proverbial glow.For the price i expected so much more . I hope they seller wont keep sending me annoying emails to withdraw this review as it seems impression management is their main concern.The product is n't worth the investment .
 Research is a good thing.I was interested in lightening my skin and decided to read up on various supplements that are supposed to lighten the skin . The key ingredient in this product that does whiten the skin is bearberry aka uva ursi and you can buy it at a much more reasonable price than in products like this . Uva ursi/bearberry is also good for the urinary tract though I dont know if that is related to the whitening effect . L-Glutathione , L-Cysteine & C , 750 mg , 100 caps -LRB- a tripeptide -RRB- also whitens the skin and is better priced.Instead of coughing up too much $ $ unnecessarily to whiten the skin , trySolaray - Uva Ursi , 500 mg , 100 capsulesinstead ofMakari Oralightand L-Glutathione , L-Cysteine & C , 750 mg , 100 caps instead ofIvory Caps - Maximum Potency Glutathione 1500 `` Skin Whitening '' Complex ** SALE REG . $ 49.99 - NOW $ 29.99 - FREE SHIPPING
 I used this product for a month and gained ten pounds !! I think the Glutathione makes my appetite increase immensely ... all I know is that ever since I stopped taking the pills my appetite has cut down but I 'm still stuck trying to lose the weight that I gained . Argh!My skin does appear to be a tad bit brighter but I 'm convinced that it is only because of the vitamin C pills I was taking along with the Makari pills.I 'm still taking the vitamin C pills ... I think this is what really makes your skin look brighter/lighter . This product does nothing except drain your wallet and , in my case , pack on the pounds .
 I purchase the ORALIGHT and it does n't work for me , I dark skin asain and your product has n't change my skin , My skin is the same and it 's been over a month of using this product . I would never purchase this or any product from your company . You should take this product off the market .
 I purchased this item on March 14 , 2011 and it was shipped and delivered in a timely manner so I was please with that . I started using it a couple of days after it arrived . After using it for about a week and a half my sister started to ask me what product I was using on my skin as she said she notice I was lightening up . I did not tell her I was using Makari Oralight because I was not sure of her statement that I was lightening up that fast . I mean I just started using the dog gone thing I felt it was impossible for the results to show so quickly . Another week passed and my sister asked me again what I was using and I finally told her that I was using Makari Oralight and she wanted to use it too but I told her I only got one pack and I was going to use the whole pack and see if I saw the same results that she saw . However I notice that my ankles started swelling tremendously and I started to become concern about this . At first I thought the swelling was due to a HEREDITARY gene we have within my family but as my ankles and my legs started to become bigger I decided that I would stop taking the Makari Oralight to see if this was the cause of the swelling since I notice the swelling started a couple days after I started taking this stuff . Sure enough the Makari Oralight was the cause of my swelling ankles and legs and the tightness that I was feeling with them . To be certain that this was the cause I gave a pack to my sister and she has the same symptoms as I did along with headaches and tiredness . I decided that I did not care to continue with these pills if I was going to be affected like that . It might have been working and I say this based on one individual statement but I sure as hell did not care , for I will never jeopardize my health just for the sake of vanity and beauty .
 Did n't work for me . A close friend said she took it years ago along with the body milk and lightened 4 or five shades rapidly.I do n't want rapid lightening , I just want my face to match the rest of my body . I figured I would buy it , take it until my face appear clearer and then shelf it.I 've been taking 2 a day for the past month along with using the Caviar cream . My complexion is back where I started a month ago . . if not worse ... which is terribly disappointing , considering it 's winter and I have n't really been out in the sun.Damn shame , but the magic lightening pills did not work for me . I 'm actually not sure how this is any different than taking Uva Ursi/Bearberry extract and vitamin C supplements together . * UPDATE * I decided to open up the capsule after writing this review . . just to see what was actually in it . . the pills content are no longer in powder form and has actually become a solid piece - in the shape of the capsule . Which tells me that the product is OLD ! From now on , I will be ordering my products directly from Makari . This is upsetting .
 I 've kept an eye on this product and the comments & must say that it 's hard to believe that in the span of less than a month these supplements went from $ 36 to $ 57 dollars . Folks move on & use another resource to order these pills if you deem it necessary to spend this much money . This particular buyer is n't the only vendor ... they see you coming !
 I 've been taking these pills over a month & i still have n't notice a difference . I 'm going to purchase a second box & try taking 2 daily & see if i can achieve any sort of lightening -_-
 This product did NOT work !!! 1 month and nothing happened . Im so sad and disappointed with this product . I wasted my money on this product . : ' -LRB-
 This product did nothing to me . My skin was still the same color and my wallet is thinner . No points of buying this product unless you would like to waste money .
 I bought this toothbrush several years ago as my first electric . I was fairly satistified with it , but my minor dental problems were not getting much better . About six months ago this toothbrush finally failed and I decided to try a Sonicare Elite - 5 times more expensive . Wow ! What a difference . I just got back from the dentist and , in every measurable way , the Sonicare did a better job . This ai n't a bad toothbrush , but it 's not substantially better than a manual jobber . You only have one mouthful of teeth , do n't be cheap with them .
 After a couple of days of receiving our purchase one of the toothbrushes ceased to work . We -LRB- my wife and I -RRB- never dropped it nor did we treat it in any way differently than we treated the other one . Occasionally it will work for a couple of seconds but is normally unresponsive and has become a $ 20 run of the mill toothbrush . The other one works great and is a pleasure to have and to use even though we now have to share .
 This toothbrush has stopped working within 8 months of my purchase . It was good while it worked , but with a life this short , its not worth the money spent .
 Yes I did notice a difference in my gums . However after about 2 months it died . I even recharged it when fully dead , not after each use , as recommended . Am I going to spend the money to send it back ? No . Will probably buy another brand but am hesitant to waste more money .
 Terrible brush does n't have the power to compete with Sonicare . Either shell out the cash for the real thing or use a manual . When it comes to your smile , why be chinsey ?
 This was a great brush , but the on/off button malfunctioned , so I can only use it by poking a bobby pin into the mechanism . Also , it vibrates so much that it makes me a little dizzy .
 I 've gotten this and I 've got a sonic care . The sonic care head actually moves so the bristles are actually moving . Putting your tongue on the bristles , you will feel the brush head moving along with whatever sonic pulse is moving down at you.What is not clear is that these Ultrasonex the handle vibrates . Yes . . you feel a vibration but for cleaning you must brush like a regular brush rather than gliding it along like the sonic care.For the price it is a low end sonic toothbrush but in comparison to a lot of toothbrushes , ironically a rotating brush head without sonic beat them all .
 Thought I would give a cheapie no-name a try . Right out of the box I noticed the on and off button was difficult to use , and since I purchased this for my 9 y/o son , I thought he may not be able to turn it on and off . I seriously considered returning it then . I should of . It 's dead already , inoperative switch . Good Luck ... Oh anybody interested in some extra heads ????
 This was a nice cheap toothbrush . Unfortunately for me , it stopped working after 2 months .
 Like another reviewer , I found that the brush 's on/off switch ceased working about 5-6 weeks after I got it . Worked well until then , but it 's mighty expensive to buy if it 's only going to work a month .
 My sonicare battery was running low , so I bought this because of the low price . Do n't waste your money , it 's much much worse than the sonicare . The sonicare brush vibrates back and forth against your teeth . The ultrasonex is much less sophisticated and vibrates in all directions , so half the time it 's actually banging directly into your teeth . It felt very harsh on my gums.It looks and feels like somebody just stuck a toothbrush on the end of what in polite company would be called a `` marital aid '' .
 THE BRUSH WORKED GREAT WHILE IT WORKED . AFTER 3 WEEKS OF USING IT I COULD NOT GET THE BRUSH STARTED , THE ON/OFF BUTTON STOPPED WORKING SO NOW ITS USELESS .
 The button on this tooth brush is ambiguous and has become less and less sensitive with each use , until I had to jab another item into the button and poke around for a while to get it to start . Now that does n't even work ! Do n't buy this product because the flimsy button design will render this product unusable after a few short months .
 I bought two of them at once , one for myself and one for my wife . Both of them stopped working in less than 2 weeks . The first one does n't charge any more . The 2nd one appears charging , but no matter how I press the red button , it never come back again . I 'm returning both of them !
 Because of the size of the mirror , the light globe is not bright enough , especially in a sunlit room . I sent the mirror back and bought an almost identical mirror that had a few more watts in the light power -LRB- albeit more expensive -RRB- .
 They show a cord in the photo , but in reality , you will need to hire an electrician to wire and wall mount the light for you . There is no plug , just loose wires . Big flaw .
 There is no cord as listed in the description ! No easy install , unless you have electrician . NO way for me to install without creating hole in drywall to run wires . Very important detail that needs to be corrected in the item listing .
 This item is titled and the lable on the photo says `` pharmaceutical grade '' but the item sent was not . The item sent is labled `` high Quality . '' this is false advertisement and the sellers know exactly what they are doing . What a disappointment . I will not be ordering this again .
 First of all let me say that I have a had good success with MRM products in the past but this pregnenolone product is not one of them . I have had very strange heart palpitations while using it . It frightend me to the point where I quit using it after just one week . Like I a said , MRM is a good company with good products but their pregnenolone is not one of them . A pregnenolone supplement from a different brand may be a better route .
 I 've been taking 50 mg/day of prenenolone for over 11 years , as prescribed by my physician , because it was low in my blood tests . It has always helped . I 've used maybe 4 or 5 different brands over the years , and never had a problem with it . However , in January ' 11 , I bought the MRM brand off the shelf of a natural foods store -LRB- not from Amazon -RRB- , and had severe adverse reactions to it . They started with cardiac arrhythmia , and over a few weeks progressed to severe heart/chest pain . When I stopped taking it , the symptoms subsided . I just hope I did n't cause permanent damage . Nothing else in my routine had changed , just the brand name of the pregnenolone . I called MRM to report this but they were absolutely indifferent . I definitely urge you to buy a different brand , especially at this strength . If I could give it zero stars , I would .
 To start with you can forget about contacting this company . They wont answer email , nor return phone calls . I needed to adjust my order . No reply from this company , they just processed it . So now I have to pay shipping back to them . They made their money on the handling fee , and `` I 'm UP SH#@$ CREEK with out a paddle ! ''
 This is a very dangerous product that contains some of the worst chemicals to ones body . DO NOT USE AS I DEVELOPED MEDICAL CONDITIONS directly related to it requiring an emergency room visit .
 Do n't even bother . Followed the instructions , the powder mixed into a blob with no adhesive value whatsoever . Would n't stick to the denture , would n't even stick to my finger . See your dentist or lab and get a real repair . Or do n't . Just do n't bother with Plate Weld or similar powder-based dental glues . I 'm only giving it one star because the review wo n't accept zero stars .
 I needed to repair an upper denture that had cracked into two pieces . It did not keep the dentures from cracking into two pieces within a few days after the repair . Would not buy this product again .
 sorry this did not work for me after 3 times of trying and they want 8 more words and i have no idea why cause &#34; sorry this did not work for me after 3 times of trying &#34; seems more than enough
 so sorry that I purchased this after shave from this supplier . it is not the real thing . different color , different scent and the label did n't even fit the bottle . In the past I purchased the after shave from a supplier that I have dealt with for years , only chose this supplier as I had an amazon gift card to use . Now I have wasted my gift card and gotten something that I will have to throw away . Wo n't purchase anything from this supplier again . only giving it one star because I ca n't give it a minus
 I noticed my daily multi-vitamin did n't have any Vitamin E in it , so I was looking for an appropriate supplement on Amazon . While looking through product and reading current literature , I found the following : - Vitamin E does not decrease mortality in adults , even at large doses , and may slightly increase it . - It does not improve blood sugar or decrease the risk of stroke . - Daily supplementation of vitamin E does not decrease the risk of prostate cancer and may increase it . - Studies on its role in age related macular degeneration are ongoing as , even though it is of a combination of dietary antioxidants used to treat the condition , it may increase the risk . - It may also contribute to osteoporosis.The most concerning is a study from the Annals of Internal Medicine
 I ordered the cod liver oil gelcaps along with the vitamin E gelcaps . When I opened them , they were identical in color and odor . I do n't know why vitamin E would smell fishy , unless there is something fishy about this product . It would seem that twinlab is a scam , I 'm not sure either product is safe to consume . Very disappointing to spend good money on a questionable supplement .
 Does NOT have any heat . Received two units and both appear to be `` rejects '' - soiled , used , and `` banged up '' . Little more than a weak vibrator . I am very disappointed ... but to send them back would cost about the purchase price ... so off they go to a charity , SAVE your money !
 didnt really work i dont want to write 18 more words , this is why I normally dont review . This is ridiculous
 Ours were also in the strips of 15 and they are not the same quality as the earlier product pictured . These bend too easily and are not even good for a single flossing . Bring back the old tips in the 30 pack .
 This was very poor quality , and not at all strong . The plastic is cheap , not strong at all . I suppose , as someone else mentioned , if you were * extremely * sensitive it would do , but with only one speed it just does not cut it for me . As well , the batteries did not last very long and are expensive to replace . The top kept popping off and would n't stay on which was frustrating . Over all , not worth the price at all as there are many other better quality products for similar prices !
 This vibe has almost no power . I wouldnt even use it just to add to the fun during sex . It got thrown out after the first week .
 The shaver doesnt work at all , I actually tried it on a hairy part of my body prior to trying it on my face , and it did not work . The trimmer did a good job but nothing like shaving would do .
 I 'm not sure why this razor was listed under razors for women , because it certainly does not do a good job on legs . Pretty poor performance .
 These did aid in digestion and prevented abdominal bloating . However , I suffered from adverse reactions/side effects from this product . It contains betaine hcl which will result in a &#34; warm tummy &#34; if you do not have a low acid stomach . I also had an adverse reaction to the pancreatic enzymes -LRB- protease-amylase-lipase -RRB- . They gave me a very sore throat , minor swelling/numbness of the tongue , feeling of fullness and general feeling of toxicity . They work well for many people , but I would proceed with caution .
 This product is a complete waste of money . I followed the instructions -LRB- spray , scrub with damp cloth , then wipe with dry cloth -RRB- and guess what ? Both clothes were pristine clean after that . There was supposed to be dirt on the cloth transferred from the car fabric ! Needless to say , the car fabric and carpet remained as dirty as they were before.I have used another product in the past , and that did the job well , you could see lots of dirt on the cloth you used to wipe . Too bad I can not remember what the brand was : -LRB-
 What about disclosing the number of FCC units per tablet ? . This is not established in any brand name that I checked in amazon and it is the only way to compare the cost .
 Hi.I order the Lactaid Original Strength Lactase Enzyme Supplement , Caplets - 120 eaBUT WHEN THE BOX ARRIVED HERE , THE PRODUCT INSIDE WAS WRONG.What was sended to me , the product inside the box is
 I liked this tub at first . The size was nice , and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn . After about a month of use , though , there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling . This was after `` squeezing '' it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use . The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold.I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days . It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime , especially since it does n't even spray well . The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press . Especially when your hands are wet and slippery.It 's a good thing BRU will take back anything ! I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub .
 I thought this product would be good , but the whirlpool and shower spray is not what I expected . The buttons do n't work well , so you have to push hard on it . Also , the whirlpool and the shower spray do not work at the same time . I guess I expected too much from this product . The tub and baby sling is great , but not worth $ 40 . I think the company should sell the tub and baby sling seperately .
 I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn . I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse . Well , the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it . Also , the button on the shower head IS hard to press , and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom -LRB- found that out the hard way -RRB- . When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick . My daughter does love the spa effect , but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath . The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it . I have washed and dried it many times and can not get this smell out . Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub , which does n't fit very well , so Im a bit irritated . Overall this is a good idea , it needs some kinks worked out of it ... Just not worth $ 40 . So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub : - -LRB-
 Length :
 I put this on my registry because it seemed so comfy and claimes it is made for ages newborn on up . WRONG ! I put my son in it and I nearly had to hold him down to the sling for dear life while I washed him . This might be good for older babies but deff not newborns .
 I am beginning to think that all Summer Products are poorly made -LRB- beware of their Heart to Heart Prenatal Listening system too -RRB- . The shower function worked twice and now it does not work . The whirlpool still cuts on but does n't provide much water movement.There is definitely a design issue with the shower/spa unit . First , you have to turn the spa off to use the shower and the button is hard to push . Second , the unit is located directly at the baby 's feet . When you turn it on your baby will probably jump because of the blast of water on his/her feet . Hopefully your child will not cry and be afraid of baths after that unpleasant experience .
 I thought that this bathtub would be the best thing , because of the shower and spa feature . But the shower is so hard to use , it 's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time . You also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling , beacause it 's just not positiioned right , it sits too high up , and she just looks uncomfortable on it . You also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit . It was n't worth $ 40 , the sling , and the spa and shower unit is n't useful or helpfula t all .
 In theory this sounds awesome , but in reality is comes really close to being useless .1 -RRB- The `` spa '' is nothing more than a light flow of water which is n't even enough to create bubbles , it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby2 -RRB- The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds , the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair . A cup does a better job than this .3 -RRB- The tub itself is pretty decent , the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus.All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub , I advise anyone else to do the same .
 I bought this tub because I was really excited about the rinse/spa sprayer . But it really is a terrible product . The cover on the incline is impossible to get off and clean , it 's ridiculous . And the sprayer got water in the battery case and it stopped working . We never took the top off once we put the batteries in ; water just worked down into it and ruined it . The sprayer hose is so hard to uncoil you ca n't use the sprayer and hold onto your baby at the same time.I would never buy this product again . Just go with a basic tub you 'll be happier .
 We got this as a gift and used it twice to bathe our baby boy after bringing him home from the hospital . We were excited to use it but when we turned on the so-called `` whirlpool '' we were very disappointed . It barely moves any water , and does so only on one side because the jet is aimed to the left . We had put fresh new alkaline Duracell brand batteries , so battery level was definitely not an issue.Then we tried the shower head , which was very difficult to press and activate . Having to press the button so hard and all the while maneuver the baby is a tedious and difficult task.All that being said and done , we used the bath twice and then it stopped working entirely for the third bath . I opened it all up and discovered that lots of water had leaked into the battery compartment and the solder joint for one of the battery connections had rusted off from water damage . I re-soldered it and got the unit up and running again . A few days later and now the whirlpool does n't work . Opened it up and what do you know ? Another water damaged solder joint.What kind of company designs such a poor product meant to be used in water but which is n't waterproof enough to protect the electrical connections ? There is so much water leaking into the battery compartment that my Duracell batteries are rusting away and will likely explode as shown in one of the other reviews.Avoid this and any Summer products ! Save your money !
 When I saw this tub , I thought WoW this is great . It had everything.Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came . I am so glad that I did . The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak . The shower was very difficult to operate , I had to press really hard.The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling . It is very nice . I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better ... in the beginning speed is key , the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub . In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else .
 We do n't have our baby yet - but have tried the tub to see if it works . The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it . this second one the spa works but the shower does n't . The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor . Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one does n't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money .
 I think the concept is great and all , but the pad that it comes with is hard to clean -LRB- maybe I 'm doing it wrong -RRB- - it 's not that easy to pull off of the frame and then since there are foam beads inside , I would n't think that it 's safe to put through the washer ? Let me know if anyone 's found an easier way . Also , the tub pretty big , although my big boy is actually filling it . I guess I was hoping for something that will sit on my counter . The one I had for my eldest was more simple in design but also convenient since it was smaller . The shower is a little hard to push - I mean it 's not super-tough to push but when your hands are slippery and you 're trying to be really careful , it takes a little bit of force to push that button . I think that once this is developed a bit better , it will eventually be a really good product . I like the idea of having more control than just pouring water over the kids ' heads .
 Seriously this is the worst bath tub ever !! I got this from my baby registry and I do n't know what was on my mind the moment I decided I wanted this for my daughter . Oh well , maybe I was too tempted by the `` Spa '' thing . This tub is a real pain ! First of all , the little newborn pad is way too flat , it should be more ergonomic . I had a small baby -LRB- 5 lbs -RRB- and it was a pain to bathe her cause she 'd just slide off that thing but oh well i thought it was a weight and size matter but when my daughter got bigger -LRB- but not big enough to sit on her own -RRB- she still hated that thing with a passion and bath time was hell for both me and my husband . Then one day I decided to try the Spa thing already but oh Lord why did I do that ?! The buttons are soooo hard to push my middle finger ended up with a blister after the first try . A nightmare !!! Finally I decided to give the tub away and ended up with the Sure Comfort Deluxe tub from the First Years for half the price this one costs and bath time wasnt a pain anymore . So my advice , DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS !!!! I gave it 2 stars just because the size of the tub is pretty convenient for me . Big enough .
 I have purchased for my 4-month-old daughter and it is hard to press down the spray -LRB- uncomfortable to use it , so I do not use it and the spray hose just bothers me -RRB- . I rather use the small bowel to pour water on my baby 's skin -RRB- . Also , the edge of bath sling is metal , so it hurts my baby 's thigh and makes a red mark on it . -LRB- It would be really nice if that part is made of a soft material -RRB- . I think the motor sound makes too much noise and makes my baby little scare for her age .
 I dont know why I did not , I always read reviews but I was SO OBSESSED with my son having everything in either precious planet and i mean everything in his nursery I bought out the entire line . literally . Except for his rain forest tub and rain forest jumperoo . I love fisher price they make quality stuff or so i thought . Until he reached almost 4 months . His back digs intot he plastic piece in the middle and when i release the bottom part of them hammock he slips into water . Holding him up his whole back in ridiculous and should be unnecessary seeing as how this bath is a pretty penny . If I wanted to holding him up the entire time I would have bought a bucket . PLEASE DONT BUY THIS , it wont last . Only two stars because its such a cute tub
 This did not fit our kitchen sink as I had planned . Our sink is not a double sink but more like one and a half , so I guess it is irregular sized or something , but I was VERY disapointed at having to use this tub in our dining area rather than over the sink . : -LRB- It also was quite hard to figure out how to adjust the net to get baby to submerge in the water at all . After many unsuccessful baths with baby screaming like a banshee from being suspended above the water and cold . We could not lower the sling to allow baby to hang because the small `` shelf '' in the tub was right in her back . I finally tried placing the sling in the tub backwards from what is shown in the picture so that she was able to set her bum on the shelf like a toddler would do , but still supported by the sling . She got to be in the warm water and actually calmed down and relaxed ! Success ! : -RRB- I have ordered a new bath to try in the sink with her fancy spray hose attachment for the faucet . I also really like the `` Tummy Tub '' I might end up trying one of those !
 I hated this tub , and returned it after attempting to use it twice . The newborn sling has no support , and kept my baby completely out of the water and he got freezing cold . I tried it without the sling , and the `` infant '' seat part also keeps your baby completely above the water , with just their butt covered . I also found that no matter how tightly I tried to screw on the `` legs '' that you have to attach , they were still loose and wobbly .
 The day after bathing our son , I noticed an odor coming from the foam in the headrest . No matter what I do , short of drying the headrest in the dryer after every bath , the odor comes back . The foam sours and fills the entire bathroom with the odor . Also , there is a `` neck rest '' molded in the plastic for the 2nd stage of bathing . It is awkwardly placed and does n't raise the head out of the water enough . Last , the tub does not drain unless you have the feet propped up on something . The opening is closed by the big bath tub . Not a great buy .
 I used this tub for the first 6 months of my son 's life , and I never really liked it . It was OK when he was a little baby and could fit in the sling part , but the pillow would get very cold very fast , and keeping him warm while trying to bathe him at the same time was a challenge.When I took the sling out , the tub became a HUGE pain-in-the-butt . The seat area was almost too small for him , so he was always uncomfortable . Plus , he was n't yet sitting up on his own , but laying back would make the tub tip backwards ... even with water in it . What aggravated me the most though , was just how hard it was to get ALL the soap off his body . The water in the tub becomes soapy as you rinse him off , so unless you have a detachable shower head -LRB- which I do not -RRB- then there 's soap on him when you pull him out.I only used this tub maybe twice after removing the sling . At about 6 1/2 months , I ditched it and bought a bath chair ... MUCH better ! Overall , this was just OK as an infant tub , but no good for bigger babies . I do not recommend .
 I have used this tub for my two kids and have never been happy with it . When using the hammock their back would lay right on that hump and it would leave a huge red mark on their back , I do n't know how they put up with it . And only their little tushes were in the water , leaving me to constantly try to keep the rest of their body warm . The pillow also would get very cold . Without the hammock they keep slipping off that seat and ca n't seem to get comfortable at all . Then , we they are old enough to sit well , the dang seat is too small . At every stage , this tub has been a disappointment . We picked it because it was the fancier of the tubs , but honestly the 10 dollar Safety First tub has a better design and you can just buy your own toys .
 I ca n't adequately express how much I hate this stupid , space-taking tub !!!! I agree with everything the other critical reviews of this product said . We bought it because it was cute and it looked like it would work well . The bump in the middle is an idiotic design flaw . If the manufacturers had tested the tub out with an actual baby in actual water , they would see how useless and scary it is . The bump makes it impossible to lay the baby down full length . The sling does not lift the baby off of the bump , but it does hold the baby almost completely out of the water -LRB- what 's the benefit of that ? -RRB- . The inclined end does allow the baby to recline ... if you hold the baby at all times to make sure their -LSB- ... -RSB- does n't slip down past the bump . If it does , the baby could bump their little head . My major complaint is that the inclined section is too shallow , and that the deep part of the tub is too short . If you use the inclined part , you end up with a wet baby that is sitting out of the water getting cold . I think the `` giant sponge '' - type bath products -LRB- Safety 1st Comfy Bath Cushion -RRB- are best for newborns and then something like the Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Fold Away Baby Bath or Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub would be much better .
 Tub was not great or even all that good . A little bit of water and the material was cool very quickly . Thought my daughter was going to catch a cold .
 This tub would be awesome if that hump was not there , I lay my baby in the sling part and her back lays directly on the hump in the tub . It has to hurt . I would much have prefered the 12 dollar cheapo tubs to this .
 This tub is very disappointing . Let me tell you why :1 -RRB- The newborn stage hammock is very badly designed and really has very little support . You have to tighten the straps very tight because if you do n't , the baby is supported by the tall piece in the middle separating the two halves of the tub . The folks at fisher price were kind enough to mold this with an indentation for the baby 's body , but honestly , would YOU like to be held up by a single beam placed horizontally across your back ?? I tried to pad it with a couple of washcloths after it caused a bruise -LRB- and my son was not terribly wriggly when he was a newborn -RRB- , but that did little to abate the problem . When you do tighten the hammock straps so as to alleviate the pressure from the evil plastic piece , the baby is literally out of the water , plus the hammock itself leaves no room to dunk a cup or scoop in to ladle water over the baby . What an unpleasant experience ! 2 -RRB- The second stage -LRB- reclining end -RRB- keeps most of your baby 's body , again , out of the water even when filled as much as you can get it . See those pictures on the box ? They must be edited , because the actual tub is nowhere near that deep ! -LRB- the bubbles do look kind of fake -RRB- My baby is also long , so his head hits the rim of the bath and did so from day 1 . This made it hard to actually wash him without getting water everywhere . I had to resort to padding this with washcloths , which were necessary in any case because the plastic is too slippery to support a baby .3 -RRB- Third stage for TODDLERS ? It would be nicer if you had somewhere to dunk your cup/hand so that you can rinse the baby . I 'm not having a huge problem with this part right now except for that divider again . It cuts the tub size down for the third stage quite a bit , and is entirely too small if your baby likes to move around at all . My baby is 4 months old and this end barely works for us . I honestly ca n't imagine the third stage working for ANY toddler and am currently shopping around for a new tub.Some things to consider after reading my review
 I bought this for my 2nd child simply b/c it was the most expensive ... so it had to be the best ... right ??? ... WRONG ! The cheap basic one I had for my 1st child was much better ! This one makes the baby sit really high out of the water and the baby quickly gets cold . Plus it left a large red mark on my sons back . He never seemed comfy in it ! It was great while we used it for the baby sling but after that it was horrible !
 This tub is so nice looking . Fisher Price really put thought into how the tub looks . When my son was an infant it was great . Perfect in fact , but he reached 25 inches at 2 & 1/2 months . Too big for the sling & not old enough to have total head control . I took out the sling & wow what a horrible time . I had to hold him the WHOLE time . It was horrible . Half his body stuck out of the back of the tub . Keep in mind you ca n't lay them down cause there is that hump there . I did call Fisher Price & they had me send it back & gave me a voucher for anything else I 'd like to get . so in all it was n't that bad . I got another tub the Safety First & so far so good . It is deep enough where he can sit unassisted & its great . Please do your research BEFORE buying . . It 'll save you some time & energy .
 I thought the sling on this bathtub would be great for my newborn . My baby hates it . The sling sags -LRB- Baby is 8 lbs -RRB- and the bump in the middle of the tub digs into his back . I always wet the sling with warm water before I put him in but by the time I get him into the tub it is cold already . Overall this just does n't work for my baby . I bought a cheap sponge mat that works for now . I 'll try the other functions of the bathtub as my son gets older .
 I bought this for my newborn son who weighed 9-1 , I used the sling for newborns but the ridge in the tub that is used for the baby 's bottom -LRB- when they are bigger -RRB- pushed into my newborns back leaving welts !! So , when he turned about 3 months old -LRB- about 13 lbs -RRB- I took the infant sling out and used just the tub but also had problems . The back rest does not have a non-slip surface so you must be very careful or the small infant will just slide / tip over to the side !!
 We thought this bathtub would be great for our newborn son , but he was never comfortable in it
 I received this tub as a gift off my registry , but hated it . Baby in the sling part made him cold because he did not touch the water . When he was old enough to go in the water , you had to hold him up while bathing . Not a convenient design.I sold it at a garage sale for $ 3 . What a waste of $ $ $ $ .
 When using a sling , your baby is out of the water . It 's good before the navel hills , but the baby stays cold . Without a sling , the tub is very shallow and the baby ca n't be in the water because of the ridge . The water also splashes outside since it 's so narrow . I prefer to use sink instead . It does n't have any weird ridges in the middle .
 I was just about to buy this for a friend when I found it new on the Walmart website for $ 32 . I 'd much rather buy it 100 % new for that amount of money than used for more than that . Ridiculous !
 I loved the idea and bought it without looking at reviews . My baby was born 6 pounds and this bath was great . BUT as soon as she reached 9 pounds I realized there is a `` bump '' in the middle of the bath that cuts into her back as I wash her.So this product is good for babies of less than 9 pounds!Bottom line , do n't bother with this product .
 My son was only able to use this tub for his first three months -LRB- and he was a premie - born at just over 5 pounds -RRB- . After the first few months he became too heavy and his back rubbed on the bump . We took the net off , but then my arm hit the bump trying to keep my baby off it of . It was just really uncomfortable and awkward . I would not recommend anyone use this tub ... there must be a better one out there .
 what a bad design . very uncomfotable , We put it in the garbage after two washes . Junk i would pay 1 red cert for this item
 I put this on my baby registry thinking it was going to work great ! I wish I could go back in time . After bringing my daughter home I tried giving her a bath in it and it was just not a good experience . The sling gets really cold which of course is not good for the baby , the pillow is slippery and awkward , and the bump in the middle of the tub underneath the sling can dig into the babies back . My daughter did not look or act comfortable in this tub . I agree with an earlier review that it is `` not very functional '' . The only thing I liked about it was the cute wash cups ... thats it . Since I ca n't take it back , maybe it will be better once my daughter can sit up on her own . I would definitely not use this for infants again ! Another parent suggested the bath sponge/foam and it works perfectly and my daughter is always happy during bath time . Sometimes simple is better !
 This tub is adorable and I was so excited to get it . I loved the hammock idea and how comfy I thought my son would be in it , but he did n't really sit well in the hammock because the pillow to support his head kept moving around . Then I realized that I was going to have to wash the hammock comstantly because it gets smelly after getting wet and sitting for awhile , just like a wet towel . I did n't have time to keep putting it in the washing machine and most of the time I forgot and would go to do bath time and end up with a stinky hammock !
 I needed a new tub for baby 5 . I bought this one because I have everything else in the rainforest collection and have liked those items . My son weighed 9 and a half pounds at birth . So , from the beginning he was uncomfortable in the tub . I cinched the hammock as tightly as I could , but his little back still hits the dreaded hump ! If I do n't keep my hand beneath his back , his lower lumbar rests right on it ! Have you ever tried to bathe a large , active , slippery baby with one hand ? He wrinkles his brow and squirms rather than enjoying the warmth of the water as he should . I have bathed many a baby many a time in my life and would NEVER have thought putting a hard hump would improve a baby tub ! I removed the hammock -LRB- great idea , bot poorly designed as well -RRB- , folded a thick hand towel placed over the hump , and used an ordinary baby bath sling . This `` set-up '' has worked much better . No more uncomfortable baby or one handed mama . In short , seek out a baby bath tub without the horrid `` hump '' !
 I liked the idea of this tub , but it just does n't work for us . He keeps sliding down despite the sling and his ears will get in the water and there is a bump that I thought would be great to hold him up and in place , but you can tell he finds it incredibly uncomfortable . I usually end up sitting him above the bump so that he stays up out of the water . He also can get his arms tight next to his body and it 's hard to move him to clean them because the tub gets in the way . He 's now 6 weeks old .
 I have twins who were born early and tiny . The sling did n't even work for them bc even when as tight as possible , the bump under them hit their back . I 'm one to `` make do '' so every bath I put a hand towel on it to cushion it at least . I just knew it would get better in the next stage . WRONG !! The next stage where their bottom is supported by the bump is horrible bc the bump is too close and my babies were sitting up against the plastic at a dangerous and wobbly angle . I was so affraid they would flop over that I went out the next day and bought a new one . I am so dissappointed in this product bc I love the brand . I can not even fathom how people give this five stars or even use it at all !!
 My baby is 6 weeks old & I am already seeing an issue with the tub . When he is sitting in the newborn mesh part , his poor lil back is pressed by the HARD rubber piece in the inside of the tub -LRB- suppose to serve as a seat when he can hold his head up -RRB- . He gets a red mark across his back , so I am in the market for another tub already . . what a waste ! I also question the saftey of the tub bc I could see it tipping backwards if his weight doesnt balance out with the seat part when he gets a lil heavier . . hmmm . . Dont go with this one . . Trust Me !
 This bathtub was passed down to me by a co-worker that did n't like it either . I really liked the toys and thought it would be great but I was very disappointed . The sling did not fit a my newborn baby 's body very well and when he was in the sling he did not sit in the water . So the whole time I was bathing him he was cold . Also my son is a pretty big baby and the sling sunk and his back was resting on the edge of the plastic that holds a sitting baby from slipping down so it was very uncomfortable for him . I tried to take the sling off and the seat position would only work for a baby who could sit upright .
 I bought this for my baby and thought it was awesome until she outgrew the sling which did n't take long at all . She can not sit up on her own yet which means the tub is absolutely useless . I am throwing this out and buying something else . What a waste of money .
 This product was great with our daughter being a newborn and worked well when she was not at the point of sitting up . Now it is difficult to have her in the tub since she is just becoming able to sit up on her own . When she lays back she starts to slip down and the tub is not supportive enough for her to sit up by herself . I definately think its is great for newborns and younger infants but around the time my daughter turned 5 months the tub was not what she needed and we had to buy another .
 This tub is the worst infant tub I have ever used . When my daughter was a newborn the sling would keep her out of the water to where she would get cold easily . She also was n't able to stay in the sling for more than a couple months because the tub has a plastic bar that would dig into her back . When I attempted to put her in the tub without the sling , leaning against the back of the tub , she would flop all over the place and the height of the lip of the tub came to just the right level for my three month old daughter to hit her head when she would try to sit up and then lay back again . I would not recommend this tub to anyone . It should be taken off the market . Do n't waist your money .
 I received this tub as a shower gift and the sling is great for newborns . However , my daughter has now outgrown the sling and ca n't sit up on her own yet . The instructions say that you should detach the bottom portion of the sling and use it as a headrest but the problem is that the seat in the tub is not deep enough to hold the baby and she slides down into the bottom portion of the tub . Luckily , I never take my hands off of her while she is in the tub so she has never gone under but I can see how it could happen very easily . This is a great tub if your child can sit up and you want a small tub to bathe them in . It 's also great for newborns but there is a three or four month window where it is useless . I 'm tossing mine out . I bought the Primo Eurobath and it is much safer and will last much longer ... probably until she is three years old .
 I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months , and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere . Also , the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out ... wet Mommy and Daddy ! So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up , but I 'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !
 I bought this item before the baby was born , not knowing how big it actually was . It is too big and awkward to bathe our baby in the bathroom with this tub , so we have to do it in the kitchen . She hates it and therefore I hate it and have decided not to even use it any more ! Invest in something a little more comfortable for your baby .
 This tub may be okay for the first two weeks of baths but do n't waste your money . The back of the tub is raised ... or has a ledge . Your baby is suppose to sit on it once they get a tab bit bigger . Then once you try to put your baby in the water you have this akward ledge in their back ... because you baby ca n't sit up at that point . I would have to hold my arm behind my baby so it would n't be in his back . After using this tub four months I had it ! I bought another tub . If I had it to do over again , Safety 1st made a great newborn tub and I would have went with that one . TRUST ME ! DO N'T BUY IT , YOU WILL REGRET IT !
 I had the Safety First tub with my first baby and bought this when I had a boy , mostly for the colors . This is nowhere near as good as the Safety First . First , the newborn insert is n't big enough for big babies , my son outgrew it within 2 months . It 's very poorly designed for a baby who is n't a newborn but ca n't quite sit up . There is nowhere for their head to go , no support , and my baby slumps over to the side . He 's also easily able to kick himself out of the part that supports him under his butt , so if I look away for literally one second he 's submerged over his face in water , it 's extremely dangerous . It 's a very awkward and uncomfortable position . When they do get old enough to sit up , half of the tub is dedicated to younger babies , so the space they have to play is much smaller.Get the Safety First with the newborn insert , you 'll be much , much happier !
 My daughter loved this tub for the first 2 1/2 months , it was one of the only ways I could calm her during the evening hours . Although , now that she is 3 + months it seems that ` the bump ' located on the bottom of the tub is extremly uncomfortable . Bath time is no longer enjoyable for her as she arches her back to try and avoid the large plastic bump pressing against her back . I would not recommend this tub for babies over 13 pounds .
 We bought the whole rainforest line which is so cute but this just did n't work out for us . From the get go the hammock part never supported our son . His back would hit ackwardly on the hard plastic bump below meant for use with older babies . No matter how tight we got the straps he still sunk too far down . He was 7lbs 9 oz . when he was born and we 've been using this since his cord fell off . He is just now at 2 months 10 lbs . so weight was not the issue . We 've now tried a couple of times without the hammock attachment . It 's better but still not great . He seems to slip side to side and it does seem pretty short , water spills over the back when we try to rinse his head . I would n't reccommend this tub . There may be better options but I say save your money for other things and do like we do , my husband takes him in the shower with him and he loves it :-RRB- . We wo n't be trying any others .
 I got this for my first baby thinking it looked so cute and came with extra toys and accessories . As some other reviewers have said , it was fine for the newborn stage . When it was time to use it without the hammock , the tub became fairly useless . It 's very shallow and my son could almost roll out the side when he leaned over . Additionally , there is some assembly required . The piece that holds it onto the side of the sink has to be screwed on and it was always a little wobbly because of the way the screws went into the plastic . -LSB- ... -RSB-
 This is my second tub I have tried ... first off , its only $ 30 at wal-mart , so if you 're still interested , buy it there.There are a few problems with this tub : First , the pillow is useless - you ca n't wash the baby 's hair when the pillow is there , and if you flip it up , it falls back down in the baby 's face . I had to cut it off.Second , as the baby gets bigger and you still need to use the sling , her back hits the seat below and hurts her . I had to hold her up with one hand and bathe her with the other.So , I tried using the tub without the sling . She is only 2 months , but can lay it the tub/seat just fine . The only problem is that it doesnt seem comfortable for her , and her head rests higher than the seat , which means when I wash her hair , the water does n't flow into the tub , but onto the counter instead.This tub only worked well for the first few weeks . Now I am off to find another !
 The main problem with this tub is exactly as the previous review describes ... the protruding bump . I owned the tub that preceded this model but it was designed to include that bump . The purpose of the bump is to hold the baby in place when the baby outgrows the baby sling . When the baby is in the sling , they slide down and that hard plastic bump is right in the middle of the baby 's back . You will have to keep picking the baby up and sliding her up to get that uncomfortable plastic out of their back . When I used this tub in the toddler position , the part of the tub where my son 's back sits is n't rounded and began to leave a red mark on his back after every bath , which eventually grew into a bruise-like mark . The tub only gets points for looking good but find another tub !
 This tub might be ok for newborns and older children but for the infant stage which is the longest it is terrble . The sling only gets secured to the top and when the whole thing gets wet it gets big and stretches out - causing baby to slide , causing their back to rest on the pertruding `` bump '' in the middle of the tub.Its going back - tried it twice and it was not a positive bathing experience .
 Everyone knows how awkward it is to bathe an infant , so the sling on this tub is what had me sold . Boy was I wrong ! My son screamed in this tub . The sling got very cold once it was wet -LRB- not to mention there was a `` bump '' in the middle of the tub that dug into my son 's back -RRB- . It took us using it only once to determine that this tub will not work out ... what a waste of money ! I have learned that the items with all the bells and whistles are usually not worth the money spent . We are now using a very basic sponge-type bather that sits in the tub and stays very warm . Now I get nothing but sweet smiles during bath time .
 This bathtub advertises that it can fit all stages - newborn , then 3-6 months , and finally babies that can sit on their own . It also comes with some bath toys and is attractive.The sling , I found , to be very easy to wash my newborn in . Granted , like other reviewers , I noticed that it does n't let baby be immersed much in the water but as a first time mom , I felt more comfortable this way because I was paranoid . The baby really liked the sling.The problem is after the newborn stage . As baby gets older and weighs more , he presses down on the sling and there is a ridge that everyone on here talks about mid-way in the tub . While my baby never fussed about it , it would leave a red mark on his back . It says at 3 months that you can take the sling down and put baby sitting up against the head cushion in the shallower end of the tub . Then after that , when baby can sit unassisted , that you can put him in the deeper end . I find it to be very awkward as my baby keeps slipping down and it looks very uncomfortable . I think once my baby can sit unassisted that it may be easier , but for now , I might as well be using the sink . I still use this tub because it 's what I have but I would n't buy it again if given the choice .
 When my son was newborn , it was really awkward to bathe him in this ... bathing him in just the tub or sink was way easier . Now that he 's six months , the bump just marks up his back and I still prefer just putting him in the tub or sink . I 'm donating this tomorrow .
 Just like everyone stated , I will state again ... My baby kept sliding down on the soft sling and I would have to continuously keep moving my baby up so that the plastic bump would n't be on his back . I only put up with the tub because I received it as a baby shower gift and I live in Tahoe where there are n't many options for shopping . When my baby turned 5mons I took out the sling part and let him sit in the tub while I held him . He 's now 6mons and can totally sit on his own . The tub color is the only nice feature about this tub . Look for something better . I hear IKEA has a whale tub that 's fabulous.Fisher-Price what the hell where you thinking on this design ? Thumbs down .
 My almost 5 month old is in the 100 % for height and weight - so she is a big girl . I bought this tub because she is too big to fit in the bathroom sink . She can not yet sit up on her on , so I needed something with support . I thought this would be perfect ... but its not . She is too big for the Level 2 side - where she can sit on the little shelf and recline . And she ca n't totally sit up on her own in the tub side . This tub also slides all over the bathtub , so now I have to hang on to the baby and to the tub just to try to get her clean . Its gotten to the point where the baby will just scream bloody murder when she is on the shelf side . Last night was better because I tried to prop her up on the other side , but it did n't work that well either . If you have a small baby , I 'm sure this tub is fine . But , with a larger sized baby , it does not work at all .
 My Newborn baby -LRB- who came long and about 8 pounds -RRB- dropped in the sling to the bottom hitting the stupid bump and when we remove the sling the stupid bump made it ` again ' hard for us to adjust our son in the tub , this tub is not right for you if ur baby is n't small or tiny ! We are not pleased with this tub Surely because of the BUMP !! it might be a good tub if the remove the bump and change the quality of the sling to make tighter so it will be much safer
 This tub worked fine when my baby could sit in the sling , but the sling only holds up to 10 pounds ! Once he got too heavy , he was sinking down and his back was on the hard ledge and he was extremely uncomfortable . Now I have to try to balance him on this shallow ledge , which he is constantly sliding off of-I have to catch him slipping into the water and re-position him over and over . It makes bathtime very frustrating for both of us ; I 'm going to have to buy another tub because I ca n't deal with this until he starts sitting up.Common sense dictates that you should never turn your back on a baby in the bath , but with this tub , your baby could kick or squirm and be in the water in a fraction of a second . I feel this tub is downright dangerous to use with an infant over 10 pounds who ca n't sit up on their own .
 I got this tub for our newborn . He came out long and big so the sling just drops to the bottom . we remove the sling and he looks so uncomfortable with the bump right in the middle . His head was above the tub lying down as well . This is probably great for a smaller baby . We used it twice and ordered the whale tub which has a removable bump so he can use it longer . He is now 8 months and we are still using it with the bump .
 Loved this at first using the sling with my newborn . Up until he weighed too much for the sling -LRB- 10 1/2 lbs -RRB- . The `` bump '' in the bottom of the tub proved to be a huge problem . It is supposed to support them after they outgrow the sling but it sits them too high up and his head would bob back & forth . We soon retired the tub soon after we bought it . Very unsatisfied with this purchase . He now happily takes his bath on a big towel in regular tub with couple inches of water . Splashes and kicks to his delight . Wish I could have saved the money buying this fisher price tub .
 I owned this tub and I hated it . The ledge that the baby sits on only fit him when he was very young -LRB- only a few weeks -RRB- , after that , he was sitting too high up in the tub and was n't down in the water enough , or he would kick around so that the ledge was in the middle of his back . I ended up giving this away and buying another tub .
 Fisher-Price Aquarium Bath CenterI used it but I must agree when baby was getting older -LRB- 4-5 months -RRB- it became very clear that it was not the best choice . The insert is always cold -LRB- hammock -RRB- , temperature varies between Baby 's butt and feet , because it is just simply deeper and more water goes into the feet area.Space for sitting child is extremely tight.Considering buying another -LRB- ! -RRB- tub ...
 Whoever created this item needs their head examined . I am a grandmother 64 yrs old , and have given lots of infants a bath in my lifetime . There is a plastic hump in the middle of this aquarium tub . So even if you put the infant on top of the hammock , the infant 's back HITS this hard plastic hump underneath it . Another thing
 I registered for this product along with several other Aquarium products . I was so excited when we got it , but the first time we tried it with our new baby , we realized it was not what we expected . The hammock is a great concept , but even with a six pound baby , it did not hold him off of the hard plastic divider in the middle of the tub . My son hated it . I ended up buying a seperate bath sponge to put in the tub . Also , with the hammock , my son slipped down in the tub repeatedly . This scarred him and made bath time such a chore . He is now big enough to sit/lay in without the hammock or sponge , but he still slides . And , the bottom is just too hard . The divider is supposed to make it possible to use the tub at the kitchen sink , but it did not fit on mine . Also , the tub is not mildew resistant . We have drained it and let it air dry after each use , but it still has mildew in the bottom . I have to clean it with bleach weekly and I hate doing that since my son likes to put the attached toys and cups in his mouth . I am now looking for a better tub .
 This tub was great for my son when he was a newborn but once he outgrew the sling it was horrible ! He was too big for the sling but not able to sit on his own yet . Because of the design of this tub and it 's lack of padding or support , he kept slipping and sliding around making it impossible to wash him because it took 2 hands just to hold him up . Now I have to buy another tub . I wish I had never bought this one . There are much better tubs out there - Do n't waste your money .
 there is a bump that sits right below the baby and hits them in the back . i never write these reviews but this bath is horribly designed . there are better choices for sure . .
 I agree with the earlier reviews . We were also sold out on the sling . Just as we were to give the baby bath we noticed the bump right in the middle of the tub . The picture on the instructions appears as if the baby is on the sling and is deceptive . Buyers beware of this tub .
 This was great for baths for the first month when he would fit in the sling . Starting at 2 months old he was too big for the sling but the `` seat '' or whatever the bump is under the sling was completely useless for him . If we had the sling attached at the bottom his feet would get caught on the edge and his back sunk down into the bump . If we detached the bottom two straps of the sling then first of all it just got in the way and either he would lie with the bump in his back or he would be 90 % out of the water with his head above the headrest .
 It worked out great for the first few bath but then I noticed the `` hammock '' it started to get a nasty dishrag smell . I had to put it in the washing machine after every use . Then after about 2 months of that no matter what I did the smell never went away . My daught is 5 months now and we have been usung it without the hammock part for about 2 months now but she is too big for it . Also when she is in it she seems to be too far above the water only the bottom of her bum sits in the water and she gets cold even with the heater on.It was ok for the time being but I will be buying a new one very soon . I would n't reccomend it
 Whom ever designed this product obviously did n't use it on a big baby , or a wiggly baby . I love the colors , and I love the mesh cradle that can be hooked to the tub for a newborn . However , there is a huge hump in the middle to create a seat , and it ca n't be removed . If the baby lays in the mesh , and is heavier than like 9 lbs , they sag and their back is laying right on the uncomfortable hump . Or , if you want to submerge their body in the water , they have to sit on the seat , and most of their body is out of the water , and only their feet are in the actual bath . This would n't be a huge problem if a washcloth was placed on them to keep them from getting cold , however , my baby likes to wiggle , and would wiggle right out of the seat over the hump , and slip in the bath water . He did this over and over , and it made it very hard to give him a bath . The tub part below the seat is small too , so a baby ca n't just lay in it . My baby was all squished . Since I ca n't just lay him in the water of the tub because it is too small with the hump in the middle , and I could n't put him on the seat because he would wiggle out , I had to stop using the tub when he was only like 2 months old !! My older son used this tub for a while , and did well in it ... but he did n't try to wiggle out of it , so I could actually sit him on the seat , and he would sit still . Cute tub , fun toys that come with it , but I hate the hump in the middle ! SO annoying !!! I wish I could remove it !!!
 Compre esta ba & ntilde ; era por ser distinta y resulta que cuando llega no trajo los cojines . Deber&iacute;an de explicar mejor como viene ... no me quede conforme .
 This tub was such a disappointment ! I absolutely hate it ! I have used it twice and I am throwing it in the garbage . Do n't waste your money on this bath !
 To the people saying that you can remove the bump in the middle , you can not , at least on the model I have that is about 3 years old . I am not even sure they make a newer model with no bump for this aquarium theme . I DO however like the Fisher Price whale of a tub , THAT one does have a removable bummp that sits lower inside the tub , so the baby is in warm water and is much happier . But at first - newborn up until 3 months all you really need is one of those bath sponges they sell at walmart or kmart in the baby section for like $ 5 , they are soft and get the job done .
 Do not buy this bathtub . I accidentally registered for it without really checking out and it was a big mistake . The bath was fine as long as my daughter was small enough for the hammock . Once she outgrew it , the bathtub is useless . The headrest is not helpful and all since it 's not high enough to support her head . The positioning of the tub is such that she sits in shallow water and her whole body is outside of the water so she gets cold . The worst part of the tub is its actual design . THere are two compartments ... one for butt to rest and other for legs . My daughter likes to splash around and more and she constantly slips down and there is a hump wedged into her back that separates the two compartments . It 's extremely frustrating to bathe her because either she tilts to the side because there is no support for her upper body or she slips down into the water because nothing there to hold her in place . Stay away from this aweful product . I 'm looking into getting the Primo Euro Bath . All the review on it are amazing . Hopefully mine review can save you some serious aggravation .
 I totally regret putting this item on my baby registry . For the past 4 months I have struggled while using this bath on my own . When my Husband can help with the bath it 's not too bad but to use this on my own is a total nightmare . The sling when my baby was a newborn was not supportive and the pillow at the top of the sling never fit his head properly . After only several uses and following the recommended cleaning regimen the sling became discolored with black markings . Despite multiple washes in the machine it would not come out . It looks gross , like mold . We think it is from the manufacturer 's tag . At the recommended age we removed the sling and even at 4 months my son hate 's the bathtub and slides all over the place . He is never comfortable in it . It has not made bathtime a fun event . It is also so large that the only place to store it in our condo is in our bathtub which is annoying to move in and out when we use the bath/shower . I do not recommend this tub . In fact , I ca n't wat to get rid of it .
 I bought this product for my new born baby . On day 4 we used it for first time . First thing I noticed was that head support can be better . I was surprised , when I put my hand below mesh , to feel some hard plastic supporting mesh to prevent it from touching bottom . I tried to adjust the straps but that did n't work . They have curved it so it will not damage spine . I still do n't like to think that babies back is supported by some curved plastic ... . I would rather buy something where mesh is not supported by anything . That would be more comfortable for baby.I read some other 5 star reviews -LRB- probably form company sales department employees or their spouse -RRB- where they try to undermine fact that bump digs in to your babies spine . They say you should read instruction so you will understand why there is a bump and why it should be there and its not a problem . One review even says that concern with bump is laughable if you read instruction.Fact is if your baby is above 9 lb , you might hurt your baby with this product unless you are very careful . So why take a risk ? Stay away from this product .
 I really did n't like this product . It was very hard for my 6 month old son to sit in . It did n't have any cushion or slip pads for him to sit on so his bottom was slipping and he could n't sit up correctly so I moved him to the laying down part . I was going to Oregon to visit my family and had it shipped there so we had something to use , so thankfully I do n't need to use it every day as I have my own at home .
 These new pest strips do not work . When Shell first brought them out they were great . Now , however , they have either been diluted in strength or allowed to dry out . The result is a pest strip with little effect .
 UPDATEDEAD IN ONE WEEK . THERE GO MY STARS . STICK WITH HOT SHOT.INITIAL REPORTI was leery about trying any brand other than Hot Shot 's Orig No Pest StripsHot Shot 5580 No Pest Strip Unscented Hanging Vapor Insect Repellentbut these shipped faster and I was desperate . The whopping chemical smell that hits ya as soon as you rip open the foil package let me know it was going to do the job . Not a thing with wings around me anywhere . Yes inside the home with A TON OF VENTILATION ! Have n't had a summer without it since the 70s . The big initial scent dissipates immediately . Let me repeat though only apply this off-label usage if you can keep it many feet from anyone 's face and with copious amounts of fresh air flowing through your dwelling.I have no pets so I ca n't attest to the safety of using this product if you do have pets in your home .
 maybe it works good in a sealed box , in real life , , in a retail store of all things where those pesky fruit flies seem to be everywhere.hang 2 in the store , I dont sell food items , i sell boxed electronics , the trash is emptyed every day , , these made 0 differenece after 3 weeks , a can of raid , , made a difference in 5 minutes
 I like NOW Vitamins , unfortunately the description did not mention that it has Vitamin D in it . I have to take prescription D so ca n't take this .
 It makes glasses stain.And I return it within 1 week .
 I am 53 years old and being a recent denture wearer for almost one year , I 've learned a lot about what to use and not . I like Polident Dentu * Gel 100 % better than the creme . The gel is much less abrasive on the dentures than the creme plus the creme is more difficult , at least for me , to clean off the toothbrush . If I have to use the creme because I run out of toothpaste I do , but again the gel is by far , far much better .
 Bought this for my grandfather who has bad arthritis in the knees . He said it did n't work . Then again , nothing does . Just passing along what he said .
 Bought this for my girl and she loved it , but it only lasted a few months . The bunny died , which makes it kinda useless . I fixed the motor , which was a huge pain , and the motor is incredibly low quality , it 's a joke . Of course it died again in short order , as it 's bound to . Do n't buy this model unless you want to spend this money several times a year . If you do n't care about reliability , then I 'd give it 4 stars . Maybe the newer models have different motor designs , but I would n't count on it . Unfortunately , I 'm guessing most manufacturers in this field are just as bad or worse , but I have nothing to compare against .
 I have bought this product several times over the past 4 years . It had been my favorite vibrator after trying many ! I have had several decadent indulgence 2 wear out and break . But , I love this vibrator so much that I keep replacing it . My most recent purchase , Dec. 2011 , was disappointing . It is not the same vibrator as listed in the description . The company has changed the material that they use to make the shaft and rabbit with . It is a softer jelly and does not transmit the vibration like it use to . Also , the rabbit ears no longer have the textured nubs on them . I am severely disappointed that I purchased this Item thinking I knew exactly what I was getting , only to be sent a modified and useless product . Not returnable . Buyer beware !
 Several years ago , I had a product that looked exactly like this one . Same color , same buttons , same name , etc. . I loved the `` bunny ears '' , especially on the highest speed . I guess I used it so long , so much over a couple years , I wore out the motor or something . The `` bunny ears '' portion quit working . So I researched the internet , and Googled `` Impulse 5 sex toy '' . I found this one and read all the reviews . Men and women gave it high ratings . So , I decided to order this product , with hopes that it would perform exactly as the previous Impulse 5 had done . WRONG !!!!!! Even on the highest speed , the `` Bunny ears '' were quite disappointing . It made a high pitched whining noise that the other one never had . I bought new batteries and tried it again . I tried all the speeds , all the vibration patterns . I was very disappointed with this product . Due to the no returns policy regarding personal health/intimate product policy , I am stuck with a dud .
 I paid too much money for a waxer that was not what I thought it would be . It does n't stay warm long enough to finish the `` job '' . It is nice and compact .
 I read so many critiques of this product and they were very positive about it 's performance . My past experience with the regular Secret product led me to believe that I need to try Clinical for better performance since I seem to out perspire the strength of the regular and though I truly believe the amount Clinical costs is too much for the amount provided , I ordered it anyway . Boy was that a mistake !! I figured the performance would make up for the cost but was I wrong . This product does no better than the regular Secret and it was a waste of my money when I could 've just stuck with the standard . Now I need to yet again find a new anti-perspirant .
 I recently purchased secret clincal strength , and I am not pleased with the results . I applied some of this deodorant at night and followed the directions . Instead of leaving me powder fresh , It left a very unpleasant odor ... worse than sweat . My daughter also used it and people in class commented her scent . It was a very embarrsing situtation for her . One positive to secret clinical strength is that it leaves smooth armpits . I recommend that you dont use this product . Go to a doctor and get perscription strength .
 I purchased this product and used it like the directions said and I sweated more and smelt bad and I usually do n't have a problem with smelling bad . I also tried it at morning and evening , no results . I highly reccomend against this product unless you just want your armpits to smell good for 10-20 minutes .
 The deodorant itself has a nice fragrance and rolls on smoothly . However the dispenser requires very dry hands and strong fingers to press the deodorant through the slots at the top by rotating a disc at the bottom . I usually must thoroughly dry my hands and/or wipe off any lotion on them to get enough traction to dispense it . I bought a 3 pack at Costco and would be happy to return it for something easer to dispense .
 I started using this product last Thursday , it is now Monday . The only time I have an issue is when I am at work . I get really nervous and stressed around this ONE individual at work . It did n't work on Friday , but I thought I would give it all weekend to work . Well it 's Monday , did n't sweat a drop all weekend , but I was at work 15 mins and I 'm sweating like a pig now . I guess I must just be special . I really need to learn how to deal with my stress and just get over it . It 's really annoying .
 Just wondering how long it took for reviewer to see her results ? I do not want to jump ship prematurely but this morning two and although I seem to not be perspiring as I usually do -LRB- I do n't want to read to much into that either since I have been sitting in my office with a fan blowing on me all day : - o -RRB- I still notice droplets breaking through?So , my question to ANYONE , how long before you notice the complete drying effect?Thanks
 Applying aluminum to your skin is NOT healthy , its extremely bad for you . And you need to sweat , your body needs to rid its toxins somehow ! There is evidence linking aluminum to breast cancer -LRB- altho it also says not being able to rid toxins by sweating at the underarm also contributes -RRB- and Alzheimers , sure they claim `` there is not sufficient evidence '' , but SOME is enough to me ! WHY risk it ? I have always had a very hard time with sweating and odor , but no secret product or any other product for that matter has ever worked for me . I used to look for the highest amount of aluminum in an attempt to stay dry and smell-free , but no success . Now I am using a deodorant from a health food store . I am wetter , but not to the point of soiling my clothes , AND NO WHITE MARKS ! You can go to health food stores and get crystal sprays or crystal solids -LRB- I personally hate the crystal-solids -RRB- and there are stick or roll-on alternatives . Avoid aluminum , parabens , and triclosan -LRB- importantly too-antibacterial soaps -RRB- . This product states that it even holds its chemicals `` just below the surface of the skin for 24 hours '' , HOW is that healthy ? Its just more chemicals , more toxins , rid your body of toxins , rid your body of odor !
 When I first saw Secret Clinical Strength being sold , I was curious to see how much more of the active ingredient -LRB- aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex -RRB- it was offering over Secret Platinum Strength , since it was about triple the price . Platinum Strength had 19 % active ingredient and Secret Clinical had 20 % . Out of curiosity , I also checked Mitchum - it had 20 % of the same active ingredient , with a much cheaper price tag -LRB- I spent too much time in the deodorant aisle that day , obviously -RRB- . I concluded that Secret Clinical was a ripoff , and later recommended Mitchum to a friend who was using Clinical Strength . She said it worked just as well and ended up switching to Mitchum.I , however , am a Secret fan and stuck to my Platinum strength , which worked well for me . The last time I went to the store to buy more Secret Platinum , I could n't find any of the 19 % strength - every Platinum package I checked only had 16 % . It could just be the store I went to -LRB- Target -RRB- , but if P&G ; is no longer selling an effective product in order to steer more people toward an overpriced solution , then I 'm no longer buying Secret . After yet another bout of scintillating deodorant comparison , I ended up buying a 2-pack of Suave at 19 % active ingredient for $ 2.98 , and it works wonderfully .
 I sweat moderately-to-heavily and tried Secret Clinical Strength as soon as it came on the market . First of all , I neglected to check the product weight ... the box is enormous , but the actual container itself is VERY small ... and only filled about halfway , at that . So , per ounce , it is extremely expensive . Secondly , while the deodorant aspect is fine -LRB- smells fresh throughout the day -RRB- , the antiperspirant aspect is TERRIBLE . I 'll have pools of sweat under my arms within two hours ... something that does n't happen with regular deodorant/antiperspirants , even in the summer . Perhaps it 's my personal body chemistry , but this product does not work for me .
 I bought this at around $ 8.00 , got it home and read the ingredients . It is EXACTLY the same active ingredient as the Secret Platinum anti-perspirant . It only contains 1 % more of the active ingredient , and as far as I can tell does not work any better.This is a complete rip-off for what it is . I would suggest trying something else . And just a warning check label before purchasing !!!
 Sorry , this stuff works great , but it is WAY OVERPRICED and a rip off . Save your hard earned money and buy Suave - the 24 Hour Protection - make sure you get the 24 HOUR PROTECTION Suave , it has the same ingredients and same strength only for much cheaper - on sale you can get it for $ 1.79 or $ 2.49 regular price !!!
 I never liked the secret product line . I thought hey , I 'll give this one a try . In a desperate attempt to find a new product to cure the extreme sweaty armpits.This product is horrible ! I wish I could have given negative stars !! I swear it made me sweat more than ever before . -LRB- keep in mind this is only a normal day at work at the office -RRB- imagine the gym ... It 's an absolute waste of money . Honestly I never write reviews , I was just so compelled to do so to warn anyone who thinks of purchasing this product !!
 I used this product exactly how the directions said , at bedtime , everyday until the container was empty . I never saw the advertised results . Perhaps because the concentration of the active ingredient is only slightly higher than in the average antiperspirant , it is only slightly more effective . For me it was not worth the extra money . It would be a good choice for a woman who may sweat a little more than average and who wants softer underarms -LRB- I know that 's an great concern for all of us -RRB- . If you are like me and sweat regardless of the weather and of stress , you probably have an actual sweating problem and would be better off seeing a doctor about it than buying an ineffective antiperspirant .
 I do n't think this works much better then any other product I 've tried . I wo n't buy it again .
 Just like any woman who has a higher than average sweating problem , I decided to try the clinical route and picked up this product.I tried it for a few weeks , ok worked well . Now it 's summer and I 'm sweating way more . I 've found I 've had to apply this product twice a day ! I went through way more deodorant than I should and it was costing me a lot more money.Also , it 's pretty bad when your significant other comments on how bad your armpits smell since the product does n't work !
 This product might work if your a mild to moderate sweater but it certainly did not work for me at all ... I have tried the Gillette clinical strength deodorant for a while with great results and right off the bat I 'll say that I 'm a heavy sweater . I switched to this product because it had the same amount of active ingredient and also that none of the stores around me seem to carry the Gillette product anymore ... Unfortunately while it smells good -LRB- women 's deodorants always smell better that 's why so many guys secretly use em -RRB- it is not by any means a powerful enough product for heavy sweaters , first of all unlike other similar products you must apply this product in the morning too , this means they clearly know its less effective as almost all other clinical strength deodorants require that you only apply before bed time and then in the morning switch back to your regular deodorant . I Have religiously applied this twice a day as instructed and lets just say I sweat right through it within an hour everytime , which led to so much embarrassment with my job the day after I switched to this product ... This product might work for some but if you sweat a lot -LRB- you know who you are -RRB- try another product .
 I purchased this with great hopes that it would really be similar to a prescription strength antiperspirant . I used this for two days before I noticed a difference but it was n't anything impressive . I would still perspire , just not as much . I had a prescription for Drysol previously and this does n't even compare to that . I would use it once and not have any noticeable perspiration for 1-2 weeks at a time . This would prevent me from sweating until about half way through the day unless I was nervous , then it just really did not hold up at all.It does have a pleasant smell to it . I had read a few other reviews on different sites that described the smell as being terrible but I did not mind it . It sort of reminded me of Teen Spirit.Overall , I was not impressed with this product and I could have bought any other deodorant/antiperspirant for a cheaper price and received similar results . This product is great for someone that really does not perspire much but people that do are better off to just go to the doctor and ask for a prescription . That is really the only thing that I have found to work well . I will use the rest of the deodorant and will then go back to using Drysol .
 Mitchum for men Unscented has the same ingredient at the same level and is less than half the cost . It works very well . I have used it for years and I am a woman . Secret Clinical is a total rip off . You can use Mitchum and save money . But you wo n't smell like a flower or anything because it is unscented . Secret Invisible solid is the same ingredient at 19 % , which I find works just as well and offers different scents , and it is less than 3.00 as opposed to 7.49 for the `` Clinical '' ! It is just another marketing tactic to make you think you 're getting something that is n't already out there . Mitchum has been around for a LONG time ! Do n't waste your money .
 When I first came across an ad for the product , I figured I 'd give it a try . I have tried almost every product out in the market , including branching out to men 's deodorants . Unfortunately , I was very disappointed in this deodorant . It does not work any better than the standard Secret line , which is about 1/2 the price . It does not significantly reduce sweat in the pits . I tend to sweat more than an average person , and I do not recommend this product -LRB- even if they have tempting $ 2.00 off coupons in the Sunday papers . -RRB- The deodorant is also semi-wet , so the consistency is between a gel product and a regular solid stick . Therefore , you need a minute or two for the product to dry and for the `` white stuff '' to disappear .
 As a deodorant , I think it works slightly better than my usual Right Guard . It 's not astoundingly great . However what prompted me to write a review is the ridiculous dispenser . It requires the strength of ten thousand men to operate . I ca n't get it to turn at all . I have to ask my boyfriend to do it and even he can only turn it with a weird special grip technique . The fact that no other reviews seem to mention this makes me wonder if I just got one with a manufacturing flaw . But really ... it 's absurd . I would never buy this deodorant again , at least not in this dispenser style .
 The insole fit a D with , and I have EEE . So they are too narrow . Seems like a good product otherwise
 I didnt order this item . . I came across it while doin a search . . based on previous experience with this supplier . . most probably u wont get it b4 it 's expiry date . . cheers all . . and shame on u vitaminlife
 this is just replacement drive unit does n't come with charger ar single brush head . I do n't think it was advertised this way . Therefore it is not a bargen at all . Dos n't even have a led indicating charging . You shopers out there go for better deal
 The product was not in the original box and there was no charger base to put it on , no brushes , nothing but the engine . I still can not use it . Furthermore , the pictures published in Amazon.com for the product does n't reflect exactly what they delivered . It seems to be a try to deceive the customers.I DO NOT recommend this seller .
 I got what seems to be a Braun Oral B handle , but it does not have the timer feature or the charging indicator -LRB- see your own illustration - the little dot near the base is the indicator led in question -RRB- . It works and charges -LRB- sort of -RRB- , but seems to lack a little power . It did not come in a closed or sealed box , just a clam shell plastic cover that was held together with a single staple . I am not going to buy an entirely new setup when all I need is a motorized handle . If this one craps out I will consider another brand or go back to a series of manual brushes again . In fact I may do that anyway when my supply of brush heads runs out . I am not a particularly happy camper . In fact I just checked the unit to see if it is actually the item advertised , and it does not have a model number and is only marked with Ni-Mh . The original , at $ 19.95 , with heads and charger stand , had a Lithium battery . The replacement for the kit I originally purchased , is $ 79 . NOT !!!
 when i purchased , there were brushes pictured . when the product arrived , the seller claims that someone else put the pictures up , and he was n't responsible for that . how can that be ?
 Gingera has 2 active ingredients-baking soda and tartaric acid -LRB- Cream of Tartar . -RRB- It 's inactive ingredients include regular sugar -LRB- sucrose -RRB- and corn syrup . Does anyone still feel that corn syrup is `` all-natural '' ? `` Ginger-ale flavor '' and `` real '' ginger are among the inactive ingredients.Yet the product is hyped based on it 's `` all-natural '' - ness and named after the the `` soothing '' properties of ginger . To say that it is made of `` pure and natural baking soda `` is absurd . Sodium bicarbonate is sodium bicarbonate . This is one of the myriad examples ofdeceptive marketing which unfortunately is now as prevalent in the `` all-natural '' and `` organic '' market sector as in the food mainstream . And of course it carries a super-premium price . To call it deceptive marketing is not strong enough . It is unconscionable . We ca n't legislate the problem away . People have to be willing to read labels and educate themselves . As always , buyer beware . If this product interests you you 'd be better off having some bicarb and some ginger ale .
 This hot water bag should be called a warm water bag . Though I fill it with boiling water , it simply does not emit heat . It is well made and the fleece is cozy , but the essence of the bag is a flop . I did a lot of searching and thought the Germans would produce a good quality HOT bag , but this is not the case . I spent a few weeks in Ireland this summer , and each night my hostess gave us all a ` hottie '' to warm our beds . The `` hottie was still hot in the morning . That 's the kind of bag I wanted
 was told by someone who has a lot of pain it was wonderful stuff . I put it on and nothing !! It smells cool but thats it . It didnt get cool or hot Its basically blue lotion . I wish I had not wasted my 21.00 , could have used the money for something useful .
 This product was a BIG disappointment . Did it provide support ? No . It compressed after just a few days ' use and is totally useless . I might give it to the neighbor 's dog to play with because frankly that 's all it 's good for .
 I bought this at a medical supply place for $ 30 and can not return it . It is n't very supportive at all and compresses to barely 2 '' .
 The elastic strap is n't strong enough to keep the pillow in one place ; it rolls up and down and you constant have to adjust it between your back and the chair . In order for it to sit correctly you have to tighten it so much that the elastic is sure to wear out in a matter of weeks . This model is too too stiff for those of us with smaller/lighter frames -LRB- it does n't compress enough under my weight for my upper and lower back to come even close to the back of the chair -RRB- .
 This roll is huge and pushes me way too far forward . As an average sized woman I ca n't see using this size roll in any kind of seat unless it was really concave and wide .
 This roll is absolutely unusable . This lumbar roll is filled with foam and it changes its shape with pressure . It does not server its purpose as lumbar roll 's must be slightly firm so that the arch in your back is maintained . I used this lumbar roll and stressed our my back muscles because of irregular sitting using this roll . I went to the physical therapist and they said that this is a low quality roll and gave me a much better one for little more than this price but it serves my purpose well . Do not buy this roll if you sit for long hours or have back pain . This roll does not help .
 After a week on my chair this thing was out of round and the strap could not keep it on my chair . It falls down and is misshapen , hardly of use . I wish I had bought something else because this thing is hardly even usable now . Spend your money on something else and you 'll be better off .
 This roll does not match the quality of former purchases for lumbar rolls . It crushes easily and does not support my back . I would not buy another .
 I found this too thick to fit comfortably but did like the original mckenzie lumbar roll . I would get that instead .
 I use it when driving . It 's too short . If it 's not perfectly centered , I can feel the edge of the pillow -LRB- kind of -RRB- digging into my back . It does n't hurt , but it 's annoying . I have to continually reach behind me -LRB- while sitting in the driver 's seat -RRB- to center the pillow . If it were longer , like 16 inches , I would n't have to keep reaching behind me -LRB- while driving -RRB- to adjust it . Also , the zipper handle occasionally comes up and that too digs into my back . Again , when that happens , I have to awkwardly reach behind me to adjust it . I guess they make it short to scrimp on costs . BTW , I 'm not a big person -LRB- 5 ' 11 , 170 lbs -RRB- , so I 'm surprised more people have n't mentioned this . Aside from its length issue , the pillow is well constructed . No complaints in that regard . It 's still firm after a year or two of use . Because it 's too short -LRB- for me -RRB- , I 'm giving it two stars .
 It 's tough to keep this in place on your chair - it slides around and is a bit uncomfortable . Wish I 'd purchased something w / a little more contour .
 Too firm and not comfortable at all . I do n't even use any more . went back to using rolled-up towel .
 I found the other lumbar pillows to be usable , but not this one . It 's too thick and hard . I also bought the slim model which is very good .
 This roll was very comfortable at first ; however , after using it for less than a week it has deformed into an oval shape and offers no support . I was only using it for a couple of hours a day ! My last lumbar roll lasted for years without losing shape . Very disappointed in this product .
 The idea is great ... the design is almost there . The thing with this is , it goes flat really fast . After it is flat , then it 's just a thin pad between you and the chair . Nice idea , but nothing an old towel ca n't do for you .
 I got this pillow thinking it would help my lower back while sitting on a reclining chair , but it does n't at all . As soon as I laid back on the pillow , it collapsed and basically became useless ; flat like a pancake . Plus , the pillow was much smaller than expected and the strap did n't even fit around my chair . I returned it and would never buy it again .
 I bought 2 due to my back problems and the raving reviews.The quality is alright but it does n't stay in place and the strap does n't really hold it in place.It slides down and ends up being in the bottom of the backseat.If I buy again , I 'd buy something that fits the arc of the back and no need to spend a lot .
 With ten years of reoccurring back problems I have kept old towels and t-shirts in my car -LRB- s -RRB- for years as I am frequently in need of additional lumbar support . When I learned from my physical therapist that they actually made special rolls that worked much better I was very excited . Unfortunately I 'm absolutely disappointed with this product as it provides nearly no support , going flat under the pressure of my body . I also ordered the Compliance Roll and it 's even worse . And to answer the burning question , no , I 'm not 300 pounds or a big guy in any capacity . I weigh about 170 and neither product does much of anything in terms of lower back support . Perhaps the firm roll would have been a better choice , but I would n't risk the money to find out . Stick with the old towels , shirts and pillows . They are cheaper and do a much better job !
 My expectation for the Mckenzie Lumbar Roll was that its firmness would last for longer . . Not 2 months old yet and it is beginning to feel soft .
 the pillow quickly loses its firmness within weeks.Its quality is much poorere than when I bought one 4 years ago . I 'll ask for a refund .
 The concept of a lumbar roll is very useful , and this product fulfills that need , albeit with 2 major obstacles.A , after a few weeks , this becomes as flat as a pancake and is useless ... and B , you can create as good , or better support with an old towel , or generic foam piece or any number of improvised materials . These people pray on one 's desperation to feel better , instead of giving you simple directions as to use common household items they lead you to believe this will be that much more effective ... well , it is n't so do n't waste your money . Lumbar support it very useful , but you absolutely do not need this product to obtain it .
 I 've had this about two weeks and am disappointed in it . The strap does n't fasten well around a standard office chair and easily loosens . The roll says it 's a `` standard firmness . '' That 's a meaningless description and makes it hard to make a sensible purchase . I 'd say that this roll is not even as firm as what you would have by rolling up a normal terrycloth towel into a roll form . Worse , after only a few days , the roll became deformed just by virtue of having used it . I 'm going to now spend the $ for the `` firmer '' roll but am not terribly optimistic given the quality of this product .
 I 'm a fairly average sized guy -LRB- height/weight -RRB- , but the foam in this roll is n't firm enough to keep it from going completely flat when in use . It does return pretty much to its original shape when not in use , however , it does n't support my back enough to maintain the proper curvature of my lumbar when I 'm seated . Perhaps I should have ordered the firmer version that some of its reviews claim was too firm . It 's too late and not worth the time and money to return the two I received . Perhaps I should have ordered one of each . With two ruptured discs , this means I may end up buying a third lumbar roll -LRB- firm this time -RRB- when I only needed one roll .
 for most people the super roll would be better , thinner and firmer but I do n't love either strap lumbar good ...
 I work on computer 8 hours a day . I looked this product online and thought it might help me reduce back pain . I use it everyday on my office chair but , i am not satisfied with the product . Once you put it on your chair , you have to adjust it every time you change position . It slips of the chair and the elastic band does n't hold it well . Overall it does help a little bit but its more of botheration for me .
 After a back surgery , I purchased both standard firmness and firm density to try them out . I 've used them on my work chair and a couch at home . Standard firmness one gets flattened after using it for few minutes and no longer gives any support on lower back . Firmness density one stays its shape no matter how long I use it and gives a good support . I hope that both have better straps so they wo n't move .
 We read the other reviews and were anxious to try it out . It was worthless . It was uncomfortable to use and did not offer any comfort only more pain .
 Only thing about this product is the cheap price . I have not thought it is a kind of simple sponge . You can not consider a piece of sponge as a lumber support .

 They only sent me 1 of the 6 candles , and still charged the full amount . I arranged an exchange to get the full order , and they STILL only sent me 1 !!! I finally gave up and sent both orders back for a full refund , and they just notified me they are only refunding me $ 6.67 !!! They are ridiculous !!! I am paying for something I never received !!!
 Although the product worked well , it was much too fragrant . So fragrant that I only applied it once and could not use it again . What a shame .
 I ordered this item and just received it . I was NOT shipped what is shown in the image for this product . What they sent me has no red and green color bars . I was sent an entirely different product - one that I would NOT have purchased . Beware of this seller . They are misrepresenting their merchandise .
 I ordered this specific eye chart because I wanted to replace my old one that was 22 '' long . This one was described as 22 '' long , but was only 11 '' long . The chart does the job , but does not fill the space where the old one was and that was what I wanted it to do.Snellen Eye Chart - Model 10 Foot
 I have a 25 punds beagale that sheds everywhere like crazy . I was tired of spending money on the Scotch rollers so I decided to give this product a try . What a mistake ! It does not work on pets hair at all . Big waste of money !
 All it is is a red lint brush that is self cleaning . If the red lint brushes work for you then so will this ... otherwise keep your money . BTW , a red lint brush at the dollar store + your vaccuum cleaner would be even cheaper .
 general stuff
 This was definitely not the same lint wizard I had in my home . I ordered it for my mom because she liked mom and this one did not work as well .
 I COULD PICK UP MORE PET HAIR WITH MY FINGERS THAN WHEN I USED THIS THING ... SO OBVIOUSLY A TAPE ROLLER WOULD WORK EVEN BETTER ... KEEP YA MONEY AND USE TAPE ... THIS PRODUCT DESERVES A NEW WORD TO REDEFINE HORRIBLE ... NOT TO MENTION THAT THE PRODUCT BROKE AFTER ONE USE ... NOT AT ALL `` AS SEEN ON TV '' ... IT 'S A LIE ...
 I have no idea when my batteries are charged up . Sometimes the blinking will stop after 5 mins , sometimes 3 hours . When I put the batteries -LRB- Duracell 2650 Mah -RRB- in my camera , they die after 20 shots . Is there something wrong with the charger or the batteries ?? Anyway , Duracell sucks !!!
 I got a good deal on this battery charger , but it is n't even worth what I paid . I have only used this charger once or twice a month , so the usage has been very light . With a brand name like Duracell , I expected this charger to be of good quality . It worked fine for the first few months , but not any longer . After the batteries are `` fully charged '' I will put them in my electronic devices , but they are still out of juice .
 I bought it to replace my old Olympus charger which finally broke down after 3 year in service . I have been fighting with it since then . I am now thinking of buying a Sony or whatever -LRB- but not Duracell -RRB- to power my digital cameras up.It does not work for my Olympus and Energizer rechargables which worked well with my old chargers . It blinks for about 30 min and indicates the batteries are full -- not a pleasant supprise !! Stay away from this charger , it will cost you more than the money !!!
 THIS DID N'T TAKE THE STAINS OUT OF MY SINK . IT DID MAKE IT SHINY , BUT THE SHINE DID N'T LAST VERY LONG .
 It says to shake well , pour small amount of polish onto a clean soft dry cloth and apply to surface . Buff with clean dry for brilliant shine.I have been using a lot of dry cotton soft tshirts . And , no matter what motion , cloth , or effort the entire panel in the fridge is smudgie . From the first application from the bottle onto the surface of the fridge , the cloth comes off black . Then cleaner and cleaner but never shining without all the circles , linear moves . Quite frustrated as I used the spray oil in the past and it was like 2 seconds job .
 This item is actually dangerous , the edges are not properly filed . I would not even use it on my horse -LRB- If I had one -RRB- . Too much troulbe to return , will be used to carve my name into wood .
 This is very low quality tool . One of those that you can get off ebay for $ 1 . It 's marked ` Pakistan ' and ` stainless ' . I sterilized it by boiling and left it to dry . It got rust just from that.I used to clean dog 's teeth with a screwdriver -LRB- sic -RRB- the steel is better on it for sure : - -RRB-
 Please do n't buy this product and try to scale your dog 's teeth unless you are a trained canine dental tech ! As a former -LRB- human -RRB- dental tech , I know the damage that you can cause in a mouth that is COOPERATIVE , let alone a wriggling DOG ! You can get your dogs ' teeth professionally cleaned , by trained techs , without anesthesia , for around $ 100 at various vet offices and pet supply stores . Call around , especially to holistic vets , or Google `` gentle dental '' or `` anesthesia free dog tooth cleaning . '' You would n't buy a `` Neuter Your Dog at Home '' kit . Please do n't take a chance on hurting your poor doggies , maybe causing bleeding , infection , broken teeth , pain , fear , and goodness knows what else .
 I have been looking for a new scaler so from the pic online it looked curved , just what i have been searching for . It 's not curved , it 's angular . My dog 's molars are a good size , he 's a 79lb Greyhound , this tool is way too big and dull.There is a $ 5 processing fee if returned , so I kept it . It might be the right size for a much bigger dog , maybe a Mastiff or Irish Wolfhound
 I bought this tool with hopes that I would be able to successfully use it on at least one of my dogs . They are complete opposite sizes , one small and one very large . Both have a lot of dental tartar and build up . They are well behaved and sit very still for me to to things like this to them so that is not an issue.The first thing that I noticed when I removed it from the packaging was how sharp each end was . If your hand slips at all , this could potentially be very dangerous in your dog 's mouth . Still , I carefully tried it on each of my canines but it made no difference . It was not able to chip off any of the plaque or remove any tartar and I was afraid to put too much force into it as I did n't want to damage their gums in the process.Personally , I would not recommend this tool to anyone else .
 I hoped to have a classy sleeve when I bought this product but it is no where near being elegant . The leather is tough and the sewing is thick . Certainly not for office use . Waste of my money .
 I paid extra for 1-3 day delivery and I ordered this item on August 23rd and was informed that I will not receive the item until the end of the month .
 I had to return the item . This basket does not attach to curved fronts of walkers . This basket will only attach to totally straight fronts on walkers .
 The basket did n't fit the walker . It looked used . It did n't come with instructions , yet there were some loose pieces that we could n't figure out what to do with . It did n't securely clip onto the walker and would fall off easily.I called the manufacturer to return it , and the person on the phone said they would issue a call tag to pick it up free of charge . We waited three weeks , it never happened . We finally sent it back ourselves and the shipping cost more than the product.My advice
 It is hard to get onto the walker and it does not sit up very well . It tends to hang downward . It is connected with strips of velcro . If you need to fold the walker , you have to take each one of these back off again .
 This item does n't even deserve one star.It is so cheap ; it comes with Velcro strips to attach and support it against the walker and it does n't support it well.The `` beverage holder '' is a flimsy piece of cheap plastic .
 Item is amazingly cheap and flimsy -- not worth the $ 13 I paid for it for sure . The basket is white plastic coated wire , just like standard wire shelving common here in Florida , except the wire is very thin and flimsy . The spacing is so wide that many objects will just fall out.The so-called tray is the same kind of plastic that serves as plastic wrap for so many products -- the really tough stuff that you need really sharp scissors to remove -- except this is so thin I feel that I have to handle it gently to keep if from tearing . It will hold a glass , but if the glass is full , it strains this flimsy stuff -LRB- you can see the tray in the photo if look really closely -- it 's that cloudy looking area at the bottom third of the basket -RRB- . The tray is needed to keep objects from falling though the wide spacing of the basket bottom wires.Mounting is nothing but some Velcro strips , except -- you guessed it -- real Velcro is sturdier . You can indeed mount it to the front of a walker , but it likely wo n't fit right or hold much weight . You would be far better off getting a sturdy basket at your local bicycle shop than trying to make this thing work . Amazon carries several baskets that cost no more and are far better quality , such as the Medline basketMedline Walker Basket for 2 Button Walkerfor 2 button walkers for only one dollar more.UPDATE
 sorry I purchased this cheaply made walker basket . velcro stips do not hold well and it tips over . RATE ZERO .
 I have been drying these in the sun but after a short time they all looked wet and crumbly . Not suree if the protective packets inside are defective or are the actual cause . I 've worried a bit about the safety thereafter but am using up the product after drying out . Will go back to Source Naturals . sorry .
 I 'm not really pleased with the NOW Methy B-12 product . I expected to feel some change in energy after taking the product and felt I was taking a sugar pill . I even increased the dosage and still nothing .
 I do not know if this medication is effective or not . I have n't had vitamin B12 levels checked.However , this bottle has 100 tablets . At one per day , it takes over 3 months to use up the bottle . Before I was halfway through the bottle , the tablets disintegrated because they absorbed water from the air . There is a dehydrator packet in the bottle , but , apparently , it did not work . I dried out a couple of dehydrator packets I took from other bottles , but the tablets still disintegrated . I ended up throwing half of them away.NOW brand needs to one of two things :1 . Put only 30 tablets in a bottles -LRB- I started noticing deterioration at about one month -RRB- OR2 . Put in better dehydrator packets.Capsules -- I 'm going to order a brand with capsules instead of tablets .
 Although this formula works well I am afraid it is nothing more than buying 2 % hydrocortisone for an inflated price.The cream works well , as well as the steroid prescriptions given by my dermatologist . The formula includes a plant named Ku Shen , fine , but it is a white cream , what are the other ingredients ? My rash disappears overnight and then comes right back in a day or two , and blood capilaries come to the surface of my skin - JUST LIKE STEROIDS USED TO DO TO MY FACE.Sooo I call the Dr Kang folks in San Francisco to be sure because I do n't want to be using any more steroids . They claim they can not reveal the active ingredients . They say the `` formula '' can not be given out!Buddy ! ... I 'm not asking for the formula , I 'm asking for you to tell me the * active ingredients * , i.e. anything that would be placed on an over the counter cream one buys at the drug store . Steroids damage your skin in the long run!Short story , Dr. Kang will not reveal the active ingredients -LRB- besides Ku Shen -RRB- or even if the formulation contains a steroid . In other words , they do n't know ! TOTAL SCAM IMO and a huge liability to all the businesses that sell it !
 it is not as the picture showed above . It is just a small plastic bag without any English instructions and other words on it ...
 The ad says `` Free Shipping '' after approving the purchase I found out that the almost 8 dollar product cost an extra almost 6 dollars for the shipping that was clearly advertised in the ad as free.I tried to email the seller but got nothing . The seller is misleading and false advertising100 Duri Bleached Muslin Epilating Wax Srtips 9 X 3 Free Shippingand Amazon should be ashamed for listing them here .
 This pen case is greatly overpriced and of inferior quality . The fabric liner is very thin and feels and looks cheap . I will be surprised if the zipper lasts more than a few months . The label says it all - `` MADE IN CHINA '' . I will never again buy anything from this vendor .
 This is not for use for vegetarians like it said . Read the ingredients . It says there is gelatin in it and that contains animals by-products , -LRB- hooves in fact , from the animals feet and toes , which are shaved off , there is also pork in it as well , and vegetarians do not consume animals by-products , neither do vegans . Muslims do not either , because of religious reasons . I am vegan and I wo n't even consider trying it . so be careful what you purchase with the animal by-products in them . Especially if you are allergic to some of the ingredients , like me . Read the labels carefully . I just read this and noticed that ingredient . Just wanted to let all the vegetarians and vegans to not consider this one . There are other vitamins that are natural and do n't contain any of those ingredients in them , especially the gelatin , which also contains pork . That is why some people of certain religions can not eat jello . further research is need to provide proper ingredients to the consumers who are able to tolerate them in their systems.Notice that the ingredients are contained in the capsules but it does not state that it is in the tablets , be careful with that one , all the ingredients are the same no matter if in a tablet or capsule.The picture and website say -LRB- 250 caps , capsules -RRB- but on the bottle it says 250 TABLETS , watch that one , it was miss - marked apparently.Dana
 Is it just me or are you noticing more and more errors being created for your orders on Amazon lately and that the quality of products they sell are getting lower , too?I ordered Now brand L-Lysine as described here but I instead got ones from Origin brand . What the heck ? How do they justify this ? And on the web , it says the order is fulfilled by HerbPro but on my invoice , it says it was Planettool . All this seems so shady to me . I am very disappointed and I do n't even know how to approach this issue .
 The batteries are 1/2 mm shorter than the other standard AAAA batteries I tried and three out of 20 were dead with no charge in them . I used a battery tester and my mm scale to find what the problems were when trying to use them in my Stramlight . Cheap , and that is what they are .
 Batteries were a bargain but we 're too old and many had to be thrown out .

 I really was wanted to like this stuff . I LOVE Pina Coladas so figured what the heck . I read the other review who dreamt she was drinking a Pina Colada . I am 65 and take some other pills , vitamins , etc so thought this would be something easy ... take a spoonful and that is that . My husband says it is n't too bad . However , that being said I could not handle at all . It was so thick it was barely coming out of the bottle . It was thick , chalky and frankly not too different than the stuff I had to drink before a barium enema ! Maybe my taster is off ? Perhaps , but there is not a way I can take this . Back to looking for another way to get my calcium . !
 These gel capsules are huge , larger than an inch long each , and you have to take FOUR per serving !
 Due to medical reasons , I am stopping the use of harsh ingredients in my products . This deodorant glides on well , smells nice - but it does not work . I am not the type that has to wear deodorant each day , and I do not have active b.o. . . until I started using this product . I smell off-putting . It does not work for me .
 Sorry , I have done a good job at using it every day for 2 months but it is the worst taste in the whole world ! I am only doing it because it was so expensive and with the hope that although it tastes so horribly bad , that I may get some benefits . I do n't feel any different , no big changes in hair , nails of any sort . My husband has been using it also and he does n't notice any difference either . I am sure it is helping with vitamins but honestly this is a horrible tasting product . No matter what you mix it with , you feel like you are eating grass . I do n't think it blends well , I can feel the grass blades against my throat when I am chugging it . Wish I did more research and realized how awful this product is on the taste buds .
 The stool leaves a lot to be desired . It is fine in the open position , stable and comfortable . But trying to fold it is ridiculously hard . The bracket that secures the folding leg grips it very hard , and a significant amount of force is needed to release the leg for folding . Also , in the folded position the stool would not stay upright in the shower stall , it fell over constantly . I gave up on it in the shower and now keep it in the garage to sit on when washing the wheels of my car . I replaced it in the shower with an excellent folding teak stool I found at Bed , Bath & Beyond , it takes up less room , folds easily , and does not fall over when leaned on the shower wall .
 using it on a desk chair with wheels and cushion leaves only a little gel at front of cushion making it so that you slip forward after a few minuetscausing you to have to get up and sit back which works OK BUT again only for a few minuets . Top of cushion is very slippery .
 I got what I paid for when it came to this pair of ben wa balls . I purchased them for $ .99 , they are made of cheap plastic , and there is a huge seam where each hemisphere of the balls is joined . This is definitely a novelty piece and should not actually be used to assist you with kegel exercises .
 I bought these because I read that Kegel ball are a good exercise for tighten your wall ; these balls have the weight but there were no instructions as to how to use them.I emailed the seller on instruction but never heard back . My dilemma is do you insert both balls or do you insert one ball and let the other hang , also do you continue doing your self Kegel exercise with the ball -LRB- s -RRB- inserted.I give it a 2 only because ' I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THEM '
 I was a HUGE fan of the Feather Touch razor with its phenomenal ability to produce a baby soft shave . So when I discovered there was an updated version with a rechargeable battery , I jumped right on it.The new sleek design is definitely appealing , however , that 's about where the appeal ends . First of all , the shave itself was not nearly as close as the original version . I went over the same areas over and over , yet this version was unable to give me the same close shave as its predecessor.The worst part , the rechargeable aspect of the Body Bare is a joke . There is maybe a 10-minute charge , which is quite an inconvenience when the charge runs out in the middle of a shave.I would suggest sticking to the battery-operated version until the rechargeable version goes through some major and much-needed improvements .
 I bought this shaver expecting great things after reading all of the reviews . I was disappointed . It did offer a fairly close shave , as long as you trimmed it very short first -LRB- like only one days stubble -RRB- . That was fine , it was worth it to get a closer smoother shave . It never was completely smooth though , but it was the best I ever got , since razors just do n't work for me , too many red itchy bumps that way . You do need to take your time with this razor , it is not a quick shave . I do love the trimmer that came with it for free , no problems with that at all.However after using it for only 5-7 times , it just stopped working . I thought the charge was dead , so i charged it and it still did n't work . I was so bummed . HOWEVER , I contacted Amazon even though it was long past return dates , and they refunded my money . Talk about amazing customer service . Maybe mine was just a lemon , try it for yourself , but at least know they stand by their product .
 Did not work as advertised for me or my partner . This razor seems underpowered and does a very poor job for me & my wife . I have fairly fine pubic hair , and after following the directions carefully found that it did not leave me `` bare '' at all . I am going back to a sharp blade , which seems to work best . I recommend you streer clear of this unit .
 The Body Bare shaver never performed the way the company claims that it will . The people who have reviewed this item with 3 , 4 , or 5 stars must have gotten a special razor that was made before the item became popular , because I think the newest models are horrible . Do n't waste your money .
 Body Bare was my first choice for pubic hair removal . Although it worked fairly well for a while and I liked the rechargeable aspect , my first shaver got a tear in the foil top making it unusable . So I bought a second one . Worked for a while , then the foil tore . Bought a third one . Same problem . This time I tried to purchase just a replacement foil but that was so expensive I just bought a fourth shaver . Again , it worked for a few months until a hole developed in the foil . Finally , realizing that repeating the same actions over and over and expecting a different result was the very definition of insanity -LRB- DUH ! -RRB- this time I bought a Seiko CleanCut and I really like the shave it gives much better . I 'm hoping the foil lasts longer .
 this thing is worthless . it does n't give a razor burn but it does n't do any shaving . I bought this for my girlfriend and after 2 uses it 's been tossed . save your money
 Do NOT BUY this PRODUCT !!! Neither of these 2 products do anything they claim to . After using either / both I still had to use my old shaver which I was trying to replace when buying this combo . Very disappointing and then for that price ?! Do not waste your money . I would not even give this bundle one star , but the review wo n't be processed unless you choose at least one star !!!!
 I just received the shaver in the mail yesterday and set it on its charger . I used the free trimmer that came with the product and was cut several times by it . I found it so frustrating that I decided to use a straight razor for the initial shave and then maintain with the intimate stubble shaver -LRB- the actual product -RRB- . I used the product today on a full charge and with tons of baby powder as instructed via the manual ... and was cut three more times ! After noticing the second cut I just gave up on shaving . And the areas that were shaven without pain , still have stubble . I 've never had an electric shaver cause nicks like this . I understand the trimmer causing some nicks , but the product itself ? I do n't recommend this to anyone for any part of their body unless you want to leave the hair and remove the skin .
 This shaver does not provide a very close shave . The only type of person this might work for is someone with light hair . If you have dark hair and light skin , you will be able to see the stubble left behind . It is also very tedious to use , because it has to be kept up every day , it has to be stubble and no longer , and powder must be used . In certain areas it is difficult to manuveur and will not shave the hair all the way . It would be bad enough having to shave in the shower every day , but this makes it even more difficult because it must be done outside of the shower.The trimmer is the worst of all , it 's loud and does n't do a very good job . It cuts your skin very easily.I 'd like to know what the `` pros '' or at least famous women use down there besides getting a wax . From what I have seen and tried , shaving does not provide an adequate solution .
 The product is what I want but I have only used it 4 times now and the blades seem to be dull . I can get the same amount of use from a straight razor . What do you suggest ? Is this product returnable ? I am not so sure it is worth $ 56
 I 'm guessing the positive reviews on this product MUST to be in error . I 'm a fair skinned female with thin , straight hair . Most of my leg hair is blonde -LRB- not very coarse at all -RRB- . This shaver specifically says it only works on stubble length hair ... so , to test it fairly , I first shaved my legs with a razor . After only TWO day 's growth -LRB- the kind of stubble you can barely see -RRB- , I tried this shaver . It did NOTHING . I repeatedly ran over the same spot ... over and over and over . Each time , it seemed to pick up ONE hair -LRB- not exaggerating -RRB- . Left my legs still feeling prickly . It goes without saying that it did n't work for more personal areas either . What an absolute ripoff . I threw mine in the trash . Seems there 's nothing better than a good old fashioned razor !
 I purchased this item and was never able to get it to work . I as given the option by Amazon to send it back but unfortunately I do n't always keep up with my e mails , so by the time I got the message , the time frame had past . I just did n't find it very user friend . I followed the instructions but it did n't seem to work . I do n't know if there was a flaw with the shaver -LRB- did n't seem to be able to hold a charge -RRB- , or what the problem was .
 Trimmer pinches and painfully pulls hair . Shaver catches 50 % of the hair at best . I was hopeful , but no luck here .
 This product worked great the first time I used it . I have sensitive skin on my bikini line and this product finally gave me the shave I wanted without the pain . Less than a week after I bought the shaver the bottom battery cover fell off and the product no longer works . I have tried to reattach the bottom multiple ways with no luck . This product was not worth the 50 something dollars that I paid for it . Big disappointment !
 I got this for my dad . It was hard to set the time . The voice was not loud enough for him to hear . It stopped talking shortly after purchase . Dumb
 I bought this watch for a friend whose watch was no longer working . Within a few days this watch stopped working correctly the talking part of the watch would read just over 6 hours ahead of the real time that the watch was set to -LRB- even after resetting it several times -RRB- it would work for a few days then jump time . Can not figure out how to get it to work correctly . Piece of junk .
 I purchased this watch for my dad . He is 87 and recently got macular degeneration in his second eye . Because of this , he could no longer read the time on his regular watch . This watch is described as unisex and when it arrived I tried it on . The band was tight on me -LRB- a female -RRB- . It was easy for me to set the time on both the hands and the speaker . I figured I could replace the band with a real men 's band if necessary . I brought it to my dad in the nursing home and he was thrilled with it . He declined the offer for another band saying that this would probably stretch out with time . The voice could have been a little louder but if he put the watch to his ear he could hear the time . However , within three weeks the voice stopped working . The hands still work so I do n't think it 's the battery . And after reading the other reviews I see that they do n't last . It 's a great idea , but defective product .
 Bought the watch for my 90 year old mother , I was out of town for 3 weeks , per my conversation with my mother , the watch has not worked from the time it arived.Need to return .
 I bought these vitamins for the second time . The first time , everything was normal . Now came the packaging in which tablets are very different from those who came for the first time . They did not have a fresh new look and color of those pills that have to be white - brown . Possibly due to incorrect storage conditions . Please return the money back or send a new box of Animal Pack .
 I got this to replace the p90x vitamin supplement because other reviews said it was roughly equivalent.Compared to the p90x supplements , these have several disadvantages :1 . The pills are huge and hard to swallow . You literally have to choke them down .2 . They stink and taste bad .3 . You have to consume 2 packages per day vs just 1 a day of the p90x supplements .4 . They are not an exact nutrient match ; in some cases , not even close . Do a side by side comparison .
 Today 's world is about convenience . 11 huge multivitamin to swallow everyday ? That 's a bit much for me . There 's a lot of hype around animal/universal products . Yes GNC sucks but their megamen multivitamin is one of the highest rated in the fitness world . Two pills a day and you 're done . You also get more serving for your money . There 's more pout there if you research . I was lucky to find out after 3 years of trial and errors that there 's a lot of hype in the supplement industry . Fake reviews , models etc. . . you name it . Protein , creatine MONOHYDRATE -LRB- yes you get water retention and blah blah ... but it 's the most studied , oldest and proven form of creatine that delivers result -RRB- , a nice multivitamin and a CONSISTENT workout routine is the secret . Look back at all the supplement you 've taken and ask yourself for how long and are you where you thought you 'll be ? Get in the gym a workout consistently changing your routine often and see for yourself . Consistency my friend ... consistency .
 I used to take these vitamins regularly ; however , after doing a little research , too much of a good thing can be bad for the body . I am not bashing Universal . I take a lot of other products that they produce . But you can be toxic on fat soluble vitamins
 Leaving alone the number -LRB- 11 -RRB- and sive -LRB- huge -RRB- of these pills compared to other multis , be warned , the body does not need , and can not process , much more than 100 % of the RDA of most vitamins . For water soluable vitiams such as B6 and C , the only danger is added stress to the kidneys -LRB- the dark urine warned of in many reviews -RRB- as the excess vitamis are excreted . Ask any doctor and he/she will tell you the same
 Listen , I 'm not a real gym rat or anything like that , so maybe this just is n't the right product for me . I found the supplement to be too intense for me , like a very strong caffeine buzz . If you really need that push to get going , this stuff probably is great , but for me , it was too much . I switched over to 5 hour energy or b12 pills pre-workout to give me a more gentle push .
 I bought these to step up my workouts , and now have trouble dragging myself to the gym , or even taking a jog around the block - have been taking for about a month now , hoping it was something that I needed to adjust to , and then would see results - I dont see how I can continue taking these - theyre killing my energy levels and taking me in the opposite direction I wanted to go .
 I 'm not a gym buff but I faithfully take vitamins and do cardio . Usually I take about 10 a day , at the same time . Other reviewers were n't kidding when they said these vitamins were HUGE . I almost choked just swallowing one of them . I only tried it for one day because it just made my stomach feel uneasy . My testosterone felt slightly outta whack that day also .
 22 horse pills , gave me a mild energy boost nothing more . Your liver will work overtime trying to digest so many pills . A strong cup of coffee and 2 mutivitamins worked better .
 I bought this product because I was on a plateau during my workouts , I had no more muscle gain and my training weights were not increasing for a whole month , I did a search online for a product that might help me to break this plateau and I thought what about multivitamins , and the multivitaming of the year at one of the famous bodybuilding websites was this product here , but I di n't notice that I will be adding to my daily routine 11 bills per serving , in the first day I took it with lots of water as mentioned -LRB- a liter -RRB- and I felt that my kidneys are suffering a little but that feeling went away next day , urine turned to really dark yellow and after 15 days of this thing my stomach started to hurt and I had things like nausea so I stopped it immediately.So unless you have a really strong stomach and willing to take 11 pills a day do n't go for it .
 why did this products price jump up so much ... over 10 dollars in two months ? it was good for 21.00 but not at this price .
 This product is over all a great multi , only problem with it was it dident work for me , with that being said , for the first 2 weeks of taking the pak , i became tired as i continued to take the pakmy fatigue increased . I looked up my symptoms , and i found out that one of the ingedients in the pak may cause strain on the liver therefor overliading youre body , botom line for me it did noy work but hey at the end of the day you can do WHATEVER THA F# $ @ YOU WAN NA DO !
 After 35 years of taking vitamins I tried animal pak because of the positive reviews . I found animal pak to be useless and noticed absolutely no difference from taking nothing . So much for reviews .
 i never got this in the mail !!!! going on two months now . . i am sorry but its a bit ridiculous .
 I loved the ingredient list for this MV . It has everything an aspiring bodybuilder could want . It 's one of the original BB vitamins . It 's so original that it has n't changed it 's vitamin profile since 1983 . Why should it when people still buy it ? It banks on the popular yet misinformed novice bodybuilding community that more is better . The science exists to pack every EFFECTIVE vitamin in to one to three pills for everything that an aspiring bodybuilder could need . Universal wants you to cram eleven , yes , ELEVEN bulky pills down your throat -LRB- ok , not all of them are bulky but at least five of them are -RRB- . Seriously , try something else , anything else before this hyper yellow pee inducing vitamin pak .
 I went through a whole can of this stuff and seen no difference than when not taking the pills . Never felt more energy or that my workouts were better at all . To me it was pretty much a waste of money , it does provide a lot of vitamins though and that 's the only reason i gave it 2 stars .
 I switched to Animal Pak about 3 weeks ago . I had been taking GNC Mega Men Sport , and was satisfid with that multi from an energy and ` stamina ' perspective , but I was so impressed with the positive reviews of Animal Pak I decide to try it out . I am by no means a serious weigh lifter , so I was n't looking for a multi that would help me make huge gains , just something to keep me emergized through my workouts . I take 1 packet in the morning , about 2.5 hours before my workouts.After taking this for about 3 weeks , I can say that I do n't feel the sort of energy that I had with the Mega Men , in fact , I am usually dragging by 2:00 on the Animal Pak . It also tends to give me a headache , which was not a problem with the GNC product . I 'll be switching back to the Mega Men Sport as soon as my Animal Pak runs out .
 BEWARE ! Not all Bath Addication/Spa Sister products are created equal , and you 're in deep trouble should you not be satisfied ! I bought some turbans -LRB- 1 good , 1 flimsy and crummy -RRB- in North Carolina but did n't open them until I returned to Texas . When I called to find out where I could exchange the unsatisfactory one , I was told I had to return to the place of purchase ! Incredulously , I asked them if they actually expected a retail customer to go half way across the country to return a $ 9 turban ?!?! They would n't provide a Texas retailer contact and continued to insist that it is company policy .
 Item came in a box that was yellowed and old . Box was stained . I am afraid to use the meds .
 all of the dispensers are too big to even get into a medicine bottle nevermind my newborn sons mouth . maybe meant for toddlers .
 At least it was semi-cheap . I had hopes for the soft-tipped dispenser -- that our 8 month old might suck the meds out better than through a syringe and eliminate drooling half the meds away -- but he would n't latch onto it -- it is n't actually very soft . Also , we dose 2ml and it is such a huge dispenser that it ca n't be very accurate at 2mls . I also had hopes for the bottle shaped one , but it is way too huge for 2mls . For something like gripe water or tummy soother it works much better at his dose of 1.5 tsp . However , I was disappointed to find that unlike traditional screw on bottle tops , it snaps on and off and is difficult to do . I like the eyedropper syringe the best , but the markings are so light they are very difficult to read , especially inside a medicine bottle -LRB- I used a sharpie to mark 2mls -RRB- and also it is quite large for a 2ml dose so I do n't think it is very accurate . The other parts I have n't used and I honestly do n't understand what the ear piece is even for .
 This medical kit is very cheap . I tried using the dropper , and it was terrible . I threw everything away after realizing they were not worth keeping .
 the measurements where not clearly marked and very hard to read . I was very disappointed by that . my child does like the soft tip of the dropers .
 This is not my favorite hair coloring product . It 's extrememly messy , takes forever to rinse the glop out , and it leaves your hair dull looking and feeling like straw . Also , for me , the color change was far too subtle , even after an hour . There is , however , a LOT of product for the money -- you could easily do two applications from one box for long hair or more for short hair . If you want safe , SUBTLE color/highlights , this might be your thing . Just use a conditioner , especially one that gives shine to the hair . -LRB- See my review for the red shade -RRB-
 This product left all kinds of herb pieces and twigs in my hair . It is very poorly shifted and I ca n't tell if it had any conditioning effect because I 'm still washing the product out of my hair , several washes later . I will never buy this brand again , and will spend my money on a higher quality henna .
 these use to be good all the thigh wrap bands do not work , the key element that made it work was removed and it was downgraded junkier material the neoprene skin on the inner part made it work but the it was stripped out it slides down or you have to overtighten an engineer at the company thought it would be better by making it very cheapy I would wait to buy it until the old design is brought back
 Iodex is becoming both increasingly scarce and expensive . I should have bit the bullet and bought another jar of Iodex instead of this crap . Nothing draws infection out of and heals a wound like Iodex .
 I purchased this product based on many recommendations , but it does n't work . It has n't opened up -LRB- or reduced -RRB- one single pimple or cyst I 've tried it on . All it has served to do is smell bad and make my face sticky .
 I hate it , because it simply did n't work , just makes your skin oily and disgusting , and has a really bad smell .
 I am very disappointed because I had high hopes for this product , but it has done absolutely nothing . It also smells awful .
 it is a foul smelling useless product . I ordered this after reading the reviews ... and so far nothing !
 I am a big fan of Hyland ` s products . After reading all other reviews of this product I ordered it . After just using it for couple times I got a pretty strong allergic reaction on the skin . Beware of this potential complication .
 really didnt work on moles at all ! I dont know about anythig else . used it for two weeks and not a thing .
 This product did not work for me at all . it didnt even speed up the process or nothing . I used it for almost a week with no difference . too bad , it got really good reveiws from othet people .
 I purchased this at Fruitful Yield . I read all the great reviews online . I decided to try it on a cyst under the skin . Right after rubbing my finger on it to soften it up and get some on my finger I started sneezing . I put it on my skin anyway thinking it was just a few sneezes . My eyes welled up , throat felt dry and the sneezing continued . I really wanted to try this stuff so I thought I 'd muster through the reaction but it was getting worse . Within 10 minutes I washed it off with soap and water . The allergic reaction stopped . I looked up the ingredients and I am not sure what I am allergic to . I have been exposed to most of the ingredients before except maybe ichthammol , so I 'm just not sure . Who knows since companies put so much crap in everything - I guess I have n't put a marigold up to my nose since I was a kid , so I suppose I could be allergic to those too -LRB- one of the ingredients of this stuff -RRB- . Anyway , I ca n't use it , that is why I gave it two stars . I will keep it around to use on the kids or pets and if I find it helps with anything , I will update my review ! I sure would like to know what in it I am most likely allergic to if anyone has any ideas .
 Although the product worked well , it was much too fragrant . So fragrant that I only applied it once and could not use it again . What a shame .
 I thought Nad 's was known for their `` NO HEAT '' method . However , its new bikini wax needs to be microwaved , and there are no strips . You need to wait for the wax to harden , then you have to peel the wax off as is . If this part was written in the item description , I would not have purchased the item . I was satisfied with the original Nad 's wax -LRB- which I still LOVE -RRB- . Would not recommend the new bikini wax ... stick with the original !
 Unlike other Nads products , this wax needs to be heated , this is n't mentioned in the product description and I would n't have bought the product had I known . Also , when I used it , the wax did n't stay attached to the backing strip during removal and I ended up having to peel it off with my fingers . A very unpleasant experience . I love the Nads no heat gel , but this stuff , never again . Stick to the original .
 I usually use the Surgi-Wax hard wax bikini wax , but thought I would give this product a try . Not only did it heat unevenly , so I had to wait for the whole tub to cool , but it did n't grip hair well and left a lot behind . Wax in the tub cooled very quickly , so by the end of the process it was globby and chunky . The only plus is that it came off easily with the included wipe . I definitely wo n't be using this product again . Stick to Surgi-Wax if you want a hard-wax bikini wax .
 I have been useing wax for bikini and brazilians for a while . I hated this stuff . It heated unevenly and it did n't fully harden . It was like trying to pull sticky candy out of my hair . It did n't pull off right and did n't pull out all of the hair . It left big spots but it did take a few chunks out of my skin ! I will never recommend this stuff to anyone I like !
 I could n't figure out why I was so tired , but after taking even a small amount of this vitamin formula I was tired all the time . I replaced it with another formula and I felt fine . Tried this formula 2000 again and the same result , sleepy and tired .
 Was not clear in the product description this is made for older monitors -- NOT FLAT SCREEN . Could not even use ! If I could have given `` 0 '' stars , I would have .
 The screen magnifier fits fine on your conventional CRT monitor but it really does not magnify to a size big enough to satisfy our employees needs . At least that was our perspective in the office . However , it 's easy to install and it looks good on the monitor . It also has a glare that helps viewing .
 Would not work with my screen type . Did not really magnify any of the font enough to be of any help .
 I 've eaten a lot of protein bars and this one is n't any different . Very dry and not very good tasting , but it does fill you up . I just keep telling myself how good it is for me .
 Was really looking forward to trying this out , as was my husband . Unfortunately , neither of us has noticed any difference.I stopped taking them after two tries - for some reason , I had very weird dreams ! My husband continued on for about a week , but ultimately said they did n't help him.Oh well . It was worth a try .
 I 've been using the product for about a month now and have n't gotten any results . I will not be purchasing again .
 I was disappointed that this product did not help me with my headaches ! I was hoping for an alternative to my migraine meds .
 I purchased Kalo direct and used Kalo correctly and faithfully for two years . They said it ` takes time . ' I saw absolutely no improvement . I do not recommend this product .
 `` hair remover '' it just lost its purposeit clearly says apply after physically removing hair -LRB- waxing , plugging , etc -RRB- after that ... whats the point?the whole concept of hair removal is to avoid the painful experience of plugging the hair
 After repeated usage for a month on a small chin area , I am disappointed to see that same hair is still growing back . It is still course . This product is not worth the $ 42.00 I paid for it . I am very disappointed .
 I gave it a year ... does n't work AT ALL . Waste of money !!!! I had high expectations of this product because it 's sooo ridiculously expensive and I am extremely disappointed .
 it slows the growth down for1 becasue you epilate the hair from th root , so it takes just a &#34; little &#34; time to grow back and this spray adds a &#34; little &#34; more time to grow back , i have been using this for over a year now and i see nothing permanent for sure !!!!!
 I was disappointed that this product did not help me with my headaches ! I was hoping for an alternative to my migraine meds .
 I 've been using the product for about a month now and have n't gotten any results . I will not be purchasing again .
 The clipper broke the first time I tried to use it . The guide combs snap onto the metal bottom plate . To remove the guide comb from the bottom plate you have to push a little plastic tab on the rounded back end of the guide comb . I had just opened the package and snapped on the half inch guide comb to see how securely it fit . When I pushed it off the whole metal plate fell out of the plastic body of the clipper and the cutting edge fell out . I was able to put the pieces back together but it did n't cut worth a darn . Do n't waste your time or money on this product .
 I quit smoking on April 22 , 2010 . I started using the Step 1 patch the same day . After four days I was totally covered in hives . It took 5 days for them to go away after I took the patch off . If you want to use this product just becareful .
 First of all , I originally ordered the M/L size and when it arrived , it was gigantic . WAY too large , so I had to go through the process of returning and reordering a smaller size . It would be very helpful if the description gave more sizing information . I am 5 ' 7 and 175 lbs and the S/M is STILL almost too large . Furthermore , the material picks up everything ! Pet hair , dirt , leaves ... anything that seems like it could stick to the fabric will . And it 's difficult to try to pick all that stuff off . Finally , I have really dry skin , so anywhere there is rougher skin -LRB- my hands , feet , sometimes legs -RRB- the material will snag and catch and it 's really annoying . I tried to wear it for a few days , but it 's so uncomfortable and I 'm going to try to sell it on eBay or something . Very disappointed .
 When I bought this , since it was listed as 1.27 pounds of quercetin -- and from the description that was listed at the time -- I thought this was product was loose & not in capsules.Not the case . The bottle weighed about 6 ounces when I got it -- maybe less -- since it was a measly 60 capsules of Quercetin . I would have returned it , but hubby broke the seal & started taking them . It 's a decent product -- but their description is misleading .
 I too ordered this from Amazon and received the Power version of the product . I noticed that the stores were no longer carrying the light green cap version and went to order online . I was a long-time user of the light green version and I am really upset if Menen discontinued this product . What a horrible marketing decision on their part . Now all the loyal users will look to other brands becuase the Power version is terrible . Colgate should read the business case history of New Coke . What a marketing disaster that was . I wonder how much market share Pepsi gained during the New Coke replacement of the original formula . The same could happen to Colgate .
 I ordered this from an amazon marketplace seller and received Speed Stick POWER Fresh Scent deodorant . It is very different than the green-lidded product currently pictured in the product description -- it has a far stronger scent . It has the same barcode as the original fresh scent , and therefore may be shipped to you in place of what is pictured here . I called Mennen , and they are phasing out the original Fresh Scent and replacing it with the Power line . Very disappointing , as I am a long time user , and the new product is not nearly as subtle .
 The old green cap fresh scent was great . I used it from 1982 until it was taken off the market . The grey cap version is both very loud smelling and a skin irritant . I think this will be the end of the entire speedstick line . In all the antiperspirant brands on the shelf that went through looking for a replacement the grey cap fresh scent is ny far the loudest and most offensive .
 I specifically ordered Speed Stick `` Fresh '' scent , with the green lid as pictured , but instead I received a silver lid `` POWER '' Speed Stick which smells way too unmanly . My adorable husband has been wearing the same antiperspirant for the 21 years of our relationship -LRB- and then some -RRB- , and I like how he smells.Why mess with success?Green Lid , please.I am returning my product and will go on a stock-up spree at local retailers .
 I was specifically looking for `` fresh scent '' and received one from the `` Power '' line . I do n't like it , and was trying to receive something different .
 I had used the original Mennen -LRB- green cap -RRB- Fresh Scent antiperspirant for over 20 years . Then the Mennen marketing department decided to pinch off this lousy replacement product . This new version smells as terrible as any of the Axe body wash/spray/deodorants . It not only smells like a gold-chain wearing gigolo on ladies night at the Regal Beagle , but my armpits started to burn sometime around hour six after applying this new `` power '' formula . As a bonus that coincided with the burning sensation , my pits began to sweat , even though I work in an air-conditioned office . I had to jump in the shower to get this nasty stuff off as soon as I got home from work . Nice upgrade.Would have given it zero stars , if I was sure it would be computed into overall reviewers ' average .
 No , no , no , no , no ! I have been using this for years , shipped to the UK , as it 's a fresh clean scent , what am I going to do now as all the others smell toxic and aggressive if that 's possible . Come on Colgate , what 's up with you ?
 The one star reviews here are all spot on . The Power Fresh Scent apparently has replaced the traditional Fresh Scent , as I have been to every large store imaginable and I can no longer find the traditional Fresh Scent , i.e. the one that has been around since I started using it in 1984 . The Power Fresh Scent irritates my skin and has a gel or oily texture , less of a powder texture like the traditional Fresh Scent had . And it does not have a fresh scent but rather a nasty sharp offensive odor , like that of a dirty old man who reaks of a sharp sweat . I can only guess that Mennen replaced some ingredients with a new cheaper ingredient and branded it as `` Power '' to give the impression it is improved in some way . To the contrary , Power Fresh Scent is nasty , very nasty . In fact , my eyes were irritated and I sneezed several times the first day I put it on . This is simply a terrible product . Mennen , you ought to re-think this very seriously . I am moving on to a new brand .
 The product pictured with a green lid is NOT what is being shipped . I 've used Mennen Speed Stick FRESH Anti-perspirant for many years because of its effectiveness and it 's light , clean scent . Recently , I ordered this product , but got Speed Stick POWER FRESH -LRB- Silver lid , same UPC label -RRB- . It is SO different , with a heavy , gaudy scent . I have learned that Colgate is discontinuing the FRESH scent . SO DISAPPOINTED .
 This deodorant worked decently on sweat , but it made me smell like a car freshioner . I would not buy it again .
 After hip surgery , the patient needs to sit at a wider angle than 90 degrees . They are not supposed to do things like lean forward on a toilet seat.My husband came home from the hospital after having a hip resurfacing surgery yesterday . We had a raised toilet seat ready for him , but it seemed to be made to keep a body from falling off , and made the sitter sit with their bottom back too far . This makes the body fold over too far . So I quickly got on to Amazon , searched for a raised toilet seat made specially for hip replacements -LRB- somewhat different surgery , but same toilet seat needs -RRB- , and spent the money for overnight shipping.The Tall-Ette `` Elongated '' Total Hip Replacement toilet seat came this morning.I put it on a chair , and sat on it , to check it out before installing it . And gosh darn it , it HURTS to sit on it . SO FRUSTRATING ! This thing is n't just uncomfortable , it is actually painful.Also , the name makes it sound like it is long . It is n't . If it did n't hurt , it would be long enough for a lady . But it might be a tight fit for a man . It is n't actually as `` elongated '' as it seems . The elongation seems to be the square cut-out at the front , but the angle is wrong , and it is n't properly elongated to fit a man 's needs .
 This seat was n't tall enough . I was n't able to use it at all . Too bad I could n't send it back .
 They did make a goopy mess by morning , but it never lessened or changed . Not sure these actually do anything , and have n't found any real research to show that they work .
 I ordered the Biotin Forte because I heard that it would promote nail health . It did nothing for my nails . They are still weak and they break easily . I would not recommend this product if you are trying to grow your nails .
 the first day I used this deodorant it worked great for the first half of the day , but completely failed by the afternoon . embarrassing odor.the next day it actually worked for most of the day , until my skin started to burn , sting & break out with blisters.good news is after almost a week of using hydrocortisone creams & other ointments i ' am finally healing.Don ' t use this product.Christopher Gordon
 I recieved my 2 # box with the 3oz . device inside . This is cheap thin foam with some stable plastic pieces in front and back . When I saw it , I thought , `` I paid $ 34.00 for this ? '' Look for the old fashion kind that dos n't let your neck move , because this device is not worth beans .
 The product received on time , however , the item is a mismatch , the front part and the back part is not perfectly match eachother , extremely hard to line up right . The price of cause is much cheaper than the regular local drug store , I wish they should mentioned `` irregular '' before I have purchased , that make understanding before order . The product still work , but not comfortablely match .
 Just like the name say 's it they black tux , tied and little too tight for average person , and not lube inaf as the silver lifestyle.These are also short in compare to the silver lifestyle.I would n't recommend them
 Unfortunately , the inflating hair basins like these do n't work well . They are uncomfortable to lay in , draining is difficult , and they do n't hold water well . Using a trash bag draped across the side of the bed is a better choice .
 This product is more disabled than the user it is intended forAs other reviewers have said ... the drain does NOT work which defeats the entire purpose of this basin.Also ... the '' cutout '' area for the neck is too small for most necks also defeating the purpose of this basin.Thankfully this product does deflate which will make it easier to dispose of in the trash
 this product has a great drain system . the head opening is way to tight , the seams in the plastic are at the opening to cut your ears and being so tight you can not hear anything being said to you . if it is tight to keep the water from leaking then you should n't have that much water in it to begin with . i had to buy another wash basin that is open tray with a whole in the end that works much better . also the drain is a thin walled tubing that kinks and bends and wont allow draining . i will not recommend this product to any body .
 This product is n't what I had envisioned . The plastic has rough edges around where the head goes , the hose to drain the water did n't work . It kinked constantly . It is large and cumbersome , does not work for someone that is truly bedridden .
 I thought this was a really good idea and it seemed to work well for a while , but after a year of use it sprung a leak on a seam that could not be repaired . Unfortunately the leak got progressively worse which rendered the basin useless . If it was made out of better quality material I believe that would not have happened .
 I Love this Basin , I am disabled and this is the only way I can wash my hair , Thank you !
 Does not empty properly . Causes a lot of water around patient 's head and difficult to use . I would not recommend it .
 Because of all the great reviews I decided to try this brand . I am not at all impressed . There are water drip spots that it just wo n't remove . It just does n't do a very good job .
 I place considerable weight on Amazon reviews when looking for a product and since this one got such glowing reviews , decided to give it a try . I have a stainless dishwasher , microwave , double oven -LRB- all from KitchenAid -RRB- , and a Samsung stainless refrigerator . After running out of the thick past like KitchenAid polish -LRB- the original type in the black bottle -RRB- I started trying alternatives and after several disappointments , tried Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Polish & Conditioner . I had high expectations with 4.5 stars from Amazon , but what a letdown . It streaks like all the others . I tried it on all the mentioned appliances , follow the instructions carefully and it left nasty streaks that where hard to remove.Well , I then did some more experimenting . I tried the old tried and true WD40 that I used years ago on my stainless sink . That worked much better than the Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Polish & Conditioner , but while doing some other cleaning and using a product called Desolv-it , the citrus smell reminded me of the original paste like KitchenAid polish that worked so well . I decided to try it on the lower section of the refrigerator , and presto ! It works wonderfully . YES - Desol-it worked wonderfully as a polish . I did all my appliances and my wife was blown away at the results . Obsessed with getting the perfect polish , I then decided to order some of the new KitchenAid polish to give it a try -LRB- I had read that they changed the formula -RRB- . Once arrived , I tried it out . It still has the citrus smell , but seems to be watered down . The old formula was the consistency of apple sauce , and the new formula is like water . But it worked very well . It 's definitely a contender.So the conclusion of the race for the best polish after trying many and being satisfied with only the a few :1 -RRB- KitchenAid and Desolv-It are the absolute best . They are simple to apply , require little buffing , and you will get a amazing polish that lasts for weeks .2 -RRB- WD40 is next on my list . Works great , but not quite as good as above -LRB- and may be more toxic -RRB- .3 -RRB- Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Polish just does n't measure up . Ca n't imagine why anyone would really like it . My partially used bottle went in the trash .
 Interesting that Joette found a big difference in the way the newer Cerma Bryte product STREAKS . I found an extreme tendency for this product to PERMANENTLY STREAK my refrigerator . Reading at another site , someone mentioned that one should avoid the usse of any product containing bleach . When I retrieved my offending Cerma Bryte from the trash to check it for bleach , I was amazed to see that it had NO LIST of contents/ingredients . I am going to call their 800 number tomorrow and find out if bleach in their product may have caused the permanent streaks on my fridge.I have tried EVERYTHING , including WOW ! , which is just about the best of all the SS products , but WOW ! left a residue that attracted dust ... lotsa dust . Other SS products did n't work at all.Advice from that other site suggested , trying WD 40 on stainless steel . It works better than any SS product i have tried . It even made those hideous Cerma Bryte streaks go away , although i theeenk I see their ghost trying to return . Anyway , WD40 is the best I 've used in 3 years of six stainless steel appliances . And probably the least costly.WD 40 is the only product for stainless steel that I can recommend .
 I read the other reviews when I purchased this product . I have an entire kitchen of Electrolux Stainless Steel . The Dishwasher has water stains going all the way down the front of it and this product did nothing to remove them . On the refrigerator doors there is permanent hand marks that once again it didnt remove and I used a lot of elbow grease . For everything else it did ok leaving a nice deep look .
 I purchased this on recommendation from the manufacturer of our stainless steel appliances -LRB- GE -RRB- . Even after shaking , the product poured out of the bottle like water . So I could n't use it . When I visited my son , he had a bottle and his was much thicker . I think what I purchased on Amazon was either a bad batch or someone watered it down . I would have returned it if it was n't such a hassle . Instead I purchased Sprayway Stainless Steel Cleaner & Polish and it works much better . You can get it at Costco .
 Cerama Bryte Stainless Steel Cleaning Polish -LRB- with Mineral Oil -RRB- Do n't waste your money on it . I 've tried every way to get it not to strick it leaves a very dull finish . I used differnt clothe 's went different directions-wiped it off quickly-wiped it after a few minutes and this was on a new refigerator.I gave up and just washed it off and it looks better.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O2O9BU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
 This retailer -LRB- Tony -RRB- was very cooperative , but the SONY NH-14WM -LRB- A -RRB- Rechargeable Gumstick Battery that I received from him had a specification of 1350mAh and I am supposed to use a battery that has a specification of 1400 mAh.Even though Tony had asked me to send the original faulty battery -LRB- that I had already tossed it out -RRB- and the replacement battery back to him for full refund , but , I really do n't think its cost effective for me , because the entire transaction had cost me approximately $ 13.00 -LRB- including shipping and handling from the retailer -RRB- . If I send it back , its going to cost me extra the buy a package for shipping , travel time and gas at $ 3.37 / gallon back and forth to the post office , waiting time at the post office , and etc. . It would have costed me more money than the refund money I would receive from the retailer . So , I thanked Tony for his offer.But , I did learn a very good lesson from this transaction , I shall never buy anything that will be so much cheaper -LRB- that I had only to pay $ 8.00 plus handling and shipping for a total sum of approximtely $ 13.00 for this `` new '' battery -RRB- , and that the actual retailed price for this battery should have been $ 29.95 plus shipping and handling.I did buy a new one from our local Sony Style retail store for a total of $ 31.67 including sales tax . It works perfectly now!I learned a good lesson !
 I sincerely tried to lick it off the skin . It tastes horrible . I have no idea if it 's the product quality or the product itself . Not thrilled , returned it .
 The picture and the item description are not the same!I ordered this thinking that they would send what was described . Instead I got what is in the picture . When I sent it back , I explained this to them . Instead Amazon refunded my money under the reason `` item shipped late . `` Hopefully somebody will fix this problem soon . I 'd really like to order the Rhino Beanie Vites because they are awesome !
 Product is great . . the little bit that was left and did not leak !! for this price horrible packing . . !! not buying again from this dealer
 I find the adhesive on these pads are so strong that I could never remove the pads in one piece . And after removing the pieces , the tape residue remain on the fabric of clothing . This product actually ruined many of my expensive jackets . Frustrating ... I dont like this product at all .
 While these items are a good price and nice size , the adhesive is totally inadequate . I understand that they are disposable and not meant to be worn more than once , but the adhesive should keep them secured for at least one wearing . I found that they became separated from the sleeve after only a few hours , and I am not at all a heavy perspirer -LRB- perspirator ? -RRB- .
 The product was Quorum after shave BALM in the advertisement . I received another Quorum product which I did not want . I sent an e-mail asking for an explanation and did not receive a reply . They have my money and just do n't care I suppose . I will NEVER use them again . Have a nice day ...

 I am only 5 ' 4 '' , 117 lbs , 60-years old . I am not some super work-out enthusiast . I only use a cable for 3 sets of 30 neck strengthening exercises twice daily . I have never broken a cable before in 3 years of daily use . I purchased these Harbinger Cables because I wanted more resistance than I was getting with my GO-Fit 20 lb . cable , which is still in one piece ! The `` Harbinger Cable Super Heavy 30-72lb of Resistance '' , placed through the included `` heavy duty woven door jam attachment '' split in half within 3 months of use . Harbinger replaced this cable under their warranty ; unfortunately , 3 months later , the replacement is now in 2 pieces , and Harbinger says they do n't have anything better than these for me to try . If this `` little old '' lady 's exercises break Harbinger 's `` best '' cables within 3 months , then how quickly will Harbinger Cables show their defects to you stronger & younger users ?!
 I wanted to give this a good review because in theory it is a great replacement for free weights -LRB- for most exercises -RRB- , and is portable enough to bring on travel . However , after less than a month of using the band it broke ! The rubber band itself snapped at the handle -LRB- it is attached to the handle by a plug that is inserted in the end of the hollow band to make the band wider than an opening in the handle -RRB- . I attempted to fix it , but there is no way to get the band back into the handle and make it hold .
 These resistance cables are very durable and the handles are well designed but do hurt your wrists a bit after prolonged use . Well worth the money!EDIT
