 My son claims that these are the best sandals made . Second pair purchased in 3 years . Initial pair survived 3 years of constant high milage use .
 These Drams are awesome ! Love the hidden flask , they are not only functional but quite a conversation piece . Definitely ordering more and after comparison shopping , a great price !
 An idea whose time has come !!! Product fits perfect-I sometimes wear a 13-ordered a 12 Perfect size -- Hope thuis helps !!! Rick
 Estan muy bien estas sandalias , buen dise & ntilde ; o y el plus de poder llenar una parte de ellas con liquido esta muy ingenioso ... Muy buen precio tambien ...
 These Reef Dram Sandals are excellent . They are everything you have come to expect from Reef brand . They are surprisingly comfortable and can hold about 1 cup of liquid each . The only trouble I 've had is that the logo on the heel is fading , but that seems to happen with all my sandals
 Wow , at first when I saw these flip flops I was a little disappointed in their lack of style . just did n't think they suited my hip urban lifestyle . This was of course all about to change and soon I learned of their true power.These babies secretly contain a hidden flask disguised as part of the heel . Between the two flip flops you can conceal a little personal party ; I myself just enjoyed this feature on a flight , saved me money on those overpriced in-flight mini-bottles . Hands down , anything that helps me conceal fluids is worthy of 5 stars in my book
 Ca n't beat this unit ; it works perfectly , is adjustable , holds tons of balls , and the price is just right for anyone !
 This product is a joy to to use . It saves me from having to bend over to grab balls off the court . The handle is easy to connect to the basket and the entire ballhoopper appears to be well constructed . Our tennis club uses the same model .
 It 's a 12.25 foot length span steel structure available as of this writing complete , including free shipping and no sales tax . Although there are many online retailers , -LSB- ... -RSB- is where I ordered mine . It arrived in one large box from UPS on my driveway . It is 60 lbs , and believe me , it 's every bit of that weight -- I struggled to get that box into the house . The shipping on this stand must be half the price ! It is ideal for many hammocks -- `` real '' hammocks -- like a Hennessey , an ENO , a Clark , and Warbonnet and on and on.I was skeptical that a hammock stand could be strong enough for serious hammocking , and I also questioned the ability to hold a sling hammock -LRB- not a Pawleys Island type cross-barred rope hammock -RRB- . Well , the moment I was putting together the Vario , my fears were out the window . This is all steel , it has only 8 pieces , all machined to fit together perfectly . There are clean welds on this German engineered , China manufactured product -LRB- at least that 's how Byer of Maine states it -RRB- . It has four three-quarter inch nuts/bolts that hold the perpendicular `` feet '' in place , and no other tools . Everything else is hand screwed , such as the hand nut on the bottom length slider , and the two end height adjustment sliders . So , the neat thing about this is , it can be fully adjusted by hand , which will come in very handy for taking it apart in 2-3 pieces to move , for instance to take it outside on a sunny day.In my living room , I immediately attached ENO slap straps and ENO SN and later a DN , and slept in it all night . The steel stand takes the weight and forces admirably . There 's a slight in-bowing of the uprights when you first get into the hammock , and I have loaded it to over 200lbs , and there is no fear of failure once I became comfortable with it . No major sway once in it , and I slept in it for two nights successfully , no bending , twisting or breaking . It has a stated weight limit of 300 lbs . It does come with a serial number , and has a written two year warranty , although it does not state how one would initiate the warranty -- hopefully it would not include the buyer shipping the item back to Oriono , ME , which would be cost prohibitive ; likely it 'd be merely shipping back for replacement the one piece that failed.The suspension point is on a very hard plastic `` hook '' at the end of the stand -- it works well for any hook , strap or rope . I suppose one could drill into the steel with a heavy duty drill if they wanted to add a screw-eye , but I do n't think it necessary , and it would compromise the forest green -LRB- only available color -RRB- finish . The finish is presumably waterproof , but steel of course is not ; I imagine keeping this stand outdoors , it would last for years but require some Krylon/Rustoleum annually.All-in-all , it solves my issues with hanging indoors and on my treeless yard . There is an available extension that is $ 35 shipped , and it brings the total length from 12.25 feet to 15 feet . I am ordering it , although I 'm not certain I will use it -- even a long ENO fits on this stand well and the uprights are not even fully extended for the ENO . Adding length , and putting the upright to maximum height , may be needed for some outdoor uses , such as for adding tarp lines , etc. . So , I 'm getting the extension so that it 's not an issue in the future . But it works well right out of the box , and if I had three spare Benjamins burning a hole in my Levi 's , I 'd consider buying another stand for future use before they either stop making it or cheapen it up in some way -LRB- e.g. use inferior metal -RRB- . The one thing that , even studying the photos of the dozens of metal and wood stands on places like eBay , you can not appreciate from a photo is the heftiness , and the quality of material of a product . I wanted to let everyone know that this stand works very well , is a great and mobile indoor/outdoor stand , and will last decades.I have studied the Flex that some have mentioned on other websites for the Byer hammock , and when I watch my 123 lb wife get into it , I can really see it -LRB- more than I can feel it when I settle in -RRB- ! In fact , the bottom bracket flexes down toward the floor by at least 1 inch ! Alarmed , I went and got a couple hardcover books -LRB- I read on a Kindle now and books are little more than paperweights and hammock stabilizers in my house these days -RRB- and put them under the middle of the bottom bar in hopes of `` helping the Vario out '' . Well , lo and behold , when I sat in it and the bottom bar hit the book and would not flex , what happened ? The four `` feet '' came off the floor ! -LRB- Grizz and Kuzuko and the math whizzes would have known this without `` War and Peace '' under there -RRB- . Ah ha ! Like those banana shaped wooden hammock stands -- it suddenly dawned on me -- this Vario is already precisely calibrated to allow flex in the uprights and the bottom bar . Each takes its own percentage , if you will , of the total flex , which allows a weight of up to 300lbs to hang from a 12.5 foot distance on a 60 lb contraption.So , in the end , I think `` pre-loading '' the flexible uprights with cam buckles , or putting books under the bottom bar as I just did , is not recommended . The steel stand works best , and is least likely to have shear force wear and metal fatigue and breakage , if it is just left alone and enjoyed.With all that said , I could be wrong .
 I purchased this hammock stand after looking at several other models and brands . This one was an excellent choice for my family . It has several features that set it apart from many others
 I got this last year for my birthday , and have really enjoyed using it . It is heavy , but that gives it stability . The hammock attachment is simple yet secure . To top it all off , when I carelessly broke it -LRB- at the hammock attachment point -RRB- , I called Byer and talked to a real person , who sold me the part for only $ 5 . Now I am a loyal customer and would recommend their products to anyone for their design , craftsmanship and customer service .
 i like the design . heavy , which is good since it 's also robust . easy to assemble , i did it myself . also easy to adjust length & height , again i did it myself . frame/stand wobbles ever so slightly when i got in the hammock but i have n't used it for an extended period of time , so am not sure how troublesome it would be ...
 I have been using this hammock stand for over 3 years now and it is still like new . Every spring I take it out of the storage and spray bare metal parts and screw holes with WD40 rust preventer spray . That 's it for maintenance . The reassembly takes literally 3 minutes and it stays outdoors on a sunlit patio in all weather all season long until mid October . There 's barely any rusting and it is very easy to polish off before storage . Outer frame is protected by very durable powder coating in pleasing dark green color.The stand is very heavy which is good since it adds stability and allows moderate swinging . The best part , of course , is how you can adjust it to accommodate literally any hammock out there from the longest to the deepest varieties . There are extender tubes available but I have n't found a hammock yet that would require them.This is a five star hammock stand . The only nitpick I have is that I wish the bolts that attach the stand to it 's legs were made of brass . Alas , they are regular steel ones with protective plastic caps and you have to watch out to prevent them from over-rusting .
 Big Guns gets a five star rating from me because it does exactly what it says . . it works out your biceps and triceps . I do n't know about the other reviewer , but the handles are in the right place and the grips twist so your hands do n't get caluses . The motion of either the bicep workout or the tricep workout is basically very fluid . If you put it together right , there 's absolutely no way you could ever fall off the standing platform.I was afraid to buy this at first because of the first review , but he has it all wrong . The machine came with four 25lb bands and two 10lb bands . My 15 yo son put it together in about 35 minutes . It also has a padded handle so when you want to move it you just lock the main cylinder post with the included pin and tilt it onto its wheels.If you 're looking for a good arm workout , this will definately do it for you .
 I bought this video to work out with in the Morning before work . I have been working out for years so I was worried I would not find a video intense enough for what I was looking for . This video is GREAT ! I love how you have different workout options and how they have short versions of everything in case you do not get up early enough that day ;-RRB- . I love it and would definitely recommend this video to anyone !!!
 This is my first experience with kickboxing and it was great ! I love the first workout but the second one is out of rhythem and the music is off beat . It 's a very good 25 minute workout and since my endurance is low , it 's enough for me . I use 2 pound weighted gloves and I 'm never sore . This is more for cardio than muscle building .
 this is a great video . Gets me moving in the morning right before work so I have more energy during the day and it only takes 30 min .
 This workout was exactly what I was looking for . 30 minutes , fun , and I broke a good sweat doing it . Kelly is very professional and fun to work out with .
 Kelly 's 30 Minutes format is a winner . In all the workouts she has made in her 30 Minute series , she includes two main 30 minute workouts , the option to do both 30 minute workuts back to back , as a long and tough one hour workout , bonus material and many versatile premixes.Both kickbox workouts on this DVD have short routines or drills that you do for a couple of minutes before moving on to the next . So nothing seems repeated for too long . Coupled with the superb music , time flies . The kickbox choreo is fresh and not tricky -LRB- particularly if you do the tutorial -RRB- and a whole lot of fun . The intensity is great for high intermediate to advanced exercisers but without being `` test the very boundaries of your limits '' tough.I find that too-fast kickbox workouts do not allow an emphasis on form and end up becoming hi/lo . The uniqueness of kickboxing for cardio in my opinion should be from throwing punches with the rotational force of the whole upper body and kicking from the power of a lunge or squat . When the pace is too fast there isnt enough time for the whole range of motion of a `` real '' punch or kick . The pacing in this workout is perfect.The bonus kick - box themed abs/obliques work on this DVD is my current favorite abs/waist routine . Kelly is at her creative best .
 This is another new workout from fitness instructor Kelly Coffey-Meyer 's 30 Minutes to Fitness series . Like the other DVDs in this series , 30 Minutes to Fitness Kickboxing offers two separate workouts ; when combined with the warm-up , each of these workouts is around 30 minutes long , perfect if you are short on time . However , Kelly also offers plenty of additional options , including a Bonus Core/Abs segment and premixes which allow you to create a longer workout by performing both workouts together , adding on the abs , etc.Kelly works out with four background exercises , one of whom shows modifications for the higher impact moves . Although with a few exceptions -LRB- see my notes below -RRB- , Kelly mostly keeps the choreography relatively basic , she also includes a 13.5 minute Tutorial that breaks down all of the combinations included in both workouts -LRB- be advised , though -- even the tutorial moves fairly quickly ! -RRB- . The Main Menu of the DVD lists the Warm-Up and each workout as separate options as well as the Bonus Core/Abs segment and the Tutorial.Kelly begins the 3 1/2 minute Warm-up with shoulder circles , shrugs , and shuffles . She adds in knees , kicks , and squats and then introduces the four punches used in the workout -LRB- jabs , crosses , hooks , uppercuts -RRB- . The short warm-up finishes with a quick hip flexor stretch . Without the warm-up , Workout # 1 is 27 minutes long , and # 2 is 24 1/2 minutes long . Both follow the format of repeating a combination for 2 minutes and then moving on -LRB- although sometimes Kelly changes it up and does a short drill-like sequence at the end of a combo -RRB- . I loved that both workouts really worked the legs with A LOT of kicking ; a few of the combos were virtually ALL kicks ! In the first workout , I had trouble with the choreography for one combination only , which involved a hitch -LRB- jump -RRB- kick ; I just could n't seem to get to the correct side on that one . For the second workout , I thought that there was some trickier choreography during the first half , but it seemed to get more basic as the workout continued . There is a little preview of the upcoming sequence which appears for a few seconds in the bottom right-half of the screen , but to be honest , this is more of a distraction than a help . Also , I wish that Kelly had cued the combos a bit more -- she 's very encouraging and obviously having a great time , but there are times when a little reminder from her to `` now hook '' or `` kick left '' would 've been extremely helpful . Still , I never got too frustrated with any combination given that none of them lasted longer than two minutes , and for both workouts , the time absolutely FLEW by . Each of the workouts concludes with just a minute or so of brief stretching.The Bonus Core/Abs segment -LRB- 14 minutes -RRB- is a great little addition to this workout . Since the first 4 1/2 minutes of this segment are performed standing , I found that when I added the segment on after the workout , it kept my heart rate up too ! The standing portion includes side bends , punches with twists/knees , uppercuts with front crunch , and kicks with twists . Then it 's on to the floor for some very different takes on the usual crunches
 Just tried this video out and it 's great !! Not too hard , steps are over all easy to pick up on , love that there is picture in picture of the next steps up to come so you can see them before you start , total body work out , I was dripping sweat but did n't feel like I was dying and I would say I 'm not out of shape but not in shape either . There was only one routine I had a hard time picking up on but this was my first time doing it today . There are 2 30 min workouts and a core/ab routine to -LRB- Have n't tried that yet -RRB- , and you can customize it to play the warm up , work out and ab routine together for a 45 min workout or all separate . I highly recommend this DVD if you 're wanting a kickboxing , cardio type workout . No equipment needed , which is a bonus !
 I really like this video because it is good at getting my heart rate up and breaking a little sweat . It 's short enough that I can fit it into my busy schedule . The instructor has a great attitude that is n't cheesy . Just when I think it 's getting too serious , she smiles and it makes me smile . So I feel better as I 'm working out .
 What I love about this workout is that you get a full body workout in 30 minutes . I have found on other kickbox dvd 's if they have premix workouts it 's usually punches or kicks so you only get a lower or upper body workout . I needed a few shorter cardio workouts as I do my cardio then my weight lifting every morning and I do n't always have time for 45 - 50 minutes of cardio.If you 're looking for decent 30 minute workout -LRB- or combined 60 min workout -RRB- and enjoy kickboxing than this dvd is for you.I have a few of Kelley 's other dvd 's and I 'm enjoying them . I usually workout out to Cathe Friedrich and most recently Turbo Jam , Amy Bento , so Kelley was a great instructor to add to my mix .
 I got this because I 'm constantly on the look-out for 30-minute , high intensity cardio workouts . I know kickboxing is a great workout , so I was really excited when I found this DVD.I was a little disappointed , though . The intensity was n't that high for me , but for a beginner it might be just fine . The sequences were tricky to follow , but I only tried the combination upper/lower body workout once , and being the fitness DVD junkie I am , I know with a little practice I 'd get the moves down . Also , it says 30-minutes , but the combo workout I choose turned out to be only 20-25 minutes , so I was let down on that front , too.To make it a better workout for me , I 'd add in 1 mintue of jumping jacks , jump rope , high knees or butt kicks in between each sequence -LRB- just pause the DVD -RRB- , then my heart rate would get up higher AND the workout would last 30 mintues.I gave it four stars because I still think it 's a good workout for beginners , and more advanced exercisers can modify it to their level with the suggestions I offered , but it just was n't what I was expecting .
 I had been taking kick-boxing at my gym , and the class all of a sudden was no longer offered . I purchased this video and found it to be an excellent replacement . Of course , it is not the same as working out in a group at a gym setting , but an excellent cardio work out .
 I 've been doing different Jillian Michael workouts and wanted something strictly cardio . JM lacks these types of exercises so I went on a search specifically for kickboxing because I really like it . Well I was skeptic because Kelly Coffey does n't have many reviews even though she has good ratings from the reviews she has . I took a step of faith and made the purchase and I 'm so glad I did . Man JM has nothing on Kelly . I love this workout and look forward to having this to supplement my JM workouts

 Using this on my boat . Works great with two batteries and charges them fine with the stock alt . I used it all season last summer and it didnt catch fire once !
 I had been looking for a good beginner set that I could travel with and use at home . These really fit the bill . I have taken them on 4 business trips and love that I can just unpack them , play the great DVD in my laptop , and I am ready to workout . The handles are well made and comfortable , and the bands allow me to perform a large range of exercises . The quality of the set is very good for such a low price and I have found I am using them more and more . I had looked at a higher priced but similar product at a sports store . I was surprised with the range of resistance that I have with this set . These were the better choice by far . I was impressed with the great warranty and guarantee too . Just a great buy all around and could not be more pleased .
 Work outs on DVD gets you going . More workouts more on line . Small , portable , and exercises lots of muscles at once in little space . No machine decorating your home . They can wear out though in a year of frequent use .
 NOT SO GOOD IN FACT THAT IS THAT CUE BECAUSE THEY SENT ME THE ERROR BY THIS MODEL -LRB- S-PJB3 -RRB- . THIS MODEL I LIKE A LOT FOR THAT IS SIMPLE AND VERY EFFECTIVE FOR BREAK
 I got this shirt on sale for $ 4 . It very comfortable and well worth it . Go Cougs .

 This MLB Oakland Athletics authentic cap has excellent quality and is definitely worth the price . I 'm looking forward to purchase another cap from New Era .
 Ordered hat , it arrived early , mine was in a box and in great condition , I was unsure about size so I ordered a little big . It 's comfortably loose , but not overly big . All in all very satisfied .
 This product is exactly as i wanted , and fits beautifully on my head ; with the dry-fit upper to the hat it makes for a more lightweight cap that stays cool on my head .
 exelente servicio , recibido a tiempo y de buena calidad . todo perfecto . recomiendo ampliamente comprar de este vendedor ...
 buen producto me gusto lo recomiendo termenda gorra a mi hijo le gusto quiere otras mas le encanto lo recomiendo
 The hat arrived in time for his 10th birthday , and neither he , nor I , could be more pleased . Great purchase !
 This hat is Classic . The original green and white color looks vibrant . The hat keeps your head cool and even blocks out harmful UV rays . It fits great and adds another dimension to your casual wardrobe . I recommend this hat to anyone !
 Bought this A 's hat a few weeks ago , and it fits perfectly . Very comfortable , the brim bends nicely , and it sure keeps you warm at the games . The high dome helps keep hat-hair to a minimum as well . Very well-priced on Amazon - much cheaper than the price if you buy it from MLB or at the ballpark .
 The is EXACTLY what I wanted for my husband ! What makes it better is that it got here ahead of schedule ! Great product , great delivery !
 I have two of these well constructed and extremely comfortable singlets . The vintage cut allows for total freedom of movement and always fits securely on the body . While this is a classic cut for amateur freestyle wrestling , I mainly use these singlets in place of shorts for no-gi grappling . I highly recommend this singlet .
 This wrestling uniform shows its easy for a wrestler to move in and show his muscles .
 I bought my first singlet from Greccogear a month ago and I have been nothing but satisfied . It fits wells , it looks great , and , most important , it 's extremely comfortable to wrestle in . I can not say enough good things about this product .
 Great balance and design . The kit does come with a carrying case for the fixed blade knife .
 This is a great set of what seems to be very good quality knives . There is also a bonus sheath at the back of the packaging , for the large fixed knife . It is not shown on the Amazon picture that only presents the front of the packaging.I highly recommend this set if you are looking for long lasting sturdy knives .
 These knives are surprisingly thick and sturdy for fifteen dollars for the set . The handles are fat and comfortable . The description does n't say
 These shorts fit perfectly and are the most comfortable pair of shorts I own . I plan own buying a pair in every color , they are that great .
 These shorts are the most comtfortable shorts I 've ever put on . Sometimes I have to check to see if I 'm actually wearing something , you forget that you have them on.Transaction was flawless . Good job amazon !!
 These shorts are great . They are n't `` man-pris '' , the inseam is 5 '' , which for shorter guys like me is perfect -LRB- I 'm `` 5 ' 8 '' -RRB- . The shorts are very tough , and should last through years of fishing in south Louisiana . They dry very quickly and have lots of good storage . Highly recommended .
 I bought these shorts for my son who is 18 . They are a nice fit , elastic waist in the back , and roomy in the legs . They are perfect around the water because they dry very quickly . Would reccommend them for any age group .
 I ahve been wearing these shorts for years . The are rugged and very nice looking . Cool also !
 The quality is Good , the service is good . I will recommend it to my friendsI am very satisfied
 Bought these for my dad for Xmas ... he was very specific about a certain brand and inseam size . Online I could see the inseam size but it was n't printed anywhere else so my Dad was skeptical that I got the right one . But it may have been inside the actual shorts - just not on the bag it came sealed in . He was nervous about opening them in case it was n't right . But other than that he loved the color and the price was competitive .
 I have been wearing these pants for many years . They run small . The l6 inch inseam is perfect for short legs .
 My husband loves these shorts . These were recommended by a friend and ever since he bought them , it 's all he wears now in the summer . These shorts are a good length -LRB- he hates shorts at or below his knee -RRB- and hit about 2 '' above his knee -LRB- he 's 5 ' 11 '' -RRB- . Some good things - they have a velcro waist which allows for much tightening and losening as needed . Easy access pockets , huge openings for full access , and each pocket goes the full length of the short so they are much larger pockets then they appear . Also , pockets are built well such that items do not fall out when sitting . Each pocket has its own spot of velcro to remain closed . My husband did n't care much for the velcro on his wallet pocket and it was very easy to remove just the velcro on this one pocket . These have faded some with washing -LRB- definitely not the bright vibrant blue -RRB- but again , they 've been worn constantly this summer and are n't too faded for something that was probably washed and dried 30 times this summer . Just remember to close the velcro on the waist before washing or everything in your washer will be stuck to this large piece of velcro .
 What a great deal for Columbia shorts . I bought a total of 9 pair for me and my boys . Paid about half what they sell for at the retailers.Great quality expected and delivered from Columbia clothing .
 Like the moon shifting through its phases I found myself trudging along predictably in life . One day was stirred with the next which was stirred with the subsequent day and eventually evenings became a time where I was waiting for the next day to start . I was in a sad state - until I found these shorts . With their clear ruggedness I find it hard to sit at home watching gif 's of cats all afternoon . These shorts inspire me to get out and explore whatever there is to explore . Whether it is the library or a hiking trail I find that these are my `` get up and get out '' shorts .
 Columbia makes an awesome pair of `` Half Moon '' shorts for guys who want a remarkably comfortable pair of shorts . Mine fit easily and I agree with the reviewer who writes that these are so comfortable you just might forget you have them on ! You ca n't get any better than that.I do n't fish but I do wear these on hot days when I am walking a lot ; and these are going to come in very handy when I slowly but surely begin hiking for exercise , too . I wo n't want heavy shorts when I begin hiking.The stitching is very well done and I like the way they made the pockets -- really good . The front pockets could n't have been designed better and the back pocket lets me carry even more . The inseam is just about right for a guy my height -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' -RRB- . Of course , other guys -- including taller guys -- may want to continue looking for shorts that have a longer inseam.These are 100 % cotton but of course you can wash them easily in the regular washer and dryer . They require no special care.I highly recommend these shorts ; they are very well made and they should last years . The only limitation I can think of is that some guys may want a longer inseam ; but otherwise these are terrific .
 These shorts are super comfortable with the adjustable waist . The pocket layout is great for activites like fishing and working around the house . Recomended .
 This is my second pair of the Columbia Half Moon shorts . I 've had the first pairfor a couple of years and decided I wanted another pair . They are comfortable and versatile . The service was excellent .
 I have two of these well constructed and extremely comfortable singlets . The vintage cut allows for total freedom of movement and always fits securely on the body . While this is a classic cut for amateur freestyle wrestling , I mainly use these singlets in place of shorts for no-gi grappling . I highly recommend this singlet .
 This wrestling uniform shows its easy for a wrestler to move in and show his muscles .
 I bought my first singlet from Greccogear a month ago and I have been nothing but satisfied . It fits wells , it looks great , and , most important , it 's extremely comfortable to wrestle in . I can not say enough good things about this product .
 Looks like they might last for a while , but they are thin and I am sure a good sized Goathead thorn will kill it ... I would run 66 TPI or better tires with these .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .
 I chose this rating because the vest is exactly what I wanted!It is light-weight in feel yet keeps me warm when I need it !
 Gave this to my sister-in-law for CHristmas present . She loves it . Nice and soft , good fit . Washes up well too .
 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .
 I got this vest for my 90-year old Mom . It 's soft and a pretty pink , but most of all it keeps her nice and warm .
 I gave this Rubik 's cube for a Christmas gift to a colleague that also grew up in Boston . I would love to say it 's a great toy , however , he loved it so much , he is afraid to use it ! He does n't want to mess up the Boston design on it ! I know that Rubik 's cubes are exceptional for children to learn motor skills and reasoning skills ... but you have to be willing to actually use it ! This is a great gift for that sports fan on your list !
 Bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas . . he loves it . . one of those busy adult toys . Nice to see the Red Sox on it !
 The knife looks nice . Mother of pearl and abalone . It is just a bit over 2 inches when closed . The metal used for the blades appears to be a close relative to that used for making tin cans . That said , it only took a few minutes to put a razor edge on both blades . I wo n't expect it to hold up long , but for minor tasks it will do ok . Nice looking little letter opener . I did not entertain any notions that the knife would be of any notable quality and I was n't disappointed . For the price it is ok . Might make a nice gift for a young person starting to learn how to use and care for a knife .
 Arrived fast and easy to install . It is very easy to grease your hubs . All you need is a grease gun and 2 hands .

 The snorkel cruise I attended in Australia provided snorkel set for free , but I heard bad things about those rental ones , so decided to purchase my own . This Speedo one worked very well , also its cutting-edge design caught everyone 's eyes . My friend who laughed at the idea buying own snorkel for only two snorkeling occasions was very jealous of me at the end . According to her , the rental one constantly leaks and fogs , was very annoying . Great deal from Amazon , was worth every penny !

 These shorts fit perfectly and are the most comfortable pair of shorts I own . I plan own buying a pair in every color , they are that great .
 These shorts are the most comtfortable shorts I 've ever put on . Sometimes I have to check to see if I 'm actually wearing something , you forget that you have them on.Transaction was flawless . Good job amazon !!
 These shorts are great . They are n't `` man-pris '' , the inseam is 5 '' , which for shorter guys like me is perfect -LRB- I 'm `` 5 ' 8 '' -RRB- . The shorts are very tough , and should last through years of fishing in south Louisiana . They dry very quickly and have lots of good storage . Highly recommended .
 I bought these shorts for my son who is 18 . They are a nice fit , elastic waist in the back , and roomy in the legs . They are perfect around the water because they dry very quickly . Would reccommend them for any age group .
 I ahve been wearing these shorts for years . The are rugged and very nice looking . Cool also !
 The quality is Good , the service is good . I will recommend it to my friendsI am very satisfied
 Bought these for my dad for Xmas ... he was very specific about a certain brand and inseam size . Online I could see the inseam size but it was n't printed anywhere else so my Dad was skeptical that I got the right one . But it may have been inside the actual shorts - just not on the bag it came sealed in . He was nervous about opening them in case it was n't right . But other than that he loved the color and the price was competitive .

 The Samba is an thick , single-layer training suit that is comfortable in three seasons . Very comfortable with handy pockets in the pants and jacket . Easy to keep clean . Overall , very happy with this purchase .
 I bought the Adidas Training Suit for my adult son as a Christmas gift . He loves it and said it 's so comfortable to lay around the house in or use to and from the gym . Shipping was very prompt and reasonable .
 This is a great hat . Fit is true to size . It is the more worn out flexible type fit , which is really comfortable . It has an old school and is a great durable product !
 Great quality for the price and great for the gym . Has gotten some good use and still holding up nicely .
 My son-in-law loves his hat . Who would n't ... it 's a GATOR hat . Go Gators !!!!!! I recommend any Gator fan to purhase this hat .
 Seiko has In general good products this watch is beautiful ; very reliable , the mechanizing is excellent with the fixture of self-wining I do n't have to worry about batteries ; it does n't need . Very economic , great price for such a watch .

 I really love this game . The carerre mode is great . It seems a lot more genorous . I 'll tell you , the hardest thing , when your a pitcher , I had trouble getting 20 wins . I had 19 win seasons , but no 20 win seasons . No hall of fame though . I love this game ! Rex Hudler is funny .
 MLB 2006
 This is my first review for a game and this also was my first experience playing any of the MLB titles . Regardless I own both the new MVP NCAA baseball game and rented this one . Needless to say after renting this game I fell in love with it & I plan on picking it up tonight . The career mode is amazing and will keep you coming back for more . The play-by-play is the best I 've heard in a sports title , as the 3 man booth makes it sound like you are watching a real game . Also do n't forget about the amazing cutscenes -LRB- ie . a closeup of the pitcher watching the double play and pounding is fist in approval or the batter showing his disapproval of a blown call by the umpire . -RRB- I recommend this game to anyone and can assure you if you give it an honest shot - you wo n't be disappointed .
 I could go on and on about all the good things this game has , but I will just list a few problems that prevent me from giving it 5 stars .1 -RRB- There are no bloop base hits , everything to the outfield is either a line drive or a can-o-corn fly out .2 -RRB- Diving is pretty much useless , the player seems to flop on the ground rather than extend at all .3 -RRB- Not a lot of in-game injuries , they only seem to occur when you simulate a season game .4 -RRB- Sometimes it 's too easy to throw a strike when you have to , even when a pitcher is tired and wild , you can usually get it over the plate w / 3 ball counts.Overall , this is a great baseball game though . Very realistic statistics and the computer can play you tough and actually strike you out . Nothing is too easy or too difficult .
 I bought The Show as soon as I could after it came out . After buying MLB 06 last year on a whim , I fell in love with the gameplay and graphics of this game . It was vastly better than any of the other games released last year.The main problem I had with last year 's edition was that the game tended to freeze up at key points , like when I was simulating a week or two of games , and I was afraid that the malfunction would be present in The Show as well.Thankfully , it had not frozen up on me once so far.I agree with the other reviewers that the commentary and gameplay is highly realistic . If you want in depth control of the baseball experience , great graphics , and the feel of watching/playing in a real game , then The Show is for you .
 Addictive . It 's about time David Ortiz get 's some recognition . The Graphics are amazing , very detailed . Gameplay is really exciting . This game takes some time to perfect . If you play this online , it automatically updates your rosters with all the trades . Pitching and hitting is so realistic . Commentary is very good . I dont know how anyone can give this a bad review . New Era even gives you a coupon for a free baseball cap . Playing online makes the game that much better -LRB- real competition -RRB- . Overall , I 'd give this game a 4 1/2 .
 This is a very good game . I like the graphics there better than mvp 's . Mvp 's graphics looked a little cartoonish . Its a pretty hard game even on rookie ! So if you want to win a game you have to go to gamplay and make the CPU TO BE HORIBBLE . The rosters are completley updated . And the broadcasting is alright not like mlb 2k6 though . Its very hard to stop the pitching meter in the place because it moves to fast , there are also ALOT of pass balls even on good catchers like mike piazza . Its very realisctic that the umpires somethimes call bad calls . There are not a lot of glicthes . I was VERY disspointed that you could n't argue so thats a downgrade from mvp . I like this game bettter than mlb 2k6 . But if you really want to get a good buy i recommand renting it first .
 MLB 06
 This is the most realistic baseball i have ever played . The hitting is superb and more difficult and realistic than ever as unlike last year 's game when you guess the right pitch it no longer tells you location you still have to read the pitch.Pitching though can be infuriating as the umpires are very inconsistent but generally the calls are evened out.The soundtrack is great , better than ever.Finally the presentations are tv like , i was watching a ball game the other night and then played MLB 06 and i was very pleased as it was just like espn coverage . the commentary is nothing short of amazing , 3 commentators mean that every pitch and angle are covered , e.g. it told me when i hit A-Rod 's 600th home run -LRB- there were even fireworks -RRB- In short this game at least in my opinion is the best baseball game around , but do n't ask me buy it yourself and find out .
 This game is good , I guess the best ever . This game never freezes like 989 's game . Also the game is relistic in most AAA and MLB players . It has a lineup that is up to date -LRB- when the game was made -RRB- . The graphis and ballparks are good and relistic.The NYY seem like the best team , but they have no speed in the game . The Red Sox are the best.The Bad-does not have the world baseball classicyou will be mad with bad calles by umpsyou will be mad at unrelistic playsthe pitching meter is wicked tough , go with classicin modes you have to play 9 innings -LRB- in some modes you can sim to your at bats -RRB- This game overall will be a awsome game with awsome graphics , though it can be tough and unrelistic . It is a great game and THE SHOW should be better than MVP next time MVP comes out .
 It is a great game . The rosters are updated really good . Except it does n't have my favorite baseball player Barry Bonds . There is a lot of new gane modes like Rivalry Mode . I like Franchise mode a lot it 's fun.I thought MLB 2K6 would be better but it 's not I rated it 5 stars to . I think you should get MLB 06 THE SHOW if you like really realistic games but get MLB 2K6 if you like kind of realistic games but is real easy .
 Arrived quickly . Package and game was NEW . Like it better than EA Sports MLB 05 . Would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge .
 MLB :06 The Show is the first game under The Show series of baseball games . It was a first party game developed by SCE San Diego Studio , for the PlayStation 2 and PSP.Sound
 The game is pretty realistic to the real world of Baseball . Especially you can use and trade players as needed .
 I think the game from 2005 was better -LRB- MLB06 - Not `` The Show '' Version -RRB- . This seems to be exactly the same except the players are dumber -LRB- they 'll slow down before jumping to catch home runs , they did n't do stupid stuff like that in MLB06 -RRB- , the scoreboards are uglier -LRB- the layouts looked sharper before -RRB- , they have a stupid mini game feature on the side , and finally , a positive , the players were updated for the 2006 season -LRB- which is n't that much of an improvement -RRB- . I rated it high though , because this is the best baseball game that was released in 2006 .
 Great MLB game for the ps2 . Easy to pitch , field , steal , and bat . Has a ton of different modes of play . A lot of editors have given MLB 06 The Show a better rating than MLB 07 . Do the research it 's a great game .
 Ok when i first bought this i thought it kind of sucked and i glitched the hell out of it . I had Kyle Davies up pitching and it was tied 6-6 bases empty but i thought it would be fun to hit some batters , so i beaned like 12 batters in the head with 98 MPH fastballs ... do they get hurt ... nooooooooooooooo ... . so i got the next three guys out , no more runs score , then it goes to the bullpen and it says `` v. Padella has been ejected from the game plz replace him '' and so i 'm like ... ok must be for next inning , so i select a replacement and then he is out on the mound and i 'm pitching again down 21-6 . I dunno ... maybe i ca n't do my math but how does 12 guys hit equal 15 runs?My only real problem besides that is SB ... it 's just too complicated to me cause every time i try to steal , using L2 , the runner ends up stopping cause L2 is also the command for a runner to hold , which was n't a very smart choice in my opinion.But now i mainly just sim through career mode , though it gets annoying to be a max stat guy , age 29 , and still only playing some 140 games a year at first base . Also , if you deny a contract after spring training ... you do n't ever get offered one again ... i simmed through a month as a FA and never got offered a contract even though i was a max rated guy and the only max rated guy out in FA . But yea ... it 's a pretty fun game for simming though , now i 've only played career mode but yea ... its fun !
 Great graphics . Great cutscenes . Great commentary -LRB- more in depth than Espn 's 2K5 stellar offering -RRB- . Great soundtrack . This game has it all . I 've been an MVP fab for the past few years but this blows it away .
 I played this game over at a friend of mines house and I got ta tell you it is THE best MLB game I have ever played . The graphics look so cool and the overall game play is down right awsome . I love being able to play as people in the minor leages , my cousin plays for the Cougars but yet their not on here -LRB- strange -RRB- unless I did not go the the menu for the minor league teams -LRB- I just played MLB style -RRB- . This is a little improvement from last year 's game -LRB- which was perfect as well -RRB- . I am defenitly getting this game .
 This was a solid game one of the best in fact . Most MVP fans might have trouble learning the controls but I played MVP a lot and I thought it was no challenge . MVP 2005 was an excellant game but this is right up there with it.PS - People say this game freezes and it has for me . Once I won a game 13-2 and while loading it froze . I replayed and won 19-0 .
 MLB 06 '
 This game is excellent 2006 Baseball game !!! The pitching is easy ! The gameplay is awsom ! This game just Rocks Rocks !!!
 i gave 2k6 3 stars , and the show is definatly better.the graphics and the gameplay were not as good as 2k6 , and it is impsossible to hit in the show , but the rosters are way more accurate in the show.many of the players in the show just were n't in 2k6 . for the overall package , i 'd give the show the nod .
 MLB 06
 I 've been playing this game for about 3 weeks now . In previous years I was loyal to the EA Sports version until they lost their contract with MLB this year.The Show 2006 is a very worthy competitor . Better in many ways and not as good in a couple of others.PROS : - Graphics are good ; no better or worst than EA Sports as far as I can tell ; - Love how the pitching works , and how pitchers will lose confidence . In a tight game you can really `` feel '' when a pitcher is starting to lose it . Forces you to manage the bullpen , etc. which I like . - The `` Guess Pitch '' feature when batting is just outstanding . Allows you to sit on a fastball -LRB- if you so choose -RRB- . - Gameplay is smooth . - Settings are very customizable . For example , by default the game is set with a lot of cut scenes between pitches . A replay , the runner standing on first , etc. . This makes for great realism but it really slows down the gameplay -LRB- I mean , if I want to watch a baseball game I 'll just turn on the TV , otherwise I just want to play the game -RRB- . The great thing about The Show though is that you can turn all this stuff off , which makes for a much quicker transition between pitches/batters . - Franchise mode is very in-depth , much more so than MVP , particularly on the financial side . You can set up advertisements , take a loan from a bank , etc. . Some will like this , others will think it 's too much to manage . Again you can customize this to your liking -LRB- e.g. have the computer run the financials -RRB- . - Sony updates the MLB rosters weekly , which you can download via online mode . Much better than EA Sports.CONS : There are several areas that can be improved : - The announcers voices lag behind the gameplay . Not a huge deal to where it detracts from the fun of the game , but definitely a little annoying after awhile . A company like Sony should be able to clean this up . - Lack of variety by the announcers . Again , not a huge deal , just a little annoying . For example , every time Willie Taveras comes up to bat the color commentary is `` and you can see by his numbers that he 's swinging the bat a lot better at home '' . Every single time . - Trading players in Franchise Mode is a complete joke . This is a big one for me . As an Astros fan I like to take the team in Franchise mode and `` tinker '' with the roster a bit . First of all , the computer wo n't allow you to trade multiple players for a single player -LRB- for example , a 3-for-1 deal -RRB- . This happens ALL THE TIME in baseball , but not in The Show . In The Show , the computer says `` unable to make trade as the Yankees do n't have roster space '' , meaning that they already have 25 players assigned to their roster and so ca n't take on two more players while giving up only one , as it would give them 26 players on the roster . This is ridiculous ; obviously a player should just be pushed down into the minors . This is how MLB handled it.The stupidity does n't stop here though . Assuming you do find a team willing to trade , the AI is just awful . For example , in April/May during my season , just to test the system I offered Morgan Ensberg , Roy Oswalt , and Brad Lidge to Tampa Bay for Carl Crawford and two scrubs from AAA . Tampa Bay was n't interested . HOWEVER , once the trading deadline came around in July I was able to trade a 28 year old AA pitcher for Crawford . I made similar types of trades to acquire Joe Mauer and Dontrelle Willis.For me this is a really big negative of the game as I love the franchise mode . EA Sports was far superior in this category , and Sony has a lot of work to improve the AI here . - This is very nitpicky , but I personally do n't like the swirling baseball graphic that appears on the field during a pop fly -LRB- the area to which you are to direct your fielder to catch the ball -RRB- . Would prefer something a little simpler . - I 've had a lot of trouble with effective baserunning . Not very intuitive for controlling manually . And when you set it to allow the computer to handle baserunning , every now and then you 'll see your fat , slow catcher -LRB- or whoever -RRB- trying to turn a single into a double . Not a huge deal , but sometimes annoying.In summary though , I can definitely recommend The Show as a very good game . The gameplay , particularly the pitching and hitting modes , is better than EA Sports in my opinion . The annoucers are not as good . The franchise mode is more in depth , with the exception of making trades as noted above.ADDENDUM
 Like many other MVP fans , I was very sad to hear that Take Two had bought exclusive 3rd party rights to MLB games this year -LRB- which essentially all this agreement did was eliminate EA 's MVP game for the next seven years -RRB- . Well since Take Two 's 2K baseball series is widely known to be horrible , I was worried what I would do for a baseball game the next 7 years . I was almost to the point of keeping MVP 2005 for 7 years and updating the rosters . But knowing this was very time consuming and would quickly get to the point of having an outdated game , I looked at the options . Fortunately , us Playstation2 owners do n't have to buy the Take Two game because the agreement still allows Sony to make this game . Luckily , I played this game at a friend 's house and immediately feel in love with . I played 3 games with him , then went to the store to buy it myself . It 's so addicting , and such a baseball simulation it 's ridiculous . You feel like you are an at actual baseball park controlling the players . The graphics are amazing -LRB- players actually look like themselves unlike in MVP where everyone was fat or skinny , Derek Lee is not 400 pounds on this game like he appeared to be in MVP -RRB- and the faces are the best I have seen in a baseball game . The stadiums are beautifully done as well , and for you Cardinals fans , the new Busch Stadium IS in the game , and Sony did a fantastic job recreating it and the skyline behind . The commentary is the best I have ever heard in a baseball game also , you almost feel like the guys are sitting there watching you play , it 's scary sometimes . The presentation is GREAT and is just like a television baseball game . The game plays wonderfully too , you get realistic outcomes , and it 's a challenge . Pitching makes you think
 In this game there are many new features and the awsome classic ones . In career mode you will start in AA with real teams and stadiums . You have to play 9 innings in career and franchise , but you can change it for regular quck games when you play your friends . You can though , just do your at bats . The graphics are awsome the best yet . Also the rosters are good -LRB- about evertthing before the game came out -RRB- . You can use the eyetoy in some modes too . This game may not have the world baseball clasic but is better than 2k6 . This game does feature the red sox and Big Papi , but yankee fans will still like it with Damon and the NYY are the best team in the game . This does also have new rival mode where rivals play each other . You can also play online.The game is fun and a great game !
 This review contains a laundry list of the known bugs and problems with MLB 06
 If you are a fan of baseball , this is the game for you . Do n't expect an arcade experience , this is REAL baseball . Great presentation and great graphics as well -LRB- the best looking MLB game ever to hit the console market -RRB- . If you are a former MVP player like me , this game reminds a lot of MVP but with better presentation and atmosphere so MVPers should enjoy this one . The pitch meter which MVP made famous is also on this game . There are 1000 different individual batting and pitching motions , you would not believe how many players that Sony motioned capped to get their exact correct stances . Very impressive . There 's so many `` little things '' that help make this game great
 pretty good graphics and great gameplay give this game 4 stars overall . The only problem with gameplay is that there is a cut off every time you through from the outfield . The game has great features though , like the career mode where you create yourself , someone else , or just someone you just plain made up.They usally start in triple A but you can train and get better . You can ask for a trade , complain , or asked to be called up . Sometimes they call you up on their own though . Dynasty mode can be hard with budgets however though , but i 've always had a hard time with budgets , so if you understand budgets ignore this part . However , if you smack the ps2 with a baseball bat though over budgets do n't get this game . I dont like budgets but i can tolerate them so its all good to me . Whatever you do though do n't get mlb 2k6 its got bad graphics and the gameplay is confusing . I hope this reveiw helps .
 I just got this game today and I 've only played it for awhile , but it looks really great , plays really great , and has a lot of cool features that make me think I 'm really going to enjoy it for quite some time . You can play the standard `` franchise '' mode that all games have - or you can create a player from scratch and he has to earn a roster spot , gaining in abilities as you complete certain tasks during spring training and during the season . It 's nice to see some of these game makers try something fresh and creative . The game is easy to get around in , the settings are easy to use , and the gameplay so far seems pretty super . The look of the thing is another thing that makes this game stand above the rest . I 'll play it more and see if I still feel great about it , but so far I 'm really impressed .
 This game has great graphics for Ps2 . The franchise mode is deep and fun . There were glitches . Whenever a pop fly was hit over his head -LRB- either by a little or a lot -RRB- they would run to it take a couple steps to a different side than the ball side and go back over and dive and make this amazing chatch without even looking with his glove strethced out at torso level . What is up with That ?
 If theres a better baseball game out there I dont know what it is . MLB 06 The Show is by far the greatest baseball game ive ever played . Almost every aspect of the game is perfect except for maybe player ratings , which was also a problem in lat year 's edition . But you can always adjust them its not very hard . The graphics are great and gameplay is perfect . Seriously , if you are a baseball maniac , like I am , buy this game .
 MLB 2006
 I have always played mvp from EA sports but when I found out they were not going to have it this year I had to find a new mlb game and this is definately the one . Awesome career , franchise and so many different options in the game you can play the game however you want . Awesome game have to try it to believe it .
 This is THE best PS2 baseball game I 've ever played . The graphics are great considering the 6 year old PS2 platform , the Game Play is Great , The career mode is fantastic , the extras are great ... . this is just an all around TERRIFIC game . Anyone that tells you otherwise is lying.By the way , my 6 year old PS2 never had any problems playing this game , even after multiple 10 HR . plus sessions , it never just quit . Maybe Chris Kennison needs to take his PS2 in for service .
 I just got this game today , and as soon as I got into my first game , I got bored . Simple as that . I was just thinking why the hell I just spent forty dollars on this game . The game is really slow paced , I find the commentary voices a little annoying , and the soundtrack for the most part is not very good . But after playing a game or so , it did get a little better . Here is my stack.Graphics
 Great Game , and I am picky . Much better than MLB 06 . Here are the only negatives :1 -RRB- ca n't create a player in franchise mode ? only in career mode .2 -RRB- A little too hard to hit homers . . I had my guy at full strength in average and power and still it was very challenging to hit homers - I think I averaged 1 in every 5 at bats with the power and contact cranked to the max and on rookie level
 This game is by far the best baseball video game to hit stores in 2006 . The best game feature in this game is career mode . In this mode you get to create your player and guide him through his journey to his ultimate goal ; making it to `` The Show . '' The worst part of career mode is having to start at like the AA level and taking too long to make it to the show , but by the time you make it to the show it is worth it . But if you are one of those guys who just want to get to the show in about 2 minor league seasons have your career set to rookie mode . I was really disapointed when I heard that EA Sports was n't coming out with a MLB game this year so I bought their college game and after I bought 06 The Show , NCAA 06 has been collecting dust in my basement . This game blew away all of its competition and has my vote 100 percent .
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two

 I chose this rating because the vest is exactly what I wanted!It is light-weight in feel yet keeps me warm when I need it !
 Gave this to my sister-in-law for CHristmas present . She loves it . Nice and soft , good fit . Washes up well too .
 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .
 I got this vest for my 90-year old Mom . It 's soft and a pretty pink , but most of all it keeps her nice and warm .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .
 I am 45 and have not worked out in years . This is such a great workout , I started with level 1on each workout and 8 weeks later I have lost 10pounds and am doing mostly level 2 now . I especially love the High and Tight workout and was using the resistance bands by the third work out and now I am starting to use the ankle weights too ! Sculpt is a great low impact cardio and toning workout . The instructor is fantastic ! He is encouraging , makes me smile and teaches in a way that made it easy for a beginner like me ! Definitely worth the $ 72 .
 I have absolutely no complaints about this product . I 'm not a physically active person besides doing Latin/Tropical dances on a daily basis -LRB- I dance , salsa , merengue , bachata , reggae and samba -RRB- . It 's been a week since I began the program and I already lost an inch around my waist . My only gripe with this workout is that there 's little moderate or alternate exercises for those who are n't too strong in the legs to do scissor jumps , but other than that the workout sets out to do exactly what it intends to do . I do the Bum Bum workout and I feel the burn in between my thighs , my butt and legs along with my core and sides . It really is a wonderful workout and most importantly fun ! Mr. Carvalho is a positive guy and a bit querky -LRB- In a positive way of course -RRB- , and his charisma really gets me through the workout without feeling bored . This was my issue with a few workouts I 've done in the past so I 'm glad that enjoyment was amplified in this workout.On a sidenote , I recommend this workout for those who are looking to lose some weight and tone up ; for people who are looking to lose more weight , I would recommend Insanity and afterwards move to the Brazil Butt Lift to tighten . Healthy eating habits is also a plus ; I eat fresh fruit , vegetables , chicken , Quaker oatmeal , Raisin Bran , lean pork chops and ground turkey . For snacking , I have Special K , fruit , whole wheat pita bread with marinara sauce and a bit of shredded mozzarella and weight watchers treats -LRB- I would add more of what I have daily , but the list would go on and on -RRB- . If I do go out to eat , I make sure my meal is between 500-600 cals at the most , and I 'll have a bit of dessert -LRB- nothing wrong with indulging folks , all in moderation -RRB- . Most importantly people , drink water daily ! A friend of mine who will remain anonymous and I began this workout together , she chose not to give up drinking fruit juices , stuck to diet drinks and coffee -LRB- while there 's nothing wrong with these drinks in moderation , the sugar and calories coupled with the other food that you ingest throughout the day do add up -RRB- . I chose to drink both plain and seltzer water -LRB- plain and naturally flavored -RRB- . I lost a bit more weight that she did and now she 's drinking only water to catch up lol.All in all I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it . * EDIT * It 's been a little over a month since I began the program , currently on week 4 . My body has changed drastically since I began the workout , My bottom is so firm , I ca n't even remember the last time it felt like this , maybe when I was a kid ? lol . My body 's becoming tighter , the folds I had around my waist before are diminishing/almost gone and most importantly I 'm beginning to see definition . I can see slight cuts around my arms and abdomen along with my legs . Switched from Weight Watchers snacks to Special K due to price , other than that I 've been losing weight at a steady pace ; Fit into my pre-pregnancy jeans now ! I will be continuing the program for another month so I 'll keep updated with my results then .
 Works your whole body ! I did the Insanity work out before this and before I bought Brazil Butt Lift , I thought it would be easy but I was wrong ! Work outs are actually really tough . I love the instructor . He 's really energetic . The videos go by quickly for me . I 'm in love with this product .
 I have been using for a little over a week and loving it ! The workouts are fun and if you push yourself , you get a great workout . You get a full body workout as well . I ordered the maximum results video as well that comes with more bands and ankle weights
 Any of these reviews saying this workout does n't work or did n't feel burn obviously were not putting all there effort into the exercise . He tells you to tighten your butt while doing the floor exercises which makes them harder . If you are lazy about it or just throw your legs and use momentum of course you wo n't feel anything ! Do n't listen to the lazy people . And it is cardio ! It will not bulk you up . Sure if you want to look like a supermodel you can starve yourself during the month , but otherwise you have an unrealistic body image ! This workout works and makes your butt hard . If you want to be stick thin but still have a jiggly butt go for it . I would much rather look tone and fit !!
 My husband ordered this for me . I was fearful bc I 'm lazy , but I did want to tone up . 6wks later , I 'm so happy . Hubby shared the news w/friends n co-workers n hey all ordered it for their wives . Granted I started seei results w/in a cpl wks , but got ill n was stuck in bed for a week then family members came to visit n yadda-yadda . Granted I did other things as well , but most of my energy was put into bbl and I did n't even push myself as hard as I could 've , ex-mil n all . I did IMO the min and I still got results , just kept moving n flexing . I lost a good 8lbs , where my goal was 10-15 it helped to tone me enough where I decided I did n't need to lose anymore just maintain .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .

 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 The mask is good , it does not fog as advertised , the snorkel works very well . I recommend this product .
 this is the best leg holster ive ever worn . its really strong and fits comfortably on my leg .
 I INSTALLED THIS ON OUR PORCH MYSELF , A LADY , AND WE ONLY GOT TO ENJOY IT A FEW TIMES THIS SUMMER AND IT WORKED GREAT . THE ONLY ADVICE I 'D GIVE IS TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT TOO CLOSE TO YOU , A LITTLE DISTANCE ABOVE YOUR HEAD IS BETTER , EVEN AT A COUPLE FEET ABOVE OURS IT WAS STILL TOO CLOSE , YOU END UP DRENCHED IN THE MIST QUICKLY AND NOT TO COMFY , SO GIVE YOURSELF SOME CLEARANCE AND YOU 'LL STILL BE NICE AND COOL
 Very well made lanyard at a very reasonable price . . I do n't enter the woods without my # 1 call-keeper . . I highly recommend it
 I like it . Lanyards are kinda more about preference and opinion than anything . I mean it 's kinda hard to screw up string and some knots .
 Ordered this on a Friday night and got it on a Wednesday . Quick delivery and exactly what was described . I would recommend this lanyard to anyone who waterfowl hunts . Very durable looks great .

 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 very compact light and functional . I have owned 2 fobus holsters and am very pleased . Holds very securely and draws quickly . Superior to Uncle Mikes .
 This holster fits well . The gun slides into it and is retained by the detent bump inside the triggerguard of the holster . It does n't feel like it 's going to fall out easily and requires a deliberate pull to release the firearm . the inside of the paddle is lined with soft rubber , so it does n't cut into your skin and it grips well holding itself whereever you position it . the size of the paddle is adequate . i can tuck this in pants without any need of a belt . the only thing that detracts from this awesome product is that it polishes the trigger guard on your gun from reholstering it constantly .
 This makes a great holster but it does have a snug fit on the gun I placed in it . Overall it was a great holster but choose wisely as compared to what type of gun you will be using in this holster ,

 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 NICE HAT , BUT IN PINK . I DO UNDERSTAND THE CAUSE . I BOUGHT IT FOR MY WIFE . STILL A BIG RAIDERS FAN .
 This is a great looking Brewers shirt I ordered for my girlfriend . She is a small girl , and I was afraid a medium would be too big . But when the shirt arrived , it was tiny ! I would order again , but be careful what size you order , and maybe even order 2 sizes larger than normal .
 ... in fact , an XL was skin tight on my normally-medium-wearing frame . I ended up returning the item .
 Today 's ethanol gas is a disaster waiting to happen . If you recently bought or have an old motor , this is necessary insurance to make sure you get back home . Recently bought a 1998 boat and the fuel ball was useless . Popped a new one on for just a couple of bucks and we 're back up and running again . Do n't forget your marine grade Sta Bil , the one in the blue bottle . What our government has done with the ethanol mandate is a travesty , but there are things we have learned to to do avoid engine catastrophe and upgrading to a new , ethanol ready primer bulb is one of them .
 We use these for making hand wash systems for river rafting . We mount them on a small wood/metal pad and use it as a foot pump for pumping water to a small spigot . Works great !

 I chose this rating because the vest is exactly what I wanted!It is light-weight in feel yet keeps me warm when I need it !
 Gave this to my sister-in-law for CHristmas present . She loves it . Nice and soft , good fit . Washes up well too .
 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .
 I got this vest for my 90-year old Mom . It 's soft and a pretty pink , but most of all it keeps her nice and warm .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .

 My son received this for Christmas and is already proficient at it . It 's really easy to learn and he does many more tricks with the Wave than with his skateboard.We went to the site on the skateboard - www.streetsurfing.com . He found this to be a good source of tricks and exercises.He 's hoping that his buddy gets one , too , so they can perform `` the leap '' trick . This is a trick where you skate toward a stationary board , `` leap '' off your moving Wave onto it , then continue on your way . There 's a video of it on the site.As a mom , I can say that I was a little apprehensive about the safety of the Wave . However , after he got the hang of this board , he 's only fallen once . He says that it 's more stable than a skateboard because you have both feet on the board at all times . I 'm just glad there 's less of a chance for a trip to the emergency room !
 It 's a LOT of fun ! It looks hard to do but it 's not . After a few tries , you 've got it down . I like having a board that does n't fly out from underneath me and that I do n't have to peddle every 5 seconds . It 's definitely worth the money !
 me and my friend have so much fun on this thing . we started a crew . we always ride down to wherever we want to go with out ever touching the ground . its amazing ! get one .
 This was purchased for my grandson for Christmas and he thoroughly enjoyed it . I would recommend it highly . I purchased the green one and that made it very much more . Green is his favority color .
 This was a surprise Christmas presents for my 12 year old son who not only extremely happy about it but will not get off of it!As for the purchase , in my opinion it was a great purchase and at a GREAT price my only negative comment is with the manner in which it was delivered . The company -LRB- for whatever reason -RRB- chose to use the shipping company DHL for delivery and the individual who delivered it to my house left it outside in the open on a commmon path that I share with other neighbors behind a bush ! So I just wish that the company who sells thiese would choose a better way ro ship their merchandise .
 They love it . My son is really good , I am just waiting on the doctors bill . I dont know how he does it . He loves it and the other one was for my daughter - she wasnt so interested and hasnt used it yet
 Great product , well constructed and looks good . Prompt delivery . Takes awhile to learn how to ride but well worth it once you get it down .
 my son -LRB- 10 -RRB- absolutely loves this board . durable and fun to ride . it takes time to get the hang of it and then you 're off . in terms of the shopping experience , it was ideal
 I bought two of these for kids # 2 and # 3 for Christmas.They were off and running on these right out of the box . Of course , they use these in PE at school , so they are not novices.They are using these on the neighborhood concrete driveways and sidewalks . I do not see where there will be a wheel wear issue on this type of surface , but I could see how wheels would get worn down quickly on any rough stuff.If you are an old geezer , like me , with decent balance and athletic ability , you will enjoy using the wave board too . It took me about 20 minutes of practice to be able to get the hang of it and not look like a complete dork.As always , Amazon came through and shipped quickly with no hassles .
 My grandchildren asked me to order this for them to give as a surprise to their mother who , after they each recieved a wave board for Christmas , taught them how to ride them . She enjoyed riding and occassionally would monopolize their wave boards , so they decided she needed her own . SHE LOVES IT.The board is exactly as described and functions as expected and needed .
 I bought this for my 10 year old for his birthday - it was too big for him , so I then bought the smaller wave ripple -LRB- wave ripple -RRB- for him , and he convinced me to keep this one for myself . We 've both had a great time learning to ride it . It took about a day to learn . I 'd also recommend real protective gear - and not riding downhill . At all . Ever . -LRB- from experience -RRB-
 I purchased this as a gift for my 12 year old sister and 16 year old brother . both are into skating and love it . it is a bit difficult to ride at first but they both picked it up in an afternoon . It is a great cross between skating and snowboarding .
 My kid LOVES IT !! i always try it out but i would always trip and fall ! it takes real talent to ride the wave board . my kid does n't have any problems . sept for the fact that his friends come over to use it . hahaha .
 We bought the wave board for our 14 year-old for Christmas . He was thrilled ! He took it to the park that afternoon and hopped on it and started riding it w/out too much effort . He can ride it pretty well now , although he comments that he needs to figure out how to make it ride faster , do stunts , etc. . It does come with a DVD which he has n't watched yet , so maybe he 'll learn more from the DVD . Overall , we 're pretty happy with the purchase .
 My daughter wanted this for Christmas . We found that it 's great for the beach . All of my children have tried it ages 8-12 and love it . Good exercise and keeps them busy . I highly recommend getting the safety gear to go with it helmet knee pads etc. . Not because its dangerous , just to be safe . From what I 've been told it seems to glide easier then the rip stick . Each child seemed to get it just after a few tries . It 's great .
 This board is so much better than a skateboard . I got one for christmas and have n't really put it down . Definately worth your money .
 All three of my kids
 Until we get anti-gravity , this will have to do.When I first saw this board , I did n't believe it could be rideable . Only two wheels instead of four , and they 're on swivels . And the board is split in the middle , and pivots around a rod ? I rounded up the owner , my 7-year old nephew Taigen . `` Show me . '' I demanded . When he did , it was like I was watching a magic trick.So I studied it awhile , and took one ride while supported by a helpful shoulder . Then I kicked off by myself . As soon as you pivot once , and feel the board actually propelling you , you `` get it . '' I was hooked.Never have I seen a recreational toy where the disparity between perceived and actual difficulty was so great . If you kick off hoping for the reassuring support of four wheels , you 're not going to make it . If , however , you kick off , and believe you 're surfing/snowboarding/whatever , you will do fine . It 's faith-based boarding ! It 's all about active balance.I showed it to a friend . When he saw the swiveling casters , he said , `` That 's death-on-wheels ! '' I give him the prep-talk -LRB- `` balance '' -RRB- Three kicks later , he 's going around the parking lot.The smoother the movements -LRB- swivel those hips ! -RRB- the better . It 's like riding a wave a couple of inches off the concrete .
 My daughter saw this when we were visiting F.A.O. Schwarz in NY . She is 8 and wanted one , bad . I ended up finding it for $ 99 with free shipping at Sports Authority -LRB- a long time ago , your mileage may vary ! -RRB- . Adults will love it !!! It took me 10 minutes to get the hang of it , and about 3h to master turning at full speed . I used to skateboard a good deal as a kid , and that probably helped . I want one for myself now!My daughter had to practice a bit more , but she never had any kind of skateboard ; it took her about 5h total -LRB- and she still does n't turn all that well -RRB- . A kid from our street that is always skateboarding got it very quickly , she was turning and in full control of the board in about 2h . These are , obviously , non-contiguous hours of practice . Who would do `` the wave drills '' ? Not us , thanks !!! : - -RRB- Every single kid in our street just wants one . They are always after us asking if they can try it . The other adults , when they see me riding , are split in two camps
 Got the wave board about 5 months ago . Took me about an hour to get the hang of riding it . Was a bit daunting at first , but after using a wall for a few runs , I got the hang off it . One tip
 I 've been riding a StreetSurfing 's Wave for a month , and I 'm really having a great time with it . I thought to share my experience in some areas that new buyers may find useful.Wave vs. Ripstik : I chose Wave over Ripstik because I heard that it 's easier to learn.The claim was supposedly based on Wave 's wider deck plate and shorter caster height . I tried my friend 's Ripstik , and my conclusion is that it does not matter which . They are both good and easy to learn.Having said that , there are noticeable differences in riding feels more than cosmetic . I felt that Ripstik was a bit more responsive , perhaps faster too . But it could be the ground surface or the wheel condition that made me feel that way . I liked the narrower deck plate on Ripstik , as it felt easier to position my feet . But I am very happy with the Wave , and these differences wo n't make me switch to Ripstik.Wheel tread wear
 I found the Wave to be in intimidating at first especially when I mistakenly tried to ride it with the back facing front . Going down a very slight grade really helps too . Follow the instructional DVD.Once you get the hang of moving your hips to make it go , it quickly becomes addictive and so much fun.It is an excellent way to improve balance skills and it provides a strenuous workout . I feel it 's a lot safer than conventional skateboarding since it does n't squirt out from under you and dump you as easily as a regular skateboard . I 'm a 64 year old geezer in fairly good shape and using the Wave is a great addition to my retired routine .
 This is a description of most types of boards based on the experiences of my son -LRB- 15 -RRB- , my daughter -LRB- 9 -RRB- , and me -LRB- 48 -RRB- : Skateboards - Fun for jumping tricks -LRB- grinds , board flips , etc. -RRB- . Casterboards are more maneuverable and fun than skateboards on a street , but less fun at skateparks . Soularc Skateboards have one curved deck on top of another for a springy carving feel . Flowboards have 7 wheels in a semicircle in front and 7 wheels in a semicircle in back for a snowboard feel . Sole Skates are small , three-wheeled skateboards . Longboards are longer and wider skateboards.RipStiks - Like skateboards but with two small decks connected by a crossbar , and two inline casterwheels which swivel 360 degrees . Seems safer than skateboards because RipStiks do n't easily shoot out from under you -LRB- they just flop onto their sides -RRB- . The wheels might show some wear fairly quickly , but even with flattened wheels they 're way more fun than skateboards for zipping around on the street . We 're able to take apart our RipStik casters and clean them , but not our Wave Board casters , giving RipStiks an advantage over Waves . RipStik Gs have metal crossbars for doing grinds . RipStik Airs are molded into a single piece of plastic , and feel stiffer than RipStiks . Ripsters are smaller to fit younger kids.Wave Boards - Like RipStiks , but with shorter crossbars . Makes more of a `` clatter '' noise than our RipStik . Wave Ripples are smaller to fit younger kids . ExBoards , X-Boards , EssBoards , VigorBoards , Cudas , Freeriders , and eXtreme boards are similar to RipStiks/Waves . WhipTides - Like RipStiks , but with four inline casterwheels . The crossbar bends up-down and side-to-side , unlike RipStiks . Can do tighter turns and slaloms than RipStiks . Ca n't do jumps or lift one wheel off of the ground . There 's a slight `` wiggle '' motion as you go faster . I 'm more aggressive on RipStiks since they do n't wiggle , but my daughter prefers the wiggle because it helps her get moving . Shred Sleds and Alive Boards are similar to WhipTides . Hurricane Boards and Cycle Force Swingboards appear to be WhipTides with only two inline casterwheels.Xgliders -LRB- Xliders -RRB- - Have two separate -LRB- unattached -RRB- casterboard decks , so they 're a bit tricky to learn and easy to lose your balance or do the splits . Can do different tricks and tighter turns and slaloms than RipStiks/Waves/WhipTides . You ca n't just step on and go , like with RipStiks . Instead , you place the two decks onto the ground , carefully step on one at a time , then go . RipSkates are like Xgliders , but with a removable crossbar . I made a RipSkate clone by bolting a crossbar between our Xglider decks , and it 's very fun because it allows you to do tight turns -LRB- even better than a WhipTide -RRB- without the danger of your feet going in different directions . RipSkates provide two different riding experiences for the price of one . Freeline Skates are similar to Xgliders , but the wheels do n't spin 360 degrees . OrbitWheels have separate decks as well , but your feet are * inside * the wheels.PowerWings - Have safer features than RipStiks -LRB- two casterwheels in back plus a wheel in front for stability , and handlebars with brakes -RRB- . You face forward and move your hips side-to-side , but on casterboards you face sideways and use a twisting movement with your hips . It 's easy to lean too far back and flip over , but with practice this allows doing wheelies . Some PowerWings have safety bars at the back to prevent flipping over . Rip Rider 360s are similar , but they have a big plastic wheel in front with pedals , and kids ride them sitting down . Trikkes and `` Slider The Unscooter '' are also three-wheeled , but with unique methods of propulsion.Bladeboards - Like RipStiks , but the casters are designed differently . We cleaned and lubricated the casters , and put in new bearings , but it still feels sluggish and noisy compared to RipStiks . Bladeboards do n't appear to be sold anymore.PumpRockrs - Skateboards with one casterwheel in front . Ca n't make tight turns like casterboards can . T-Boards are skateboards with two casterwheels , but do n't appear to be as maneuverable as RipStiks . OBoards appear to be PumpRockrs.TimberWolf XtreeMs - Similar to RipStiks , but the casters are designed differently . My kids and I are experienced riders , but we felt cautious at first because the TimberWolf is quite a bit faster and more maneuverable than RipStiks/Waves/WhipTides . The casters can go forward or backward , so you can swap ends as you ride , and do 360s . RollerSurfers have different casters , but they also allow you to swap ends and do 360s . Streetboards - Like skateboards , but the decks are in three sections . Your feet rotate the outer sections to propel the board , and you can strap into bindings on the footplates -LRB- optional -RRB- . Good for jumping tricks -LRB- grinds , etc. -RRB- , but not as maneuverable and fun as casterboards on the street . Snakeboards are shorter versions of Streetboards . It took us several days to figure out how to ride our Snakeboard because the movement is different than with casterboards . Our RipSkate clone is everything that I had hoped the Snakeboard would be . Alterskates had a similar rotating mechanism to propel the board , but no-one at their website responds to emails . LandSharks are kneeboards which you propel similar to Streetboards -LRB- using a handlebar -RRB- . Bottom line : We own a skateboard , RipStik , Wave , WhipTide , Xglider , RipSkate clone , Bladeboard , TimberWolf , and Snakeboard , and we 've ridden a RipStik G , RipStik Air , PowerWing , PumpRockr , Flowboard , and LandShark . Our favorite boards are
 I love this board ! I never snowboarded or surfed before so I cant really tell you how close of a feel this board gives you . I can , however , tell you that I sure want to learn how to after riding The Wave ! This thing is probably one of the most fun toys I 've ever bought . It took me only 20 minutes to learn to ride it with the aid of a wall . It is simply AWESOME ! No board out there -LRB- to my knowledge -RRB- can give you the tight turns of The Wave , which is what i love most about it . The self-propelling feature is just as advertised and you can effortlessly go uphill with some practice.My only problem with this board is the wheels . They SUCK ! If you plan on riding it on asphalt , expect to be buying new wheels because they wear out QUICK ! I rode it outside for half an hour and you can already see a noticeable difference between the front and back wheels . My back wheels started looking more like a skateboard wheel than an inline wheel.Also , the advertising they do for this board is a little misleading . Yes , the wheels do physically rotate 360 degrees , but functionally , they each can only rotate 45 degrees from midline . The wheels are attached at an angle that limits full rotation while you 're skating . So dont listen to them when they say you can `` RIDE SIDEWAYS ! '' because the most can get is going forward with the board at a 45 degree angle . Dont even think about going backwards because the angle will prevent your wheels from doing so and you will likely fall off before moving an inch.This is not a big deal because you probably just want this board because it doesnt require your foot to touch the ground , and can give you crazy turns . I just think they should n't place all that emphasis on a wheel that can rotate 360 degrees.Overall though , I am very pleased with my purchase and ca n't wait to buy more replacement wheels so i can `` surf '' the streets !
 I can attest to the wheel problem that others have mentioned . My son 's rear wheel was stripped in less than two months from what I 'd call moderate use -LRB- about 3 days/week -RRB- . But he LOVES the board and is asked to demonstrate it everywhere we go . I 've tried it twice now and feel I 'll get it with another practice or two - not bad for a middle-aged mom . Manufacturer needs to address the soft wheels , though - otherwise budget 3-6 sets of replacement wheels per year , depending on use .
 I got this board yesterday and i LOVE it ! Its so much fun to ride around and kind of unusual . Its a little hard to get used to at first but once ur used to it its great fun !!!
 why buy this on amazon when it is 15 dollars cheaper elsewhere -- what happened to amazon ?
 The truth at first seemed somewhat complicated because I had never ridden in a way , but once you mount the instructions that come with the table , and makes you much easier to use and learn . The video tutorial is very helpful
 I really liked how this video was presented in segments and a viewer could go to what was of interest to them or just start from the beginning . I thought that restating over and over again of how important safety is was a plus . Anyone with or without experience should view this video and get something out of it .
 My son is 10 years old and learned how to ride this board in a few hours ! He absolutely loves it ! Now my 9 year old daughter wants one !
 From the moment opened the packaging box till the time I am able to ride on it for a quarter mile without fall takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes . As a 40-year-old dad , I eventually bought the toy not for my kids but for myself , and found this toy to be very easy to learn even for my age.However , the quality of the board is made of plastic . It is scratched on the day one . The board is purchased from FAO Schwartz for a similar price on Amazon but with the bonus pack of extra wheels and faceplates . The wheel is hard to be taken off ; the quality of metal bolt is definitely in question . Since it is only 70 bucks , hope it can last for at least half year . Checked out the RipStik , looks like RipStik DLX is made of high quality metals and read some good comments about it . Will definitely try RipStik once this wave board is worn out.In summary , the design of the wave board is good , and easy and fun to ride on . However , the board is made of low quality materials such as plastic and cheap metal bolts which make it difficult to replace wheels and plates . Hence only deserve 4 stars .
 My 8 year old son got this for his bday . He loves it ! It has a steep learning curve . It took a solid 2-3 days for him to figure it out -LRB- a lot of frustration/throwing during that time -RRB- but now he cruises everywhere on it . He even took it to a intermediate skate park and skated the bowls with it !
 Kids like it . Good change to the traditional skate board . Make sure you get the helmet . I was glad I did !
 I bought this for my sons 9th Birthday . He loves it . He is actually very good at it . Practice makes perfect . I would suggest that if your child has never skateboarded , surfed , nor snowboarded be patient it becomes easier , and funner . My son enjoys riding it with his friends too . I believe it will help with your childs coordination and balance .
 This product is a lot of fun . It 's not a an improved skateboard but really something entirely different . It 's major advantages over the skateboard are that you can accelerate -LRB- including propelling yourself uphill -RRB- without removing your feet by executing a series of switchbacks and it 's far more maneuverable.The board is in two halves , each with a single rollerblade wheel mounted on a caster which is mounted on a bevel angled to the rear . The two halves are connected by a torsion bar so that they can twist semi-independently . By counter-twisting the halves while essentially dancing `` The Twist '' you can accelerate . Stopping , just like on a regular skateboard , is still problematic . : - -RRB- I do n't think it has the trick potential of a skateboard but going on a long downhill has some of the feel of snowboarding but more flexible or , as they call it , street surfing . You get a lot of control with your feet on the board . A huge parking lot with a slight grade is a great place to go nuts .
 Great fun!Definitely takes some time to get used to if you are not a skater.The wheels are a problem , I knew this buying it but it should n't stop you . I actually just got my wave board today and after about 5 hours of use the back wheel busted completely in half . You should invest in some extra wheels but overall it is worth your money ! It has gotten me to off the computer and outside !
 I bought this for my 12 year old son on line , as all the stores are sold out of them . He absolutely loves it and has gotten very good at it , it 's great for flat areas as well as hills . Just remember your protective gear . Atlanta Mom
 I love this thing . I got mine a few days ago and it took me a while to get it , but after a few tries I got the basic mechanics and now I 'm waving to get the mail . I 'll get good soon . This thing is great for the legs , and it 's hours of fun .
 I do n't own one but I got to ride one in gym class and within 30 minuts I had the basic skill I needed to go around the gym without falling . One thing is when you start for the first time you should have another person help guide you by holding their sholder . I ca n't wait for my birthday !!!!!
 i bought the wave about 1 week ago and I got the hang off it in 3 days now I master the wave drill and high speed turns its worth your money -LRB- Im 10 years old -RRB-
 Although my wife disagreed - I bought this for my son 's 6 year old birthday . It took him a day to figure it out well enough to jump on it from a stand still and get going a hundred yards or so.Materials look reasonably good , it 's light enough that he can cary it , and stout enough that I -LRB- dad -RRB- can also enjoy a fun ride . I must say this is one of the coolest toys invented . Easily 5 stars .
 I never knew this skateboard existed until one day in P.E. when we got to try them out the whole period ! This guy came to our school with about 30 waveboards and helmets , plus 7 boards he was giving away for free ! So we got in pairs of two , and we tried out the boards . They are a little hard to get , but soo fun ! Even trying to get it is fun , and it is a little helpful to have someone to hold onto in the beginning . I could n't ride the board on my own in about 15 mintues of trying it , but I was getting close ! I will be getting this board as soon as I can ! It is sooo fun ! = -RRB-
 I bought this for my 10 year old grandson . It is an unusual ride , took him a while to catch on , but he is really enjoying it now that he has mastered it .
 I bought this board from interest . When I saw the two wheels , I thought it would be impossible to ride . But I tried it and it turned out to be easy . If you lose your balance it wo n't slide out from under you . Instead , it will tilt to one side , which I found conveniant . I recommend this to people who enjoy skateboarding , skiing , or snowboarding
 i just got the wave and i thought it looked easy , but it took me a very long time to learn to ride it , but it was totally worth it ! it 's amazing!but i still dont get how to stop . i mean i tried leaning forward i little , but that didnt help . but ill learn . when you ride the thing it feels like your gliding !! it totally feels like snowboarding and surfing.it took me forever to do the S shape , but i learned to do it in less than an hour . whats with amazon ?? its more expensive here than sporting stores . but if you want to get it , get it at costco . it comes with the wave , replacement wheels , practice cones , a silver deckplate change , and a dvd for 95 dollars .
 My son wanted one of these after Christmas . Unfortunately , they were no where to be found . We kept looking , and waiting but , none of the local stores were receiving any -LRB- inventory season -RRB- . Finally , we did a search on google and Amazon came up with a fantastic price and free shipping . When the board arrived , he was absolutely thrilled . It is much better looking when you see it . I would not recommend this board for any type of skateboarding beginner . I personally have not tried it but , you have to have great balance and coordination skills . It looks like a great deal of fun and also provided great exercise .
 whoa ! the wave is really cool . It requires a lot of balance and hip rotation . Overall , I ca n't ride a skateboard , but i can ride this !
 My best friend has one and I tried it . She said I learned how to ride it fast it is very hard at first and kinda hard to stop but fun . Im trying to find one cheap it awsome look in to it .
 This board is amazing . A lot of people complain about the wheels but HOW HEAVY ARE YOU !?! Ok i ride this baby 5 days a week and i am about 90 pounds and it is not wearing out ! It 's been 3 months alreadyThis board is probably one of the safest things around ! It works like magic - i know it seems scary at first but once you ride it it just works ! I never fell on this thing but i fell on my bike , scooter , skateboard , rollerblades , etc. . It took me 5 min . to learn to ride thisWhen you ride this board it feels like your floating . Really cool since you NEVER touch the ground . And it really is n't hard to stop . Just lean your feet forward a little and it stops ! Very simple . You can see some videos at their official site.Even my little sister can ride this baby and she 's 7 years old . So it took her 15 min ! She does n't even know how to ride a bike but she knows how to ride this thing ! That 's how amazing the waveboard is . Totally worth it . Truthfully i believe the price should be raised.If you have any doubts about getting this why ? It 's a perfect gift . Its safe , fun , and the price is too cheap for this baby ! I 'd get it for your childe if they wanted it.If your too heavy -LRB- 100 plus pounds ? -RRB- do n't ride this thing . Do you think 2 wheels can hold your weight ? It was designed for KIDS . But sure you can try but do n't complaing about the wheels then . Use your head!The perfect x-mas gift ! I 'm getting one for my sis . She 'll love it . This thing is selling fast at Big 5 ! If you go to your local sports shop it 'll probably be cheaper .
 When my friend bought one of these babies , the rest of us were a bit hesitant to try , but within 5 minutes none of us wanted to give it up ! Everyone 's always so amazed that it works because of its strange shape and only two wheels . I have never skateboarded , snowboarded , or surfed , but i wakeboard alot , and the control is about the same . Some say it 's impossible to ride backwards or sideways , but i 've done both . -LRB- actually learned when i was learning to turn -RRB- I 've ordered one for myself , and so has another one of my friends . I have n't checked on the condition of its wheels , but we 've been riding this thing non-stop for a week and it still rides smoothly .
 I admit it , I NEVER have used a skateboard . I was skeptical on purchasing this board , but I am glad I did . I was able to learn to `` surf '' it within 10 minutes . I love it ! It is just like real surfing , but the wave never ends ! I love that I never have to put my foot on the ground ! Just requires good balance and a lot of foot strength!Be sure to wear a helmet for safety !
 I wanted to get the wave board when I had learned how to ride during gym class . I got it cheaper than the usual price that sports stores sell it for . I bought it and i love it . People say the wheels wear out to quickly , but do n't all skate boards need new wheels ? Your usually not suppose to go near very rocky surfaces its probably better to go to a skate park or a very smooth street . Overall this is a very good board , but i would suggest to wear a helmet .
 The board is very neat and fun . I am 36yr old female and it took me about one hour to get very good at it . I tried snowboarding once and yes i would say it was like snowboarding but ca n't speak for surfing or skateboarding . But with the Wave board i doubt someone can go down a steep mountaing like they can with a snowboard . My wheels are doing good after many weeks of use but do n't wan na pay $ 20 for a pair of wheels . You can get an 8pack of wheels for $ 26 at Dickssporting goods . Also , it is excellent exercise for your legs . When you are first learning though for the first 30 minutes it doesnt seem like it , because you keep forgetting that it is selfpropelled and whenever you come to an incline you just STOP . But once you realize you have to keep moving and twisting it is very good exercise .
 new challenge for my son and fortunately myself.my son has become some wave rider i never expect.for me its an exercise for my legs and stomach , and just to stay balance.time well spent with my boy .
 First , let me start with one little fact . Once you ride this , you 'll never ride any other -LRB- wheeled -RRB- board but this again . I had a skateboard once , and while getting on , the board shot out under me and I landed flat on my back . Sound familiar?I got this board when I saw some friends riding it , and they let me take a shot . I wanted this thing after one try ? Yeah , I know . Anyway ... Starting off , riding it is n't actually difficult . You just push off with your front foot , get your other foot on , and starting `` waving '' -LRB- notice the quotes ? NO hands neccesary -RRB- . Self-Propulsion At the beginning it 's going to seem frustrating and hard -LRB- and you 'll be getting plenty of stares , I assure you -RRB- , but afer I few tries , you 'll start getting the hang of it , and be going above walking speeds uphill . Only problem with the board is that it 's nearly impossible to stop if you 're going downhill . Even if youu jump off , momentum 's gon na grab ya . Belive me , I know.Turning
 The Wave is a well made quality product . As a former skateboarder , snow boarder getting the hang of the wave took about 20 minutes . The ride is incredible , from doing zero radius circles to riding sideways this board gives you a totally unique ride .
 I purchased the wave and let me tell you , THE BEST THING TO RIDE ! Whenever I go down the street everyone stares and ask what is it . They all say they want one too . The best thing of all is riding hills ! I can even go up them but when you go down its like snowboarding . I recommend this 100 %
 This toy was the hit of Christmas . All of the kids , ages 9-12 at my house , loved this board , they quickley learned how to balance and played endlessly .
 This product is a excelent skating , but it 's necesary to be careful because could be danger in unexpert boys ...
 My daughter received this for Christmas and was riding it within an hour . She skimboards in the summer so I thought she would catch on quickly and now she can stay on as long as she chooses . Her dad was worried that she might hurt herself -LRB- could happen -RRB- but she is riding carefully , with pads and helmet , and she loves it . This board provides great balance practice and incredible exercise . It will keep her in shape for summer !
 Bought this for my 9 yr . old grandson for Christmas and he absolutly loves it !! I was a little concerned it was n't the `` RipStick '' he kept hinting for , but when he saw the ` cool ' skulls all over the board , he did n't even notice the brand.Really fast shipping and very satisfied overall !!
 Sturdy , stylish , and loads of fun . To an adult , it looks impossible to ride , but it does n't take a determined kid very long to learn and have fun . Promotes coordination and balance . A cool way to navigate for pre-teens and teens . Safety is a concern - address that with your kid , and you will both be happy .
 I got my Hi-Tide for Christmas . It is awesome !!! I got really upsessed with it by my friends and wanted it for so long !! Now I got it for Christmas and I ride it multiple times a day ! I just have to say 3 words : GET A HI-TIDE !
 TOTALLY AWESOME ! The wave carves , slides , moves sideways , and even does 360 Degree turns ! The maneuverability on this thing is amazing ! It can easily change direction , almost literally on a dime!I 've had this for about a month , and it is an awesome product . I 've found it to be fun no matter where you use it , though going uphill is especially tiring . I like the way it carves down hills , and it manages to pick up speed well . In terms of color , I 'd recommend this black one , as it is uncommon , and other people with wave will be awed by the pitch black . It 's also just plain cool!The only problem I have , is like may other users , The wheels run out very fast . If you do not plan to buy extra wheels , do not buy this ! The back wheel runs out much faster than the front , which leaves the ride feeling lopsided , leaning backward . The wheel does n't run totally out , it just grinds flat , and becomes slippery and hard to turn on . I have had the same wheels for about a month , and it works fine , except for the few problems mentioned above.Over all , Great product , But be ready to buy extra wheels .
 Your 9-13 year old son will love this product . It is easy to learn and fun to ride . Good exercize and my kids have never gotten hurt using it . It seems like the design makes it much safer than a skateboard .
 This board was a huge hit with my son . Smooth ride . Love the design . It has gotten many hours of use , and I 've even tried it ! Great board , and would definitely recommend .
 ... but would like a little change . It 's a little tricky to get use to the wiggle motion . Most people say that 's what they do n't like . I like the fact that your feet never touch the ground -LRB- unless you fall off ! -RRB- and you can make smooth turns.The Wave Ripple Junior Street Surfing Board-Little RippyGreat for smaller people .
 My son really likes his street surf board . He rides it a mile to and from school . All of his friends play with it and it seams to be holding up quite well . We did some reaseach and saved money buying ` The Wave ' on line . We saved money with tax and free shipping and he got the board he wanted .
 I bought this for my 10 year old and he has been having a blast with it . It rides very smoothly and once he got the hang of using it he has been skating all over the neighborhood practicing new tricks . He no longer uses his 4 wheel skateboard . Definitely recommend this for anyone who likes to skateboard .
 If this had been invented before the skateboard , the skateboard would never have been invented .
 hella good . takes a while to learn but carving down steep hills is worth it . I might want to recommend using both feet power evenly instead of just thrusting with the back . If you dont the rubber on the rear will run out easily -LRB- as with me w / already on my 3rd back wheel and still original front -RRB- Highly recommended board for carving .
 I 'm 26 and I 'm having a blast on this board ! It 's much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing , because you can just grab your board and go!I take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface . They recommend using small hills and stuff , but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline , so I prefer to stay on flat land . Its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground ! The board seems to be constructed fairly well . I 've gotten to the point where I can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively , its really fun trying to master it.I 'm curious if the Ripstik -LRB- competitor board -RRB- is better constructed since its made by Razor , and they might have put more money into the design . Anyways , I 've had mine for about 2 months , and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear . I 'll most likely have to replace them soon . I 'm kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels . That enables you to look for good deals on some wheels.I 'd also look around for the best deals on these boards . I got mine at a Sports Authority on sale for $ 80 , after having seen one at an FAO on my visit to Las Vegas for $ 130 . So , if you 're a fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along , I 'd definately recommend this ! It 's addicting !
 My 11 year old son has had the wave for the past 2 summers and loves it . In fact now we have 2 ! One for the shore & one for home ! The 1st summer he got it , it was so new that no one knew about it . When we were at the shore he had college kids stopping him asking him to try it and then proceed to go online to buy it.He 's even taken it to skate parks and the really good skate board kids want to try it ! Ironically he 's not a skateboarder - but he 's great at balancing . The best thing about this is that you do n't have to push with your feet - you can got uphill by just pedaling it!It does take sometime and perserverance to learn -LRB- my son it took about a day to go on it a little -RRB- but once you learn it 's so much fun and you can just keep getting better . This past summer was his 2nd summer with it and he 's still getting questions about it.It 's also very durable . He did n't wear his old one out they came out with better faceplates and we needed another one for our vacation home so my his ever indulging father bought him the 2nd - which is great so now he and his friend can wave together!By the way - the wave is the original the ripstick - which is a knockoff of the wave looks cheaper and not as sturdy . Why not go with the best!After having it for 2 summers it 's still his favorite toy ! And great physical exercise/activity !
 I bought this Skateboard for my son and it is not easy for beginners but when you get used to it is amazing . Kids can do things never thought for a traditional skateboard , as a recommendation try to buy a spare of wheels .
 My girlfriends `` hippy '' step-dad came home with one of these puppies one day and at first glance I thought it was some gimmick alternative to what a real skateboard should be . First let me say that boy was I wrong . I 'm a 245 pound guy and I can ride this thing smooth after about only a couple hours of practice and there 's a few reasons why I really love this toy . First of all , it can be quite intimidating once you get over the `` hope I do n't break my ankles bit '' but soon after you get moving you are riding such a smooth piece of engineering . The wave does at times feel like you are surfing or gliding over the cement . And once you have your balance and momentum right on it requires very little effort on your part to stay up and keep it moving.The second reason I like this is because you can ride it aggressively and actually put your whole body into propelling this thing . It 's a hip-rotation movement that makes this board move forward but if you want to go faster not only are you putting your hips and legs into it but you are also using your arms and shoulders . This full body workout keeps your heartrate up and really tires your whole body out which is a GREAT reason to ride this toy.I have n't quite figured out everything to riding this board but if you are looking for a new spin on skateboarding and would like to be a little adventurous then try one of these things out and then go and buy one.Have fun and good luck !
 Not since the first time I climbed on a large British parallel twin motorcycle have I had the same feeling of freedom and grace that I have experienced on this board . But let me back up -- I bought this as a present for my lady friend 's son . It turned out to be a little more than he could manage ; many kids under 15 are going to get discouraged if they are n't used to falling a few times and getting back up on their feet . To show him it was n't so hard , I got on it , and fell in love . It was hard to turn around -LRB- once I 'd gotten the hang -RRB- , get off it , and try to give him a turn.There is something innate in the handling and the wave-like motion . You do n't skate like on a skateboard -- you hula dance your way around town . Once I got on it I never wanted to stop -- I wanted to just surf down the sidewalk , away from the house , from the kid , from everything . It reminds you what is great about being a kid -- not just that you do n't hurt so bad when you fall , but that it is just so much easier to zip off down the street leaving everyone else behind . -LSB- 41 -RSB-
 This board is awesome !! It 's hard to get the hang of at first , but once you do , its a lot of fun ! It can be hard to balance when your first learning , so wear sneakers and a helmet !
 As a parent , the first reaction is `` this thing is going to kill my kids '' . Well , quite possibly , but ... What happens when you loose ballance as a raw beginer on a skateboard , is that the deck gets tippy , you start down , and the whole board accelerates out from under you as you crash to the ground . What happens with this thing , some of the time , is you get out of ballance and just lean the board on the ground , end of drama . In some cases 2 wheels are better than 4 .
 So it was the summer of 2006 I was walking in with my girlfriend in the park and saw this kid riding a two-wheeled skateboard . I went over to him pushed him off of it and took it . Well , not really . I actually went home and looked it up online . Found it for 129 on the home website then found it at sports authority for 99 with and had a coupon for an additional 40 percent off !! We purchased 1 then went back the same day and bought number 2 . We started off riding it on a shallow hill , and then started riding it on some steeper ground . I could n't believe how much it reminded me of riding my snowboard . Yea its a little nerve racking at first but definiteley worth the 99 . I now live by the beach in the south and can hardly ever snowboard `` the wave '' is my new fix !
 Both of my boys -LRB- 8 yo and 10 yo -RRB- got one of these for Christmas . Even on Christmas day , when it was very cold out , they got out and tried them . The older one picked it up very quick and is now really good on it . The younger one took a little longer to master it , but he 's got it now . They seem to be really well made , no complaints .
 My son really wanted a rip stick , but I couldnt justify the cost . We found this as an alternative . He is 9 and loves it . I thought it was going to be a little big for him when we got it , but after two days he had it mastered . He is very pleased with the board and I was pleased with the price .
 Thank you !!! When i ordered both waveboards-Checkered and Sketchy . . Right time-right place . . I got these boards at such a good price , got here quick and they were a hit at Christmas . . Free shipping too.WOW
 Its alot of fun and it has extra plastic under the edges where the board scratches on the ground . FYI the `` Rip Stick '' does not .
 I got this for my 16yr old son and he loved it !!! I still cant figure out how to ride it but all the kids around our neighborhood love it and I got it at a pretty good price .
 As always Amazons price and speed could n't be beat on this purchase . My son loves it and picked up riding it alot easier than I thought he would . Thanks again !!!
 This is a great product that my kids -LRB- and I -RRB- have enjoyed for countless hours so far . There is a learning curve , especially if you have not had much experience skating before . My eight-year-old is still trying to get the hang of it , but he is coming along . Amazon gave us a very good quality board at a great price and delivered it in plenty of time for Christmas , when other stores in my area were all sold out . I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves skateboarding , surfing , wakeboarding , or snowboarding .
 this was a christmas present for my 8 year-old son and he loves it the only thing is one of the wheel squeaks but other than that well worth the money .
 We got it for our granddaughter . She likes it just as well if not better than the ripstik she rides @ her mom 's .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .
 I chose this rating because the vest is exactly what I wanted!It is light-weight in feel yet keeps me warm when I need it !
 Gave this to my sister-in-law for CHristmas present . She loves it . Nice and soft , good fit . Washes up well too .
 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .
 I got this vest for my 90-year old Mom . It 's soft and a pretty pink , but most of all it keeps her nice and warm .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 I 've been using OR Nalgene carriers for 12-14 years , and they have gone all over the world with me , from down in the Amazon to 19,000 feet up the side of mountains . I typically carry these using a Petzl Spirit : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T2BSYQ/These are large enough to fit the velcro carry strap and still weave through molle gear or clamp on a 1.5 '' mountaineering or web-gear belt -LRB- or holster belt for those of you that use the same for your IPSC/IDPA rigs -RRB- . A larger carbiner like the Petzl locking biners actually fit the strap better : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000T29REY/But I find these a little too bulky and harder to weave into molle for EDC.These are by far my favorite Nalgene bottle carriers . These used to be even more solidly built - the top tension-strap spring-catch on the old ones hold much tighter , but they also break off easier . The new spring-catches do not seem to break off - but they do n't hold well and you regularly have to re-tighten them.FYI / / The Nalgene-brand carriers are poorly made & stitched . If you EDC them they start to fall apart > 1 year old . Best avoided unless you just plan to use them for your 2x/year , 5-mile hike , when you leave suburbia .
 Had an older version like 10 years ago and loved it . Just received my new one today and could n't be happier . Simple and does what it is supposed to do well .
 I purchased a lighter backpack to cut weight . Unfortunatley , the side pockets are impossible to reach , there 's just no way to do it without taking the pack off . They 're almost too tight for a Nalgene anyway.Water bladders are rediculous in most applications , so I wanted to keep my Nalgene or reuse Gatorade bottles for water.This tote works great ! The strong velcro keeps it on the hip belt nicely . It 's not as nice as simply using the side pockets of a pack if they 're accessible , but I guess I ca n't have everything.-1 star simply because the inside of the tote is a rubbery material , making it a lot more difficult to remove a 32oz Nalgene than necessary . A slicker material or slightly larger diameter would be perfect .
 This holds my water bottle while I 'm hiking . I wore mine out after several years and hundreds of miles , and was very glad to find it here on Amazon .
 I really like the mat , it is not slippery when doing the poses and like the thickness , not too thick .
 The first edition of my mat arrived two days ago . It was wrapped in cellophane with a small white outside sticker saying the mat is 74 '' long , as advertised . But the actual Hugger Mugger label , under the wrap , said the mat is 68 '' long . I did n't want to tear it open if it was the wrong item , so I called Amazon and asked about the discrepancy . The representative , who was otherwise very helpful , did n't understand the difference . She sent me a return label via e-mail and said the correct mat was on the way . So I sent the first one back . The replacement arrived today . Identical situation
 This mat 's color pretty much resembles the picture , a pastel green . Being 5 ' 9 '' , I love the length of the mat and have no problems with any poses . The thickness vs the weight is right-on for my needs . I would prefer something just a * little * more thicker for my knees , but I would n't want anything heavier for classes.The mat does tend to slip a little bit in the beginning , but it was n't too bad . You can just use a yoga towel if you tend to be a heavy sweater -LRB- I 'm not at all , and I only had slippage problems with my hands in downward dog -RRB- Overall , I think this was a nice mat at a great price .
 I bought this mat for my yoga class because I was tired of using the Lysol-covered school-provided ones . This was a huge improvement . It 's not too thick to cause imbalance but not so thin as to make you feel like your bones are rubbing against the floor . Plus the length -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 9 -RRB- is really good since I always end up doing a bunch of adjustments between poses like for downward dog , and you do move around laterally when you 're switching around and not a yogi , so I do n't find myself stepping back into my mat as much .
 The color is n't really olive , its more of a grass green and i have already managed to make some tiny tears on the surface . Even with those two issues , i really enjoy the mat .
 Had a smaller drain ina flat boat , this was the closest I could find to the one I had , they work great .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest

 I bought this knife for my 12 yr old niece for Christmas . She loved it .
 Bought one for my 12 yr old niece for Christmas . Bought 2 more for her older sisters , because they were threatening to steal hers ! Note
 Since I was stupid enough to not pack my older knife in checked baggage , I had to get another one . This one is slightly bigger than my old one , but I wanted one with some capability to measure this time . So I upgraded a bit to this model , and it does exactly what I need . However , I still do n't know what to do with a cuticle pusher ...
 Bought this for wife as a stocking stuffer . I 'm sure she 'll enjoy backing her team without taking up the whole window .
 My Husband was throughly pleased to find this in his stocking for Christmas and uses it all the time , it is a perfect compliment to have everything he needs in one handy little knife . No problems loading onto the computer and even better to transport a little bit of work to home . The light is not bright so that seems to be the only problem with this product otherwise , a perfect gift .
 I ordered these stopwatches for a summer class . I wanted different colors , I wanted a good price , I wanted to save on shipping -- I got it all . Plus , the stopwatches do work well , which I have since learned from online orders does not happen every time ! These stopwatches seem to be somewhat sturdier than the stopwatches I 've seen with the transparent plastic covers . The kids used them for a few activites , and I raffled them off after the class was over . The quality is much better than another group of stopwatches I ordered for my second session of class . If I had known what a difference in quality there is among the products out there , I certainly would have done this order again .
 I have been wearing these socks for years . They last for years , which is saying something when your a wildland fire fighter on a Hotshot Crew . Very comfortable and extra padding in all the right places , even for ten inch boots !
 My son loves the sandles . He said they were very comfortable . He took them to college and its winter time .
 i lost the original pair i had , they were a gift.Very comfortable . I replaced them at Amazon . great price and they look good.you will not regret them
 nice for outdoor use , not everyday footwear . will buy another pair when necessary .
 This is a nice sandal that can be worn just about anywhere in the house.It is very comfortable . It is very light and durable . I use it after I shower and sometimesI forget I have them on . The price is affordable but well worth it .
 Thank you for the speedy and quality product that I gave to my Dad for Father 's Day . It was a great little present that made him very happy .
 The product was just what I needed . I got it for my mom for Mother 's Day and she was so excited ! A great gift for any die hard Sox fan . And the seller was much less expensive than other sites .
 We ordered this item as a Christmas gift for my fiance 's godson who is a huge Tony Stewart fan ! While there are LOTS of racing products on the market it 's difficult to find age appropriate items the young man does n't already have decorating his bedroom . This was perfect . We were able to us the cooler/lunchbox as a creative wrapping for other small gifts as well . The turnover in shipping was speedy too .
 my wife love 's tony and she had been looking for a lunch box -LRB- does n't need much -RRB- she just loved this cooler it is well made and look 's great .
 Yes , they are expensive - but they hold up . This is one sock that I 've been able to pass along in my family . These are great for tennis , or any other sport where the kids can use extra support and padding . We love our Thorlos .
 Our 7 year old son loves these socks . They are very comfy and do n't wear like other socks . He loves running , running , running . Buy them and you wo n't be disappointed at all . They are well worth the $ .
 It is a great accessory for any Naruto fan , it fits perfect and was shipped very fast and got here on time . I love it .
 The first day I wore this to school , almost 10 people said they thought it was cool ! I love this wristband a lot < 3
 I bought this for my Naruto-obsessed 9 year-old . He wears it constantly . One of the studs came loose the first night he had it , but he still wears it .
 So I actually bought one of these for my boyfriend , we both love naruto , but I have yet to give it to him xDI love this little thing so much!It is FOR SURE not cheaply made.I ordered one of these before from another company and it fell apart the first day i was at Anime Land Wasabi . It said it had a metal plate on it but it was really plasticWEEEELLLLL with this one its for sure a metal plate . this thing is AMAZINGDo n't even look anywhere else for a better one because you wont find any better.Just click `` add to cart ''
 I love this wrist band so much . The only thing I do n't like is how if you bend the metal to form your wrist , you can see bends in it and it does n't look good . I ended up just flattening it again and having it slightly bent . I have a really small wrist so since it is n't bent all the way around , my wrist looks even smaller . I originally bought this to play tennis with but my coach said he did n't know what would happen if it was a sunny day and it might not be allowed in matches . I thought I could just play with it with the metal plate on the inside of my wrist but I ended up deciding to take it off and not take my chances . I bought two for tennis but since I ca n't wear them , I 'll just wear one around school because it still looks really cool ! So if you plan on buying this to wear during a sport , you may get called on to take it off since the metal is reflective . If not , it still looks cool to wear around town and school which is what I do now . The wrist band comes in a pack of one , so if you want one for each wrist , buy 2 .
 I got this for my brother , who loves Naruto . And if you 're an anime lover , you know how awesome it feels to own something that resembles a prop from your favorite anime . -- this is perfect for that , especially since Naruto wears it himself .
 A nice little wristband to have . What more can I say ... . I will buy again when the time comes .
 This is only one wristband , so be sure to order one for each wrist.This is actually sweatband material with a metal plate attached . I had to `` bend/form '' the metal plate so that it rounded more to my son 's wrist . As long as you are applying gentle pressure , the metal wo n't make a `` crease '' . My 10 year old loves them .
 excelent product met all my expectations ... ...
 My sons 7-18 all love these items , Naruto is the latest anime craze ... hit at school and with friends !!!
 Exactly as advertised . If you 're a Naruto nut , or like wristbands , I 'd advise buying this
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 Here we go Steelers , Here we go !!! Nuff said ... GO STEELERS !!
 great feeling gloves , I sweat alot and these gloves still hold up great , this is the fourth pair i have purchased in the last 3yrs . i still have 3 pair in great shape ... Mizuno needs to keep making this glove
 Not a bad glove for the price . If you are just looking for something to use recreationally -LRB- ie
 This is denetly a must have ... . very comfortable , cool looking and resistant , GREAT PRODUCT ALL AROUND .
 We have been looking for a good pair of batting gloves that will last more than a week and keep my son from getting blisters . This is the glove . It protects the heels of his hands better than anything else we 've tried .
 There was a significant improvement on my swing using these gloves . The grip is great and my control of the bat improved tremendously .
 solid quality and construction.it should be noted , however , that these are n't magnetic like most of the other ones you will find on amazon.com . if your not used to it , it can take some getting used to.i use lamp fluid as fuel .
 But ... Difficult to use . I 've used what I learned to call `` Crystal Stix '' -LRB- just the brand of the ones I bought when I was younger -RRB- over the years , and I 'm pretty good with them . The Fire Devil Sticks , however , are much much harder to use . I played around with them a bit to shake the rust of the hinges and remember how to use them . To my dismay it seemed as if I were no good at them anymore . Upon digging out my old Crystal Stix , I realized that I still knew what I was doing , it was just much harder with the Fire Sticks . I can only attribute this to the foil wrapping vs having the rubber on the batton itself . The way it 's wrapped creats a sort of spiral rivet , which will force the baton out of a natural spin and make it roll the way the foil goes , which can be a pain in the ass . Regardless , I became impatient and decided to light them up and give it a go . I did alright , did n't burn myself or anyone else . On a concrete slab I was n't concerned about dropping them -LRB- which happened several times , of course -RRB- . The flames slow it down quite a bit , BUT it 's a very fun and intense feeling to be tossing the flaming baton around , that 's for sure . Just know that it can be dangerous , and try to be SAFE and SMART when using them .
 I 've now been using these for awhile now and these are the best fire devilsticks you 'll find out there . Very sturdy quality and burn beautifully . I recommend them .
 This cooler goes everywhere with me . It has a great design with a front pocket . It is large enough to fit several smaller glad wear containers or 6 cans of soda .
 Finally , a cooler big enough to hold a lunch . It has a good top for easy retrieval . It keeps things cold -LRB- if you add ice bricks -RRB- .
 I spent the weekend camping in Desoto State Park near Forte Payne Alabama . The Teton 4 footprint attached securely to the bottom of my tent and I would recomend it to anyone who wants to preserve their teton 4 for future use.Marshall
 The yellow fill sticks around longer then some paintballs . The shell is quite impressive in color . Too bad the fill isnt the same irridescent glimmer . But I am pleased . No complaints
 magnet sticks to car . hope jets turn season around . i do n't know what else to write because it 's a magnet .
 I bought these for my husband to decorate his car when he goes to tailgate . They are a good size for his SUV doors .
 I have one for a .22 and one for a .410 . I used Hoppe 's and patches for 60 years and to do it right took about ten minutes . A bore snake does the job perfectly in less than a minute . Just one pass and the bore is clean . Just the thing for those of us concerned with saving time and money . If they get too dirty just wash them and they 're like new . Sometimes new technology is really worth it .
 The BoreSnake makes cleaning a much faster task , and that 's a good thing especially when not at home with my work bench and gear . The ` Snake goes in my range bag and heads out on trips with me to be the primary cleaner when away from home.I used this first on .223 / 5.56 AR-15 and must say that it was an extremely tight fit - so much so that I was worried about damage to the chrome lined barrel . After reading more on the ` net I put a ton more gun oil on and that helped a lot . Still have to give it a very strong pull through the barrel , but it seems to do a very good job.Still give my firearms a good rod & patch cleaning at home every once in a while , but the ` Snake will do in between those times .
 Bought this fella for my hardcore Auburn fan of a husband ... he has the guy sitting on his desk at work . . LOVES IT . This is a great gift little smaller than I imagined but perfect
 I ordered two of these for Christmas gifts . They are sooo adorable I ordered two more ! They are on the smaller size , but I actually ordered one for a friend as a kinck-knack to put on a shelf/desk as opposed to outside . Great deal for the price !
 This was a Christmas present for a colleague and she loved it . It was really cute and the price was just right .
 I got this garden gnome and the female version for my very hard to shop for Mother and Stepfather for Christmas this year . They - and I - loved them both . They 're even better than described and the transaction was quick and easy . Love these !
 My teens were breaking racquets every time they played . -LRB- boys will be boys -RRB- I got 4 of these last year and 3 of them survived the whole summer . The double shaft design keeps the head in place and not wobbly . I 'll have to get a couple more this year . These are less expensive and last much longer than ones you find at sporting goods stores .
 Although this racquet is a little heavy it has withstood the punishing that my two kids have dished out to it unlike many other racquets I have purchased . It might not be suitable for tournament play but it is perfect for casual backyard use .
 My Husband and I have a huge picnic every year on the 4th of July and every year we have to purchase new Badminton racquets because they get destroyed . This year I decided to search for racquets that might survive this event and I found them . The Double Shafted Racquets are strong and very durable and survived to see another year.Not only were they durable but they were a great value and came quickly .
 Durable and well made . The handle tape does wear but they all do . These have stayed strong , both the shaft and the strings . Worth the money . I would purchase again .
 Thse rackets are very good for the price . Ours get lots of use with the kids and grandkids . I did note that the wrapping on the handle on two of the rackets is already starting to come off though . They can probably be retaped .
 I have had these for a few months now and they are not broken yet its a miracle . One is slightly bent but when i beat the kids in a game they are poor sports and throw the rackets , etc. . The double barrel design is pretty good . I 'm gon na buy more ...
 This is the best all-around fishing lure of all time . It casts excellently , hence the name , it works at various retrieve speeds , can jig or behave as the finest spoon and it wags it 's tail on retrieve , rides low or high . I have caught more large fish on this lure than anything else , ever . It 's been around a long time and has my highest level of confidence . But the price plus shipping for this item as listed is almost $ 20 for a 1/8 oz lure . There 's a link to an article about investing in precious metals on here too , and I have asked myself many times , upon losing one or buying another , the following question
 i bought this taget as it being my first , and it is pretty impressive . all the bullets stick to it no matter what the fps . it is very sturdy , so you cant knock the target over if u shoot close . and it is inexpensive , and long lasting . i would only get it if u have more than one gun , or else it begins to get boring . there are many uses for it , such as aiming , and if its a new gun , u can set up the accuracy . the only bad thins are that if you hit a bullet that was on the target already , the bullet shatters and you can not tell wer it hit . another bad thing is , the gel bad can get dirty , which causes the bullets to fall of quickly after hitting , but that is easily fixed by a quick rinse off and dry . overall , this is one of the best targets u can buy .
 This is a really good target . it is pretty big . when you first get it it helps to remove the gel and clean it off with water and put it back . you have to make sure there is no space between the foam and the gel or else the bbs will just stick for a fiw seconds and fall off . i have a 300 somthing gun and it makes little marks on the gel , a less powerful gun might not do this even though it dos n't effect anything .
 Remained sticky long after my airsoft gun broke . Perfect size to hold a cat against its will . Simply place cat back first onto target , and keep off the ground !
 larger than i expected and lasts for a long time , easy to clean , and a fun target to practice your aim .
 I purchased these spurs for a horse that had never had them used on him . They are the perfect spurs to teach a horse what this new aid means . Gave just enough push , without making him crazy . HIGHLY recommended .
 My 4 year old does not know how to swim . We took this on vacation and by the end of the week he was holding his breath , diving off the side of the pool and we even experimented without the vest . This vest gave him the right amount of bouyancy and confidence in the pool . I highly recommend it .
 good value , floats well , very visible . My 4 year old son wears this in the ocean , easy to zip , soft material , just great
 My 2 year old toddler loves it . It gives her a lot of confidence and unlike some other vests , it keeps her head sufficiently above the water , without the vest rising up to her face . It 's bright colors and streamlined look is appropriate for both boys and girls . I threw a pool party lately and was able to share this vest with a slim 7 year old boy . I believe we 'll get a lot of use out this .
 I got this for my toddler who liked water but was n't very balanced yet . He tended to fall forward when walking through the kiddie pool . This vest gave him confidence to just jump into the deeper pool -LRB- with me catching of course -RRB- and walk through the kiddie pool with ease . The vest does not keep his head out of the water but it provides the floatation he needs to help him right himself in the water .
 My daughter loved it . Had trouble with the zipper , vest was replaced with no hassel .
 My 2 1/2 year old was reluctant to wear a more restrictive , firmer vest I had used with my other children , which had the tendency to turn him over to float on his back . This Speedo vest is comfortable to wear and keeps him afloat . He is very happy to put it on and to keep it on even while playing outside of the pool -LRB- a big plus ! -RRB- . The only thing that is less than perfect is that his face sits pretty low to the water so if there is a lot of activity in the pool he tends to get some water in his face . However , the vest does seem to encourage him to `` swim '' so overall I am pleased with this product and would recommend it highly .
 First off for anyone who does not read the item 's description PLEASE note : ***** THIS IS NOT A LIFE JACKET ***** Ok that said -LRB- no I knew what I was buying , I just want to make sure that others do as well -RRB- this is really good for making children comfortable in the water with it on . They are able to paddle themselves around the pool with a little assistance at first -LRB- children are very top-heavy and toddlers ' heads will tend to pull themselves over into the water -RRB- and then independently.I dock it a star for two reasons

 My son wanted his own yoga mat to do yoga with us . I picked this mat because I have a Hugger Mugger and have been very happy with it.This mat did not disappoint . While the material is thinner at 1/8 '' -LRB- compared to 1/4 '' for the thicker adult types -RRB- it `` feels '' proportionate for the mat 's size and a child 's weight . The material is still much higher quality than the typical mat you see at a big box store and provides better support , cushion , and grip even at the same thickness . It seems to be the EXACT same material as the adult Mandara . It stays in place as well as any mat I 've seen and the surface grips without being sticky . I also do P90 on my Mandara and the material feels very good , simultaneously providing firm support and cushion.At a fairly standard 24 '' width and 60 '' length the size is a nice blend of being easy for a child to move and take little room to set up but large enough that a kid who is 6 or 8 years old will have years of use before they outgrow it . My experience with Hugger Mugger mats is that they will easily last for years of casual use with decent care taken of them so if you expect your now-little one to pass 5 feet in the next year or two I 'd recommend getting an adult size . They also resist dirt and sweat amazingly well and wash easily when the need does come.Because this is the same material as my adult-size 1/4 '' Mandara I expect it to hold up about as well . It is not prone to what I can only describe as dry cracking that cheap mats can start to pick up after 6-12 or maybe 12-18 months . A Hugger Mugger is a very nice mat you will be able to enjoy for a LONG time .
 I got this bike for my son when he was 3 1/2 . He learned to ride on it and rode it almost every day all summer long . Now it 's winner and he still asks to ride it . He is turning 4 and is tall for his age . He is outgrowing it . Perfect for 3 year olds or smaller 4 year olds . As a parent I appreciate that this bike is not decorated with a licensed character , yet the kids still think it 's `` cool '' .
 This bike is everything we expected . It is a great little bike for our son , he just loves it .
 A requirement for cleaning primer pockets . I use it in a screwdriver handle and it works great . I have one for small primer pockets also .
 These really work great at cleaning primer pockets . After some use they do tend to break - the wires start spinning inside the holder and wo n't clean the pockets anymore . They are great while they do work .
 This is the best face mask you 'll ever own ; great fit , no leak , full vision , what more can you ask for ? I have tried 4 types of masks before purchasing this one and I have since purchased 2 more and 1 for a friend.I swim everday and this mask holds up well and never leaks if you keep if fairly clean .
 I am used to a dive mask so these were easy to get used to . I hated how traditional swim goggles left that annoying ring and I am not a racer so the extra drag does n't bother me . They are great . After I bought them , my mother and father got a pair for them as well . They enjoy them and my dad gets more use out of them than I do now .
 This works the best . I have taken swimming as my main workout for I do believe that I come from the water -LRB- The Toadies ... `` I come from the water '' , hot song ! -RRB- . My issue with regular goggles seemed to be that sooner or later some water would enter the eyes area . Also the small window in which you are allowed to see . With the Mask I am much more happier . First , it covers a much bigger area and the seal aspect is more complete . No more aggravation in the middle of a lap when some unwanted water disturbs the flow of activity . Very impressed with the results and could n't be happier . They adjust very well and actually pretty tight so no water is welcome . Like night and day from using conventional goggles to using this kind of mask . Rather surprised with how efficient they are , highly recommended for anyone who prefers a full mask instead of the much smaller goggles . Pretty good item and it deserves a 4.5 ! Speedo Rift Swim Mask -LRB- Navy/Clear -RRB- .
 I purchased this product because I have a mask with a nose piece that does n't fit well . this mask fits me the best -LRB- high cheek bones -RRB- and works very well . I really like the grey colored lenses . I used them in my pool to check different areas as well as swim in them . My triplet grandchildren who are 3.5 years old also are learning how to swim using regular speedo goggles .
 Nice addition for backpacking/camping . Something to add to your backpack for a quick reference check on direction . Sturdy , durable , easy to use .
 I love this key chain compass and I had one and been using it for 15 years.After 15 years the compass still work great - I think it will last indefinetely.But the thermometer is another story . It will fall off in a few weeks - watchout for that.I would use like supper glue to glue it back on
 The compass part has yet to fail me , although the thermometer fell off in about a week which was kind of a bummer . I keep it on my keychain and i bike so it gets beat on a bit so i 'm not too surprised about the thermometer part . good overall , but would n't buy it again . Hope this helps .
 This is a high quality license plate . The emblem is raised . I actually use it on my car and it does n't show any wear after over a year of being proudly displayed .
 This gnome is delightful , though like the other reviewer says , it is small.I bought it for my gnome obsessed UGA graduate boyfriend , and he loves it.The gnome feels sturdy , like you can toss him around without being too concerned about breaking him , so I 'm sure if you wanted your gnome outside , this one could stand up to it . It 's actually a pretty nice little gnome , especially for the price . -LRB- Look around , people , gnomes are pretty pricey . -RRB-
 I gave this as a birthday Gift for a Georgia Alum ... it is in her front yard here in Big Orange Country !!
 My neghbor is a graduate of Georgia and still attends all the home games . This little guys keeps a watch on his dogs .
 My dad loved it -LRB- got my mom the florida gator cheerleader gnome to go with it -RRB- . Detail is nice and the paint job looks good . I forgot to check if it was solid or not but it is hefty for it 's size so I 'm assuming it 's solid until I get to check it out next time we go to my folks . The size is the only reason I did n't give it 5 stars . I knew full well it was only a foot tall when I ordered it so I was n't shocked when it arrived I just wish they made one that was 18 or 24 &#34; tall so it would be more prominent in the flower bed .
 This was a gift for a Go Dawgs ! fan . . it was a hit . They are on the small side but the description tells you that so read folks . Great for inside or outside and i bought the pair because everybody needs somebody :-RRB- plus it was a better deal at the time .
 UGA Garden Gnome ... I thought it was a joke , but the family loved it ! I bought two ... one was to be squirelled away til Christmas , but I was convinced it needed to be out and about for the football season . Go DAWGS !
 So Cute , small enough to put on your desk . My husband brought his to work and keeps it on his desk .
 Finding the `` right '' leggings is almost as difficult as finding the right bra or swimsuit or pair of jeans ! The price of my favorite leggings shot up to $ 29.95 since the last time I bought them , so this time I bought four different kinds to test . Herein , I shall review all five options . As a point of reference , I am 5 ' 7 '' and weight 137 pounds . Black leggings are a staple in my wardrobe ; I wear them all the time .1 . Athletica `` City Lights '' ***** -LRB- five stars -RRB- Hands down , my favorites . Length , cut , and fit are all absolutely perfect . But as of this writing , the price is $ 29.95 for a pair . Leggings just should n't cost $ 30 ! 2 . Moontree `` Cotton Spandex Jersey Legging '' **** The length is good . The waist is in the right place . The cut is good . But something about these leggings makes me feel like `` this is what wearing Spanx must feel like '' . They are snug , but not in a way that makes me feel like I 'm wearing the wrong size . It feels like the snugness is part of the design , like in control-top pantyhose . -LRB- Remember those ? -RRB- Only the snugness is in the entire pair of leggings , calf to waist . They look great , but frankly they are almost a relief to peel off at the end of the day . And leggings just should n't feel that way . To me , one of the huge advantages of leggings is their comfort ; it 's like wearing a second skin . Still at $ 12.99 the price is right and they do look good .3 . Anne Klein `` Women 's Cotton Leggings '' **** I expected less from these leggings because the waist band is nearly twice as wide as what I 'm used to . It turned out not to bother me at all ! The fit is perfect . Length and waist are great . But the leggings started pilling almost immediately ! Usually , if I run my hands over my leggings , everything feels smooth . Within an hour of the first wearing -LRB- I washed them first -RRB- , these leggings had pervasive pilling . Still , they look great , feel good , and they are only $ 15.4 . Doublju `` Women 's Stylish Casual Ankle Cotton Span Leggings '' * The name of these leggings makes me wonder if there 's such a thing as formal leggings ! The waist is low . No , thanks . I want my leggings to stay put . I returned this pair .5 . Spalding `` Women 's Ankle Legging '' * I returned this pair also . The waist band was about two inches wide -LRB- ! -RRB- , yet the elastic inside the waist band was only about one centimeter wide . Picture that ! Anyway , because of the thin waistband which only looked seriously oversized , as I moved around the waistband pretty much went wherever it wanted . Thanks , but I like my leggings to stay put !
 I got my order in the mail today , fast delivery . I tried them on , and found the medium size to be a tab bit long . I am 5 '11 180 pounds . They are comfortable , and imo a good buy . Rated 4 instead of 5 stars due to the length .
 I have a closet with leggings from the best makers and these out-shine all of them . I love them so much that I 've gone back three times and bought more . These go all the way to the ankle instead of 3 inches above . They 're perfect !
 Finally , full-length leggings that are actually cut long ! Material is soft but still sturdy . I really love these and plan to buy more !
 I am very pleased to have ordered this item . it is to my satisfation.Womens Cotton Spandex Leggings by Athletica in your choice of color
 Great leggings without having to go store to store looking for the longer version instead of the `` capri '' version . Fast delivery . Second time I 've order from seller and will order from them again .
 Product is good but the small leggings are a bit on the large size . The leggings are soft and have good spring to them . They are white but not see thru . I will order again .
 I purchased these to have something to wear on cold days under my skirts and dresses . They were perfect and keep me warm when I have bus duty or have to be outside with my students .
 Best leggings I have ever purchased . These are perfect thickness , easy to put on & held up to the test of puppy claws jumping up on my legs with no snags . I am purchasing another pair after this review .
 I got theses today , they are gr8 , I am almost 5 ' 8 , these go to the ankles , I ordered the large , they are the perfect length , and although I have not worn them out yet , they seemed to me to fit like a glove , I will definitely get more of them , too , thanks to all the girls who gave a review , you were absolutely correct .
 Leggings look reasonably well , and are of a reasonable quality.If you are looking for something lightweight for the summer , or towear here in South Florida , these are for you.They tend to be a little bit long and if you are not particularly tall , -LRB- I am 5 ' 5 '' and stocky right now -RRB- you might have to shorten them.But for the money , they are still a great deal , if you do n't needsomething thick and short.So far they have lasted in the wash . . but I have n't been washing them forthat long to really give a good recommendation on that.I will come back and post again , if I find them to be flimsy in thewashing department .
 Great fit & quality , and other reviews noting they run rather long in the leg , 100 % correct and I could n't be happier about it . Normally , as I am tall , the leggings end up as capris , but not THIS pair ! Perfect for my yoga and pilates as well as pole exercise .
 These legging are pretty OK . However , they are SO long it seems they are for an 8 foot woman . I am average height and I have to roll up the bottoms which is not that bad they just look kinda funny . Also , the crotch is just a plain seam - no triangle sewed in for better comfort . You get what you pay for though ! Good price and American made .
 This product is great . For the price , the product is top quality . Thick , comfortable , and they are long enough to easily cover my ankles -LRB- which many leggings do n't . Thanks for a great buy !
 Being of an age to have seen leggings regarded as high fashion for the 2nd time around now -LRB- the first time was in the early 90s -RRB- , these are truly some of the BEST I 've ever owned . I got 2 pair and am so glad I did ! This wardrobe staple is true to size and fits PERFECTLY all the way from just below the navel down to the top of the foot . They 're very stretchy with a higher lycra % than most cotton spandex leggings you 'll find , and they 're well made of a quality material that is thick enough to give terrific coverage yet light enough to stay put and remain extremely cool in all weather . But as always , leggings are NOT trousers , so pairing them with a long tunic or a dress is recommended . And eventhough they are not at all see-through , `` phantoming through '' will happen when you bend over at the gym , so you 'll probably want to choose undergarments that provide the desired amount of coverage and are of a solid flesh-tone . :-RRB- They launder nicely on the gentle cycle and with tumble drying on low or cool . It was an OUTSTANDING shopping experience with this seller , too !!! A +
 Ordered these white leggings in Large . Received promptly . Nice fabric . Fit is close but not snug , with easy stretch and no `` baggy knees '' . Would purchase again .
 Exactly what I was looking for , and made of nice strong material , very comfy . I wear them alot , and they still show now wear .
 My very persnickety teenage daughter loves these . I am going to have to buy another pair for her . She wears them around the house as comfy lounge pants , under her jeans like long-underwear -LRB- she gets cold easy ! -RRB- , and in a few weeks when a dance style PE class starts up , she 'll be wearing them for that . She 's not inclined to wear as such , but they would work well with a long sweater or tunic top . A nice mid-weight material .
 These leggings are longer than most , which I appreciate . They are softer than most , which I appreciate . Besides that they are pretty costly for what they are They are fairly thin , which I find disappointing . At $ 30 a pair I wo n't be buying more . I 'm 5 ' 5 @ 150lbs . and a large was perfect so I would say they are true to size . I would recommend them if you can afford the cost for leggings that are already nearly see thru on arrival .
 These are comfortable and what they look like . I am short so there is a bit extra length , which I expect with most pants I buy . They are easy to wash . I wear them to yoga - and they are perfect there .
 designed for a real woman - ample stretch , good fit and sturdy fabric ! will be ordering more of these soon
 Very well made and warm ! They are true to size . You do not need to order larger than you normally would .
 These are so softy and comfy ... I can wear them with my boots or as a pj bottom ! So versitile ... we also ride motorcycles in the winter and they go so well under my jeans ! Love these !!!
 Thanks for offering Prime ! The material is fairly soft and true to size . Not loose around the legs , and plenty opaque enough that your underwear does to show through ; quite thickish material . Pretty good quality material .
 Legging slightly heavier than the grey version . Wore on a cooler day , 75 degrees.This company is very user friendly .
 I bought my leggings from Lands End for years , but they recently stopped carrying them . It has been very difficult to find a replacement anywhere , until I tried these out of desperation . They are a very suitable replacement at about 1/3 the price.I wore a medium from Lands End and the medium size of this product fits perfectly . These are longer than the Lands End leggings and that 's good for me . These have 2 % less spandex , but have plenty of stretch and recovery . These are not as heavy , but look great and appear to be just as durable.I 'm giving these the top rating because the value is good . At this price I can order in large quantities and always have nice leggings at hand .
 I 've been wearing leggings for years , and am alway looking for something that 's comfortable and will withstand the test of time . Do n't know yet if these leggings will last -LRB- since I just got them -RRB- , but they appear to be well-made . As other reviewers point out , these leggings are on the thin -LRB- material -RRB- side , but I actually like that . I 'm thinking I can wear these through more seasons , not just winter . One thing that surprised me , though , was the shipping cost . While the leggings are a great deal at at less than 10 bucks each , the shipping cost -LRB- to my home in Ohio -RRB- was $ 7.95 .
 Made in America . Priced right . Perfect thickness and tight fit . Excellent for working out , yoga , pilates , around the house or even for layering . They are basic but they are not cheaply made or lacking quality.cons
 Great value for the price
 The last reviewer is right . I searched and searched for leggings that were long enough for my 5 ' 10 '' frame . These are perfect . The legs are plenty long enough . I am very happy with these .
 I just bought these , have worn and washed once . So far so good . they are a little light weight , but I got them to wear under long tops , sweaters and skirts , so that is fine . they fit very nice . I have a problem with things being too short from waist to crotch , these fit . They are also long enough in the leg . I am happy with them and hope they hold up for a long time !
 Excellent product , delivered in record time . Thank you ! Will order some of these leggings for my sister .
 Though these pants are n't the warmest for cold weather by themselves , they are great for layering and hopefully summer wear . The material is not too thick and not too thin , and it fits comfortably - not tight at all . The waistband is very snug , and the shipping was very fast ... most likely the reason for the high shipping and handling costs .
 My order arrived 2 days early and it is worth the purchase ! They fit perfectly and the material feels comfortable !! I will order another very soon .
 Finally a great legging ... These leggings fit so well , they have the best &#34; coverage &#34; , as far as covering up winter pale , ugly veins , etc. . I 'm only 5 ' 3 &#34; , so I can bring them down under my heel if I want ... or leave them at my ankle ... they are designed so well and are have such a great fit , you can do that and they still feel wonderful and look the same . They have a wonderful silky texture , so clothing does n't hang up on them as you move .
 I will order more . They keep their shape , they fit true to size , they are soft and comfortabole . they are not sheer at all , oi ordered them in heather but will be ordering more olors . mine ripped in the crotch but i have washed them at least 100 times and also i 'm basically sure that they ripped because i was rough housing with my toddler and tried to be funny and do the splits . i dont think it was a defect in the pants .
 GREAT ... FITS ME VERY WELL ... I HAVE THIN LEGS BUT THE PRODUCT ADAPTS TO THAT . LIKE THE WEIGHT TOO . WISH I HAD MORE COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM . LAUNDERS WELL TOO .
 These leggings are just as described . The delivery was very quick and the leggings are so comfy . I put them on right away and have been loving them all day ! They feel soft and have n't sagged on the knees or butt after a whole day 's wear . Would definitely recommend .
 I 've had these leggings for about 2 months now . I wash on gentle and hang dry -LRB- like I do all these types of things as it makes them last so much longer -RRB- . They do sit a little below the waist , but that seems to be the current style and it 's not too low . The legs are long which is great for me because most leggings are too short and then my ankles get cold . Not with these ! I do n't wear them barefoot , so do n't know if the long length would be a problem . I really like the price , and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition . I wish I 'd bought two of them as I sleep in them as well . Recommended .
 These are some of the most comfortable leggings I 've had in a very long time . They are long enough so that when you sit or bend over - they do n't feel like they are riding up . They fit comfortably and do n't sag at the knees after wearing all day . Love these to just lounge around and work around the house in .
 7/2/12I am a plus size lady and I needed to find some leggings that fit me . I had found some at Layne Bryant for around $ 30 but after one use it had a hole in it . So I returned it because the quality was absolutely ridiculous . I was not going to spend $ 30 on cheap material that wont even last a day of use.So I came on amazon because lets face it , they have everything on here . Looked up some XL Leggings and what do you know they had it for HALF the price . I bought it and when I received the leggings they fit fine . Longer than I would have liked to have them but hey I 'm only 5 ' 5 '' . I have been wearing them for weeks and no sign of wear or tear yet . Much better quality for a much better price . The plus size stores are a rip off and just take your money for poor quality goods.These will do you just fine and they are great once you break them in . : -RRB- 11/9/12Follow up : I still have the leggings they have not torn or shrunk . Minor fading but nothing major . They wash just fine and the seams are still in tacked . I wear my leggings very often like maybe 4 days out of the week and sometimes I sleep in them . They are still working just fine and I am having no issues with them whatsoever.I am surprised however to see that the price doubled . I do not approve of people increasing the price of a product just because they can . We have enough inflation as is on thing that we cant not live without . : / I wish I had bought a few pairs cause now the price is to high for my taste . I think around $ 16 was a fair price $ 30 is a steep price for leggings . I suppose if you desperately need a pair that fit then it may be worth it . However , the importance of leggings varies depending on the person . If you have the money go for it . If you are poor like me look around for a more affordable pair lol . Just being honest . : P
 These leggings are nice and pretty good quality . They are not see-through unless you buy them too small . Mine fit perfectly . The legs are a little long -LRB- and I 'm 5 ' 8 -RRB- but I like them that way . Good quality . Really like them .
 The leggings are well made and fit well -- actually , perfectly . I ordered them about a week ago and am wearing them now . They match the quality of leggings sold at twice the price . They 're comfortable and look great . I 'm very pleased with the quality and speed of delivery -- and will doubtless order another pair before the really cold weather arrives.They must be great if they make me look forward to winter with pleasure !
 After a couple of failed attempts with other brands , I found this one . An Amazon notice popped up saying I 'd ordered this product from them years ago and sure enough they are the same product . I still have several of the older ones but after years of daily use , the occasional mishap with bleach and eventual fading , I wanted fresh new leggings that fit the same way . I had found another brand I liked but when I went to order more , they were sized differently , short in length and I the crotch , very uncomfortable , sent back 10 pairs at $ 20 each , Spiegel claimed they never got them . $ 200 gone forever . I 'll never shop with Spiegel again . These , on the other hand , fit beautifully , just the way they made them years ago . Long , thin , high waisted . Beautiful ! Sexy around the house with a tank top or under a skirt in public . A great extra layer under pants for those of us who get cold easily . I ordered 10 and may order 10 more . I love them !
 I bought several pairs of these leggins nearly 2 years ago . Even with weekly washing and drying , they are in great shape . The keep me warm , as I 'm the cold blooded type . They do n't sag or creep . Will be ordering more.Update
 I really like these pants . I use them as long johns so it is important that they fit tight without a bulky waistband . I 'm about to order several more pair and toss my old ones from the 90 's that are full of holes . -LRB- Until I found these , they were the best I could do ! -RRB-
 Perfect thickness and tight fit . Excellent for working out . They are of good quality and look good as well !
 These leggins are good quality and hard to find where I live . I will order more .
 These are nice leggings...light-to-medium thickness ... perfect for Spring and Summer in areas with moderate to hot climates . I have thicker thighs and , even though these are n't the thickest leggings , the coverage is adequate . I have n't had them long enough to comment about their durability , but they appear to be well-made , so my fingers are crossed for them to last a while . So I 'd consider these leggings a good value .
 These Cotton Spandex Leggings are comfortable and seem to hold up well after washing . Overall , I am satisfied with this purchase .
 solid color , a little show through on the butt area however they are thick enough to not be mistaken for stockings .
 leggings , boots and long shirts are my winter uniform , so i have several pair . These are my favorite because they are LONG enough - legs and crotch , NOT TOO BIG IN THE WAIST like several other -LRB- cheaper and more expensive -RRB- pair that i seem always to be `` pulling up '' , NICE LOOKING , WELL MADE , and the most COMFORTABLE . i bought the black ones and am ordering dark gray . sure wish they had more -LSB- dark -RSB- colors !
 These are terrific leggings because of the cotton/spandex combination . I am living in them this winter .
 I was very happy with my purchase of this t-shirt . It arrived in the expected time . The shirts do run a little large though . I normally wear a men 's small and this men 's small is quite baggy on me . Other than that it is a great product .
 This is the perfect bike for a young new rider . When buying a bike we looked forever and found the best deal and quality here .
 This leash has held up like a champ with almost no wear and tear , and it looks nice . What more is there to say ?
 I bought this bike for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and she just loves it !! It was made perfectly with the pinks , purples , flashy decor and Big bright white wall tires !! Truly Charming !! Excellent price too !! Thanks Amazon !!
 Bought this watch from the Nixon website for $ 150.00 . They did n't have this model with the black face diameter , so I purchased the one with stainless steel . The watch was much slimmer than I thought and at first I was n't sure if I liked it . The pictures on the site do n't always give you the best shots , and I generally like a larger watch . But I have to say that it is kind of nice to have 1 watch that you ca n't feel on the wrist . The band I believe is polyurethane which I would maybe categorize as a hardened rubber compound that is very light and very comfortable . It would be a decent deal at this price and it 's a good beach watch or just with shorts and a t-shirt . The end of the band has a protruding rubber knob that fits to the hole on the slider so the end does n't hang out or need trimming . In my opinion it 's a great feature . Noticed on this site that it lists the watch as having an alarm . This watch looks identical to mine which does n't have that feature . The button at the three o ' clock position is for the light and the other to adjust time . I would call to confirm . Peace .
 THIS SHIRT IS AWESOME !! I GET MORE COMPLIMENTS EVEN FROM NON BEAR FANS . THIS TYPE OF SHIRT IS NOT COMMON . I LIVE IT . WISH I COULD FIND 1 IN DOLPHINS !!
 Had it for a while and it 's been to the ballpark on many occasions . Keeps you nice and cool during those hot days at the stadium .
 Item was a mesh batting jersey with embroidered stitching . Looks great and shipped really fast ! Love it !
 This bar tape is super nice . it took me a while to wrap , i was probably too meticulous , but it looks great . The Yellow will get dirty , but you can clean it with soap and water .
 I bought this to wrap around a metal safety bar for my mom 's bathtub . It 's gorgeous and works really well andI would assume would work just as well if used as its intended to be .
 These sunglasses are the best fit for my face that I could find . I had owned this exact pair previously and lost them kyaking . Ray Bans are always quality . They are easy on the eyes and the polarization of the lenses makes all the difference in color and clarity . The style is very cool and not so trendy that they will need to be replaced for next season . I would highly reccommend these sunglasses . FYI I ordered the `` small '' size and they fit perfectly on a woman 's face .
 i just bought this for my little brother , and he is in love with his new Ray Ban ! . This is the complete set
 I really love these glasses and am kicking myself for waiting so long to buy them.I am somewhat petite so size I chose was small and they fit my heart shaped face perfectly!One of the things I love most , beside the awesome optics , is the lightweight feel of these glasses.Cannot stand tight or heavy sunglasses as they always give me headaches , so these are perfect !!
 El producto era lo que yo esperaba . Cien por ciento originales en excelentes condiciones . Muchas gracias por el env&iacute;o hasta Guatemala
 Entrega en tiempo establecido por el vendedor , producto nuevo y en perfecto estado y correctamente embalado . Compre con toda confianza
 My daughter-in-law asked for these sunglasses for Christmas . They look great , and she was very pleased with them . The color is true to description .
 This sunglases are very nice and they looks very well on mi !!! I like it ! like them a lot.the model is modern .
 Hubby absolutely loved them , he 's had this same model in the past but were too scratched so i got them for him in a different color . !!
 I absolutely love these sunglasses . These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake . The originals were actually a little too big . This is why I lost them . Ordering through Amazon , I was able to get a pair just like the originals that fit and at a better price . Ca n't beat that !
 Hello , I 'm looking for Gold frame & Browm lenses Ray Ban 3211 Sunglasses.Can some body help with it?Thank 's ! Regards , GM
 I was very impressed with the beautiful quality of the artwork depicted on the mug . The coordinating absorbastone coaster absolutely makes the set . I am giving this as a gift and I am very confident that the recipient will also thoroughly enjoy and appreciate the craftsmanship and integrity of the product .
 i use this sled for presses , and rows , along with dragging it.it 's a great item and would recommend it , , i do ` nt use the harness , and could ` nt figure out how to set it up , but then again i never planned on using it at all .
 This is a very nice cost-effective buy in Hard-Shell Style Rifle Cases.I was looking for a Hard-Shell Style Case to protect my Scoped Savage .308 FCP-K Rifle when transporting it in my Vehicle to and from the Range . I also liked the fact that this Case Housed a Rifle in the Vertical Up-Right position so the Scope was fully protected all-around . The Case has 2 internal Foam Inserts to cradle/protect the Rifle , has three external Metal Clasp/Latches and the Case can be locked . The Case also has a strong folding Molded Handle.If you are looking for a Sturdy Case that you can take with you on Commercial Airlines or other public transportation I am not sure that this Case is your best choice for that task in that I am not sure how well it might hold up during frequent travel . A more expensive , more rugged Pelican Case may be your better option for that role . Am I saying this Case will not meet that challenge ? , NO ! , but the Pelican Style Cases , at considerably more $ $ will afford you more protection . A Pelican Style Case in this class/category will cost you $ 200 - $ 300 . I am very pleased with my purchase of this Plano Case from Amazon for its intended role . At a $ 34.00 price-point `` delivered '' this Case gets 5-Stars and is a super-buy . If you need a Great Range Transport Case this Model for Long Heavy Scoped type Rifles is hard to beat .
 Target rifles are large . The one I bought this case for is overly large and the rifle fit . The included front and rear pads , and two Velcro cinch straps fit easily . The rifle layed right down into them . Both straps are 1 '' x 19 '' . My stock is very large and I 'll need a 20 '' strap in the rear but for virtually every rifle 19 '' is more than long enough . I 'd buy this case again and would recommend it . If you plan to use it for air travel you may wish to stuff the voids with bubble wrap .
 I purchased this case for my AR . The size of the foregrip forced me to place the weapon in the case upside down . It still fit perfectly . I was extremely pleased with the construction and value for the dollars spent . In fact , I plan to purchase more of the same .
 I got my Plano Vert Rifle Case at a pretty good price her on Amazon with free shipping . It arrived in only 3 days ! Great shipping!The case is pretty sturdy , and set up outta the box is not bad . You only have to install the included 2 foam inserts and 2 straps.The foam was my only point of confusion , the pic on Amazon shows 3 pcs but it reality it is 2 . The product details confirm this , youjust have to read it carefully . I was pretty hyped up about the price and all so I didnt even read that ! lol . On the same topic offoam , with my SKS on a ATI Dragunov stock with bi-pod the front fits perfect and leaves about 6 '' , the very front can hold a coupleof ammo boxes and below the stock is about a foot of usable space for mags . Im going to pick up some heavy foam and cut out littlecubby holes for my extra gear . That is the only thing this case needs in my opinion.Otherwise , having it Airport approved is great . The locking tabs are built in , they appear pretty secure and should work fine.This case is a good buy , now I just cant wait to go shoot again !
 THis case is great for storage or transport . Its a bit too bulky to use as a field case though . It seems to hold scoped rifles very sturdily .
 Got this case to travel south with three other guys for a weekend deer hunt in one truck with all our hunting gear . Two days of hunting in and out of vehicle the scope was dead on with claiming a nice buck . I could not have asked for anything better . It does what it claims to do and that is to keep your scope secure in traveling.All smilesAL
 I have needed a case for my Remington 1100 for some time now and after I checked out my buddy 's , I knew I had to have one for myself . My shotgun has a scope and this case keeps it locked in nicely . The only thing that could be better is a flat end that would allow for the case to sit upright in a closet , etc. . Nice job Plano !
 This is a great case for protecting your rifle . It 's simple het works very well , securly holding the rifle in place while transporting it around . It does not take up that much more room than my other cases and i feel much more secure in knowing the rifle is protected to the level this case offers . I highly recommend it !!!
 No other rifle case holds the gun without touching the scope/mounts . The only thing this case needs is some additional padding/containment for whatever else you plan to carry in the case .
 I have Nightforce scope mounted on the rifle and Plano Vertical Rifle Case-single scoped is perfect for safe transportation . I love it . I will buy more for other guns .
 This case does a good job of holding the firearm while transporting . The firearm sets upright so with a scope the adjusment turrents are n't getting mashed . The item is held in with two straps . Works fine .
 This is a great case - provides a ton of room for your largest weapons even with a scope included . Secure velcro straps holds the firearm secure and offers plenty of room to customize the foam pads . Excellent case .
 nice case . only problem is its rather big . and now im stumped on where to put it . the place i put my gun wont fit with the case , and its rounded so you cant stand it up .
 I 've never liked those cases that squeeze a rifle between layers of foam or other soft material , regardless of how many rifles they are designed to hold . When I found this case I knew immediately it was the perfect case for transporting my rifle -LRB- s -RRB- . No , it wo n't accommodate more than one rifle , but that 's the point . More than one rifle in a case makes it too heavy . One rifle per case is enough . This case holds the rifle securely with two Velcro straps , provides cushioning for butt plate , rear of stock and forestock , plenty of room for the scope to prevent banging it around in the case , and room for a few accessories -LRB- pads , gloves , etc. -RRB- at the same time . Added bonus - it 's inexpensive . It takes up more room than the skinny `` rifle squeezing '' types , but IMO it 's worth it .
 as described , traveled with my M4 to Hawaii , no issues , had to store upside down but liked it , alittle long case but can use for my other guns too
 the only reson i gave this a four star review was that it doesnt come with very much foam . other than that it is very good and i would recomend it . it also will fit my remington 700 30-06 bolt action scoped perfectly . you can also fit a box of shells and a gun cover for hunting .
 If you want to protect your rifle/shotgun this is the case to have . With the way your firearm sets in the case it is more secure then any case I have ever had .
 This is a great rifle case . Stong , Waterproof and durable ! I have a mini 30 and it holds it perfectly . Dont get this case if you have a long rifle , it might be a bit short . Holds your rifle in the upright position rather than lying on it 's side .
 I bought these rifle cases , because they set upright and are wide enough for a match rifle to set in .
 I would not feel too secure locking this as it would be really easy to break into but it is nice , nonetheless . After all , if you leave a rifle in a plastic case unattended , you 're a bit of a tool , eh?I can see this being a very useful case as it will accommodate every rifle I own -LRB- not at the same time if you are from Rio Linda -RRB- For smaller rifles it works just as well as for larger rifles as it has internal straps and the way it 's designed allows for a one-size-fits-all approach -LRB- with the foam inserts -RRB- . I paid about 35 bucks per case . I think that is a fair price for these . Would n't pay more .
 The way that it 's built protects a scope better than cases that clamp the scope and gun between two foam pads . I would not , however , trust putting a gun on an airlines in this case . The hinges and closing clamps are not strong enough in my opinion to withstand the abuse of airport baggage handlers . Nor is the material that the case is made of . It 's fine , however , for transporting a gun to a range .
 only thing wrong it was 1 of the straps that hold the gun down had the same velco on both ends so i cant use the strap to hold my gun on place , velco has 2 sides but the strap i have has 1 side on both ends > the people at planto was so helpful in replacing the defective strap with no problems , they are great people @ planto !
 great foam blocks to hold the rifle off of any side , nice Velcro straps . l do ' t care for the funny lock thingy but i guess that is for airport security approved locks or something there is enough room for my dope book , some targets , foamy ear protection , bore snake a box of shells and some other stuff in there also . but my favorite part is the free little metal personalized sign that you can send off for .
 Plano is a household name in this family . From rifle cases to tackle boxes to ammo cans , this company sells the best products for a REASONABLE price , something thats hard to find in todays world . Very durable and light weight . I 've got three and they all work great . Fits all my rifles with room to spare and cinches them done tight . I have dropped them before and the rifle did n't move an inch . Very happy with this product and seller . Seller is a fast shipper , a big plus .
 This case suspends your firearm on blocks of foam.It keeps your rifle or shotgun from impacting any part of the inside of the case to prevent damage to the weapon or a scope . Not something you could use for airline travel , but great for transporting your firearms to and from the range . Well worth the money .
 I was looking for a new range case and one that would hold my M&P 15-22 in storage when it 's not in use . I wanted to avoid a foam lined case because of the moisture issues and this case was a perfect solution . It not only holds my 15-22 with MBUS sights and reflex sight but also a box of 500 rds of 22 , 4 mags , several boxes of 380and 40 S&W , and 2 soft pistol cases on either side of the 15-22 plus my ears , a scope and glasses . There is plenty of room if you pack it right . I keep the 15-22 in a gun sock to protect it from moisture and bumps . It 's a pretty secure case with spots for 2 pad locks but I would like another on the hinge side so I 'm sure I will poke 2 holes for a cable lock there . I only own 3 guns so I do n't need a full locker cabinet . All in all I 'm really happy with it .
 I just finished converting my 1939 Mosin Nagant 91/30 with all the accessories . New Scope , Picattiny Rails , Stock , Bipod & etc. . Once it was all done , I put it in my new Plano Vertical Case and it fits Great !!! Perfect !!
 Ca n't complain about the product or the price . Will have to see how it stands up to wear and tear but very pleased with the fit of my Ruger American and Scope in the box . You can also fit about 6 or 8 boxes of ammunition in the box as well .
 I 've used this product for 7 years now . They are extremely durable and do n't let the gun take too many knocks . I 've had scoped rifles in these cases for 7 years and never had to re-sight one due to a drop when it was in the case .
 Very sturdy case . Weapon is held secure and scope is unable to touch any part of the case . Works well for air travel .
 I bought this to carry a single gun -LRB- rifle or shotgun -RRB- for hunting or range shooting . I do not intend to ship this case via airline.I was unsure whether my Remington 11-87 12 gauge shotgun would fit in the case . When I tried it I found that even with an extended turkey choke tube , the shotgun fit comfortably . It also accommodates a nice scope on my Rem . 700 30-06 as well as my brother 's Marlin 30-30 . It seems to me that some of the other reviews concerned with the padding reflect a misunderstanding about the nature of the product . In this case the gun is not supposed to be packed between padding so that it ca n't budge . It is secured in strategic places so that it can move a little bit without hitting any of the sides . That is why it is so light to carry . It protects the gun -- not with packing it as tight as possible with foam , but by being smart about where the foam and straps are placed.The latches are strong and there is space for zip ties or locks for the case.If you have a high end gun that you want to protect at all costs , then one of the bulky , heavy , more expensive cases will give you more peace of mind . For me , this affordable lightweight case works really well for my function-over - form guns . If you plan on checking your guns on an airplane , you might consider something else . I have had broken guitars and busted suitcase zippers galore when I have checked bags.If you want a case that is light to carry , will protect your guns from home to field to range and back again , and is affordable to buy , then this one should work great for you.One cool little perk is that they send you an order form for a stick-on engraved name plate . You have send them 2 bucks , but it looks cool with the name plate on it .
 This is a great , inexpensive case for scoped rifles.On the outside it has three latches and two spots to secure padlocks.The inside is very plain and comes with several foam blocks . The blocks are made of two densities of foam , stiff foam on the bottom and softer foam to cradle the rifle . Included are two Velcro straps that pass through slots in the lower case to secure the rifle.It is very simple and yet works well . My Finnish Lion with 30 '' bull barrel and Lyman Super Target Spot fit easily in this case although that is about the limit for length . Even with this heavy of a rifle , the case is well balanced . There is also plenty of room in the bottom dividers for sights and some accessories . I bought several of these cases at $ 24 with free shipping . I never would have bought one at full price before -LRB- $ 40 or so -RRB- , but they may be worth it if you want to keep your scope free of case contact .
 I have used this case to carry a rifle back and forth to Europe . No problems with airlines or TSA and the case protect the gun fine.So why pay more when this case does an excellent job ?
 Use the case when I have to fly to a competition and I have to check in my rifle with its scope on . Case gets banged up and scratched , but the rifle and the scope come out OK - so far no change of zero . Unlike other cases wherein the rifle and scope are imbedded into foam this one sort of is locked in and floats in the case without anything touching the scope . My friends spend a lot on their Pelican cases - they are great too but expensive and heavy ... . If you do n't need the waterproofing this a very inexpensive and rugged case to get . I would love to get another one and would really recommend it to my friends . All those that have it in my group love it - that 's why I bought one .
 I am a bolt-action precision firearms professional . These are literally the best value in a gun case to date . Rifles are velcro 'd in place with only two foam contact points
 This is a great case for the price paid . To get a case as effective and tough you would have to spend many times the asking price of this one . Holds the gun securely and protects your scope from getting knocked out of whack . It would take a determined effort to damage a gun placed in this case . There is room in the case for extra foam if you think you need it -LRB- air travel for instance -RRB- , or you could use those air tubes used for shipping . Has three hasps to keep it securely closed and places for two padlocks to keep people/children out , and a convenient fold out of the way handle .
 I currently have over 15 rifles and shotguns varying from loaners to top of the line custom made High Power Benchrest . By far and above , this guncase supplies the best protection and easiest transport of any case I have ever owned over the past 40 years . Granted I would n't use it for air travel , but transporting it anywhere else by any means is a pleasure knowing your rifle/shotgun will be totally protected . So good I have now purchased 5 more for prairie dog hunting this summer . Wish all products were as reliable and well made as this .
 Good gun case like it becausenof the way it cradles the gun an nothing thouchs the scope . The srtapes hole gun secure an has some roome for storage .
 Good design . Not super rugged , but treating it with just a little care it should last many years . Fit and finish are very good . Considering price , I am very satisfied .
 Nice , light , secure and well balanced . I shoot Benchrest . The product keeps my rifle and scope protected instead of laying flat and jammed into the side of a typical case .
 Well worth the money , this my third case , the foam & straps keep the rifle in plac , case protects the rifle , ny rifle is 30 `` long and it fits in the case with 3 ' to spare
 I got this case to transport an ar15 24 '' varmit rifle with scope mounted . The case is plenty long . With the bipod folded you kinda got to set the rifle all the way to the rear and adjust the foam before strapping it down . it clears the scope 6-24 42 ao , but just barely . The case itself is well made and sturdy no complaints . Would be perfect if 4 '' shorter and 2 '' taller new model for Plano .
 when i first saw one of these cases at a match , i knew it was the best available , and the only one which held a rifle in an upright position , not squashed between to slabs of egg-crate foam.i can even fit my rifle into this case with a 4-16x56mm scope installed.i ca n't imagine any other case for my rifle on an airline.-bpps , i bought it at amazon , where it shipped FREE !
 The Plano Air-Glide case is the only way to go if you care about protcting the contents from moisture related issues , as well as routine transportation impact hazard concerns .
 Bought this case this fall to carry my new BAR in and I have to travel over 10 miles of woods roads to get to camp and has never once moved . Works great and I would recommend this case to anyone who wants a very stable gun holding case .
 This is the second one of these I purchased . They keep your gun secure and protect the scope . I would say you ca n't beat this case unless you spend alot more money . Amazon ships fast , I coud not be happier !
 I bought this case for an SKS with I high mount scope and laser sight . it fit perfect and had room for additional items i like to carry to the range . I do wish it came with extra foam for additional placements for specific custumizing but I love the case all the same .
 Looking at the pictures and reading the description really made this look like a logical way to store and carry your long guns . I bought two and they are even better than I had hoped . The rifle stays secure and the scope does n't get a chance to move and ruin your zero . I just bought a Remington 700 in 30-06 and am ordering my third case . You ca n't go wrong for ther money .
 The case holds my rifle very securely . It takes up less space and keeps my rifle protected .
 For the price this is a excellent case . I like how the rifle sets upright in the case and is secure . Note I would n't ship or use this case with airlines .
 Solid design . I was looking for a case that held the gun perfectly in place without bumping the scope . I shoot competitively and that is a must when transporting my gear . I have already used the case twice and I am looking to buy more .
 Fantastic rifle case and best case for the buck ! Everyone at the range who has seen it has ended up buying one or two for themselves . Price ca n't be beat . Even found one place selling the same thing for $ 87 . Approved for shipping on airlines but you need two approved locks , one for each locking location .
 This case protects your rifle by securly strapping it in . even if the case falls upside down , It 's also approved for air travel .
 this rifle case is great . i had 2 others . i keep my .308 match rifle in one and my hall actioned .22 lr match rifle in the other . this one i purchased has my suhl 150 standard match rifle in it . they hold the guns upright instead of laying them on the sides like most cases . these means less of as chance on the scopes being off .
 After reading some of the reviews - I had some doubts . I even made several trips to Academy Sports - but did n't like the Plano varieties they carried - a few of the other varieties appeared solid , but at a much greater cost.So , I decided to go ` cheap ' take a chance on this Amazon offer . I am NOT disappointed . There is plenty of room for the scope and other ` stuff ' . If traveling by air , I would forgo the other stuff and add extra pillar packing . Do n't worry there is plenty of room .
 Great gun case , with a really good price . I think of this as a very good buy , great protection for your rifle .
 This case is absolutly nothing facy , but it does the job . The case is simply just for transportation or locking it up in your house to simply keep away for children . This case will not stop ANY thief . But like I said just a simple case if you need one . Another plus is that I can perfectly fit , with no wiggle room but fits nice and smooth , a mossberg 590A1 and a H&R 12 gauge .
 I purchased this for my Remington 30 AR and love it . My gun has a full size scope and fits no problem . I love the fact that its small enouphe but big enouphe to store all your stuff . I have my field cleaning kit , extra ammo , and extra magazines in there as well . The only con is that there isnt enouph padding included . I took some extra foam padding from an old case and lined the entire top and bottom for complete quiet and firm fit . Im buying another one and doing the same .
 Not a bad rifle case at all . Holds the rifle in an upright position and is hard shelled thus offering a good level of protection . I 've used this case exclusively for several months now and the only bad thing I can say about it is the inside foam that holds the rifle stock in place is starting to deteriorate and I can envision a time when it will have to be replaced . But I ca n't complain too much as I have used the heck out of it and it was relatively inexpensive . I would definitely buy it again .
 it may not have every fancy attachment and compartment , but for the price , this thing is great . Not a bad deal at all ... and i recommend if you are not looking to drop alot on a case ... save more for the gun itself !
 excellent case for transportation . i 'm using it to carry guns to the range . it has places to lock . plenty long . durable enough for airlines or just to throw into the back of the truck instead of the front . Recommended .
 It keeps the scope up and does not allow it to come into contact with anything . Rifle is sucured using Velcro straps .
 Case received as scheduled and I am very pleased with this case . Holds rifle in the center of the case and leaves room for securing other supplies in the enclosure of the case .
 Bought two from Amazon to replace the `` rust enhancing '' foam lined ones . These have plenty of airspace around them so moisture is n't trapped like the others . Rifle is held firmly with the velcro straps . Being right handed , I just wish they opened the other way so the latches were toward your body . For lefties , no problem .
 Great case and super gun protection . Ca n't beat this for the price ! Solid Protection and easy , fast storage.Velcro straps hold well .
 These case are the best , They hold your gun upright and keep it from nocking around , And if you can buy it on sale it is a better deal !! Get one you will like it .
 Great price on a great case that protects my competition rifles very well ! I no longer need to worry about my rifle getting kicked or stepped on incidentally .
 This is my second Vertical Rifle case . I keep my bench shooters in them . This case is extremely secure for one rifle . The straps hold the butt and forearm in very thick padding . There is no pressure on my high dollar scopes at all . I do not have any negative commits on this case . If it costs twice as much I would still buy another . At the price Amazon sells them for you are almost steeling them.I you have a nice rifle that you want to baby , get this , you will be glad you did.See you on the line , D00M
 This case is the best of its type that I 've ever used or seen . It holds the rifle securely against foam pads without putting pressure on the scope or a collapsed bi-pod and presumably any other accessories . The plastic case itself is very robust . If you want a case that 's able to be submerged and able to withstand a 20 + ft drop , get a Pelican , but be prepared to part with 200 + + $ . For everything else the Plano vertical rifle case is superb .
 This case holds my Mossberg 590 and other gear such as a spare light , shotgun shells , batteries , and various other things needed for when `` TSHTF '' ! It has plenty of room for the tactical light and mount on the side of the barrel too.The case is very well made and holds the gun secure in foam blocks and straps . Best money I 've spent in a long time.Amazon was fast in free shipping as always and I do a lot of business with them . Always the best service and widest selection . I recommend this item and Amazon highly !
 The case is solid and it is worth every penny . Shipped my 300wsm from Alaska with out any problems after been used in the hunt went back in the little bush plane got thrown around and it has kept my rifle safe . Highly recommended .
 I bought two of these to use as storage for my marauder rifles . Much better than the bags I was using . Do n't have to worry about bumping the scopes and throwing off the sightings . Large enough to allow the rifle with high mounts , a BSA 6X44 Tactical with a 100mm side wheel.Trimmed the foam to secure and they are good to go . You can also purchase separately a plastic bin box to put under the gun but I have n't done this yet .
 This is for the money the best case I have ever own . Great gun support and protection with some storage space for small items . I 'm buying another one ... !
 After building a rather large and long benchrest target rifle I needed something to move it around in . This plano case was a perfect fit after a little foam removal on the forearm foam piece . Holds rifle and scope firmly and I have room for the rangefinder and notebooks . Great rifle case for the price ... Highly recommend
 Excellent gun case and I own 6 of them . No trouble and well designed I will only use these cases when I travel . . Buy one with confidence . . shb bayfield CO
 Every hunter should have one from begginers to experts . I now have two and getting more . Friends are buying them , there are no defaults om the case . Very dependable and sturdy . Going on trips , I just place in the back of truck and no worries . You can lay on its side and when you open , right where you placed it , secured . I would like to see a double ! Bukmastor fromSW Louisiana
 I love it but it got damage in ship the edges are thin.But it travels very well and save space and you do not have to set it somewhere to get accessto the gun .
 My Plano AirGlide is great for the money . I use it to take my benchrest rifle to the range Holds the rifle secure without any foam touching metal parts . I dont think it would be a good case to use for air travel but is great for everyday trips to yhe range . It is a good buy for the price . I would buy another . Ken
 I would recommend this gun case
 This is the best rifle case I have ever had . It completely protects your rifle .
 I bought it to travel to paintball games by air - protected my Tippmann X7 during my last trip . Airport security had me open the case when I checked in and I left it unlocked - when I arrived at my destination , security hand delivered the case to me with my X7 inside - the case protected my marker and there was no problems . Only wish there was more room inside for paintball gear , but it was designed for transporting rifles and not paintball markers and gear . Good case - very well cushioned and protective for the price .
 I have n't used it for my trip yet -LRB- via airline -RRB- but it does seem like it will protect my rifle . Certainly a good case for the price .
 Plano AirGlide Single-Scoped Shotgun / Rifle CaseExcellent rifle case as it protects scope and rifle from jars during transport .
 This case does an excellent job of securing your rifle and scope.You will not be able to beat this quality at the price .
 My friends showed me the case , It holds the rifle securely with velcro . It has room for the rifle while it is scoped . seals securely and the case will accomodate 2 padlocks .
 This case is somewhat hard to compare to other cases because it is a fairly unique design and there really are n't any similar cases anywhere near this price range . Where other cases hold the rifle laying flat between large sheets of foam , this case holds it vertically . There are only two points where the rifle touches the case , stiff foam blocks at the butt and at the forend . The rifle is held in place with velcro straps.The major advantage of this is that the metal of the rifle is not touching anything , and so the finish can not be marred or affected by moisture trapped in the foam . The straps holding the rifle also ensure if will not move around inside the case if it is jarred or dropped.One thing to keep in mind is that this case is made for the traditional stock rifles . AR-type rifles and other rifles with protruding pistol grips may not fit this case well , depending on configurationThe design of the case is excellent . The only drawbacks are somewhat cheap materials and execution , but you can hardly expect more at this price point . The plastic of the case is relatively flexible . Plano states it is airline approved , but I would be a little wary trusting it to the baggage handlers . The foam is cut and glued a little sloppy . Also , the straps can be too long for slimmer rifles.The case holds a rifle with a wide target forend very securely and comfortably . With a narrower forend there is some potential for it to move side to side , so I would suggest a couple of small foam blocks to hold it more securely . This is something that really should come with the case , but does n't . An extended bolt handle fits , but just barely , so if the case is bumped on the side where the handle is it would probably flex enough to hit it . If you are using this for long distance transport I would suggest removing the bolt.I have a fairly large scope and medium height rings , and it clears the case well.The latches are very well done . Rather than the typical snap latches of cases in this price range that rely on flexing plastic to lock this case has latches with metal rings that should stand up to far more use . The case has two hasps for small luggage locks , so it can be secured . However , the plastic of the hasps is fairly thin and most likely can be defeated with basic hand tools , so this case can not be considered theft resistant . At best , it will keep out small children.Aside from the two attachment points the case is smooth inside . There is no storage for anything else besides the rifle . If you are in the habit of keeping extras like spare magazines in the case with the rifle , you will need to either get inventive and put extra foam in , or keep them elsewhere . I would not recommend just putting them in with the rifle , as they will bounce around and possibly damage the finish.The carrying handle is very comfortable . It is vastly superior to just about any other rifle case handle I have used . It also folds down flat.In short , this is a case that offers some unique advantages , particularly for higher grade and precision firearms , even against much more expensive products .
 I just received the Plano AirGlide gun case and I am very pleased with the design . Mine was missing the foam block that is shown at the very tip of the case that would go under the tip of the barrel . The other two foam blocks support the gun fine so I am pleased . Considering buying another and saw that the price has gone up another $ 5 . It does n't seem you can pick These up anywhere else for under $ 50 .
 Perfect for my scoped CZ455 . Keeps scope from being knocked out of alignment . Sturdy plastic with sturdy latches . I recommend .
 This case is sturdy and holds the rifle in a safe position , so the scope is not pressed into the padding . It is the best way to transport our specialty rifles . We will buy more !
 This case easily holds a rifle in place -LRB- via velcro straps and cushioning blocks -RRB- without having to remove the scope . It is the best case for holding precision target rifles that I have found in over 60 years of competition shooting . It would , however , be very clumsy to use in a mobile hunting situation .
 This is the best single long gun case on the market in my opinion . Excellent protection particularly for rifles with scopes . The scope is completely suspended with nothing touching it . Excellent value . I now own 5 of them . It can be used for all long guns except shotguns with a very long barrel and will protect any gun you put in it .
 I received my Plano case in a timely manner . The case is very sturdy for the type of plastic used . I would not use this case for air travel ! Great for back and forth to the range or simply just to store your rifle/shotgun . Really my only issue with the case is that it does n't seal very well . This may allow moister and/or dust to enter the case . Overall very happy with product , also my bi pod fit nicely in the case while attached to rifle .
 This case was designed with bad things happening but not ruining your gun in mind . The rifle sits securely in the case , strapped in with two Velcro straps that hold everything tightly . Still , the gun is only contacted in two limited areas by the case . The height of the case accommodates a mounted scope nicely . Drop the case , toss the case , do everything shy of run over the case and even your scope is safe from harm . This was # 2 for me , and I can see # 3 , # 4 , and # 5 on the horizon . The price might make you think this is a &#34; cheap &#34; case , but do n't be deceived .
 This fits my Remington 700 with a 26 '' bull barrel and mounted Vortex Viper scope . The bipod on my rifle also clears the front mount in the case . One of the velcro tie down straps that secures the rifle in the case was ` loop ' on both ends rather than ` hook and loop ' . However , Plano sent me replacement no questions asked . This is great case for the price for general service or air shipment . It is not waterproof and you can not drive over it but it did not cost $ 250 either .
 Best bang for the buck out there . This is the 4th case of this style I have purchased so I knew what I was getting . Loads of room in side , great protection , ballances well with any size of rifle and it will accomodate some very long guns . Not fancy or pretty , but well made .
 Just what I needed , an inexpensive case to safely transport a precision rifle.The case even arrived early . Much smaller than most of my other cases , it fits in smaller sub-compact cars . Thanks
 I think this is the best value for a gun case ever . I had to wait to get it but when I did was I pleased . The gun sits a good distance from the side walls so it would take something very drastic to damage the gun . There is lots of air around the gun so the chance of damp foam leaving you with a rusty gun is diminished . It carries easily and is air travel OK . It opens and closes easily and much more easily than some of my cases where you have to push down very firmly to get the latches to close . Since nothing is being compressed to close this case it is easy as pie .
 This is the best of several rifle cases I own . It is one of the few that fits a scoped Anschutz with a barrel tuner and a large scope .
 Great for transporting to and from range as well as camp . Not sturdy to ship on airline . This is the second one of these that I own .
 My wife bought this case at least 10 years ago for me . I use a Marlin 30-30 with 9 x 40mm scope in it and it works great . It has kept my gun from damage and works great for someone that does n't have a gun cabinet . I have not had any trouble with rust even though I keep my gone in this case all year long . The reason for this is the gun is suspended inside the case by being strapped to foam at the rear of the stock and forearm . I would recommend this case for anybody with a rifle w/scope .
 This is one of the best designed gun cases I 've ever owned , and the reason I purchased five of them . They do take up a lot of space compared to a conventional case . However , they are easy to use and provide great protection . It is a 5 star product.http : / / ecx.images-amazon . com/images/I / 017CD7E3T0L . jpg
 I purchased one case and liked it so well I bought another . That says in a nutshell how I feel about the product .
 Bought this on the recommendation of a friend , and he still is . I use one for a 1885 Winchester Hi Wall with a 32 '' replica scope , and it protects it perfectly . The other has my varmit gun , and it goes in the truck over some harsh terrain and is protected , but easy to get to when a shot is presented . Thinking about a few more . Great protection for the money .
 I am a 30 something guy , and me and my friends have been playing this non-stop since we got it . Why is it better than wiffle ball -LRB- which I also enjoy quite a bit -RRB- ? Well , three reasons
 This is a great case . Overall smaller than I thought it would be -LRB- based on the pictures -RRB- but can easily fit 4 pistols with 2 mags each -LRB- 1 mag in the sidearm 1 more next to it . -RRB- Seems pretty durable and nothing moves around . I got 2 of these and would get more if/when I need the storage.Pros - Inexpensive compared to similar offerings - Plastic has nice texture and seems durable - Has spot for lock -LRB- s -RRB- - Hold 4 pistols easilyCons - Price -LRB- it can always be cheaper ! -RRB- - Hinges look like they would be the only thing to ever break on the case , but they seem sturdy enough so that might not even be a con .
 Holds my all my stuff in place and looks like it will last . Good product and seems tough enough for the field and travel .
 This case holds four -LRB- or more depending on size -RRB- handguns with clip -LRB- s -RRB- . The plastic used in this is n't very strong but enough for local transport -LRB- to a firing range , etc -RRB- . Has two holes for locks - more for adding another layer of tamper resistance . The hinge seems like it can be taken apart with a screw driver but does it 's the job otherwise . Whether it has one or four handguns , this case holds everything in place securely -LRB- no noise/rattling from anything in the case -RRB- . The case is inexpensive - priced right !
 yes , it will hold 4 pistols . solid plastic case . nothing too fancy , but the foam is soft and firm . Lid closes easily even with pistols on both sides of the solid foam pad .
 I use this case for a manual film camera and three manual lenses , one of which is a telephoto lens . Everything fits tightly and does n't move around in the case . Works great for what I use it for , albeit it is a bit larger than I expected .
 Not a bad case , I bought a few to move my glass pieces around in . If your buying for glass , you 'll need a thick extra insert to hold everything very still . Its a tiny bit flimsy but so far nothing has cracked or broken -LRB- about 8 months old -RRB- . Not bad for the price .
 I really like this . My husband and I used this for our guns . It holds 4 pistols . Works great .
 Let me start off with I only use this case for paintball but I bet my collection of actual firearms would be secure in it too.So far I own two for my two paintball markers and both fit perfectly . I own a DP FX and an Empire Sniper and the case can fit the marker and all their accessories quite nicely . I keep the two piece barrel , a couple 9v and AAA 's -LRB- for my Rotor -RRB- , the allen wrench set , iFit kit and lube all in the bottom section and the DP FX in the top section of one case . My other case has the barrel front , 3 barrel backs , allen wrench set , parts case and lube in the bottom and my Empire Sniper in the top . The Sniper is a little tight with the pump are but it does fit . The cases make it so easy to organize , protect , and transport both markers . The pad lock holes are an added bonus for when at the field.The case is well built , the foam is strong , and the size is perfect.Overall A + job and perfect for paintball .
 Great lens that fits into a great mask . Played a few days with it and never once had a problem with visibility . This lens was easier to take out of the Flex 8 than my previous mask . Definitely use a micro fiber cloth for cleaning and be very gentle . Got another lens to keep as a backup for the days on the field .
 These lenses are a great upgrade over the stock clear lenses . When used in a open field it cuts down on eye strain significantly . These also work well in lightly wooded areas , but the amber or clear lenses should be used in dense overhead vegetation . I had no problem changing the lenses out , but two helmets one with the amber lens and another with the smoke lens would be optimal if possible .
 I bought this for my husband who loves to keep up to date on logs and records . The cover is very nice although the metal plate kept falling out . The logbook on the inside has a place for all of the entires necessary to keep up on boat maintenance . I would purchase this item again .
 good starter set over all , couple issues though . one is you 'll need a barrel ring because the AK barrel is a half turn off , but a 95cent ring will fix that no problem . And two the rear site doesnt line up with the forward site on the barrel , its way off . So its hard to do any distance shooting with this . But I give it about 100 feet range , all the accessories that come with are good parts , over all nto a bad set up .
 very excellent foam roller , comfortable , durable and helps with working the back out.Nice price and delivery.Thanks for the bomb ass work and product.Have a nice day !
 A good bargain and delivered promptly . This product was intro'ed to me by a physical therapist I bike with - it is a great way for a ` self-massage ' and right after I received it there was an article detailing the ` how to ' in Bicycling Magazine . Although not a substitute for a real massage , it sure is a whole lot cheaper and you can throw it down on the floor while watching TV and make it seem like a worthwhile endeavor .
 Arrived quicker than expected which was nice . No damage . Using for back exercises and works well . No problems/complaints what so ever .
 I 've always been pleased when I order from Amazon I always get my orders in the time they say the Foam roller is working great for I what I use it for and the ear pods sound great .
 I picked up some McNasty on the recommendation of a friend who said it was the only product that she found that kept her Golden Retrievers from chewing up their patio . We had two Border Collie puppies who were really into chewing lattice , decking , the telephone junction box , and digging under favorite flowers . They thought all the other anti-chew items like `` bitter apple '' were condiments , and cayenne pepper was what everyone in a South Texas house ate on everything . Anything or any place McNasty was sprayed , however , they stayed away from . We also had a problem with rats and opossums getting into a place under our deck we could not get to . I found that spraying between the decking into that place would clear them out in a matter of hours . I wish that this product was carried by Pet Supply stores and Home Improvement Centers .
 this product works . A must have for a horse thats on a glucosamine program . Thank you for this product . A major improvement .
 Please note that the red features on Amazon 's image of this article are in fact all black
 I generally do n't review products I buy here , but since this had no review and I really like the knife I figured I should . Basically this is a high quality , well balanced knife , that will not break easily . It has a fairly smooth opening , which makes it easy to flick open . It has a locking mechanism which will not break if you are trying to stab something . So if you are looking for something that looks good , will not break , and can be used for more than just show ; then you should buy this knife .
 I was leery about buying galoshes online , but noone local sold them . After lots of research I found myself looking really hard at these . They are very flexible , do n't weigh much , and allow me to use my own shoes without getting them dirty . DEFINITELY BUY LARGE . I read that it other reviews and found this to be absolutely true . The fold-over closure is a wonderful feature , and uses a big keyhole-and-button for fastening .
 First off , I am not a kid , I just do n't have an account on amazon right now . Anyway , this gun is amazing . I 'd say this is probably the best airsoft AEG there is for it 's price . It shoots very fast when the battery is fully charged and has great range . The gun is weighted nicely , has a pretty good capacity magazine -LRB- 50 shots -RRB- , and has a mock scope ; by the way the scope works if you draw accurate crosshairs onto it , even though it does n't magnify . This gun comes with a 9.6 volt rechargable battery -LRB- charges quickly -RRB- , a charger , safety goggles , extra sights -LRB- if you do n't like the scope -RRB- , fake scope , some black precision bb 's , and a speed loader -LRB- useful in battles -RRB- . Oh yeah , the cocking lever moves but does n't do anything useful-it looks cool . Overall a great rifle , especially for the price . Reccomended . Accuracy = 9 Range = 9 Power = 8 Value = 10
 This gun rocks ! It shots very fast and is really accurate . I must buy for everyone . One bad thing . The scope does n't do anything . Plus there is n't even a cross hair in it :P > : O
 i love this airsoft gun ! It 's the best gun that ive ever shot ! It 's never broken down on me ! i REALLY LOVE THIS AIRSOFT GUN ! Me my brother my cousin and my dad had a war with them and i got killed by my cousin and his Aug airsoft gun . My ak47 was useless . It 's not that i dont like it it 's just i love my cousins gun better . Ryan mullins loves his Airsoft Aug
 some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is ... it shoots crazy fast and is very accurateI shot my uncle with it and it made him BLEEDnone of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any moresome of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is ... the safety ca n't be pushed to hard or it comes outthe handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came offthe battery takes longer than it says to charge to workplease take my advice because I have had this gun for more than a year now and I know it front and back .
 ive been playing airsoft for over thirteen years and ive never seen a chinease gun this good . Whats not to love about this gun . The price is good the accuracy is amazing and so is the power and speed i mean i shot a target and the BB broke in half and the battery life is good . BUT the only thing is that the scope doesnt zoom in it just tells u wear ur aimin so buy a good scope or just keep the really good ajustable sights on it wich is a good idea . The foregrip on this gun makes it better too cuz it steadys ur aim . GREAT BUY GET IT
 this thing is awsome it can shot far fast the only thing bad about this gun is on mine when i first got it it got some bbs jamed in it so i was feeling how much air cam out of this thing its alot and a bb flew out and nailed me in the tip of my finger it left a welt the size of the bb in my finger for a week but during battle this thing is awsome u just run out of bbs fast if u get someone in a good postion u could nail them with every shot every one should have this gun
 First , as the original Steyr Aug , the trigger is a two steps fire selector . Any problem with the auto or semi is due to a very small tooth that holds the second gear after the motor inside the gear box , preventing it from making a complete revolution ; if you push the trigger completely the electrical switch -LRB- also into the gear box -RRB- will put the gears to work in full auto . So you may have some problems with that tooth , if you ever open the gear box be very careful and watch how every piece is placed , if not , you will enjoy hours of sweating putting everything back together . Good luck.I really love this gun , I get 2 inches groups at 30 ft , take care of it and buy more mags ; never use normal real gun 's oil lube in any plastic gun , instead very light silicone oil is the only safe thing because other petroleum base oil will damage the plastics inside the gun.PD
 i just got this gun today and am quite suprised by the quality of it . the styer does have a few draw backs the saftey button must be pushed with care as not to push it throw the gun the break apart switch is to loose and the front hanlde is so flimsy im afriad to use it in fear of breaking it off the rate of fire on the other hand is awsome i can lay down a hail of pellets and suprise another person fire very easly . the acuaracy of the gun is ok not bad but not good with the pellets they give you . the noice it makes is actually a lot quiter then i thought it would make meaning its good for stealthy fast attacks.the wieght also gives it a feel mobility and i just whant to walk up to some one and pistol wip them but ney i can not in all this gun isnt bad for 40 greens but its fragile feel makes you very gentel with it but in all id recomend this gun
 Best price and best gun I ever bought its soo accurate . the speed loader is also very handy . -LRB- Buy the gun thats $ 1 more the shipping is $ 10 less -RRB-
 Do n't get me worng I know what im talking about I recived this 8 days ago and this gun CAN compete with those M14 you see on this site the rate of fire IS higher than the 14 's but these gun 's have a tendencey -LRB- because they are shooting so fast -RRB- to spit out a BB that only goes a few feet but other wise prepared to get blasted by what must be like a a shotgun amount of bullets . My daad and I shot at one of our shovels outside our house and we hit it QUITE a few times . Only use the iron sight the scope is flimsy and worthless . I have even played with this gun during paintball i loaded some 6mm paintballs into it and and snuck behind one of my friend from 15 feet away and unloadded the whole clip on him .
 first off to the idiot who said his gun didnt work because he charged it all night . These guns come with a very cheap battery , if you charge it for more than the allotted time -LRB- 2 hours 35 minutes -RRB- you will destroy the battery.anyway the gun.This is an excelent gun for the cost , it out ranges any of the CYMA guns and simply dominates in a spring war -LRB- i would know i whipped this baby out in the middle of a pistol match and got 7 people -RRB- Its magazine is kinda difficult to load and spills bbs out if you remove it before it is empty . Also dont put the magazine in without the barrel in propperly or the mag empties into the gun . This thing has high fps around 220 -240 -LRB- yes i cronographed it -RRB- The only problem is mine doesnt really work on single because it double feeds apart from that this gun rocks .
 This gun is so amazing . I bought it and loved it . It is SOOOOO accurate and works great . The firing rate is great as well . All around great gun . The only problem is that it takes a liitle while to ship . But it is worth it .
 First of all , I 'm not Deborah Williams , I 'm her son . But that 's beside the point . I may be 14 but I 'm better than you in anyway possible . Anyway this gun really surprised me , but as said before it has its cons . I 'll just list my pros and cons , and save you a boring paragraph.Pros :1 . Its automatic speed is amazing , although I suggest bursting or semi , if thats possible for you . .2 . Accurate . -LRB- if you actually aim ... -_- -RRB- 3 . I just have to say it , it looks great . : D4 . Powerful - you 'll know when you hit someone . ; -RRB- Cons :1 . Battery life is a bit of a disapointment .2 . Magazine capacity is a let down for how fast it shoots . But then again , do n't be an idiot and always use auto .3 . As said before , the scope is a no no . Use the iron sights .4 . Be gentle with the front handle , it is a bit flimsy .5 . The safety came out , but did n't affect anything about how it shoots.About all I can say , if your looking for a great gun for the price , THIS IS IT . I strongly reccommend this gun , it is well worth the cost . Its great for both offense and defence , if you know how to use it . And last of all , its pretty scary on the receiving end . ;-RRB- 4/5 - Get this gun .
 This is a very good gun when I bought it I did n't think it could kill small rodents but it doe 's if you are looking for a good air soft gun at a cheap price this is the one .
 I was having a dual with my friend I shot him once in the leg from 20 feet and he started dancing on that leg for a minute . Get the point ?
 this gun is really great for the price . it comes w. reg sights and i suggest that u immediately trash the useless scope . You definately need a speedloader or three cuz this thing has an amazing rof . also use .2 s cuz .12 s curve too much . It 's relatively accurate , and it breaks down fairly easily . it is comfortable to hold and is relatively accurate . however , if ur looking for a deal , buy the double eagle m47 shotgun . for like 25 bucks , u get a superbly accurate and enjoyable weapon . This aug is an interesting weapon , and i suggest it . I believe that if u want a cheapy gun though , buy a shotgun that is rated well , cuz theyre amazingly effective . -LRB- i beat kids w / crosman r74s all the time w. mine -RRB- Oh yeah , this gun is pretty powerful too , id say upwards of 250fps w. a .12 , but those shotties are above 330 w. .12 s. anyways , look around , cuz there are great deals out there if u know where to look .
 This gun is a good entry level AEG . It looks nice and performs well . The main issues is the magazine capacity , saftey button , and wobbliness in carious parts of the gun . Overall its pretty sturdy . On the downside of this gun is there is no switch to go from auto to semi-auto . Also the good for nothing scope thats included is well ... good for nothing . I just took off the scope off one of my bb gun rifles and mounted it on . This scope magnifies so it gives the gun more of a sniper feel . you should definetly buy spare magazines . The lack of providing the spare magazines , and better scope is definetly a negative . But for the price it really is a good ENTRY level AEG . I did not clock the FPS but i would say its about 250-280 FPS . Not too sure on that . Overall a good gun especially for the price . Way better than most LPAEG 's out there for this low of a price . It is in no way as good as a TM obviously . Great for starters , and includes saftey goggles , mock scope , bb 's , speedloader , cleaning rod . you can also disassemble it . great for the price , great for a new player to airsoft . just what your looking for . By the way , im not a kid . just to lazy to sign in .
 the guns great theres only two bad things about the scope stinks and you can only load like 40 shots at a time , unless im missing something . and i took the gun apart bcause of a jam and i cant put it bak 2gether so if sum1 will help me i would appreciate that
 Sweet gun . It 's got lots of accessories , making it a really cheap buy , especially for the quality . It is very durable and beastly . It looks realistic and shoots well , it hurts too . It goes really far and has super good quality . It was well worth the money . Oh yeah , and that one guy was wondering what a `` speed loader '' was . It 's a device that holds bb 's and loads them into the magazine clip . When you press down this tall button thingy you can load bb 's in extremely quickly -LRB- Like 20 seconds per clip -RRB- , instead of having to load all 50 bb 's one at a time . Again a great gun .
 Well . I have to say its not the best . but it sure does beat out spending around $ 300 for a Tokyo Marui . I just got this gun and i have used it many times already . It shoots very fast when the battery is charged fully and has really good accuracy . I was able to take out a pop can about fifty feet away . Only two problems . The scope does n't zoom in and has a really small whole to look through and it does n't even have cross hairs or a dot . I would suggest either getting a real scope from some sporting goods store or just use the sights that come with it -LRB- which are very good to use -RRB- . the second problem is i never found anything that told me how long to charge the battery so i 'm just gunna guesse and leave it charging for a while . Over all this is probably the best beginers AEG out there . and the cheapest for its quality .
 This is the best airsoft gun for this low of a price . the accuracy is amazing thanks to the bullpup design . even on full auto . the scope stinks but who cares ? I also own the Tokyo Marui AUG and the only really noticeable difference is how solid the rifle feels . the power and accuracy are about the same . I would really recommend buying this rifle . Heck I may even buy another one .
 this gun shoots more than 200fps easy because i have an M16 auto thats shoots 250fps , and this gun acually shoot farther.This is probibly the best airsoft gun I have.It is easy to manage , not heavy , powerful , 60 round clip , speed loader , and it is confertable to hold . get this gun
 This is the ideal starter gun . It 's inexpensive , lightweight , and fully automatic ! You 'll have a blast from the first squeeze of the trigger , especially if you 're new to airsoft . The instructions were slightly vague in some areas -LRB- they did n't specify how long you should charge the battery , but i suggest to charge it for a few hours -RRB- , but it 's not too hard to figure out . If you 're new , get this gun , and you wo n't be dissapointed .
 YOU MUST GET THIS GUN ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER . It doesnt shoot 200 fps but actually around 250 fps.Scope sucks but everything else rocks . The battery doesnt burnout like my old mp5 AEG . GET THIS GUNSIMPSONS ROCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1
 I have been playing airsoft for nearly a year now , and I must say this is one amazing gun!Pros - This baby shoots so dang fast !!!!!! Sexiest gun EVERHandle easily folds upThe shipping is absalutely amazing IT TOOK 3 DAYS !!!! The price is crazy good!It shoots hard!Its super quietIt has a semi/full auto switch in the trigger!The SPEED LOADER IS COOL!Accuracy !! Cons - The magazine goes by really fast -LRB- Buy tokyo marui clip for 30 bucksThere were bb 's in my handle -LRB- takem out -RRB- if anyone knows how to take apart the handle that would be nice.The scope is worthless -LRB- buy a new scope at most any store -RRB- Over all I give this gun a 5 because any problem it could have is easily fixed !!! THIS IS AN AWESOMELY AMAZING GUN !!!!
 Once again , this is a gun i do n't personally own but have used at a friend 's house . It has awesome ROF , ok accuracy , good FPS for a 30 $ electric , and all in a low price tag . This gun has everything you could want in a cheap AUG , except it has a low ammo capacity so i suggest you buy a few extra mags for it.PROS :1 -RRB- awesome ROF2 -RRB- good FPS3 -RRB- good accuracy4 -RRB- ok range5 -RRB- cheapCONS :1 -RRB- low ammo capacity2 -RRB- FPS could be better
 this is the best gun ive gotten so far but the scope is useless , and doesnt even have crosshairs.pros - > powerful > accurate > easy to handel > fully auto > comes with extra sites > not to costly > looks goodCons - > after pulling the triger it takes a second to reach its most rapid fire > loose foregrip > a little fragile > directions could be a little more helpful with how to charge the batery > needs more clips > get a new scope
 ok , this gun is really great . It looks cool , pretty high powered , and at 32 bucks , it 's a really good deal . The only downsides are the safety buttons and the scope . The safety buttons can easily be push all the way out if you push them really far , but to fix that problem you only need to not push them all the way . The scope is useless . It looks pretty good , but that 's all it 's good for . It does n't even magnify anything . That being said , this is still a really good gun . I would strongly recommend that you buy it , because it is really good for a good price
 THIS GUN IS GREAT !!! i got it today , and its shooting really straight even though there is a breeze blowing . Strong gun too , im guessing around 250 fps . Not sure what its range is , im just shooting at a fence about 55 feet away and its going right where i wanted it to go . Definitely buy a second clip !!!! only holds about 30 or so , might sound ok but ull realize really quick in a fight that ull need another clip . i only charged the battery for about an hour and its been fine for the past like ... hour and a half . The safety works fine , the scope is crap though , it doesnt have crosshairs !! i figured that it would at least have those but no . its just a tube with glass . anyway i just used the sights that come with it and its deadly . Also comes with a convenient speed loader . Holds about 80 or so bbs and u just push the button easy as that . Great gun ! Even at the like 40 dollars after shipping . My little brother bought the sig 552 with all the lasers , and lights and stuff ... Its what you would expect out of a like 40 dollar gun . So you definitely buy this gun ... DONT FORGET THE EXTRA CLIP !!!
 i got this gun after christmas and i opened up the package and i was like holy cr@p when i saw this beast of an airsoft gun . i shot a soda can i put on a fence post using the scope after loading it with a couple of bbs . if u want a cheap AEG buy this monster !
 Well , answering the question of someon asking whats a speedloader
 This gun is an okay gun.It shoots fast on auto and goes far.I have two complaints about this gun .1 . The saftey is allways falling out and hard to put back in .2 . The trigger is sortof hard to use.Some times when i want to go auto it dosent insted it just burst or single shoots.Also my battery last really long so i dont know what so other people where talking about . This is a all around good gun .
 One of my friends bought this in desert color and I got to hold it and shoot it once . the feel is great , except for the magazine rubbing against my wrist . and the magazine capacity is less than normal for an AEG . buy more mags - they save you in a war . By The Way , i think I know the kid who posted the above review ... but all around a good AEG , ` cept the low magazine capacity . Hope this helped !
 yours only stopped working because you killed the battery by leaving it on ALL night ! the charge time is 2 and 1/2 hours ! if you charge it more it will just destroy your battery !
 this gun is alright . my friend has it and i 've shot it a couple times and i like the feel . from about 20 feet it somewhat hurts and you can atleast feel it . i would rate the pain 6 out of ten being a little generous . i 'd say buy it but think about getting a descent scope with it .
 I ordered this gun a couple of weeks ago and it arived just the other day . Gun worked right out of the box , only prob was that after actuly loading the gun and gettign ready to fire it for the first time it failed , turns out i had to open it up and ajust teh copper connectors because the trigger was not connecting to the rest of the components , was a simple fix but it is a pain to put back together . So no problems there really , just incase it will not fire when you get it , this might be your prob will not hurt or change the fireing of the gun in anyway . the only reason for the 4 stars is the front grip locks into a up or down posistion and it would not release and broke in the first 15 mins of handeling it . i do not mind i will jsut simply fix it with some knowhow , other wise a great gun , fires fast , accurat , and far , note the scope is just for looks thoough .
 Okay , i 've only owned an airsoft gun and I think I was four at that time . So I 'm pretty much new to this . I am reading the reviews and getting more and more pysched about this . I seriously hope that most of you are right cause I get really pissed when things do n't work . I 'm also getting the two barettas and the 5000 round container . I 'm really amazed at the price . -LRB- P.S What is Tokyo Mairu ??? -RRB-
 This is a really good gun , What are you waiting for , BUY IT !!
 I have n't bought this gun yet but it seems like a nice gun . The reviews all give it a five so thats good . This will be my first gun that I have owned . I hope I wo n't be dissapointed . : -RRB-

 wow!i have n'tgot this gun yeti think its gon na be good
 I bought this gun in late december 05 ' . It is still kickin in late may . The safety thing fell out . I 'll have to admit , this gun is cheaply made . You just need to be smart with it . It pierces two layers of somewhat thin cardboard . I have indents in my walls from this thing . For like 40 bux , this gun is a real deal . And the rapid automatic bursts from this gun are pretty cool . Oh yeah , the scope is a piece of -LSB- ... -RSB- .
 First off , those of you calling it a `` clip '' should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself . Please call it a magazine -LRB- actual name for it -RRB- And a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round . Second , dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument . you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun . this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away . Its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar . It 's plastic , it shoots things . I 'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance . So yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you . NOT A SPORT . I also suggest getting .20 g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water . Have fun.P.S . Though they may noth have the trigger finger ability , spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb 's . If you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $ 30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps -LRB- shoots like 300-350 -RRB-
 ok ive had this gun for about a year nothing bad has happened to it still shoots fine only bad thing is that the battery -LRB- or atleast my battery -RRB- dosent last to long about 20mins remember this gun is only like 30 $ and its as good as a gun worth twice that much i used to have 4 guns a sniper 2 pistols and this 1 my pistols broke sniper was eather stolen or i cant find it -LRB- i think someone stole it -RRB- so all that was left was this if u dont have alot of money and want a good trustworth gun GET THIS GUN also u might wan na order another clip for it
 This gun is amazing but the only problem is that I can `` t figure out how to remove the scope . Does somebody know how ?
 This gun is sweet . It has a high rate of firer but the scope SUCKS im a sniper and the scope is the worst i have ever seen .
 the styer aug is an enty level gun that i bought a couple weeks ago the scope that comes with it you should trash right away this gun goes in the middle 200s it curves alot and is made of abs plastic now be carefull with the safty mine fell out the magazine that came with it fills if you push it in 50 .20 bbs fit so i bought a hi cap mag from airsplat.com the gun or at least mine when you fully charge it goes for a hour and a half but overall a very good start up gun also this is nothing like the tokyo marui that gun is expensive for it 's perfomance
 I 've been doing airsoft for a year or so now but this is the first airsoft gun I 've owned , it shoots very fast and is very accurate . The scope is not magnified but the gun comes with an additional sight that works much better , but if you want a scope you can get a decent one for about $ 20 . The only thing I dont like about this gun is that the battery takes very long to charge , as with any electric airsoft gun , but other than that the gun is practically flawless.Also , Combat Optical has very fast delivery just on standard shipping so dont pay any extra for shipping on it , mine only took three business on std . shipping .
 Obviously your in the league to be starting air soft if your investing in an aeg , and chances are that if you 've investigated Its not all that cheap if you really want to go professional . This is a very good weapon modeled after the civilian steyr aug bull-pup design with low rail system . It claims to replicate a Tokyo Marui but it really isent in the same league . The TM model ranges anywhere from $ 300 to $ 500 which no doubt will put a dent in your wallet so it filters the average player to something a little more cheap . The TM is a magnificent rifle though , created out of solid materials , with exact weight , dimension 's , and everything else that its real life counterpart has ; at the cost of 300 bucks . Now the model right above us here is created to be an OEM copy . Do n't believe that this rifle cost $ 200 because there 's no way it possibly could , whoever posted that were probably pulling a `` retails at 200 bucks but were only charging you '' kind of deal . Ive seen the max price for this rifle at jungle toys for $ 100 and that included some extra gear . THIS IS NOT AN AEG its is an LPEG which might turn some off as being weak but I must say out of all the LPEG 's on the market the steyr comes the closest to being the full blown aeg powerhouse . retail for this gun is around $ 40 and from what I have researched www.airsplat.com does have the lowest price -LRB- I paid $ 46.98 with shipping -RRB- . as far as how well it shoots I have seen different opinions . Do n't believe what stores tell you because most of them lie with the fps -LRB- feet per second -RRB- ratios . Some compare it to firing faster than a tokyo , psh , no way but for the cost it shoots well enough . Now to give you the real fps . I chrono the gun as shooting an average of 170fps out of the box which really is pretty decent from an lpeg . VERY IMPORTANT
 Well starting off il just say the kid under me is very WRONG . This is not a replica of the Steyr AUG A1 , the A1 is the military version with a 2x scope on it that is fixed and can not be removed . This is the civilian AUG. . It has a site rail that you can choose your own optics . I suggest a red dot or a 4x44 . And someone farther down said something like bullpups suck because bullpup means that its only a right handed weapon . Thats wrong the real AUG can be re-configured to a lefty gun very easy.And the shells can be made to shoot out the other side . the word `` Bullpup '' describes the sizes of the gun . Its a litle smaller and lighter than your average assualt rifle.Okay back to the this AUG BE . Its a great gun . Its one of the best lpeg on the market . It will shoot around 240fps with .12 and 200fps with .20 . the .12 curve a little to the right . so i would defently go with the .2 grams becuase they shoot dead on with this gun and you only loose 40 fps . * If you want more power hear are your options * YES you can swap a TM AUG mech box into this gun , its easy and you will be shootin around 330 to 450fps . Slight modifications to the reciever are needed.YES TM high cap mags also work with this gun with slight shaving to the mag.NEGATIVESForegrip is really flimsy . I modified it by using super glue . I Also filled the foregrip completly full of hot glue through a small hole in the bottom of it . This will totally get rid of its flimsyness and its hollow plasticy feeling . If you do this the foregrip will no longer be able to fold up . This has no effect on the firing.i hope i helped you make a dicision . This AUG will never be as good as a TM or classic army but HAY ! look at the price
 This gun is way better than I expected . My friend ordered a 50 dollar 5 start gun and this one is better than it . Definately get this . It is amazing . The range is freaking good and the power is insane . My friends were cowering in fear . Muhahaha .
 This gun is a exellent gun for it 's price and great shipping . This gun shoots hard and accurate . It 's quite and it has built in safty and the trigger has a built in mode switcher ! If you only pull the triiger a little bit it will shoot semi even if you keep holding it ! For full auto just pull it all the way COUTION if you hold the trigger in full auto for more than 8 seconds you 'll strip the gears and burn the motor out what do you expect it is n't real ! I got this gun today it was so easy to assemble . The scope is fake it 's so bad but hey draw cross hairs and walla ! you have a working scope or you can buy one for $ 20 and mount it . This gun comes with Battery , Charger , 100 bb 's and saftey glasses . The cock on the side of the gun does n't do anything but it 's cool ! it goes back if you pull it . The guns only downfall is the battery which you can replace without upgrading the gun ! The gun shoots it 's hardest when battery is fully charged . Also comes with quickloder ! Have fun if you get this gun ! Amazon is amazing !!!!!
 Here is the basis of the gun 's quality : PROS-1 . Accurate to an extent2 . Awsome design , looks sexy .3 . Speed loader is incredibly useful .3 . You can completely disassemble it and it still works after .4 . The front handle is removeable with a scruedriver .5 . Its got weight to it .6 . Its big ... 7 . Durable , it can take some hits.CONS-1 . BBs in the clip will go by really fast .2 . The battery takes forever to charge.But the cons are blown away because it only costs 30 $ ! It is worth 100 $ It is awsome for beginners , hell , I would buy another to give to my friend just so I could shoot him ! But the only thing that I didnt understand is why put in the mock scope ... I used it for target practice , it dosent even have crosshairs ! Now that i think about it , i dont really need any sights , the other sights are cool , they can fold down and are fully adjustable . So , in conclusion ! If you want to go airsofting with some friends and you wish you had a kick ass gun , get this gun ... n_nP . S.This gun acually has no semi auto ability at all ! If you look at how it fires , on the inside , it is unable to do that , unless the moter was faster , which can be arranged . 5/5
 I am obsessed with this gun ! It is so amazingly powerful -LRB- 280 fps -RRB- , I took out a pop can from almost 50 feet away after only a couple shots ! This gun is my primary weapon for battles and is amazing . I like the semi/auto switch feature on this gun . If you pull down the trigger half way , it is semi auto , but when you squeeze the trigger all the way and hold , you get an automatic sniper weapon ! The rate of fire is fast , really fast , and this gun is very accurate . This is because of the bullpup magazine set-up . The magazine is behind the handle so the barrel length is increased without increasing the size of the gun . After having a night shootout , I realized I needed an LED light , so I slapped one to the side of the front with black electric tape . The two things that I had problems with were the safety button and the front handle . I still do n't know how to get the hanle into an up position -LRB- you 're supposed to be able to -RRB- , and my safety fell off because I pushed it so hard that it went through the side of the gun . I should n't have done that . Anyway this gun gets a whopping 5 stars from me because of it 's power , accuracy , great price -LRB- it comes with tons of accessories -RRB- , amazing rof , and overall a good battle rifle .
 I bought this last wednesday -LRB- 10/5 -RRB- and it came today proving Combat Optical Store has good shipping methods . This is my thrird AEG and its very good for its price but the scope is the only downfall , its a cheap piece of plastic but hey , thats not their fualt they did n't make it . Other then that it shoots fast and hard plus it looks and feels incredibly real . If your looking for a good beginers AEG , this is definately it .
 When I bought this gun I knew it was going to be good . Once it came it looked even better than on the Website . The only thing that wasnt decent was the scope it wasnt even magnafide , everything else was great.It shot very far and accurate.What was very great about it was that it took less than 30 seconds to load all the 50 bullets.Last it had very great detail .
 One , I am not Nancy Ronan , but I am not really encouraged to have my own account . Second , this gun is so flippin ' good ! I have had it for one day and am loving it . The scope really stinks and the mag has low capacity , but everything else is nearly perfect ! It shoots around 280 fps at least , and for an amazing price too ! It is so accurate and goes right in the area I want it to ! Overall , you save a lot of money for a gun that is as good as most guns over $ 100 !
 I bought this pouch at the same time I bought a new SwissChamp . I agree with other comments that the fit is snug to the point of being difficult . I ended up putting a larger split ring on the knife so I 'd have something to tug with to get it out . I hope it loosens up with use.That said , the case is sturdy and attractive , although I 'd have a preference for stitching that matched the leather -LRB- black on black -RRB- instead of contrasting -LRB- white on black -RRB- . The steel on mine is on the opposite side to what 's shown in the pictures .
 Product arrived quickly and was sealed in factory packaging -LRB- as expected -RRB- . Given as a gift , but looked great !
 First case arrived with the snap off center , such that the flap was turned 1/4 '' from vertical . -LSB- ... -RSB- This is my third case like this . Well , my first one in the 80 's did n't have the sharpening steel . I bought that first one after my knife dropped from my pocket when I fell crossing the dunes at the beach . -LRB- I also broke my fishing rod on that fall . Should not have emptied that bottle of Jack before attacking that hill . -RRB- The first two lasted 10 years . Being an engineer and not caring about fashion , I wear it most all the time . All three needed a shoe-shop repair of the belt strap after about 5 years . The steel is not a toy -- it works very well when used regularly and when you do n't abuse your knife blades . If they do get abused -LRB- like cutting a lot of corrugated cardboard -RRB- you 'll still need to use a stone.When the case gets scratched from rolling around on the ground -LRB- or sand dunes -RRB- , a little shoe polish gets it looking like new -- in case you 're going out for dinner . When my last one got old and soft -LRB- like me -RRB- , the steel dropped out and I lost it . It it were n't for that I 'd have probably waited another year or two before replacing it . A replacememt steel cost almost as much as the complete case w/steel . Now I have 2 , so I 'm set for retirement . ; '' -RRB-
 Victorinox - X-Large Zermatt Pouch , Leather , Black w/SteelI have had these sheaths before and found them to be excellent quality , with a long life . Replacement has been caused by loss or purchase of new knife . I appreciate the sharpening steel . I usually dampen the sheath and form it to the knife for a tight fit . I will no doubt be ordering another for another blade I have recently purchased . I have tried other sheaths made of other materials and have been very disappointed with their durability and security . The little extra in cost is cheap as compared to the loss of a blade.Russ
 I had an original case that I carried for ten years , while a little worn and shiny still worked great until the new puppy decided it was a teething toy . This product is a exact replacement so I 'm good for at least 10 more years or another puppy .
 I HAVE BEEN CARRYING A SWISS ARMY SINCE MY SECOND VIET-NAM TOUR AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE WORKMANSHIP AND QUALITY . THEY NEVER DISAPPOINT AND WOULD FIND IT HARD TO REPLACE ITS USE ON A DAILY BASIS . UNFORTUNATELY , AS WITH ALL THINGS , THE LEATHER EVENTUALLY GIVES UP TO AGE AND HAS TO BE REPLACED . I LOOK FORWARD TO MANY MORE YEARS OF EXCELLENT SERVICE FROM YOUR PRODUCT .
 I 've had the HRM for over a year now , so I feel pretty well prepared to give it a fair review.I 'll give the bad first , since at one time , I was ready to throw the thing in the trash .1 . For the first week , I had a difficult time figuring out the menus to get the information that I wanted after a workout.In defense of the manufacturer , I only casually looked at the manual once I had it configured for my heart rate zones , age , weight , etc.If I 'd read it a bit more thoroughly , I could have saved myself some aggravation . I suppose that 's the curse of being a male .2 . There is no back-light . I 've gotten so used to Timex HRMs and watches that I did n't pay attention when I was buying this and did n't notice that it was n't included . I do early morning bicycling and would really , really love this feature . Also , because it has a reasonably stylish design and displays date and time very clearly , I wear it as my regular watch . So if your listening SIGMA , I would really , really , really like a back-light feature on this watch .3 . When changing the watch battery at one time I lost my language settings and the watch defaulted to German , if I remember correctly . I had to go out to the Sigma Sport web site to lookup the manual to figure out how navigate the menus to get myself back to English .4 . Now , the really annoying . When I first got the device , I was having problems with connectivity . It would sometimes take 5 minutes of exercise before the chest strap and watch would synchronize . It would then frequently drop the connection during the workout . I bought new batteries for both pieces twice . I bought electrode gel to get a better connection between my skin and the chest strap . By the time I decided it was a piece of junk , the warranty had expired . I shelved it for about 3 months before I stumbled upon a reasonably priced replacement chest strap on the internet and decided to buy it . That solved my problem , and I 'm in love again.Now for the good .1 . This HRM has features normally found only on much more expensive devices . It 's very cool that you can get your calories burned per workout as well as a running total . The calories burned seems fairly accurate when compared with calorie counter on our treadmill . It also lists time in the various heart rate zones , which I find pretty useful .2 . The display is very clear , both as a watch and when displaying hear rate information .3 . The menus now , after long-term use , seem pretty intuitive . I have no trouble navigating to the features that I want .4 . The silicon rubber watchband is very comfortable . It seems nearly indestructible . It 's easy to clean with a wet cloth , and does n't stink . I sweat buckets when I 'm working out hard and the no-stink-thing is a big deal . My old velcro sport bands would hold the sweat and start smelling funky in no time . I do n't have to worry about wearing this watch out in public and having people wonder if I have a dead mouse in my pocket.The take home on this is that even with my initial problems , I still love this watch . If it had a back light , it would be perfect . ******************************* REVISION ************************************** I 've had this HRM/watch for a long time now , and someone here on Amazon just pointed out to me that it does indeed have a back light feature . It is activated by simultaneously pressing the 2 opposing buttons on the bottom on the watch . I apparently missed that feature in the manual and it 's not one that I was likely to stumble across during normal use.I 've been using for 2 years now and it still works like a champ . With the discovery of the backlight feature , I 'd now give it 5 stars .
 I 've had mine now since 2007 -LRB- it is now 2011 -RRB- and concur with other reviewers about the general remarks , both positive and less positive : - Has a lot of functions and features - So much so that it can be a bit complicated to find the info you want - Is very reasonably priced - Occasionally had synching issues with HR monitor -LRB- more on this later -RRB- but not oftenI had n't used it for some time and pulled it out to start using it again as I try to go back to running after two leg breaks and knee surgery -LRB- wish me luck ! -RRB- . Unfortunately when I pulled the watch out I found the battery had died . No matter how hard I tried I could n't get the battery cover to open and it just stripped until there was no way to get it off at all.So here 's the great thing ... I contacted Sigma through their website and within a day was contacted by someone in their IL office with a Return Authorization number . So I sent it back to them and very quickly they repaired it and sent it back to me . Not only did they replace the battery cover -LRB- and the batteries ! -RRB- they ran some tests on it and found some issues with the heartrate synching so replaced the electronics and back plate as well . They also sent me some Buh-Bump cream to put on with the heartrate monitor to increase conductivity . AND they included a discount for future Sigma product purchase . All at NO CHARGE.Consider the cost of the watch , the many functions it performs and the excellent customer service of Sigma and I just have to go with five stars .
 This watch does everything you need for personal training and is an unbeatable value , especially considering that it fully beats the features of competing watches costing 30 dollars more.The included chest transmitter belt is easy to adjust and comfortable to wear , quickly linking up with the watch and maintaining a signal throughout long workouts . The HRM automatically sets up your optimal training zones based on the initial interview and audibly alerts you as you go from zone to zone during workouts , although I found the visual zone indicator to be a bit on the small side to quickly glance at if mounted to bike handlebars . The watch gives you a per-workout and overall statistics which are very helpful and complete.The only minor aspects that prevent me from giving this HRM five stars is the decent but not perfect build & aesthetics of the body/strap , and instruction manual & watch menu interface that could use some more refinement . This is certainly not a deal-breaker though , and you quickly get used to the interface with repeated use.Good stuff
 I have the PC15 for already a couple of months , using it in the Gym mainly.The watch is well built and solid . I wear it daily though it is not the nicest watch seen . It works fine with no prolems so far.Pros ----- The minimal set of features I needed is supported . This set consists of HR , Cals , HR zones , % of max HR , Tansmitter 's compatibility to Gym equipment.Max HR and avg HR measurements are also given.Cons -- Menu navigation - Navigation is hard to control while at workout . Switching between displays requires attention as normally more than 5 steps are needed with 2 buttons to control.Back light - light stays on for about 3 seconds only . After that it turns off even if you are still not done with the menu 's buttons . You 'll have to push the backlight button again.No automatic light on.My old Polar was much better in that sense.Watch - No week 's day , no seconds.Stopper - There is actually no real stopper inside . Resolution is of seconds , no fractions . After 10hrs the resolution degrades to minutes . It takes about 10 buttons push to get to the stopper from the main menu . In case of no signal -LRB- if strap is off -RRB- the stopper display switches to the main time/date display.Lap Counter - No heart rate measurements per a lap , only time/lap .
 Works good the only problem I see is when trying to locate the heart rate signal ... it takes a couple of minutes to do so but other than that the watch works great .
 I 've been running with Heart Rate monitors for over five years . In this time I have used products by Sports Instruments and its predecessor Freestyle . The thing I liked about their heart rate monitors was the abundance of data , in particular the 3 zones -LRB- health , fitness , performance -RRB- . The Sigma gives this data as well as the percentage of time spent in each zone . Naturally it also gives average heart rate and estimated calorie burn . As indicated in the description the watch also has numerous other features , but I really do n't use them . I primarily like to track my time in the various zones , so I was very happy to find that the Sigma PC 15 provides this data.When I first used my PC15 I thought it was n't working . It turns out that I needed to moisten the chest strap a bit -LRB- as per the instructions ! -RRB- . My previous monitor/strap must have been more sensitive as I never had to moisten . In any case , once I moistened the electrodes the watch picked up the signal almost immediately.The monitor is definitely worthy of 5 stars . I give it only 4 stars because the menu is n't the most intuitive . The instructions are somewhat confusing and could have been clearer.Finally , I am very happy with my Sigma PC 15 and recommend it as an alternative to its higher-priced , name-brand alternatives .
 This is a good HR monitor for the price , both myself and my Girlfriend have one and we like them a lot . They 're mainly very accurate and have good functions.PROs
 I 've had two Polars that never quite worked properly and eventually quit after a year . The Sigma works consistently , accurately and is easy to use yet gives a lot of information . Highly recommended .
 Well functioning device that gives lots of useful information ; monitor can double as a watch if you desire . The button sequence is not exactly intuitive , so I have to review the instructions from time to time -LRB- thus 4 stars instead of 5 -RRB- . I would recommend it to those who want to monitor their aerobic capacity .
 had a lot of trouble getting this thing set up and still do n't know how to get all the bennies from it . it works as a watch and takes the heart rate fine but I would have liked a much less complex monitor.My fault for not understanding what I was buying .
 I looked at two heart rate monitors before this one . They were both complicated and difficult to program . This one was easy to program and easier to use . If you 're looking for simplicity I highly recommend this heart rate monitor .
 I 've used this watch for over 3 years , and it still works pretty good . Of course it ran out of batteries quickly , but it is logic since it does not have an on/off switch in the strap , not the same case for the watch , where if not used as a heart monitor it will last almost for a year.In all the time , I 've been using it -LRB- as a heart monitor and regular watch -RRB- I can say that it does not have become `` rusty '' since this model is all plastic made . It has a very good `` o '' rings in the battery 's door , so I have never had a problem with moisture , even though I have used it while swimming in pools and in the open ocean -LRB- just the watch -RRB- . I was surprised with the two bad reviews . I think they had bad luck , and one of the reviewers is referencing to a different watch.So IMHO I will recommend this watch and definitively will buy it again when mine fails ... if it ever happens .
 This HRM may lack in bells and whistles but it does its primary job , providing heart rate feedback , very well . Once I got the device started the first time , I 've had no difficulties at all . It 's definitely a good value for a relatively simple HRM .
 Compared to the other heart monitors , I feel this was a huge value . My husband asked me how much I paid for it when I first got it because he could n't believe it was less than $ 100 . Training with a heart monitor has changed my workouts for the better and improves the efficiency of my fitness routine . I bought this for spin class , but now I use it for every workout . I highly recommend it !
 I own this product myself and liked it so much I bought it for my dad as a gift . It works very well , has a large display , and the strap is not uncomfortable at all . It has a ton of features , so much in fact that it 's a bit confusing learning how everything works at first . This is the only reason I gave 4 stars .
 I ordered this item when I saw it on an Amazon.com special . It was the right price and had the chest band . It actually works really well and does all the thinking for me , for instance I put in my gender , weight , and age and it calculates the correct cardiovascular zones for me , keeps track of KCal , total KCal , and can keep track of laps . Its consistent , meaning that if I do approximately the same exercise I burn the same number of calories , so I can rest assured that it is functioning correctly and takes stable , reproducible readings.I do n't know if its because I 'm female , but I do have some problems with the signal dropping from time to time . Its usually very brief and typically happens during sit-ups or stretching , which is fine with me as that 's not really when I need to watch my heart rate . I also have to make sure the plastic that covers the sensor is warm and I have to breathe on it to provide some moisture so that it will actually start reading before I get 5 minutes into my workout . I also can not use a sports bra I have to use a top with a shelf bra , or exercise top with a shelf bra . Fabric from my sports bras tended to get in the way of the chest band and caused some signal problems , this of course is not the fault of the chest band .
 While the slew of menus and features in this HRM may be daunting to those using it for the first time , it soon becomes very simple , and those extra features in the product description become quite handy . My favorite feature is the display of the `` zone '' you 're in , calculated from a percentage of your maximum rate . It seems to be quite accurate , and the only real criticism I have is that the backlight requires you to press two buttons at once , potentially going into another menu if you press one button slightly before the other . Also , the light turns off after a short time , even if you are still navigating through the menus .
 Price is Good instead of paying more money i prefer this heart rate , and easy to use , You can change the watch and band 's battery by yourself.The chest band has started to unstitch maybe due to the perspiration i will need to replace it.Nice to use it and exactly what i needed . Tks
 So fare the monitor has performed flawlessly . Nothing real fancy , but give me all the information I need . Easy to use and good instructions . Definitely a product I would recommend for an entry level HR monitor
 This heart rate system was so easy to use . You set your information and go . I do suggest setting it up using the guide , otherwise you will get lost in the menus . However , it works so great at the gym . Most of the treadmills , elipticals , and cycling machines will pick up the signal and send it to the machines Heart Rate Display . It is a good training tool !
 I bought this HRM after my last Polar gave out . I 'm pleased . The Sigma does everything it claims to do , and does it well . I wish the display were a little brighter , but otherwise I 'm happy with it . If it were a bit more readable under my rather dim gym lights I would have given it 5 stars . This may not be a problem for anyone else .
 I 've been shopping around for a heart rate monitor for a while , Polar is the recommendation from everyone , however I did n't want to buy it for 2 reasons , its way too ugly and cheaply made , and very expensive for the specs , I ended up buying this HRM after I saw a cyclocomputer made by Sigma Sport , it was such wonderful , easy to use computer , so I thought their heart rate monitor would be designed and built the same way , I was n't wrong , this HRM is amazing , very accurate , and most importantly it easy to use , straight forward , and loaded with functions without making your life complicated , it has all the features you need plus little extra for luxury , however without the hassle of digging around with buttons to get the important data output you need , it can display all the information you need with large print , so you do n't have to concentrate a lot to read while cycling or running , unlike Timex or some Polar models , where the display is too small that you have to look longer to read it , quite distracting and frustrating when cycling , more over Sigma Sport utilized the whole surface of the watch to be as display -LRB- you can tell from the picture -RRB- and they placed all the buttons on the side , as a result you can get your heart rate , heart rate zone -LRB- health , fitness or Power -RRB- , your percentage heart rate out of maximum + training time or calories or lap count -LRB- you choose more if you want -RRB- all in one screen with huge print , very impressive , absolutely ergonomic design.You can define your Max heart rate with the zones your self , if you know them , or you can simply enter your gender , age and weight and let the watch do all the work for you.Another advantage is the chest strap and the sensor , you can change the battery by your self which is a major advantage over other HRMs , moreover the sensor is very sensitive , you do n't even have to wet it to get the reading , did n't have distortion from electric signals yet , and very rarely lost the signal , when it happens the watch captures it again within few seconds.The watch has a very attractive design , I found my self wearing it all the time instead of my regular watch , it has all the functions of practical watch , like time , 12 or 24 hr format , day and date , stop watch , alarm , backlight , plus nice looking , something you do n't see in Polar models , The watch comes with bike bar attachment so you can mount it while cyclingThe only disadvantage is the size , its big and more suitable for men , I believe it would be too big for ladies arms , you can compare it in size to Casio G shock models , however its much thinner , but mounting it on Bike bar would solve this problem.Over all I see this watch as a perfect HRM in regard to function reliability appearance and price , highly recommended
 I have used this HRM for 4 months now and love it . I mainly use it riding my bike . Comes with a handlebar quick-mount for bike that is nice to use so can see it always without taking hands of bar.Trying to decide I found Polar -LRB- and others -RRB- had too many models and they carefully structured features/price to make you spend $ 50 to $ 150 more . This HRM has a ton of features -LRB- all that I need -RRB- and a great flexible display . I do n't think it has a light.While working I like to display the Heart menu so I can see % of max constantly and a % graph and my current HR . It 's easy to move thru the menus and see all the info . Keeps a running tally of calories , I think I burned 20,000 so far.The Sigma Sport website is very well done and shows all the info you need to decide . This is a best buy .
 This product exceeded my expectations by a long shot . It is literally easier to use than my watch . It is set up with menus which you can scroll through rather than memorizing witch buttons to hold down for 5 seconds . The menus are also clearly labeled on the outside of the watch . The only set up this product requires is Time/Date and weight/age . the watch does the rest for you . press one button it will start to log your heart info press another button , and it will stop . you can also pause . it will beep each time you enter a new heart rate zone . At the end of a workout it has all your information logged for you . including max HR , average HR , Calories burned , length of workout and loads of other features . This is highly recommended for anyone who is looking at staying or getting into shape.I was further impressed with the product when I took it to the gym , I bought this mainly for my bike riding , but soon found out that most treadmills pick up the sensor and display it on the machine , which is great so you do n't have to look at the watch or even wear it while running . I am sure that is a feature all the HR monitors have , but it 's just another great reason to invest in one if you are a treadmill user .
 My earlier comments are below ... July 2008 Update ... My SIGMA PC15 is now dead . It lasted less than a year.Note
 All in all , I liked the functionality provided by this heart rate monitor . Unfortunately common bodily flexing can lift the contacts from the skin just enough for it to lose the heart signal , where it starts an incessant and annoying beeping . This will happen despite being covered head to toe in highly conductive sweat , possibly thanks to the design of the sensors.Aside from that minor annoyance , the watch remains easy to use , offers review of your last workout with all the expected averages , maximum sustained levels , and some accumulated values for total workout length and calories burned . Very good price for all the features it offers , and it even comes with a handle-bar mount for all you bikers out there .
 I use it for cycling . All the info I need to see is on the screen at one time . No hands off the bars to push buttons . The chest strap works with the fitness equipment at the gym too .
 For the money , this one does a great job . It works reliably and is flexible enough to view anything you 'd want -LRB- current heartrate PLUS ... max HR , avg HR , % of max HR , calories burned , training time , more -RRB- . If that was n't enough , you can turn off the HR monitor and use it like a watch . You can even change the name across the bottom to anything you want -LRB- like YOUR name -RRB- . Indigo night light works WELL in dark environments .
 For the money the Sigma PC 15 is a bargain . It has the Feature set of many more expensive HRM 's , it 's easy to program , well made , and as a bonus it comes with a handlebar mount for cycling . I have owned several Polar HRM 's over the years and eventually you reach the dreaded point in time when you have to send them back to Polar to have the batteries replaced . In my opinion , one of the best features of the Sigma PC 15 is that you can replace the batteries in the watch and the belt yourself . If you have never had to deal with replacing your batteries yearly with Polar , you can not begin to appreciate how great this is . It 's a little big as another reviewer said , compare it to a Casio G Shock watch in size . It 's a steal for $ 65 from Niagara Cycle Works . I feel it 's one of the few things that I paid for and got more than my money 's worth . That does n't happen enough these days . Buy it .
 I purchased this monitor based on a review by another user . He did not lie . This monitor is easy to use if you read the instructions , accurrate , and is 2/3 the cost of comparable heart monitors in the stores such as Cabelas , Sports Authority , etc. . The bike attachment is a nice touch .
 Received this product in the timeline promised and in the condition described . Setup was pretty easy once you figureout how to change the language and see whats on the screen , particularly if you are familiar with this type of thing before . I can see where setup could be a challenge for those persons unfamiliar with a computer setup as the user guide is not very friendly.Used it for running and it works well . Have not used it to cycle as yet but plan to do so , as I was attracted to the bicycle holder . It also is good looking enough to wear it as a normal watch .
 Had this for about 3 weeks and used it quite number of times . Programming is straightforward once you get the hang of the menu functions . I do n't use any gel or water to get it going , but I notice that the HRM only responds when I start moving around , then the measurement is rock steady - note I do n't think the stopwatch will start until the heart rate is monitoring . It works perfectly during exercise and never misses a beat -LRB- sorry about the pun -RRB- . The watch works well enough and looks solid , although I would n't choose to wear it as a fashion item . Functionality is pretty good with a timer , max and average heart rate and a bonus of calories burned ; I guess based on age , weight as well as heart rate .
 Bought this monitor on recommendation for indoor rower use . It has worked well . Not really intuitive but I 've figured it out . Great price .
 I bought the sigma pc 9 women 's for myself and liked it so much I also bought this one for my husband for valentines day . It works everytime . Love that it has max heart rate . He has never been able to get his heart rate on the treadmill or elpitcal . This works with the precore machines right away with no problems.A must buy !
 Has a lot of useful functions , esp . the average HR and time in each HR zone that the user establishes . Also , it has user replacable batteries in both the watch and chest strap , which is an important advantage.The initial setup requires some careful attention to the instructions , but is not all that difficult if you do that.One problem I 've found is that the heart rate signal is occasionally lost -LRB- drops to zero -RRB- even if the chest strap connectively is good during vigorous exercise . This happens infrequently , but I do n't understand why it should happen it all.Overall , I am very satisfied with this HR monitor .
 This watch does pretty good for the price . I 'm not really sure if it accurate or not because I had a polar 11 and the amount of burned calories seemed higher with it but it started losing connection after the battery change , so i replaced it with this . I like the fact that you can put your name on the front of this watch . The connection seems to be good most of the time except when in position for push ups or to pick up weights it does lose connection breifly . As far is the fit of the watch , its a little bulky for a womans wrist.At first the set up of the watch was very diffucult to figure out , but once I got the language figured out it was a breeze . They could have done aa better job on the instruction manual , because when I emailed into Sigma they promptly sent me how to instructions that were to the letter and easy to follow . Over all I 'm very happy with this monitor .
 I have this device for over a year and I love it . It is accurate and simple to use -LRB- once you learn how to -RRB- . All the threadmils I have run on were able to receive and identify the belt signal . this is a great device .
 This is the only road bike we found designed for 9-12 year old girls . With one limitation , this is a great transition from a 20 '' child 's bike.Our oldest daughter was outgrowing her 20 '' child 's bike . Both of her parents are traditional road bikers as compared to cheap mountain bike riders . She wanted gears and a freewheel , and we determined 24 '' was the desired wheel size . Bike shops and the Trek monster only offer mountain bikes as the next size up after a 20 '' child 's bike . The geometry options were terrible . They forced the young riders to be too stretched out in length . It may not be as bad for larger boys , but definitely incorrect for smaller girls . Additionally , these mountain bikes have value added marketing destroying any other potential . Shocks are added which add weight and bulk , making them hard to maneuver . The shocks are ridiculous since few children are heavy enough to activate them . The bulk , weight , and poor geometry hinder the ability of young children to ride the common 24 '' bikes . In short , most bikes for this age group are built to sell and not to ride.Then we finally found two options . LL Bean offered a mountain bike specifically designed for 9-12 year old girls . This was a fine choice although we preferred traditional drop handlebars and road geometry and gears . This Denali 24 '' girls bike is perfect . The 19 '' bar height allows a safe stop and start . While it comes with lower end Shimano grip shifters , they work smoothly and are appropriate given the aggressive pricing of this bike . The frame is a nice 7005 aluminum and the other fine components offer a decent weight.I wrote Terry bikes to suggest they consider this age group as potential future customers , but Terry never responded.Our daughter is a small 9 year old weighing only 51 pounds . She is also on the shorter side of girls her age . It took only a day for her to get familiar with the handling and shifting . She is riding faster and longer distances than she ever could with the 20 '' child 's bike and we are enjoying our times together . I fully expect this bike to last her for many years.The only negative was the brakes . The traditional brake levers , under the drop bars , are too low and need a wider hand to reach than our daughter has . The brakes took too much strength to pull given the grip width and position . The solution was easy . We added inline break levers on the top bar . This was not ideal given the bar shifters are in the same location we wanted the new brake levers . I needed to move the shifters inwards to make room but in the end , the new brake levers works . If Danali would consider adding the shifters as standard , this bike would be perfect out of the box.In summary , we are grateful to Denali as a bike manufacturer for considering this age transition as important for creating long term riders . This is a great bike for 9-12 year old girls and was a great price on Amazon . I wish our local bike shops would consider carrying this type of product .
 My husband and I have been runners , but wanted to start biking and did not want to spend a lot of money . He did some research and according to other people who had bought it , this was a very good bike for the money . I enjoy it immensely . Of course , it 's not as light as the bikes that are over a thousand dollars , but it is fun to ride , shifts fairly smoothly , brakes well and feels good on the road . Definitely the bike to buy if you want to try cycling without the huge investment !
 This is really the only option for a kid who 's outgrown a starter bike and enjoys longer rides . That said , it 's a really good option . Got this one for my girl , 8 , and the boy 's version for my 11 year old.Tip
 First of all , a Thank You to the previous reviewers . The bike arrived 3 days after I ordered it and was exactly as I expected . Assembly required , brakes and shifters needed to be adjusted , but the frame was reasonably well put together , and everything worked . And the brakes were useless for small hands . I added inline levers the way others have suggested , but I moved the shifters to the barends . There is a `` customer image '' showing this . I also wrote a detailed web page with instructions , but I believe I 'm not allowed to link to it . So I will quote it instead : >> Finding a road bike for a small child turned out to be really difficult . I thought I 'd make this page to write up what I learned in the process . The `` GMC Denali , '' possibly the worst name for a bicycle ever , is made by Who Knows What company , and it 's available at amazon and department stores . What 's nice about it is this
 This was the only option we could find for our growing daughter that was n't closer to a grand in price . As a family we tend to take off and ride our local rail trail for several miles , often riding to other nearby towns . Our daughter was doing up to 15 mile trips on her 20 '' that she outgrew . We really wanted a bike with lightweight wheels and tires for long rides . Her 20 '' that she outgrew was 7 speed , and therefore she was already comfortable shifting on hills . Also her natural cadence is much higher than her friends that learned on single speed bikes.There are at least 4 different 24 '' tire sizes that are not interchangeable . This size is the only one that has the option of using skinny road tires . However the tires that come on it are a medium width that 's about perfect for our local rail trail made of packed gravel . It 's nice knowing we have the option to use pavement tires if we want to.Our daughter actually did n't like the road handlebars , but everything else was good considering the price -LRB- not high end components , but serviceable -RRB- . I switched the handlebars to an alloy straight bar -LRB- $ 10 -RRB- , and found Shimano 7x3 combined trigger shifters/brakes -LRB- another $ 35 -RRB- . The stock twist shifters will actually go on a straight bar , with the addition of simple brake levers.She now has the equivalent of a fitness bike , with geometry appropriate for her age , That rolls easily on lightweight wheels , that allows road tires if we want to add them , that allows shifting to go over hills ... for very little money compared to the other options . But more importantly our daughter loves it .
 Like a few of the other reviewers , my girls really struggled with the drop bars and included brake levers . I purchased two of these , one for my 9 year old and one for my 8 year old . We live in the mountains of Colorado and brakes are pretty important . I swapped out the drop bars for a midrise bar and bought a couple sets of Avid reach adjustable brake levers . I should point out that for maximum braking power , the brake pads should be sanded with a medium grit sandpaper to remove the factory shine . Once the new bars and levers were installed and the brakes were adjusted , the bike worked great . Know that you will need to plunk down an extra $ 50-75 to make this bike safe . Beyond the brake issue , this is a nice quality bike for the price . Not knowing how fast your kids are going to outgrow a bike , it 's really hard to justify spending $ 500 or more for a 24 '' wheeled bike . Do n't hesitate to buy one of these for your kid !
 This bike is a great deal for the money , which is why I gave it four stars . Shipping was very timely . The bike came packaged well in cardboard surrounds and plastic standoffs . There was no damage and the major assemblies were put together . But , like another reviewer said , they were just slapped on with no fine tuning -LRB- which is why I did n't give it 5 stars -RRB- . I assembled all the basics , but I got to a point where I knew I needed help . I could n't get the stem to sit right . Plus , I wanted to ensure the brakes and derailleurs were set right . I paid to have the rest put together and tuned up . If you are not a bike mechanic you 'll probably need some help.I took my 11 y/o daughter out to test it and the bike rode very well . It is a good fit for her at 4 ' 7 '' . It accelerated smoothly . She had trouble reaching and pulling the brakes . She 's on the shorter side for her age , but only barely.My daughter is transitioning from a ` dept store ' bike , so I think this is perfect for the stage she 's in . We plan for her to do some sprint/mini-sprint triathlons with my wife and I . We had considered Fuji and Felt 's 24 inch kid 's road bikes , but just could n't spend the $ 700 to $ 800 they are asking . Considering she 'll only fit the bike for another year or two , it was the right price.It 's on the heavy side , considering it 's aluminum . I thought it would be lighter since it 's a small bike . I have n't weighed it , but I 'd guess it 's about 25 pounds .
 This bike was my birthday present from my husband . I researched for months and talked with a friend that is an avid biker before deciding on this bike . I love my bike , it is the perfect style and color . I am 5 ' 5 and the bike suits me well . The pink and black colors are awesome -LRB- especially since I found a matching helmet -RRB- . Assembly was pretty simple for me to do , my biker friend tweaked it a bit for me . I am able to shift the gears with no problems and the brakes are good . This is a wonderful bike and I would recommend it to others . The shipping did not take long either -LRB- I used regular shipping -RRB- .
 It was time for our daughter to graduate to a bigger bike for her 7th Birthday . We searched for `` best girl 's road bike '' and were directed to this one . Read the other reviews they are accurate
 As advertised by others the handle bar and brakes do n't really work for an 11 year old , espically a small 11 year old . After new brake grips , cables , handlebar and stem my stepdaughter loved the bike . She had been riding her sisters mountain bike which was too large or her own single speed kids bike , neither of which fit . If the manufacturer would convert to a straight handlebar this product would be a six star bike .
 We got just what we wanted . My daughter really enjoys it.It came in good shape and was just as descibed .
 My daughter started doing kids tris last summer . She is now an average height 7 y/o -LRB- 24 in inseam -RRB- and has been begging for a `` skinny tire '' bike for next summer triathalons . After reading some reviews I was a little worried about putting the bike together and then having to spend a lot of time fixing manufacturer 's problems.I know my way around a bike , and can fix little things , but in no way am I a bike `` expert . '' After recieving the bike , the package was banged up as expected after a long shipment -LRB- being made in China -RRB- which was concerning at first . But the bike was in great condition and packaged well . Next step was assembly . I was concerned that I was going to have to put on brakes , derailers and gear shifters , but they were all already connected and in place . Aseembly required 45 minutes , another 15 minutes with adjustments to brakes and the bike was ready to roll.I have been extremely pleased with the setup , height , and components . This bike will be well worth the money to get us thru the next 3-4 years of races and rides . If you have a child like mine , that is all about competition , having fun , and trying hard you always want to buy the best . I just could n't allow myself to buy a $ 800 bike for a 7 y/o until she realizes that this is really what she wants to do as she gets older.The only downside is the brake levers are likely to be too long for her short hands to reach . After talking with some road bike buddies , a quick fix will cost about $ 40-50 and placement of a straight handlebar so as to make reaching the brake lever easier . I plan on waiting and seeing how she feels about this after she gets this bike for Christmas.Hope this helps anyone trying in a similar situation , not wanting to spend more than $ 200
 Ordered these for my tall husband . He said they are longer than any he ever purchased . He really likes the boots . Good brand and quality product .
 Arrived within time limits , was sized and fit great . Will be buying another pair for myself from this seller .
 These boots are great -- just what I needed for an erosion-control project . I needed to wade into an erosion pool behind a big dam and do some protective work to keep the hole from getting bigger . I used them several times in that project and need to use them a few more times . My original plan was to finish this project and sell the boots , but I like them so well , I 'm going to keep them .
 Love these boots . This is my second pair . I use them to clean out the koi pond . I also like the way that we can connect them so they wo n't slip . And the price is great !
 The boots are about a half size bigger than their size says . They are way bigger than my other men 's size 6 shoes . The ` cleated ' sole is not cleated like an athletic shoe , it just has big treads , thankfully . I know everyone looking at these probably already knows that , but I did n't . I know this is unorthodox , but I bought these just as cute , cheap rain boots . I saw some similar boots on Britain 's Next Top Model and knew I could rock them . I love them and ca n't wait for it to rain . The outside color is only slighty green ; mostly brown . The inside , however , is a nice olive green . It will look great when I fold them down . It 's funny that these cost less than most women 's fashion rain boots , when they are made of at least twice as much rubber . They seem really sturdy . I hope they hold up .
 I read the reviews before I bought it , several said it was small but it is a garden flag , they are small . It was shipped very quickly , love that ! The only thing that I did n't like was that it was n't printed on both sides . I also knew that from the reviews . It was a very resonable price , so I feel that I got what I paid for . I was n't surprised by anything when I got it , I was happy with the product for the price .
 My only gripe is that I was under the impression it included the metal stake for displaying the flag.My own fault though .
 Seller had good communication and shipment was fast . Item arrived in good condition . Very satisfied !
 Nice design , accurate , useful alarm and tough.I like this watch very much . It 's cool !
 The alarm feature on this watch is extremely useful . It is easy and simple to set an alarm for a few minutes or a specific time of day . It is especially useful when negotiating with my children , who often request `` 5 more minutes '' . The reason I did not give 5 stars is the leather band began to stretch from the first day , and broke after less than a year . Also , the dial for the alarm became very difficult to turn after a few months . I eventually used a citric degreaser which fixed it right up .
 This watch is built for rugged use but will also look nice with business wear . It is made to fit and be used by a man .
 I 've always loved the analog , easy-set alarm series from Timex . If , like me , you want an analog watch that is easy to read -LRB- both day and night -RRB- and has an alarm , this watch is a great choice . The analog face has good contrast , so it is easy to read . Setting the alarm is a snap ; simply rotate the bezel to set the alarm `` hands '' and pull the lower crown to the 12 hour or 1 hour position . Setting the alarm for one hour or less is even easier
 love it and founded for a great price !!! everyone i got them for love it too !!! great deal.would buy more from here !!!
 This tool gets a bad rap , and unfairly , I think . Sure it takes time , but it works fine for the occasional wheel building project or replacement spoke . It 's a nice item to have in the tool box for a rainy day when you ca n't be riding . You can build or repair a wheel instead . Even a bike shop might find one of these handy.It 's fairly simple . The tool mounts in a vise . The three rollers emboss threads in the spoke , rather than cut them . This makes for a stronger spoke . You turn the crank and the rollers `` chase '' threads up the spoke . When you get the threaded length you want , you turn the crank in reverse to back the rollers off the spoke.I just used it to thread 36 14-gauge spokes , with no problems at all . -LRB- It threads 14 and 15 gauge spokes . -RRB- The keys to using this tool successfully are to generously use cutting oil -LRB- or an equivalent -RRB- , start with a properly chamfered spoke , and make several passes to get the depth of thread you want.I think one reason this device gets such a bad rap is that people try to make it cut finished threads in one pass . If you tighten down the rollers that much to start , it will be difficult to get a blank spoke to feed into them.Practice with a few extra spokes first . Chamfer the ends slightly with a file or a grinder.Open up the Hozan tool 's rollers by loosening the adjustment nut , until it will easily `` take '' a blank spoke and lightly emboss threads . Back the spoke out , tighten the nut a quarter to half turn , and make another pass through . Repeat this until you get threads embossed deeply enough so that a spoke nipple screws on easily for its full length . That will be your final setting.Now you can back the adjustment nut off a full turn -LRB- 360 degrees -RRB- . This is so you can start a blank spoke . Make a first pass through , back the spoke out , tighten the adjustment nut a half turn , pass the spoke through and back out , and tighten it one half turn again for the final pass . Repeat this process for every spoke you want to thread . After a few you 'll get into a rhythm and things will go faster . Apply more cutting oil with every spoke.After every few spokes clean the rollers . I spray them with WD-40 while holding a folded paper towel underneath , then re-oil them for the next spoke.The instructions say that with proper care this tool will last for years . I do n't see any reason why it wo n't .
 I have a pair of Ellsworth XC wheels ... I love my Ellsworth bikes , but these wheels ... not so much . The main problem is that they are underbuilt for a 200 lb rider , and I was having continual problems with my rear wheel due -LRB- IMO -RRB- to the thin , quad-butted proprietary straight pull spokes they used.Making this worse , the hub and rim are 24 hole parts ... that 's right , 24 holes . So , when I went to respoke the wheel , I could not find straight-pull spokes in the lengths I needed ... My only option , other than throwing the whole mess away and buying a new wheel , was to buy longer spokes and rethread them . That 's what I did ... I ordered DT Swiss DB straight-pull spokes in the closest length available , which turned out to be 10mm longer than my original spokes.I 've used the Hozan to add threads before ... but I did n't do that this time , for two reasons . First , as I explain below , multiple passes are not , IMO , a good idea . But mostly , there is a finite lenght you can thread a spoke before the Hozan reaches it 's limits , and that length would not have put enough thread onto the spokes I used ... I 'd have had to cut them and then add even more thread ... So , I simply cut the spokes to length first , which removed all of the existing thread . Then I rolled new threads using the Hozan . It worked ... but here are my observations from the experience.First , I must disagree with the previous review ... While he 's right when he says it 's much easier if you roll the threads to an intermediate depth first , I do n't think that 's the best way . There is no guarantee that the subsequent deeper passes will exactly match the previous pass , and you may -LRB- and I think , will -RRB- wind up rolling the final thread in a different orientation . If you were using a dies and `` cutting '' threads , this would be analogous to cross-threading in that situation . But , since we 're rolling threads and not cutting them , you probably wo n't notice this when looking at the final result . It will simply deform the threads into the new orientation with each pass . Will it work ? yeah , I tried it and the threads looked fine . But , I 'm fairly certain that they wo n't prove as strong as if you rolled them in one pass . They may still wind up stronger than the threads in an alloy nipple , however , so perhaps it does n't matter . Either way , rolling each spoke three times is a LOT of work if you 're building a 32 or 36 spoke wheel ... I only had to thread 24 spokes , and I still thought it took forever . It took me longer to thread the spokes than it did to build the wheel once I had them ready.Second , it 's VERY important to prep the end of the spoke correctly before trying to thread it ! The other reviewer is correct when he says it 's difficult to roll full-depth threads in one pass ... specifically , it 's harder to get the thread started ! But , if you have the appropriate amount of chamfer on the spoke , this is alleviated somewhat . At any rate , that 's the way the instructions tell you to do it ... in one pass . I found that even with a chamfer on the end of the spoke , it required me to firmly push the handle into the spoke as I rotated it the first 1 1/2 turns . From that point on , it would feed itself.Finally , it 's important to make sure that the vise -LRB- the part of the Hozan that hold the spoke ... NOT the vise you 're using to hold the Hozan itself -RRB- is properly aligned with the axis that the Hozan 's threader spins upon . if it 's not , you 'll wind up with a bend in your spoke somewhere in or near the threaded area . But , even after aligning my Hozan per the directions , I still got a slight bend in the threaded part of the spoke . I believe that this is because the tapered part of my spokes -LRB- where they reduced from 14ga to 15ga -RRB- fell right in the place where the spoke is clamped , leaving it at an angle to the threader . It was a slight bend , and did not prevent the nipples from threading on , or interfere with the build . I mention it only to illustrate how important it is to make sure your tool is aligned properly.Use cutting oil -LRB- even though you 're not ` cutting ' the threads -RRB- Keep the rollers clean -LRB- I use a wire brush and brake cleaner every 10 spokes or so -RRB- . Both make things easier.DO NOT continue to spin the handle when you 've reached the end of the Hozan 's limits , or if the spoke is bottomed out in the center of the roller assembly . This is easier to miss than you 'd think , and if you do so , you 'll damage your new threads.It is handy to have a magnifying glass handy so you can look at the new threads ... make sure you 're getting the full thread depth -LRB- no flat spots atop the new threads -RRB- . I have trouble seeing stuff that small up close , so I have a magnifying visor to help me.Bottom line ? Well , it 's a little too expensive to justify to someone to build one or two wheels . In my situation , I needed spokes I could n't buy without specially ordering them , and so the hozan allowed me to get my wheel back together for less than it would have cost me to buy a new one ... If I had n't had the Hozan , I 'd have had to discard my oddball hub and rim , so it was worth it . If you have a wheel combination for which you can easily buy the correct spoke , then I 'd probably say that was your best option . On the other hand , this machine would be a lifesaver if , in a pinch , you needed to thread a longer spoke down to the length needed by someone who needed it very quickly . Generally , I see this tool as being a good idea in a bike shop , but a luxury in a home shop like mine .
 While most tools allow you to adjust parts this tool allows you to make the parts you adjust . Spokes come in 1mm increments usually in a couple of different gauges so you would need to keep like 15 boxes of spokes on hand if you wanted to repair bikes at home without running to the bike shop every time you needed a spoke . For less than the price of 2 boxes of spokes this tool will thread any spoke saving you money and time.It works by rolling the threads instead of cutting them so is a little tricky . You clamp the tool in a vise to use it . Do n't let the rolling head rattle around in your tool-box . For stainless spokes you can get the rolling head for stainless steel spokes . Remember to slightly round the edges of the spoke on a grinder after you cut it . Use oil when rolling the threads and make 3 passes to form the threads . Operate the roller by turning it twice forward and one backward for the first pass , just as you would use a tap . After that you go back across the threads a couple more times . I use an already threaded spoke to set the tightness of the rollers . At the correct tightness the spoke will just be able to thread into the rolling head .
 What a fun sled ! Perfect sled for me , I 'm 5 ' 10 '' , and my son ! Took it out this weekend and I could not get my son off of it . I was worn out after 3 runs ... but my son just kept going ! Highly recommend.Thanks !
 We live in the mountains of Maine , and certainly have alot of experience with sleds . This is the nicest sled we have ever owned . The workmanship and quality is superb . The only problem is that it is almost to beautiful to actually use ! But when you do use it , it is fast and fun ! The only assembly is screwing on the handle , which took under a minute . Even the screw driver that comes with it to do that is nice ! You will be very happy with this !
 I purchased two of these for my grandchildren from Amazon . The price was good and they were available . When they arrived to my dismay only one was what I had ordered an &#34; Ultimate Flyer Original Sled &#34; . The other was a different style for infants . When I contacted customer service for exchange what I ordered was not available . I am very dissapointed in that you accepted my ordered , stated thr same in a confirmation that you had the two available and then only ship half of my order and tell me you are out of stock . I will be very skeptical on any future orders.The kid -LRB- s -RRB- does enjoy the sled , well one of them does .
 I absolutly love this sled ! It is always the fastest and most beautiful sled on this hills . I originally got the 52 inch sled , and after a few weeks and some rough bumps , it got a crack . I called the company and they immediatly sent me a new one . Because it was so late in the season , they only had the 47 inch one . As it turns out , I actually like that one better . They even let me keep the 52 inch one to continue using it , so that they would be able to figure out what went wrong and how they can improve . I got a sled pad for that one , and now you would never even know that it is broken . I was pretty bummed to have a broken sled , but it is a wooden sled ... they break . The important thing is that this is a company that stands behind their work . I do not think that I could have gotten a better product anywhere else !
 I have been sledding on my sled , an original Ultimate Flyer , for over 5 years now . My kids -LRB- now 10 and 12 -RRB- have grown up using it . We go out sledding at our tiny local ski area on weekends , and at night down the steep town streets . Sometimes my husband and I go down the hill on the sled together -LRB- him lying down face-first , with me lying on top of him -RRB- . More often , though , I grab it or one of the kids does . It is what a sled should be
 We got two of these sleds for our kids last fall . We live in the mountains and get LOTS of snow . Our two boys were out on the sleds every day . After just a few runs they could easily get the sleds to turn and carve . They rode on their bellies , on their backs , sitting down , two on a sled - and there was lots of laughing . The sleds are still in good shape , broken in but ready for another winter .
 Definitely in a class by itself . Coolest looking sled on the hill . Old style looks on top and hidden newfangled technology underneath . Top speed on the hill that day at over 25mph !!!
 When I ordered this sled , I assumed I was ordering the 52 '' sled . The ad did n't specify the length -LRB- that would have been good information -RRB- and while the order was being processed , I contacted Amazon to clarify the length of the sled . They advised me that the sled I ordered was the 47 '' . They were very thorough and gave me the info I needed to stop the shipment -LRB- which was already on it 's way to me -RRB- and return it . I did return it and will soon reorder the larger sled from them . Their service was OUTSTANDING . I particularly chose this sled because it has molded plastic deep plates underneath to allow the sled to ride above soft snow and still allow you the ability to turn effectively . Once the slope is packed down , it is equally effective .
 This sled is rugged , good looking and easy to turn . My neighbors ' kid tried it out and he reported that because it fit him and only him perfectly , he did n't have to let his sister ride along . Now his sister wants the exact sled just for herself . I 'm sure she 'll get it because she has everything she 's ever wanted .
 This thing is sooo much fun ! My 5-yr old and my husband can each use it equally well - sled the exact lines they want , easily avoiding any bumps , trees , etc. . The kids like this original -LRB- shorter -RRB- version better than the 52 '' version that we also have . Plus , the sleds look awesome hanging on our den wall - beautiful , functional and FUN!Last year we cracked the bottom of our 52 '' ultimate flyer after one of the older kids went off a jump and landed on a sharp rock . The guys at Mountain Boy sent us a new base for it , and we were using it again the same day it arrived .
 It has n't snowed since we bought it , but we 'll be ready for next year ! It 's a really beautiful looking machine .
 I got these after my less than stellar experience with the Viper Black Mariah 's . These throw better , feel better and are built much better . Overall it was a wiser investment for a casual dart player like myself .
 I just love OMEGA timepieces . Not only do they offer the best balance between cost and quality but they are beautifully designed , striking that perfect chord of understated sophistication and timid power . It is like going slow while driving a muscle car.This PLANET OCEAN SEAMASTER is just gorgeous . The faceplate is easy to read under all conditions -LRB- the domed sapphire-crystal is double anti-glare and the tritium hands and numerals magnificently luminescent -RRB- . The black-stainless steel-offwhite-orange theme is perfectly balanced and it will compliment most outfits.My advice
 I am rather opinionated when it comes to luxury watches . This comes from spending 2 years in watchmaking school , studying directly under the guidance of a certified master swiss watchmaker who came here from Europe . Watches , especially mid to high grade swiss watches , are a passion of mine . I am not loyal to a brand or a style or anything else . I judge them for what they are , in terms of quality , function , construction , and style . A watchmakers point of view.This said I will tell you that this particular watch is what I consider to be a `` best kept secret '' sort of watch . This is an AUTOMATIC watch -LRB- read
 I ended up buying directly from watchmaxx.com . Received a brand new watch exactly as expected , with their warranty card in place of the factory warranty card . I have n't had a problem since I bought it almost a year ago . The watch runs within tolerance , about 5 seconds fast per day . I wear it a couple of days per week when I wind and reset the time . The watch has an awesome non-glare coating which at certain angles make it appear there is no crystal at all . With the black rubber strap , the watch goes best with black clothes . The rubber strap is extremely thick and robust . The underbelly of the watch -LRB- including strap -RRB- is beautifully inscripted . The watch is heavy and has an expensive look and feel to it . I love my Planet Ocean !

 I have used several inversion tables in the past and most of them cost quite a bit more than this one , so I was very skeptical that it would be a quality product . I was pleasantly surprised!It is truly worth the low cost - thanks !
 I have never felt better . It has done wonders for the arthritis in my neck , shoulder and back . I think my visits to the Chiropractor are a thing of the past.I only gave it 4 of 5 stars because I 'm sure some of the more expensive models are more comfortable . However it does not hurt my feet and there is no discomfort from the support bar beneath my back -LRB- my support came with a cushion -RRB- as some other reviewers have experienced . Because of the angle of the table , there is a potential for straining your lower back while releasing yourself from the machine if you are not careful . This must be done carefully until you get used to the angle and the stretch .
 We are very pleased with our purchase . It assembled fairly easily and appears to be a well-built unit . It is sturdy construction -- well worth what we paid for it . My wife uses it twice daily and it is helping her pain level .
 This product was so inexpensive I was afraid about the quality when I bought it.It turns out that it is a very good quality equipment which serves its purpose perfectly.The assembly was very easy , all necessary tools are included in the package.Some people complain about the force on the feet
 This machine worked well for the inversion . It was very fast shipping , and exactly as ordered . Well worth the money .
 i was very suprised at how quickley i recieved my inversion table & i just love it . i spend twelve hours a day standing at my work . i have lower back problems , since i have been useing my inversion table my back is not causing a lot of pain anymore . i use it on a nightly bases . .
 Quick recovery from lower back pain . Start out slow on first day and gradually increase the angle . Table detaches easily , base folds up , uses very little space to store against the wall . Instead of going to the chiropractor and paying for each visit , this seems more effective and much cheaper in the long run and you do n't have to leave your home . A +
 Does what it claims ; easy to assemble and breakdown . Best overall price for quality equipment .
 I purchased this table because I have scoliosis and needed something to help the pain in my lower back . I was able to put the table together in no time at all and was very impressed with the quality of the product . It 's sturdy and safe . I use it daily - once in the morning and once in the evening and have found it has helped me tremendously . I could n't believe the price of this model seeing that I was going to purchase a similar model at Relax the Back for 7x the price of this one . It 's a very good buy and I recommend it to anyone that has back pain !
 This item came complete and well packaged . The quality of materials is quite nice and compares in design and quality to the local sporting goods store item that was $ 329.99 . Assembly was straightforward.It is also nearly as comfortable as the inversion table that I have used previously at my physical therapist.Some of the reviews complained about the discomfort associated with the cross bar in the lumbar region . This can be easily changed by playing with the height setting on the table , I 'm 6 ' 1 '' and I found the 6 ' 3 '' setting to be most comfortable . Also I tried wearing a back brace , the type with the stiff vertical ribs around the lumbar region , while using the table , and it seemed to really increase the effectiveness.I have not found the ankle restraints to be uncomfortable . Considering I am hanging my whole body from my feet . I have some past experience.All in all , this was a great choice . Just make sure to read the manual thoroughly !
 I would like to share my opinion and experience because I have had back and neck pains for years and years as a consequence of psoriatic arthritis . The things that I benefit from are 1 -RRB- Avoid drinking cold water specially real cold ones and particularly after exertion . 2 -RRB- Avoid excessive sexual activities or excitation . 3 -RRB- Do not overeat and try to loose some weight . 4 -RRB- Inversion table regardless of the brand . Talking about inversion table the basic concept is to learn how to relax for a few minute everyday while you hanging upside down and this comes with time and persistence . Relaxing in a way that you do not have tense muscles contracting your back while on the table as a result of fear of breaking your back or hurting it . Try to take several deep breaths while inverted as this helps creating a relaxed state in your back . Popping is not gon na hurt -LRB- back or neck -RRB- and you can add extra weight by putting your hands on your head sides -LRB- do not attempt to add any weight if you had previous injury or back surgery please -RRB- . It it very relaxing and therapeutic . It will save thousands of dollars spent on chiropractic , physical therapy , medications and doctor bills . Avoiding chemical medications is the main great bonus which saves your body a whole lot of side effects of pain killers . Make sure to relax for one hour after using it in a proper position preferably lying down . Good Luck .
 I received this inversion table and when I went to assemble it , I read the warnings in the manual that basically should have been provided before ordering it . So be aware that the table is n't for everyone . According to the warnings , I should n't be using the table . I am on a blood thinner , have had a heart attack , and am on a beta blocker , so I waited to assemble it until after I saw my cardiologist to make sure it was safe for me to use.The table took me well over 3 hours to assemble as some of the instructions were a bit nebulous as to how the pieces fit together . My only issue with the table is that it is difficult to get my feet under the foot bar when wearing shoes . I did find it elsewhere for half the price , but with shipping added it was about $ 129 . I only wish I had shopped around before purchasing it and known about all the warnings . I am still concerned a bit about the safety issues for someone with a history of heart problems even though my doctor said he thought it was safe for me to use .
 Great value for the price ... . very comfortable and easy to use . The one thing I find which causes some discomfort is the foot cushioning mechanism . Being that you are actually hanging by your feet in full vertical , I feel the cushioning should have been designed in such a way in order to prevent any possibility of pain ... . I do experience pain in the back of my ankles once hanging for over a minute , or after doing crunches . I 'm 5 ' 5 '' tall and weight 112 lbs. , so it is not due to excessive weight . Otherwise the product is a great deal .
 This table helps stretch the bones in the spine for relief due to degenerative back and neck problems . The only part that is uncomfortable is where your feet are held , but otherwise this is working great .
 This is the first inversion table that I 've ever used . After back surgery and steroid injections I wish I would 've tried it sooner . I have improved to almost 100 % since I have used this table . The quality is durable too . I am 6 ' 4 '' and over 200 lbs and I never feel afraid that the thing will collapse on me . Best money I 've ever spent on my health .
 The Stamina Inversion table arrived within a week of ordering . It took 15 minutes to assemble without any problems . The frame is well built and within 20 minutes I was hanging from my feet and hearing the first pop in my back . Comparing this machine to other ` under $ 200 tables ' , it is a very good value .
 i bought this gravity machine because it appeared to be as well built as the name brands costing over $ 100 more . it is well built and very stable . a real bargain for the price and it really does help with back and leg pains by releasing the constant downward pressure.thanks
 I have used it for over a year now . I have lower back problem . I flip myself upside down using this . IT DOES GIVE ME RELIEF . I have not had to goto Chiropracter . So it pays for itself . A very useful one for the money
 Pros
 I bought this for my hubby . He is always complaining of his back hurting . He said he can feel his back stretching when he is on it . It makes his back feel good when he gets off . And my 10 year old son loves it . He is on it all the time . HE just likes swinging up and down on it . Great to have with bad backs .
 Take the time to set this table to fit your height . Once you are properly balanced it works great . I found that the height sticker on the bar between my legs is not accurate . I am 5 ' 9 '' tall and I balanced out at 6 ' 2 '' . After attaching your ankels you should be balanced while lying horizontal with your hand on the handles . By simply apply presure thru your wrists and you will begin to invert . Again by simple pressure you will revert to horizontal . You do n't need to turn completely upside down to get the full effects of this table . I use the product picture as the guide for inversion . By adjusting the belt to an angle simular to the picture I get the full effect with much less pressure on my ankles . Again due to balance you can quickly relieve the blood flow from head to toe . Do n't invert yourself further than horizotal if you are not able to do 20 sit-ups from the floor . Take reasonable precautions if your body has not been conditioned for an extended period . Have a spotter in case you have difficulty .
 Great addition to my ever growing Home Gym . . The unit was in good shape when UPS dropped it off , assembly was fairly easy , and it was a steal for the price ... I have been using it for about a month now , and I can see some improvements when it comes to the lower back pain that I 've been dealing with for the past year or so . No more wasting $ $ $ at the Chiropractor 's office for me . Thanks Amazon and StaminaCalm 55-1532 Gravity Inversion Therapy Table by Stamina
 My back loves this table ! Why did I go so long without one ? Priced right and good quality . Fast shiiping , arrived 1 week after I ordered , standard ground from PA to CA . Easy assembly in under 30 mins . Can be some strain on feet and ankles if you 're a big guy like me -LRB- I go 230 -RRB- , but I only use it for about 5-10 minutes in conjunction with back and leg stretches recommended by my Chiro , so not a real problem . Buy the way , leg stretching can be very important for lower back pain , especially if you have tight hamstrings . Some stretching is a must , this is not a miracle machine , but a tool to assist your spine and body . My Chiro visits have decreased since using this table and following stretching regimen . Overall good buy , thanks for great product !
 I real `` doorbuster '' bargain . I expected some flimsy item for the price I paid . Instead , I received a well and safely constructed piece of equipment . I am totally satisfied with my purchase and feel safe using it .
 I was looking around for something like this that would n't be a huge investment and still perform well . This table was only $ 99 and it works great ! It 's actually very relaxing , and definitely gives you a great stretch !
 I originally was looking at the `` Teeter Hang-up '' brand , but noticed the appearance similarity between it -LRB- the 5000 model -RRB- and the Calm system for only half the price . The Calm reviews were favorable so I decided to order it -LRB- from Target - free shipping -RRB- and I am glad I did.The sturdiness of the machine was my primary concern and the Calm model is surprising high quality in materials and workmanship , especially considering the big price difference.As I write this , I notice that Amazon is no longer offering it from Target . But I bought mine direct from Target Online to get the free shipping . Amazon wanted about $ 15 S&H. ; Sales tax was less than that , and the base price was otherwise the same .
 The craftmenship is excelent on this product.The instructions were clear and easy to put together.It is very safe and easy to use.The only problemi had was getting dizzy when in the inverted position.Before getting off the table you should stand in the upright position for a minute or two before walking forward .
 I just received this table and it 's much better than I expected . I 've owned several inversion tables over the years , usually giving them away to friends with worst backs . As to this one , it was easy to assemble -LRB- and I `` hate '' assembling things -RRB- . As to the inversion experience , this unit `` is '' capable of a full 90 degree lock , though only the more expensive inversion units on Amazon say this . I almost did n't buy this one because I wanted the full inversion.As to inversion tables , they 're not for folks with bad ankles or bad knees or folks who are probably 50 or more pounds overweight . But if you 've got a bad lower back , nothing works better than one of these tables to at least temporarily alleviate the pain.So yeah , five stars . For the price you ca n't beat it . Combine this with a little yoga and your life will change !
 Arrived quickly . No missing parts . Easy to assemble . Quality seems very good for the price . Sturdier than I expected . It does get uncomfortable for the ankles after just a few -LRB- 3-4 -RRB- minutes . I dont believe its a poor designed product however , just people were not designed to be held upside down by the ankles . I wear ankle high hiking boots and leave them on when I use the table , it helps some . I doubt getting a more expensive table will help this unless it has boots that come with it to hold your feet . When you first use the table it ask you to adjust it to your height . Add about two inches to your height since you will slide up when inverted . Setting it to your height will balance the table so you dont flip over un-controlled . When adjusted correctly it allows you to invert slowly . The instructions say to use the table for 5-10 minutes twice a day . I found myself on it about three times in the first hour . I have had some lower back pain lately and maybe after a week or so it will do away with it , but not yet . Bottom line is I have found a new friend and am glad I did not spend any more than this .
 The machine arrived in good shape . It was easy to assemble and it seems to be of good quality . It took a few days to get use too being upside down , but my back has been thanking me every day I use it . I try to get on it 3 times a day . I am only upside down for maybe 2 minutes at a time.I am even now doing sit ups from that inverted position . I hear no popping in the back doing situps this way unlike when doing them on the floor . It is quick , easy and I feel lighter when finished , so I would recommend this to all who wants to keep there back in good shape .
 Extremely happy with the inversion table . Is really helping my back . . muscles are n't tight anymore . The table arrived in 5 days . . free shipping and easy to assemble . Would recommend it to others .
 This is a high quality table for a great price . I put it together in less than 30 minutes with the included tools . After using it once , my back pain disappeared .
 Arrived quickly , went together easily , performs well . It needs help in the ankle/foot support area . I am a big guy , and it is hard on my ankles and feet . Perhaps a hard boot would work .
 This is a wonderful addition to any home gym . It arrived promptly as promised . It was so easy to put together , and the directions were simple . Every thing you need to assemble was contained in the shipping box . It is easy to adjust and very sturdy . The whole family enjoy 's `` hanging out '' on this inversion table .
 Overall I have been happy with the inversion table . I have had this table since Christmas . When I received the unit the packaging of the table needs some work . The cap on the handle bar was snapped off and the bushing the the leg assembly rides in was broke in a few pieces . When I called they sent me the part in about a week but only sent me one of the two bushings that I needed.The unit itself is pretty straight forward . I would use their recommendation on starting with a slight angle . It takes some getting use to . The one thing that I noticed is the limiter strap adjust by itself . So you need to check it at least every other time , otherwise you can go past vertical and you can get stuck . I have had a bad back for 15 years so I know it will take months . I do seem to have more range of motion and less pain with it . I started 3x a day but most of the time I now use it 2x at about 3-5 min . each time . I will have to give it a few more months to see if it will truly help my back , but I am hopeful .
 A friend of mine had one of these , and when my back went out a month ago he let me borrow it.within 3 days of using it several times/day , i knew i had to own one . It has become a regular partof my routine , along with a good stretch routine everyday . my back health and overall attitudehas never been better . and , the skin in my face looks good too , from the circulation effects . great price , great product , great lasting health benefits . love the ankle holder esp very comfortable .
 Inexpensive . Quick set-up . Easy to use . Feels great . I really love this table . What more is there to say ?!!?!
 I love this inversion table . It was easy to assemble , gives me a great back stretch , and the price was exceptional and it shipped for FREE ! This is a great value .
 I 've had this for almost 2 months now and keep it in my small den which fits perfectly off to the side . I get on it twice daily 5 minutes at a time . I feel amazing !! its been 3 years since i 've felt this good !!! on my 40th birthday completely to my suprise I found out I had a 50 spinal curvature . months later after trying to attempt my first marathon i started getting pain in my shoulders which later triggered pain in my low back and legs . All this pain started at once and i later found I had a severe disc herniation in my neck and low back . a year and a half ago I had cervical spine surgery which barely helped my excrutiating pain . since using this table I can walk without pain again and feel in control of my life because i 'm not in as much pain !!! If you suffer like I did you need this machine !!!
 I have a herniated disk in the L4 lumbar region . I purchased this piece of equipment at the suggestion of my Primary Care Physician when I told him I was not amenable to having back surgery or cortisone shot treatments for pain . It has been one of the best investments I have ever made . Does it eradicate your back problem completely , never to have to endure back pain ever again , NO ! Does it alleviate your pain so that it is bearable or temporarily eliminated , YES ! It is recommended that you use this device 2-3 times a week . I use it when I have pain . I do n't use it again until the pain returns . And oftentimes , the pain will not return until I do something , like heavy lifting or tugging , that pulls on the back and causes it to return . I live on the third floor , so carrying heavy grocery bags or luggage up three flights of stairs does not agree with my back . But every time my back begins to nag at me , I jump on the inversion table , and VIOLA , I am good to go until the next time pain strikes . It saves on popping a bunch of pain pills as well -LRB- which is damaging to the kidneys and liver -RRB- . I would recommend this piece of equipment to anyone that is enduring persistent minimum to moderate back pain . It is my WONDER piece of equipment , as it works wonders for me and at an affordable price . It is very relaxing and very comfortable as well . The first time I used this equipment , I literally wanted to lay there and go to sleep -LRB- not recommended though -RRB- . The only `` downside '' -LRB- no bun intended -RRB- to this particular model is that it is not collapsable , so you definitely would need the space to allow it to remain fully extended . But for me , that is a small compromise to be able to have affordable pain relief.Gravity Inversion Therapy TableHope this review helps you make an informed decision regarding whether to purchase or not to purchase . The best to you , and may you live long and prosper
 I bought this in 1/08 for $ 99 and feel comfortable with my purchase . I see now that the price has doubled -LRB- as of 6/23/09 -RRB- , which may give some customers pause . Here are some considerations.Pros : ----- relatively easy setup . I think it took me about 30 mins to build . All tools required are included -LRB- flimsy nut wrenches , so you may want to use your own -RRB- . - good for lower back stretching and perfectly balanced so you can easily hang upside-down and get back up again . - light and easily portable when folded . Takes up very little space when collapsed . - easily adjustable to differing heights of users via a spring-loaded knobCons : ----- angle of inclination limiter is horribly cumbersome . It 's controlled by a nylon loop-thru strap on the underside of the unit and is time-consuming to adjust . - not effective for upper back stretching , which is where most of my pain is -LRB- between scapulae and middle of back -RRB- . - ankle securement mechanism is problematic and maybe painful or difficult for some users . This is my biggest problem with the unit . It is not a cuff/boot around the ankles and calves that distributes the pressure . Instead , you are locked in via a padded bar and your ankles take the full brunt of the hanging force . This gets uncomfortable for me after more than 5 minutes . It helps to wear hi-top sneakers or shoes that offer ankle padding , but a boot type strap design would 've been better . - no thigh support cross bar , so reclining at less than 90 degrees for more than 10 minutes may be fatiguing.Given these caveats , this is still an OK item . I sometimes recline on it and try to take a short nap . It would be greatly helped by a thigh support bar so your legs have something to rest on.At $ 99 18 months ago , it is a justifiable purchase , due to my constant back pain and discomfort . Now , at double the price , you may wish to do some more comparison shopping and consider alternative brands before committing .3.75 stars overall .
 When my table arrived , I could n't wait for my husband to get home to assemble it . Turned out I did n't have to , it went together without a hitch . From the first use , I could feel a release of pressure in my spine that I had n't felt in years . I took one star off since no matter how I adjust the height and foot rest , I still have to reach up and pull myself up -LRB- if I did n't slip this would n't happen -RRB- . I wear boots so I slip less and can relax my feet , which also reduces the discomfort . I 'm happy to deal with a little pressure on my feet in order to experience the euphoric release of pressure on my back , finally ! It 's amazing how your mood changes when the pain goes away ...
 This product was recommended to me by my chiropractor and my neurologist . It certainly has helped by back problem -LRB- I have a ruptured disk in my lumbar spine -RRB- . I refrained from giving it a five-star recommendation because I find the design of the ankle braces could use some tweaking .
 The cost is reasonable . The product is strurdy and easy to assemble and move around . It is simply an excellent physical conditioning product that is inexpensive , well made , and helps stretch out your joints and back . I would recommend it to anyone .
 This table works excellent . My back feels better & it really is helping me . It was easy to set up , maybe takes 30 minutes . Very fast shipping from Amazon as well .
 Besides that it 's a little uncomfortable in the back at some point when you are rotating , everything else is pretty good .
 I have not tried another inversion table but I 'm very happy with this one . It went together easily although the instructions had one blank unprinted page . So hard to tell if they would have been any good . It is built sturdy . I am 200 lbs and no issues for my size . my kid is 4 ' 2 '' and 72 lbs and can operate it supervised . I do n't think it is advisable for kids though . It 's not a toy .
 For the price , this product has been of value to our household . Having a bad back , the table has been able to take pressure off the spine after a long days work
 Great price , immediate shipping , excellent benefits for my back . The instuctionas were n't great , but I put it together in about half an hour . Do n't do more than five minutes at a time to start , then work up from there . My back started feeling better right away .
 Easily assembled/user friendly/great price for the quality of product . Looked at several available and this was definately the best price for product .
 I just wanted to try an inversion table . Although unpacking seems like lots of parts , very easy to assembly . Well made , no junk.Works fine .
 The Inversion table works great . The materials and construction are very good ; instructions for use are accurate . I compared the price of this table with others both on-line and locally and found this to be the best priced . I 'd recommend this product to anyone who wanted to buy an inversion table ; it 's a good deal .
 I have been using this table two times a day for three weeks and I have significant lower back pain relief . Whenyour muscles are tight this decompression of the spine is a great way to feel better . For the money it is a greatbuy . If you have tried all else this is the next step in pain reduction , add it to your daily routine .
 Does a good job , easy to change settings for different heights . I like this inversion table .
 This gravity inversion table is easy to use , adjust and manage.Its build quality is more than adequate and its design is lean and functional . In my humble opinion the overall quality of the table is better than what I 've seen in other markets -LRB- I 've seen very sketchy products in several retail stores for twice the money ... ones I 'd never use -RRB- . To my mind this Stamina table is a bargain
 So far so good , it was very easy to put together . I am 6 ' 00 '' 215 pounds and it is stable and steady . Not being an expert at this kind of equipment I wonder what the expensive inversion tables do that this one does n't . I would recommend it to anyone . It was delivered very quickly .
 Assembly was simple and instructions easy to follow . I was very impressed with the solid and secure frame . Great quality throughout . Highly recommend !
 Went together with no problems , and works great ... assuming I am using it as designed .
 Another great product . If you have back problems , this is a must . Consult with you doctor first . Great pain reliever & easy to assemble . Does take a little time to adjust to use . Have someone handy before you try full inversion . .
 My unit arived with a few broken parts , which the the company promtly sent me , and I have been enjoying this Inversion table ever since.My whole family loves the inversion table .
 Great inversion table for the price . Easy to assemble and probably works as well as the more expensive ones .
 I did a lot of research before buying this inversion table , and am very pleased with the features I got for the money . I found the ankle restraints to be very comfortable , even in bare feet . It adjusts very quickly to fit me -LRB- 5 ' 1 '' -RRB- , and my husband -LRB- 6 ' 1 '' -RRB- . It has helped my back imensely , and I LOVE using it . After a session , I feel tall and straight . It is a little heavy and awkward to move , but that also makes it very stable . I use a small roll pillow under my neck , which makes it even more comfortable . I would highly recommend this table .
 On the advice of my chiropractor , I decided to buy an inversion table , but did n't want to spend a lot of money because I feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room , along with my rowing machine and exercise bike . So I purchased this Calm system because it was inexpensive and I figured I could sell it or send it back if I ended up not using it.Well , so far I and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain , and best of all you do n't have to spend a lot of time on the machine . About 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine.Also , the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit . Overall , I am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system . There is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy .
 After doing a comparison of other Inversion Tables the Calm model 55-1532 matches feature for feature to the more expensive models on the market . The foot/ankle support is very comfortable not like the cheap versions that are out there . It is very stable . It has a safety tether like all of the other tables so you can gradually increase over time your ability to go fully inverted . Most every table claims that they are easily foldable and portable , but that is not the reality . Most table weigh around 50 pounds , and to fold them you need to remove the table from the base . Be careful if you have back problems . For the price this is the best value , 5 Stars !
 I purchased this item for my husband . He has some damage to a couple of discs and by the end of the day , after driving for at least 6 hours , he usually has lower back pain caused by spine compression . I read the reviews on this and similar products and figured it would be worth a shot.OH MY GOSH !!!! ... My husband is in heaven !!! ... . He uses it morning and evening for just 5 minutes . He tells me that it his the best gift I ever got for him . He still gets some back pain during the day but he uses the therapy table and the pain goes away . This particular model seems well built and was easy to assemble .
 I saw this product for twice the price on multiple websites before it occurred to me to check Amazon . It provided noticeable relief for my husband 's lower back pain , though did n't do much for my upper back/neck . It 's very easy to assemble , and highly adjustable for just about anyone of any height . The footpad is pretty comfortable , even when you make it really tight , but I would recommend wearing shoes -LRB- even hightops , if you have them -RRB- for extra support . It 's not that easy to fold up and put away , so you really need to put it somewhere you do n't mind seeing it every day , especially if you will use it often .
 I have had this product for a month now and like the ability to do inverted situps . my wife says it hurts her feet too much when on it . Overall is has been good , but since it is a little tough on the feet i only rated it a 4 .
 This table is a very good value . I 've seen ones more than twice the price that were n't any better . I am very happy with it.Notes : - I like the fact that it folds up . Most of the expensive ones do not fold up and they have a large footprint . - I found that you need to add two inches to your height to get the best balancing . Once you go upside down , you slide an inch so you might have to grab the handles to come back up . - There is some pressure on the tops of your feet/ankles . You are being held upside down by your feet after all . I find slippers or shoes help . - Mine had foam padding at the crossbar and I do n't feel it at all . - This table does fully invert . It will lock when fully inverted so you can do sit ups . - I weight 210 and it holds me with no problem and is very stable . - One of the end caps of the handles was broken . I emailed customer support and they mailed one out no questions asked . - My daughters age 3 and 11 love it .
 When I realized I was throwing my lower back out with increasing frequency , I heeded my brother 's advice and looked for an inversion table to minimize that and keep the sciatica under control . Went with this thanks to the combination of price , reviews , and free shipping . and have been really pleased with the result . I did add a lumbar cushion for support -LRB- the bar is inevitable -RRB- . Not only is my back much happier , but I sit at a keyboard and this has eliminated my ankle swelling at the end of the work week , my sinuses are draining better , and with the increased blood flow , I 've had to reduce my thyroid supplement . Results even if I only use it 5-15 minutes a day , which makes it an easy piece of equipment to stay faithful to . Pretty simple to assemble , very sturdy , and really sweet that it came less than 48 hours after ordering.Stamina Gravity Inversion Table
 The table was delivered free and in a timely manner . It needed some assembly but is n't too difficult for the average person who can follow instructions . Quality is good overall . Inversion has helped my back problems which I 've had for years now . After a couple weeks of using it just 5 minutes a day I could feel my lower back slipping back into place . My daily pain has nearly been eliminated . I will use this for the rest of my life .
 this inversion table is fantastic -- i bought a more expensive one and this one is the same as the more expensive one does the same thing -- i bought for my dad for fathers day -- my teenagers love it as well as my husband they all claim to sleep much better after using this machine properly !
 It took me two years to purchase this product under my doctors orders to have one.Now that I have one , I am able to sleep because my pain level is under control to a lesser degree and sometimes at 0 . I highly recommend this unit .
 Was easy to put together and use . Our Dr. recommended as an aid to keep back problems under control . It 's been helpful for disk problems both my husband -LRB- lower back -RRB- and I -LRB- cervical/neck -RRB- have . When we get kinked-up , and ca n't stretch it out , its time to hang from our inversion table . Well made and folds away if needed . Adjusts easily for varied heights of person using . Reasonable price !
 First , I bought a different , low priced inversion table but I returned it because it was hard to assemble and ended up being defective . I chose this product from the reviews and I have been content . The price was right , easy to assemble , easy to put away and it is solid and easy to use . If you are looking for good priced inversion table , this is the one to get.Btw , my back problems got better after about 3 days of regularly using the table and now I 'm ok ... I have n't had to use the table in a few months but I can always pull it out of the closet if the need arises .
 At the suggestion on my spinal orthopedist , I sought out different brands and models of inversion tables . I tried out one at a local sports store costing $ 399 . It was well-made , but far out of my budget 's range . I then explored the tables available through Amazon . The reviews on the Calm looked unbelievable for the price . I made my order and surprisingly it was at the front door on Tuesday morning following ordering late Saturday . It was easy to assemble and set-up , and the quality of every piece is outstanding . I have been experiencing considerable pain and am still facing spinal surgery tomorrow . However , my Calm table alleviated MUCH pain over the last four weeks , and it will definitely be a great part of my after-surgery re-hab and on-going exercise program . I recommend it without reservation and regardless of price .
 Bought this for my wife . She and I both use it . She is smaller and has no problem changing the setup if I have used it . She finds her self in a happier mood after using it for 5 minutes , and I do to . I would recommend it to anyone with the same.ONLY CON
 First and foremost , please read the manual . Easy to assemble . Very stable machine . The only reason your feet hurt when in inverse position is because you are n't used to this kind of work-out yet .
 This is a nice table - great for the money - I have seen this table for much more at other stores and sites . I have seen reviews about this table being bare bones and not comfortable on your feet/ankles ... and I admit that this is my first one , but I feel the padding on the feet/ankles is very sufficient . I like it - great table for the ten to twenty minutes a day I use it .
 The Stamina inversion table was easy to assemble and easy to adjust for my husband 's height . It 's very stable and takes up only a small space when folded together . It has been wonderful in helping him with his back pain .
 This inversion table is great at what it does
 - Nice foam like grip - Heavier plastic top ... when the wiffleballs are taken out the plastic is still a little on the heavier side for kids . - Hard plastic barrel is n't the safest in my opinion , but it appears pretty strong . - Have to see what the durability is over time ...
 Just got one of these little cameras from ebay and am having lots of fun with it . My expectations were low but I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality in the `` high res '' mode . No , the instructions are n't great , but the set I got was in French -LRB- ! -RRB- and I managed to figure everything out.I do n't think I 'd pay $ 25 for this camera , but it was certainly worth the $ 12 I paid for it on ebay .
 I bought these gloves hoping it would stop me from getting blisters on my thumb from kayaking , but no luck . The gloves are great , I use them on the SeaDoo and kayaking . For both of these activities I do have extra grip on the paddle/handle bar . I only took a star off because I still got blisters during the activity . If you do n't have blister problems from squeezing too hard on the bars then I 'll highly recommend it for you .
 I purchased this gun and I love it . It 's made out of plastic , but it 's thick plastic so it looks and feels solid . The gun shoots dead straight , even when in full auto mode . You can really unleash with this airsoft gun . The battery has n't died on me yet . When I received the package , I expected to have to charge the battery , but it came charged and it has n't died yet ! I have shot close to 700 + bb 's with it and the battery still works great . The accessories are fun also . They all work , so it makes for more fun . If you 're considering getting a beginner/intermediate level gun , this is it !
 i got it a few days ago and its great it shoots straight and it shoots far . a kid was running down the street and i nailed him in the back with the gun and the kid was far away . I RECOMEND THIS GUN IT IS AWESOME AND THE SCOPE IS NOT A CHEAP PLASTIC TUBE !!!!! BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!
 This knife is incredibly sharp , lightweight , and durable . I generally buy American as much as possible , but in this case I must say the quality is quite impressive considering it is made in China . Cold Steel maintains excellent quality standards .
 Well , I am going to give this a 5-star rating based on how much fun people are having on this thing but really , we can not seem to get this to work the way it should . We filled it up with air and then started letting air out with each `` attempted '' launch . We still have yet to launch anybody -LRB- adult or child -RRB- off of this thing . Seems to be that the launchor ends up hitting one end with the idea -LRB- hope -RRB- of launching but bounces right off or rolls off the end . Right before we gave up for the day , the launchee could n't even get rolled off the end -LRB- that is if they made it to the end without falling off -RRB- . The launchor would hit the end and then get bounced off while the launchee just stayed sitting . It is great humor for those on land , that 's for sure . The launchor typically weighed more that the launchee too -LRB- anywhere between 120 and 180 pounds and the kids were all under 100 pounds so it is n't like we are trying to launch Bessie off from this thing -RRB- . Any tips on how to be the launchor and launchee and perhaps any tips on the right amount of air would be nice .
 Just an awesome shirt . Exactly what I wanted . Perfect for Laker fans everywhere . Get some .
 Kept my son safe in what could have been a very scary hit during football this year . Thank you so much
 Overall I like the product and it has great durability which is a great asset for everything I do . It 's lasted me almost a year now which is probably the longest out of any hat I 've ever had .
 This chair is ideal for people who frequently travel , go to sporting events , or outdoor concerts . I take mine to concerts , dog shows , and football games . Overall , it is pretty comfortable , you would n't like to spend the day in it , but it suits the purpose it was made for admirably . It is light , comes with a carry case , and has a shoulder strap . These features make it ideal for the person on the go .
 The chair is good but like the other guy said the bag is BAD ... mine all had rips in the bag right when I got it out of the Amazon box .
 I used this pad in my Berlin Flyer wagon . The thought of paying over 70 $ for the pad set to go with the wagon seemed insane . This fit my HEAVY DUTY wagon perfectly in that i folded along the seem to provide a backrest and the rest of the length along the interior of the wagon .
 Fits the Mountain boy wagon / sled perfectly and a very necessary item for small children . Well made and soft . Seems to be durable and the ties fit well on the wagon or sled .
 Quick delivery . Product was faulty . Returned to manufacturer . Manufacturer replaced faulty product .
 I 've had this gun for nearly a year now , and I 'm pleased to say that it works as beautifully as ever ! I 'm 19 and own an assortment of spring , electric and gas guns , but this one is by far my favorite !!! 260-280 fps with .20 g bbs , a 21 round mag and a dominant , commanding look are all winners with me . Accuracy is excellent up to 30-40 feet , but shots tend to drift to the sides beyond that . Aiming is easy and the sights are perfect for rapid target acquisition . Yesterday , my cousin and I went one-on-one . I used this beauty of a pistol , while he used my 400 round , fully automatic 320 fps M16 . Guess who won ? I nailed him once in the forehead , twice on his upper lip , and seven times in the chest , all in a single mag of 21 . He got me once on my right knee , and he used nearly 300 rounds !!! Of course this had a lot to do with the way we fight , but I think that proves my point of this pistol being one of the best springers you 'll ever find ! Even better , this gun is a very attractive matte black which does n't give you away in night combat , and the weapon is almost SILENT which is very rare in spring guns . I nailed another cousin during the night as he walked past me , and he did n't even hear the shot ! He looked around , but could n't find me even though I was squatting about five feet away . The gun can feel a bit flimsy at first which can take some getting used to , and it may well break if you drop it , but if you treat your toys with love , this baby wo n't disappoint you ! If for some reason you do n't like this springer , I also reccommend the UHC M92F Heavy-Weight and the UHC MP5 SD3 , both of which I also own and love . Happy shooting !
 Let me start by saying that I 've only ever owned one other airsoft gun , so if you 're looking for an experienced airsofter 's opinion you should probably look elsewhere.The gun feels great in my hand , looks amazing , and is weighted perfectly . The magazine is full size -LRB- takes up the entire grip , not just a small section -RRB- , holds about 15 BBs , and locks in place with a satisfactory click . The stippling on the grip is a little excessive , so this may not be the gun for you if you have sensitive skin.I ca n't speak to accuracy , as I do n't have the equipment to test it with any degree of certainty . But I can attest to the fact that the gun has plenty of power , although not nearly as much as some CO2 powered models . Certainly powerful enough to raise welts on bare skin -LRB- I 've still got one from my fire test a few days ago -RRB- , but it wo n't shoot through an aluminum pop can as I 've seen my roommate 's CO2 gun do.Lastly , as has already been stated , this is not a weapon for an airsoft battle where speed is important , as you must rack the slide before every shot . While it is possible to do this relatively fast -LRB- I managed about two shots per second , but I was n't paying attention to accuracy -RRB- , you will still be at a disadvantage compared to others with even semi-auto weapons . Also , it takes a very long time to reload an empty magazine -LRB- this is manually loading each pellet - a funnel or other speed-loading system would certainly help here -RRB- . Overall , definitely worth your money if you 're looking for something for casual target shooting or costume play , but probably not for a serious Airsoft battler .
 I 've owned this gun for a month now , and I have to admit , I love it . I love the weight of it , which gives it a more realistic feel . It does n't feel cheap at all . Even though I 'm older than most of the teenagers that mess with airsoft guns , I 'm not experienced to really review this gun properly . I will say this , I do n't regret buying this gun at all .
 I have bought over 20 pistols and all of them were either crap or close to it ! This gun rocks . It is very silent , shoots fairly far , is sturdy , and can hold a lot of ammo . Pulse it looks super bad ass ! The hammer will cock back , and even though it wont cock the gun it is still help full . It will automatically cock back every time you cock the gun , and the safety will only work if the gun is cocked or the hammer . This way your do n't have to put the safety on and no no if the gun is cocked . It is really accurate . A really good combo with a sniper rife or any other gun . Except another spring pistol . Just do n't let a friend use your gun for two reasons . One it 's too good to let them even have the advantage on you , and two there is the safety , and next to it there is a another latch that if you undo and pull out the gun will fall apart . So if you let some one use it tell them not to undo it unless your know how to put it back together .
 I have to admit , I love this gun . I own a double eagle m82 aeg , and this works great with it.I have shot it with 0.12 gram bbs . they work well with the gun up to about 45 feet . 0.20 gram bbs are slightly more accurate at far range , but is this for long range ? no . I use a mini-uzi as a side arm and this as a side arm with my uzi . so three guns in 1 battle . It shoots fairly accurate from 50 feet . It leaves welts at point blank range . It is relatively quiet . I love that you can get extra clips with this gun . -LRB- It took me a while to find the link , so I 'll post it below -RRB- . This handgun also fits in most holsters . The compensator can be taken off , but then you have a regular handgun with a long looking barrel.http : / / www.amazon.com/UHC-Airsoft-magazine-92/dp/B001BQZL1A/ref=pd_rhf_shvl_47
 I bought this gun a few years ago , and I still find pleasure in shotting it . It 's on the heavier side , so it 's more realistic to an actual gun . The only draw-back is that you have to cock it after every shot , so it would n't be my first choice for an Airsoft War . All in all , it 's a really good gun , and I recommend it to anyone who is either a first time buyer or airsoft veteran .
 I was looking around for a P8 H&K ; USP pistol for cosplay . I did some extensive searching around , finding some fairly decent guns in the $ 100 price range , which I am NOT willing to spend . I figure for cosplay , its a bit crazy and pointless to be spending in the hundreds of dollars for a gun you wo n't actively be using . If you are using it for airsoft , then fine . But I saw some video reviews on youtube of this gun and how it was praised by its owners . I figured $ 15 was pretty cheap for an airsoft pistol so I went and ordered it , keeping an open mind.The pistol arrived and immediately unboxing it , it visually was very stunning . Very nice in size , nothing you can consider to be small . Though its obviously plastic , the gun has some weight to it . It is well constructed and put together nicely . The clip is solid metal and very realistic . This gun looks very legitimate and is beautiful in appearance , it does not look like a toy . Like I said , though it IS plastic , it does not look like a cheap plastic toy . The gun operates easily , the clip ejection is simple to find and operate . The cocking mechanism is easy to locate and operate as well and cocks smoothly . Now as far as power goes , I did a practice shot in my bedroom and it was a bad idea . I shot the wall across the room -LRB- 12 foot distance -RRB- and the bb ricocheted back at me . It has some very decent power , which throws you off a bit , considering how easily it is to cock . You 'd think the power of the projection would be moderate but I would consider it to be very powerful for a spring airsoft gun . I would say the power ranks with or surpasses some of the CO2 pistols I have used . I do not want to ever be shot with this at point blank.So for the price , you ca n't go wrong . Whether you want to use this for cosplay , airsoft or display , this is a really great gun . It apparently is the gun Lara Croft used in the Tomb Raider movies , and would also be a nice piece to own if you are a fan of Tomb Raider and want to have the gun as a prop or memorabilia . Just do NOT drop it , as the weight of it will probably cause the gun to break on impact . The end of the gun comes off somehow , but I have n't figured out yet how to do it . But the gun looks awesome with the extended tip on it . Without the tip , it would look like a regular P8 USP with a black tube extending from it . I personally do n't like the looks of it that way , so I will leave the extension on . Great gun , great price , you wo n't regret buying it .
 this is exactly what i hoped for . the parts of ths UHC - HK USP Match are exactly the same as the Umarex build with a little switching , i took my Umarex USP , which i had lost a part to , the piece that caresses the spring in the rear of the slide , took the pistol grip / trigger mechanism and ejection port cover -LRB- has HK logo on it -RRB- , and the end result was a trademarked UHC - HK USP Match ... or as a lot of people know it , lara croft 's weapon of choice from the tomb raider series . even without my slight customization , this pistol still works very good . if you are wondering why i keep calling it a USP Match , it is the compensator on the front , that makes it a Match model USP . i seriously recommend this spring powered air gun to you all . - Mr. Odd Fox
 Short and simple , SPRINGER ! Good for messing around in the back yard . This gun will be easily out-performed by any other side-arm in professional airsofting . This gun is FULL plastic and very light weight . There are some people who say it 's heavy or on par with an actuall pistol , I do n't think it 's close honestly.The slide does not lock back , but is removeable , there 's a pin right under the chamber that holds the top and lower reciever together . Push it out abit from the right side of the gun , then from the left side - push the slide catch up . You can now remove the pin by pulling it out carefully . Like I said before , it 's plastic - you do n't want to break it . -LRB- NOT for serious airsofters . -RRB- Though if you are a collector and love to display mock firearms or perhaps in need of a nice prop for a film or cosplay , this will do the job !!! Pros : - Fairly decent weight-Fun for backyard airsofting-Slide is fully removable-Makes for a fantastic prop!Cons : - Full plastic-Easily breakable-Slide does not lock back
 When I first got this gun in my front door I was so happy to unbox it . I decided to take it out for a test and I was pretty damn excited to use it , everything hit or flew as perfect as it would , but it 's not super accurate , it 's good enough . Racking the slide get 's annoying , if they fixed that , this gun is perfect for the price it 's one of the best and realistic if it did n't have the Orange tube ... Great purchase , enjoyed . ^_^
 My little brother was getting into airsoft , so I was looking for some decent guns that did n't cost an arm and a leg . I bought this one for me so I could play with him and I was amazed at the quality and it only cost $ 15 ! Pros
 This is a great gun all in all ... only bad thing i have to say is that the picatinny rail doesnt work because it 's curved and not straight so you cant mount anything on it
 To start out i have never shot or owned an airsoft gun before . However i have shot bb guns and paintball and if that 's anything to go on then i think that this is a good gun.one piece of advice do n't drop this gun on a concrete floor . i did that and the whole thing exploded all over the place once i was able to put it back together it still worked great . so i say that this gun is really nice . it 's a little heavy and can fall apart but it 's still really nice . the only thing that this needs is a holster .
 I going to just cut the crap and say this gun great !!!! In case yor wondering you can unscrew the metal grill on the front and have a normal hand gun but it still has a long blakc straw @ the end the only thing this thing could use is an extra clip sadly
 I just purchased a second unit of this UHC model . My original purchase was the silver two-tone Tomb Raider , which I have owned for several years.My primary purpose for airsoft pistols is collecting accurate replicas of firearms . This UHC is outstanding ! It is superior to the HFC model which is sold for the same price on Amazon . The grip is full length , unlike the shorter HFC . It is solidly constructed . The barrel weight and extension are removable , resulting in a standard USP configuration . The hammer , slide stop and safety all function as on the actual USP . The weight is acceptable . It is easily the most accurate airsoft I own , and my favorite for indoor target practice .
 This gun just just came today and already love it . Full scale and feels real . GET IT !!
 Product was a little time consuming to install ... but it serves the purpose , for the price . Just having this laser pointed at an intruder will be enough to get the message through .
 It was what I expected from the picture on the internet and it works like it says it should . Very pleased with the courtesy and quickness of receiving this in a timely manner and it was what they said it would be . Thank you .
 This is one of the best generic laser sights I have ever purchased . Easy to install and easy to zero in
 Universal Laser mount is a quality product and is user friendly for mounting on a pistol without picadilly railing . I recommend this product as usable and fairly easy to install . It may take a few tries to get on target but worth the effort .
 good for the price and pads are good for adjusting sight ideal for round barrels that ca n't fit most square brackets
 Product came within 4 days of online purchase . Price was good as was the product . Only took about 20 minutes to figure out how to attach to my .45 . I was really impress how easy it was to zero in on accuracy . I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try out a laser sight but not wanting to pay 80-100 dollars .
 This Laser requires three different allen hex wrenches . It comes with two . You 'll need a 7/16 to mount the Laser to the Trigger Guard Adapter . This is not a complaint , just a heads up . I 'm impressed it came with any allen wrenches at all . My one minor complaint is that the 7/16 bolt that attaches the Laser to the trigger Guard Adapter is to long . I have a bench grinder so I 'll just grind it shorter . Its no big deal -LRB- for me -RRB- , just be aware you may need to shorten the 7/16 inch bolt . This Laser is brighter than a $ 200 Laser I bought for my Glock which uses a 123A lithium battery . This $ 11.99 laser uses three LR44 batteries , included . Overall I 'm very pleased . If it came with three allen wrenches and the trigger guard bolt was the correct length I would have given 5 stars .
 Not as strong and durable as I had hoped , but its really inexpensive and works just like I had needed it to . Thumbs up .
 great little laser for what I had to pay for it ! The only thing I had to put a little loc-tite on the screws!I have it on a .22 single action pistol and it works great on it !
 THIS PRODUCT WAS AS ADVERTISED AND FULFILLED MY EXPECTATIONS . I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND WOULD BUY IT AGAIN IF NEEDED . AGAIN THIS PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED BY THIS REVIEWER .
 My review is about the Tasco version of this model . Tasco is made by Bushnell and my scope is almost identical . As far as I can tell , the only difference is the Tasco model has Coated Optics , where the Bushnell model has Multi Coated Optics . I got mine used from an online auction for $ 32 . I could n't find a review for this scope anywhere , Tasco or Bushnell , so I wanted to post mine . I wanted a low cost scope with a tripod for stargazing and looking at the moon . Sure these only have a 50mm objective lens , but do n't expect the Hubble Space Telescope for only $ 32 . I checked out the moon tonight . On full zoom to 45x , the moon almost completely fills the view . At 15x it 's slightly less than half . The zoom worked much better than I expected . Many zoom scopes do n't work as well as fixed power scopes . This zoom is acceptable . The focus is very smooth . I only had the opportunity to look a 2 stars tonight . It seemed to work ok for that except for 2 things . First , the eyepiece is not angled . It was difficult to look at anything higher than 45 degrees elevation . This was also because the tripod is kind of short for stargazing . I 'll need a taller tripod for sure . It 's a good solid tripod for table top use though . The 2nd thing was the optics . Looking straight on at a star , it looked ok . Towards the edge of the lens , I could see colors separate slightly like a rainbow . Not the best optics , but not bad for $ 32 . Maybe the Bushnell model has improved lenses ? Oh yeah , and the scope is very solidly built . Mine is used and I could tell it was well used in the field . It still works just fine . I think it could survive my 2 year old better than a more fragile astronomy telescope . I do n't plan to use this as a spotting scope at a shooting range , but I think it would work well for that . I also plan to use this scope at the beach for bird watching and looking at boats . Some telescopes have a second finder scope attached . This one has sights like rifle sights on top , which is kind of cool . The sights made it very easy to locate the moon at 45x zoom . For stargazing it would be better to have an angled eyepiece , a larger objective lens and a taller tripod . That 's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 . I still think this is a good solid well built scope for the money .
 I 'm not a review writing type but after reading the 2 very bad reviews I thought I 'd share my experience to maybe balance things out a bit . First off I paid about $ 24 US . for a 1 Watt LED - what a deal ! This is a utilitarian torch , no clicky to fail or leak , by using twist contact , simple attractive polycarbonate case that ca n't roll , rubber on outside for easy grip . The flashlight is clearly marked inside where the pos & neg sides of the batteries go , but it would be better if it had the protection built in for inserting the batts in wrong -LRB- maybe it does and it failed -RRB- , but $ 77 AUS for a new head , toss it & replace it ! DeRoche - First I ca n't believe you would take off on trans Pacific cruise without testing your equipment . Having your life depend on 2 of the cheapest 1 watt torches makes me shutter . Second , after using mine hard for almost a year I 've had no problem with the on-off , half turn is all it takes , do n't even have to look - I know its off . I bought it for camping but since use it for everything , working on the trucks , home repair projects , you name it . I have even held it between the teeth to have both hands to work and soft rubber easy to get a grip , even gave it to the dog to run around the campground in the dark for some fun -LRB- at least it was after a few stout ones ! -RRB- Cheers Brian
 I 'm happy I bought this watch . Its easy to read , fun to use , and the compass is reasonably accurate . There are a few things that set this apart from other watches :1 -RRB- it is 1/2 '' thick2 -RRB- the watch needs to be LEVEL for the compass to give a reliable reading .3 -RRB- If you use the compass heavily you will use up a battery - mine lasted 90 days during the `` play '' period ; but I used it daily and multiple times .4 -RRB- changing the battery is not as easy as with other watches I own . The battery itself is held in a special mount , a tiny screw driver is required to remove and install it , and the back is VERY hard to snap back in -LRB- I eventually used a Bessey glueing clamp to get it to `` snap '' back in . -RRB- Watch shops have a special press for doing this .5 -RRB- the watch is quite heavy -LRB- 2.7 oz vs 1.1 oz for a similar sized dress watch -RRB- I 'm very satisfied with it and would buy it again . It fits compfortably on my wrist , and is a pleasure to wear . My 11 year old son thinks its pretty cool , and it looks nice enough to wear for general use .
 This watch does everything just right . The compass is classy , and easy to calibrate . And it looks wonderful on my wrist . Bravo !
 Received watch in good shape and in timely manner . I did notice that is was heavier than a normal watch . I followed the directions to set the compass and everything was working fine . After wearing a few times without using the compass I had need to use the compass and noticed right off that north was not where the compass was pointing . Finally figured out that when I put my hand in my pocket I was moving the stem and pushing buttons and the alignment was getting reset . Now I have to remember to check things whenever I put my hand in my pocket and I have n't had any problems since . All things considered it has been a good purchase .
 The Timex Compass watch looks nice , fits well , and performs as expected . I 'd recommend this a a gift for the outdoors person .
 This is the watch I wear most often . No matter if I 'm dressed up or dressed down , it always looks solid and classy . It certainly fits very comfortably and is easy to wear overnight . The backlighting is excellent for being able to see in the dark , either directly in semi-dark room , or residual glow for dark-adapted eyes . The red-blue compass needle makes for a very cool looking visual element on the watch , but proves to be very handy , especially when driving in unfamiliar areas .
 Quality timepiece with an accurate compass that resets to zero after each use . Remember to dial in the North declination from TRUE during setup .
 This video has it all a great mix of songs for a soundtrack . The slow motion effects are insane . A great addition to any collection . Contains an excellent wakeskate section , a wakesurfing session , and the Liquid Force ladies are well represented . One of the best DVD 's i own
 he does a lot of work and always needs extra light so this was a great gift for him
 I am impressed with this design an implementation . Unfortunately , its missing the top over-the-head strap which it needs as the batteries -LRB- 2xAAA -RRB- are housed with the bulb placing extra weight that could be compensated for with the strap we all see in the photos for this light . Oh well , happy with the quality nontheless ; especially for the price !
 I used this headlamp to climb Mt Fuji ... started the climb at 8 pm and used the light until about 3am . The battery lasted the whole time and it was fairly comfortable.For the price i would definetly suggest this product to others preparing for a night hike/climb .
 Has worked great for running - it 's lightweight , amply bright and simple to use.Also , it 's inexpensive and has a long battery life .
 I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he thinks it 's the best headlamp he 's ever used . He 's amazed at the long battery life and the bright lite . We live in the Cascades and he uses it all the time either for work or even to get firewood at night .
 For four years I have been doing late night feedings for my horses and have carried a flashlight . I never thought of getting a headlamp until my horse got a nasal infection that required night flushes . This has been the best thing I have had for years !! Instead of carrying a flashlight I have the convenience of this head lamp - The strap is big , fits well over a hat , but my head alone too big - For the price , this is a must have ! I am so happy I can see at night well now !!
 I am extremely happy with this perfectly designed 2 -LRB- TWO -RRB- AAA battery headlamp . Often you will find very well designed products from newer companies before they change the design to fit what the ` consumer ' desires . The design is often very well thought through for it 's initial release and it appears that is the case here .
 This is a great value headlamp . It 's not as robust as my Petzl lamp , but it 's far cheaper . My only complaint is the angle adjustment is soft and can shift while you walk , so sometimes I have to re-adjust it as I go . The lamp is very bright and quite effective even at reasonable distances .
 Great when you lose power - keeps your hands free and you can walk around , read or whatever . Light is bright and can be directed
 This light works great but I work outside and found that to turn light on or off I have to remove my glove because of the push button type switch on the top light . But would still recommend this light .
 I 'll probably end up getting a few more since my husband loses things like this , but talk about handy , works well , easy use and set up , ideal for any place dark , where you need hands free , even walking to your car at night , it comes in handy . I use it mostly for construction purposes and crawl spaces .
 A great headlamp that allows me to see the trail as I hike up the butte to watch the sunrise !
 ... and this is what my daughter wanted for reading at night . The light lasts a really long time on the batteries . It being adjustable and having the tilt function makes it work great for our purposes . Granted , we are n't exactly endurance testing it , but it works fine . Most hazardous thing its been used for is to find the latrine on a camping trip or flashing me in the eyes every time she looks at me while reading . = -RRB-
 Keeps your hands free to do things other than hold the flashlight . Had cheaper ones that put out more light .
 I bought the Streamlight headlamp to use as a ` night light ' while reading after my husband goes to sleep . It 's hands free and I love it .
 For the money , this is a great light . I would prefer that it was brighter , but it worked reliably , was comfortable , and lasted a long time on the original batteries .
 uses conventional batteries . works great ! used 3 nights in Bonnaroo . Lifesaver . Would never go w/o ... great price as well .
 Nice and bright . Can clip to visor or use with strap . Works great ! The picture showed a third strap that is n't included but I knew that from the other reviews and I would n't use it anyway .
 This is a very well designed and well made light suitable for illuminating things at arms length or in a dark room . It is light weight and comfortable for extended wear . The head strap is easily adjustable and secure enough for ordinary activities . The batteries which come in the package are easy to install and replace . This light is very handy for jobs such as peering into the recesses of a cabinet under a sink , or into the dark corners in the case of a computer , or into the shadows under the hood of an automobile . If your electricity were out , this would be a neat little light to wear moving around a darkened house . And it leaves both of your hands free !
 This is a pretty solid headlamp . I needed it for outdoor evening rescue simulations for a WFR course . It worked , but was not the brightest one out there .
 I often work in poorly lit areas around my house . This light is nice & small but thus has limited reach . You might need an additional light if things are too far away . Also found myself hitting things with it repeatedly , inadvertently adjusting it . Good light for it 's size/prize though !
 The light has worked great . We use it to check our dogs ears and it has also been used as a reading light . Only negative is the battery instillation .
 What can you say about a headlamp flashlight ? This one works . I use it in the shop and when working on the innards of a computer . It puts plenty of light wherever I 'm looking -LRB- a good idea , eh ? -RRB- . It remains cool to the touch and the strap is reasonably comfortable.In short , a handy led light for the shop .
 Perfect little headlamp for the price . It may not be the brightest on the market but it works fine for my needs . The beam is fairly narrow but I find that to be a plus . I especially like the ability to clip onto a baseball hat .
 The light is good - but the distance is not what I needed for working in a basement without electricity . I 'm helping to gut out homes after Sandy 's Wrath . I ended up getting a Streamlight headlamp for $ 32.00 . In my case , it was well worth the extra dollars . I can shed a lot more light on my subjects !
 I used my light last night when it arrived ... I take my dog for a walk every day ... It was raining/snowing out and that light worked great . It 's fits like a glove . It 's powerful on low . When you put it on high it works even better ... I am going to order more of these for our Cub Scout troop ...
 both the boy i gave this to and my husband like the product - i expect to see it around the house during the next blackout . -LRB- if not sooner -RRB- .
 Works well for hands free operation . Good construction and quality . Will use for night operations in a marine terminal environment .
 Everyone should have this in case of an emergency and I have used it on my dog for night walks !!!!
 always wanted one of these ; great product ! would purchase one for every member of the family too !! a necessary product to keep safe in storms .
 I use it to inspect my semi rig at 2 a.m. before heading out each morning . It provides plenty of light , where I need it , to be able to do my pre-trip inspection . I 've tried using headlights before , but they never worked very well . It 's refreshing to find a product that does what it says it will do . Thank you !
 Got this for my son . he loved it . It is made of good quility . Will order again from this company
 These items were purchased as Christmas gifts so they have n't been used yet . However , I was happy to find they came complete with batteries .
 This headlamp was given a good review in Backpacker Magazine and when I saw the price , I could n't pass it up . Nice , very light headlamp . Not sure why they use the over-the-head strap ? The light is so light that the headband alone would be fine but that 's a picky issue . I also bought the Burton RL4Brunton RL4 , 3 White & 1 Red LED Headlampat the same time , like both equally . The Streamlight has a longer focused beam throw while the Brunton has wider spread and a red LED feature I like when I do n't want to mess up my night vision . For the price of the Streamlight 61400 , you ca n't lose .
 Excellent product at reasonable price . I like the two AAA battery feature , becausse it is light and convenient to recharge if we use rechargeable batteries . Recommended .
 This was the rave at our last group camping trip . All the kids wanted one . Ofcourse , we only had enough for our kids + 2 more -LRB- which were supposed to be for us parents -RRB- to lend . Then I saw it for a little less @ Target . Think of all the things you 'll need light for hands free
 I purchased this headlamp to wear while running in the ragnar relay race . -LRB- a headlamp is required as the race goes all night and is in some remote areas . I was worried that it would be either uncomfortable being tight or keep slipping off my head while running . But neither was true at all . It didnt slip one bit and it was actually quite comfortable . The light was bright enough for the purpose intended .
 My nephew turned me onto this headlamp while camping . While I was fumbling with a flashlight , he just walked around with the ` Streamlight ' like it was daytime . It is certainly bright enough and lightweight , plus the straps make it comfortable and keep it on your head while you may bend over or under something . It also has a low and a high beam for certain uses . In a garage or basement , the high beam works great to see everything and if working on a car engine -LRB- or underneath -RRB- the low beam is perfect . If your house lights go out , this is much safer and brighter than using candles or holding a flashlight . You can wear this on your head while cooking over a Coleman stove ! The entire lighting works on only two AAA batteries.Another reason I like it for camping is that it is waterproof and the lens is polycarbonate , which makes it very durable and impact resistant . It 's lightweight and comfortable . It surprising when I think about all the times I went without one . I consider this a safety necessity . There are other headlamps on the market , but for this price , I ca n't think of a better deal .
 This headlamp is light , takes my kids abuse and works like it 's supposed to . I bought three for my 8 year old triplets and they have n't managed to destroy them and they have n't fallen apart on their own . Nothing fancy but not a bad headlamp for the price and my purposes .
 I 've had this headlamp for a couple of weeks now and have already put it to great use in the woods and even when our power went out . The ability to change from low to high beam is great and the amount of light it spreads is more than adequate . Comfort and angle adjustments are simple . No complaints whatsoever .
 This headlamp is really good and very easy to carry . I already got two from the same company and I love them .
 I recently went on a 33 mile hike in Big Bend National Park and it worked perfectly . We started every day hiking in the dark and finished the third day in the dark . It worked great for hiking in the dark .
 im doing work outside after dark and this handy tool will make the job easier it waterproof down to 1 meter so i can definately use it in the rain . im glad i made this purchase , i highly recommend this product .
 good quality construction good brightness adjustable output for different needs like the removable center strap i work on cars all day great for hands off lighting puts the light right were its needed
 Fits great , and has an adjustable band . The light angle is adjustable and has two different brightness levels . I 've had it for 2 months , and it 's still working and I use it 2-3 times per week .
 I 've had several types of head lights -- this one is light weight and supplies a tremendous amount of light and battery life is great !!
 Good price on a quality headlamp . There is n't much that one would need from a headlamp but this little light can be used with the band or on a hat . There are cheaper lamps out there , but there are also more expensive ones too . I like the LED , and impact resistant capabilities of this lamp . It 's also waterproof , which makes me feel confident about using it in the rain . I have used it camping and it works great .
 Just what we were looking for . Great light to get around dark campground . Lightweight . Good battery life . We camped for a week and used them pretty frequently and never changed the batteries . Could get a little uncomfortable after hours or wearing it on your head but over a beanie or on a hat brim it was perfect .
 This headlamp is great ! I use it for walking my dogs . The light is very bright and gives me a hands free . Love it !
 I 'm going to Peace Corps in a couple of weeks and saw this on the list of things to bring . I went camping this weekend and brought it with me to test out and its great ! Really convenient . There 's two options for brightness , strap is comfortable and it stays in place . I would definitely recommend .
 This hi/lo power lite is very small and light even though it has power for long periods . The 0.5 watt LED is just the same light that I bought at target years back under the River Rock brand name . This has been a very durable and handy flashlight . Wearing it around my neck is more comfortable for me to allow hands-free use .
 This thing is amazing , light weight , comfortable fit , long battery life , and tough . I closed a car door on it by mistake , no problem . Only light I need in my kit .
 I bought these as gifts for my nephews and they love them . This item is durable , provides great light , and is what I expected . I would buy them again .
 This only use 2 AAA batteries . It is still very bright and you can adjust the light direction . Your 2 hands are free to do anything you want . It is very valuable during camping .
 perfet to work on my car , my bikes , etc etc , and no need to use my hands to hold the light bicouse of the head strap , love it
 these were given to a 6yr old and 8 yr old boys . they loved them .
 works perfectly for my running , and not too heavy on the head . i like the dual light intensity and the settings so that i can look down toward my feet or straight out onto the trail . the price was great . i have recommended the light to my running mates .
 I absolutely love this light , I use it to walk my dogs at night and it is WONDERFUL . Works well , two levels of light and is a life saver at night . Cars can see me and I can find the stuff my dogs leave on the walk so I can pick it up .
 I have used this headlight for weeks now in hunting and camp situations and found it to be exactly as advertised.It is very good quality and the run time is nice . I use it mostly on low and it lasts very well with the 2-AAA batteries it uses which by the way are another reason I tried this in the first place because AAA are common and available as well as cheap to use . The Enduro is awesome for the price and the high setting is pretty good for about anything within reason for a light of this caliber . I ca n't speak of its waterproof design but it looks like it will take a drenching with no problem with the oring seal it has in the battery compartment cap.You ca n't go wrong for the money .
 GOOD , it is a good product , and fits perfect on the head , so adviseable to whom want to buy it .
 I use at work in dark garages , attics , anywhere there isnt enough light for me to work in.Leaves the hands free to get the job done.Keep one in your bail out bag , get home bag , and camping gear and you will see how handy they are .
 I researched headlamps for a while before committing to this one , and I have to say , this is exactly what I was looking for . I wanted something with a powerful light output that was well made . Streamlight is , in my opinion -LRB- and the opinion of the US Military -RRB- , the top manufacturer of LED flashlights , and this one tops all I 've researched . If you 're committed to buying on Amazon , I strongly suggest you go down to your local Sporting Goods store and test a few side-by-side before making your decision/purchase .
 As an avid hiker this product is great , two light settings and seems to be good quality . I used it tonight and its been great . Thank you , I would recommend this item .
 For several years my boyfiend had joked that he needed a miners helmet to work in some confined spaces in which he needed to use his hands such as wiring behind computer systems or behind other obstacles . As a joke I obtained this light as it was the closest thing that Amazon has to a miner 's helmet . This product is no joke . It has solved many of my boyfriend 's lighting needs whether working on cable arrangement , doing electrical work around the house or trying to find something in a deep cabinet . This light is the ultimate hands-free lighting solution for small projects . Multiple brightness settings allow the light to be flexible to what is needed and not over-brighten when it would be inappropriate -LRB- such as working with camera equipment during astrophotography , or working with anything reflective -RRB- . The light can not function for long periods of time -LRB- rated at 12 hours low-light , 6 hours on full -RRB- and therefore is probably only suitable to occasional or short-duration use and not for continuous use . It is a great light and works well for its size and cost .
 This is a decent head light . We got two , this one and the Streamlight 61052 Septor LED Headlamp with Strap . This one has a more spot on light while the other is a bit brighter and illuminates a larger area . If I was to buy again , I 'd probably stick with the Streamlight 61052 Septor LED Headlamp even though its a bit more , but if your looking for something on the cheaper side that will get the job done , this one will do just fine .
 Good product , as described has 2 levels of light low and high . Adjustable strap is comfortable and easy to adjust .
 Nice , simple and cheap . Puts out good light and with two settings it can last a long time . Easy to source and replace AAA batteries are a bonus . good built in clip for a ball cap is great . I use this thing to chop firewood all the time in the dark when I get home from work . Cant beat it for the $ 15 or so dollars it cost .
 Strap feels secure have n't used the clip for hat though.Overall bright light for the money , ajusts very easily . no complaints .
 This little light produces big results . It is powerful enough to illuminate your working area . It can even shine about 20 yards away but not very brightly of course . I very rarely have to use to the super mode , normal is bright enough for illuminating what you are working on with your hands .
 I do n't know how I got by without a headlamp . We just moved and I am doing a number of house projects , many of which are in areas that are not well lighted . This light weight headlamp really performs . Plenty of light and it is so light , you tend to forget it is on your head .
 I purchased this headlamp after some window shopping on amazon . For the price , it is just as it was described . It works great on both settings , it is light weight and so far very durable . I use it for navigating around the COP at night so that I do n't trip and fall . It is great for military tactical environments , so that your hands can be free . This headlamp is awesome for multiple use once this deployment is over .
 Super light , cant even feel it on your head . also good because you can clip it to your hat too . 2aa batteries , better than most compact lights which require 3aa . bright enough to do any working task . highly recommend it .
 this is a good product for the price . durable and strong elastic band . stays on my hardhat great . also clips and holds onto a hat very well .
 I bought this to use when taking my dogs for a walk at night . It is just as advertised and works great .
 Provides plenty of light output and is easy to use . I 'm glad it only uses 2 batteries , and 12h runtime on `` low `` is acceptable . I would like to have a `` strobe '' option but I ca n't be too choosy . Overall , an affordable headlamp that is easy to use .
 Kept my son safe in what could have been a very scary hit during football this year . Thank you so much
 THis gnome is very cute but there was some painting errors , but it was still loved by the receiver .
 I think this is hilarious - very cute - too cute for my backyard -LRB- I bought it for the back planter -RRB- - so I 'm keeping it in my office - well painted - seems sturdy
 Our University of Michigan gnome goes with us to every football game . He 's a huge hit at tailgate parties ! When he 's not saying `` go blue '' with us , he 's a cute decoration in my office .
 THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GNOME HAS BECOME A REAL PART OF MY SON 'S FAMILY . I GAVE IT TO HIM FOR CHRISTMAS AND BEING A BIG MICHIGAN FAN HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT . YES HE IS THE TRAVELING GNOME , HE GOES ON ALL THE FAMILY OUTINGS AND VACATIONS , HE IS IN ALL THE PHOTOS AT EVERY SPOT THEY VISIT . HE IS ALSO THERE AT EVERY GAME THE FAMILY WATCHES ON TV AND GOES TO TAILGATE PARTIES TOO . WHEN THE FAMILY IS AT HOME HE SITS AT THE DINNER TABLE ALONG SIDE EVERYONE ELSE . MY 2 YEAROLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES HIM AND PLAYS WITH HIM LIKE A DOLL.DEFINETLY A FUN PART OF THE FAMILY .
 Great product . Sits in our garden and looks good . Not corny . Quite durable and stands up to weather well . Overall a great purchase .
 I got this for my dad for Christmas and he loved it a ton . It was worth buying if your friends and family like sports .
 For the U of M fan with a yard . Bought two , both were in good shape/paints fine . Smaller than I expected , but it is the size listed . Went over well under the xmas tree , if I ever have need for a football gnome again , this is where I would look first . Thanks .
 Go Michigan - Fans just adore it.Great ornament for display!Good conversation starter.It probably will not see the garden .
 Looks amazing came packed well and they are just really cool decorations for your yard or house ! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a cool gift !
 My Father in law is a HUGE Michigan Fan , got this for him and he proudly displays it on the porch
 Bought this as a gift for someone who loves UofM and just moved into his first house . It 's very cool and nicely painted . He loves it and I 'm happy
 Saw one of these while tailgating at a Michigan game . Brought it for my husband for Christmas . Very cute , just what I was expecting .
 I have been looking for this gnome for forever . I had bought the female cheerleader gnome a few years ago and could never find the male . After a short search on Amazon I found him . Great quality product !
 I am a Michigan fan and I love this gnome , we named him Jethro and he sat with us during the Michigan vs OSU game , he did his job WE WON ... GO BLUE . !!!!!
 This is a great gift for that maize and blue lover in your life ! I got this little gnome for my grams garden for Christmas , shes a huge Wolverines fan and I just know shes going to LOVE this !
 My boyfriend has every Michigan sticker , keyfob , utensil , pen , apparel , etc. for Michigan . He recently became interested in backyard life and landscaping and I stumbled on this adorable figurine by accident . He loves it . It 's winter here in VA so , I have yet to see what it looks like outdoors . It 's so cute it makes me laugh . Someone reviewed that it was so small that it gets lost in the foliage but I do n't feel the gnomes are meant to stand out ; look a little closer & you spot it . Putting it in a potted plant in the office is a great idea , although it 's not THAT small :-RRB- Hope this review helps .
 I purchased this gnome as a Xmas gift for my son-in-law . Ca n't wait for him too see it ! He is a huge fan of the Michigan Wolverines . I know he will love it as much as I do . The gnome is adorable and will bring a big smile to my son-in-law ! He will appreciate the little guy giving him added support during his roaring cheers !!! A must have for a loyal fan !
 This was a gift for my sister at Christmas she started screaming when she saw it . She is a dye hard Michigan fan . She got it sitting in her living room in the window .
 This leotard is a real bargain . Very comfortable and fits true to size . Straps are very soft and do not dig into shoulders .
 I love this leo , I have it in black , white and pink -LRB- the pink one has a peach undertone , it 's not really ballet pink -RRB- besides the color issue , it 's perfect , it does not ride up , not see through , and the material is very nice thick , solid colors and it does n't pill up . A real steal I bought it for less than $ 10 !
 Very pleased with the product and the vendor . Received as stated and timely
 Will be back to buy many more , just started ballet and love this leotard ! Its great and comfortable for my workout !
 I did n't think I 'd like this leotard since nylon ones tend to be too thin and the light colored ones are often see-through . This leotard did not disappoint . The chest area is n't too low as long as you get the right size and adjust the straps . It is n't like the other nylon leotards I 've seen from other brands , where you can see every little line beneath your leotard . It 's just thick enough . As a bonus , it also smells good . I think it 's the odor-protection ... I am so glad I chose this leotard , especially when I bought it for $ 4.55 ! Great deal !
 Really nice quality fabric with a shelf bra and adjustable straps . Good width in the crotch with a built-in liner and a cut that fully covers the rear end . Sizing is on the small side , or else I 'm getting chubby . Usually I get a size `` small , '' but will exchange the `` small '' for a `` medium . '' I got this leotard to wear with yoga pants for teaching belly dance at high schools where the faculty prefers to not reveal abdominal skin . The fit of the leotard is snug like a second skin , so I 'm sure it will reveal the abdominal undulations while still being `` modest . ''
 Got this as a gift for my daughter . She has a plastic mail box so the strap on design was perfect . She LOVES it .
 This towable is an extremely stable , safe ride for everyone . It has a low center of gravity for the riders and the scoops that make the spray pull the boat to the water . In turns and rough water , it stays uprite , directly behind the boat . My kids , ages 7 and 10 , love it . The rider in the back seat gets a little wet but they do n't seem to mind .
 This is our first towable . We wanted something safe and stable for our young children , yet also fun and exciting . This fit the bill perfectly . When water conditions make the riding rough in choppy waters or going through wakes , you ca n't flip it . -LRB- I 'm sure you can push the envelope and flip it if you really tried , but I 'm talking regular use here , nothing crazy ... -RRB- The smile on all three kids ' faces gets ear-to-ear when they hit these wakes and waves -LRB- and the smile never leaves in calmer conditions , too -RRB- . I think the best part of this towable is its ease of use . There is no `` holding on for dear life '' as there are on others , but it is still exciting for young -LRB- or older -RRB- riders , especially new ones getting used to water sports activities .
 There is an online community that rides/races on the Netathlon software through Gamespy , the online gaming portal . The program works great the vast majority of the times . There are several courses available from velodrome to Alpe d'Huez . It has excellent graphics , and it controls the resistance of your electronic trainer -LRB- such as Computrainer , Tacx Fortius , others -RRB- to mimic real world conditions . It gets harder when your rider is in front taking the wind or when climbing . It gets easier when you are in a draft behind other riders or going down hill . It feels very realistic . Support is pretty good , and there are frequent updates.The software adds motivation when you can ride and even `` race '' other real and virtual riders online . It has definitely helped me to stay in shape for cycling in the cold months . Indoor riding has actually been fun.Here are links to some YouTube demos :[ ... -RSB-
 I first used the Exped Airmat 7.5 Pump Deluxe sleeping pad a couple of years ago , and immediately was impressed with the clever design of the integrated pump mechanism . I have used the pad with cots as well as on the ground , in summer and in winter . It is well designed , lightweight , well built -LRB- has never leaked -RRB- , and easy to use . It is not insulated , but as I do not camp in extreme cold conditions , I have always found the pad to be comfortable . The pad itself is rectangular in shape and is not tapered -LRB- as are some pads that are designed for use with mummy-type sleeping bags -RRB- . This is the `` deluxe '' version of the pad , which provides an extra 7 inches -LRB- approx 18 cm -RRB- of width across the entire length of the pad and is especially nice , making it tough to go back to a standard sized 19 - or 20-inch wide pad.The integrated pump makes it a snap to inflate the pad without a lot of effort . Depending on the amount of space you have to work in , the pad can be inflated in a couple of minutes or less . It has taken a bit of practice to learn to evacuate the air completely from the pad and then roll it up into a size that will fit into the storage bag.The pad comes with a storage bag and a repair patch and adhesive . The price will be a barrier for some , but the quality of the design , comfortable size , and the low weight will interest anyone who is serious about camping.Conclusions : * The price will be a barrier to some , however its ease of use , high quality , and clever design make it easy to recommend this pad for those who are frequent campers or who want the comfort of an easy to inflate pad in a lighweight package . * The design and build are excellent and reliable . I have never had trouble with the mat -LRB- I actually own two of them , one for use in the US , another for use in Japan -RRB- . * With a little practice , the pad can be filled very quickly and sleeps comfortably . * This is a general purpose design . Those who are in cold weather or without a cot may want to look at an insulated model . And extreme backpackers will probably opt for a smaller pad in order to reduce weight . * Lastly , if you 're on a budget , you can find a comfortable sleeping pad at half the price of this model if you look for one that does not include an integrated pump.Hope this helps !
 I am a former NCAA Division I Womens Basketball Player , and became interested in learning soccer when I lived in Italy a few years ago . Last summer , I made the decision to actually do something about my interest adn bought this official FIFA soccer ball labeled with the colorful and wonderful country of Italia . I fell equally in love with this soccer ball as I did the game . It is a quality product , armed with the official FIFA stamp and name . Today I take it with me , in my car , everywhere . For me it represents a strong symbol of the country I love , and a sport I very fondly enjoy . I will be ordering another one soon , while they are still available . Great product , and very highly recommended .
 I spread seeds in January and now in February I have a pretty emerald carpet of cute clovers growing with some of them having tiny white flowers . I bought this for chicken forage , so we 'll see how that goes . I wish the sun needs were clearly stated as it does not grow well in shade . Partial shade seems to do okay so far .
 This is a great visor . Exactly what I would expect from Reebok NFL Equip . The fit is good and the material holds up well even after washing in the dishwasher .
 I am pleased with this product . Leupold is a very good company that makes quality products . I think all of their products are made in the USA . Also the directions were clear and included the necessary tools .
 This gun is really fun for close quarters playing but not good for long distance ... Its fun to just play with it though .
 It does what it should ... i had always bought fenders pre inflated so this was new for me . I used a regular bike pump to inflate this one up . That was not the problem but the challenge is to fully inflate the fender and then seal it before all the air escapes . I tried doing this a number of times with limited success . I dont know however if one needs them fully inflated as even somewhat half inflated it seems to work fine ... . BUT it does appear to look like it needs more air in it .
 This is the second Shurhold brush I have gotten , the frist one only lasted 10 yrs . That cleaned 6 cars and one speed boat . Hopefully this one will last a little longer . Would buy this as a gift for anyone who wants to clean with ease .
 My latest purchase of the Shurhold brush head is a replacement for one that I have had for twenty five years . It is the only brush I will use on my car as it is soft enough not to scratch the paint . The old brush is reserved for cleaning the garage floor . It is still useable after 25 years .
 Highly recommended item , ca n't say enough for shurhold . Every item I own from them has been nothing but great . Instead of 10 separate cleaning items , I have a few brush heads that I store in my bucket , the expandable pole tucks away neatly in my gunnel rod holder and I have the gaff head along with the docking hook .
 I installed this on a cabin cruiser in the summer of ' 09 . The prior charger was the original on a '89 vintage boat . They 've come a long way since then . We take the family out and spend the night at the beach or out at anchor . It is imperative that the batteries are in top condition as getting stuck out on the water is not something I want to experience -LRB- again -RRB- . I 've got a dual deep-cycle battery setup , and wanted something to help ensure the batteries would live a long , productive life . I learned the hard way with a prior boat that while the old single stage chargers would indeed charge a battery , they were not good at maintaining a battery and eventually they would fade and have to be replaced -LRB- although at some point they 'll need replacing regardless , but I 'd like that day to be as far off as possible . -RRB- For as much as the batteries cost , and the hassle of moving them around , I want a solution that I can plug in and not have to worry about . I also wanted something that maintained each battery separately so that if one had a week cell or something it would not affect the other battery.Installation was easy . I ended up cutting the plug off the power cord and hard-wiring into a junction box to interface with my boats shore power system . Setup consists of connecting to the batteries and then selecting which type of battery each is so that the charger can use the proper algorithm . Very very simple.When I arrive at the dock and with the shore power connected I can quickly see the status of the batteries by the color of the individual LED 's . The unit is mounted in the engine compartment and I just lift the lid and take a peek . I do like that this has an optional accessory that plugs in to display the battery status remotely , without having to open the engine compartment , but it 's a luxury that 's not worth it for me but may be a big help for others.One concern I had when I opened the box was learning about a recharging time limit -LRB- this may have changed on newer units so be sure to check -RRB- . Apparently there is a timer built into the unit that if it stays in the `` bulk '' charge mode too long it will error out . I 'm not real clear on whether it would keep charging at that point or shut down thinking it has a malfunction . Supposedly the recommendation would be to use a higher amperage charger so that it would charge the batteries faster and not have the time out problem . After contemplating this -LRB- and really wanting to get it installed that day -RRB- I decided that the batteries would generally be charged by the alternator on the boat while returning from that weekends adventure , so that this charger probably would n't have to work very hard once it was plugged in at the dock . I 'm happy to say I was right , and pleased that I did n't spend more money on the next larger size . But if you are using the charger in a different application where the batteries will be more run-down , then checking the battery size against the charger output would be wise.I 'm storing the boat up on blocks for the Minnesota winter . I 've decided to leave the batteries connected to the charger , keeping them in `` float '' mode all winter . This has saved me a ton of hassle by not having to disconnect and lug the batteries out . Unfortunately I wo n't know for some time if this was really a good idea or not.In summary , I am pleased with this charger and would recommend it to others .
 I put this charger on my 32 ' sailboat that has two large wet cell deep cycle marine batteries . Installation was straightforward , except the wires between the charger and the batteries are only about 4 ' long . I had to lengthen these to be able to mount the charger where it would get good cooling air flow , and also be able to see the indicator lights easily.The indicators are nice , except I wish they had picked a different color to show that a `` wet cell '' battery had been selected . They use a red LED . Red means trouble -LRB- normally -RRB- , so this is a bit misleading . Otherwise the indicator LEDs are nice because they show if you have shore power working , and also the charging status of the batteries . It 's nice to know at a glance that your batteries are fully charged.I will update this review as I get more experience with the charger.Pat Robinson11/10/2011 Update . This charger has been installed for over two years now . It has worked without any issues . This is a good charger . I would recommend it .
 I have a Yamaha 212x with two group 24 batteries with a 1,2 , both switch . I was looking for a charger that would monitor and charge each battery independently because naturally one battery on my boating trips will get drained more than another due to sitting in a cove and listening to music for periods of time . This charger fit my need perfectly . Install was a breeze . Monitoring system is great . . Very easy to see each independent battery charging state -LRB- charging , trickle -RRB- . . Product is great . . Now I never have the need to worry about going on a day of boating with one or two dead batteries ...
 I have purchased two of the Guest 16102 chargers . When I pull my boat into the slip , I simply plug them in and forget about it . They do the thinking for me and keep my four batteries in tip-top condition . This is a solidly built , intelligently designed product , well suited for marine use . I had one technical question and I can highly recommend the manufacturer 's tech support in that regard .
 This dual battery charger is great ! I installed it on my boat myself with a minimum of tools . It keeps both batteries charged and ready to go all the time , and does n't ever boil out the battery water -LRB- although I recommend checking battery water level every couple of weeks -RRB- . The lights are a nice indicator of charge activity , so you know when and how much they each are being charged . Usually only when I have just come in and plugged in to shore power I will see the red lights for a very short while before they turn to blue and then to green . If the red or blue lights stayed on a lot I would be checking batteries ... I would highly recommend this charger to anyone who has a boat or rv with two -LRB- separate -RRB- batteries and wants them to be ready at a moments notice ...
 Going on 2 years and has worked with no problems.Agree with the other reviewer about the LED lights ... otherwise I would 've given it 5 stars .
 My husband , a Baltimore Oriole fan since a little boy , loved the Baltimore Orioles sandals ... great beach/water shoes ... they were so comfortable and looked sooo good on ...
 I 'm no Orioles fan nor any other baseball team - but I do love to flop around the house in slides - these are the BEST EVER !!! Especially considering the low price !
 my boyfriend 's dad is wearing these shoes in the cold of winter to take the dog outside . they are convenient and comfie and everyone who has them loves them !
 ok . . so warm . . so comforable and fits really well - i bought 2 at first and i just bought 4 more diffrent colors . you wont regret buying 1 of these : -RRB-
 This was my first online buying experience of clothing and I have to say I was not at all disappointed . I bought two of these pull overs for myself and my husband and we both love our fleece hoodies . They are perfect for going to the store , playing around the yard , just anything . They are so comfortable . I would definetly recommend one of these and we definetly plan on buying more in different colors .
 Very warm and I really like it.Only thing I dislike is that it is kinda short -LRB- not the arms , but the bottom part -RRB- Other than that , it 's awesome !
 I consider myself a hoody aficionado , and this one is instantly my favourite . This is not a bulky , heavy hoody you wear when it 's very cold , this one you throw on when the temperature starts dipping a little in the evening , or it 's a little windy , or you do n't want to turn the furnace on just yet . It 's a pure comfort hoody ; it breathes very well and stays dry , so you can comfortably wear it if you 're not quite sure whether it 's cool enough out for a hoody yet . You can wear it outside , then come inside and forget you have it on . It also fits really well , perfect sizing . I bought two , and might get another , since the dog put a bite hole in this one -LRB- my fault for leaving snausages in the pocket -RRB- .
 I would n't ever buy another brand of sweatshirt ever again after buying these Russell sweatshirts . They are warm , comfortable , and you ca n't beat the price . I would recommend them to anyone .
 Not sure how my home offices are always in the coldest room ... I wanted something warm which would fit over my already layered look and allow me to move . I love this hooded sweatshirt , it is warm and very comfortable .
 Russell Athletic hoodies are supreme in functionality . If you need something that can wear well , wear long and keep you dry , warm and not shrink with washing - this is the best sweatshirt ever !
 Russell Men 's medium pullover sweatshirt was a good buy for the money . Size was very accurate and priced just right considering the prices of sweatshirts for young men today . Purchased mine for my 15 year old son . He was very pleased .
 This is a good basic hoodie at a very good price . Not too heavy and can be worn inside when the air conditioning is too cold .
 Ordered this sweater for a set of sorority standards . Condition perfect , delivery quick , material strong .
 This sweatshirt was exactly what I wanted . It is well made , the color is bright , and it comes out of the drier looking great time after time . It was an excellent purchase .
 This is an awesome sweatshirt that keeps you dry and warm in the snow and cold . I bought two for my construction-working brother a couple of weeks ago , and he 's asked me for more already !
 The front pocket is HUGE . You could park a car in it . Great for holding keys , an iPod , or other essentials.The hood is big and warm . Plenty of drawstring on the hood too . You can pull the hood in tight on a really cold day or just let it hang loose on your back.I did n't get the whole `` dri-power '' thing until after I wore it for a full-day . Russell claims this new `` dri-power '' thing helps with `` moisture management '' -- meaning it helps you keep dry during workouts . After wearing one for a full day and sweating a lot , my t-shirt underneath the pullover was barely touched by sweat . -LRB- Other pullovers have drenched the t-shirt -RRB- This pullover is 50 % polyester and 50 % cotton . It is 100 % comfy . Highly recommend . In fact , I bought three myself . Get these . You will not be disappointed .
 I bought this sweatshirt last year and it is one of the most comfortable articles of clothing I own . I am a little ashamed to admit that I do n't use it when exercising , its so comfortable I use it to lounge around the house .
 My son loves these as they are really soft inside . He has many sweatshirts but will only wear these ! So , now we only buy these !
 i was surprise when i got the product . it is very good quality sweatshirt and i like the color .
 My husband and son both wear Russell Sweatshirts and they last wash after wash . Russell is a better brand of sweatshirt , thick , fits well and roomy . I have tried the cheaper sweatshirts and they do n't last as long or fit as well .
 I like this sweatshirt a lot , however the the shade of black that was shown here is different from the one I received . Err yeah . . good buy
 I bought a black one . Great hoodie ! Very comfortable and warm ! Fits great ! But I do n't like the fact that the hood is pointed . I look like an elf or something with the hood on . That was kind of a disappointment , hence the four stars .
 I was extremely pleased with the quality of this sweatshirt . It was sized right , did not shrink when washed , is thick and warm , and is well constructed.It definitely lives up to the Russell name .
 GREAT sweater . it fits perfectly and does n't seem like it 's been washed after you wash it .
 Ordered this shim for an older cruiser frame that I was turning into a retro `` Clunker '' MTB . I had an old layback BMX post that I wanted to use , and this shim fit the build perfectly . The shim was machined well , and had no burrs or scratches .
 I 'm sorry to hear that some people have had bad results , but there seems to be some misunderstanding about what this tape is designed to do . It is a * delicate surfaces * painting tape and it 's intentionally manufactured with a lighter-than-normal adhesive . It 's for use for example on fragile old paint that would pull up when you removed conventional masking tape .3 M 's standard painting tape is called Scotch Blue * multiple surfaces * tape . It has a tackier adhesive and should be used in most cases . Use the delicate surfaces version only when you have to . They also make a high tack tape for jobs that required extra adhesive.That being said , this tape is a lifesaver when you ca n't use the regular tape . I live in a very old house and have to deal with fragile paint films and plaster that ca n't stand up to the regular tape . I 've found a surprising number of uses for this tape . The adhesive lasts almost forever without running or drying out . You can use it for temporary repairs or to stick things to the wall and it will still come off cleanly a year later , when other masking tapes would have melted , hardened , and bonded to the surface . I find myself using it for this kind of job all the time , more than I do for painting .
 As always , Scotch pulls through . What more can I say ? I needed to stencil something and needed to make sure the surrounding areas did not get spray painted . 2 '' tape certainly helps !
 I recently used this to paint my kids ' bedroom . It stuck to the ceiling , it held , and came off clean . 2 '' was the better size between it and the 1 '' .
 These shorts are excellent quality . AFTCO is one of the finest and is known worldwide . These are heavy duty fishing shorts but dry quickly
 I really love this product it is very well made . Its really nice when the fish are really spookish and it is 100 % florocarbon .
 This Gun Is Very Good But When I Got It I Was Strugling To Get The Battiers To Work Pleasee Help
 Purchased this air soft gun as a gift for someone for Christmas . It is a great little gun ! Works great , looks great !
 This was a great buy , it works really well and is fairly well built , my only complaint is that it burns through batteries like you would n't believe so keep plenty on hand .
 I have had this gun over 7 months & it 's never jamed or caused any trouble . The acuracy is great and the sight uses a very small hole in the back and a pointer in the front . It runs on 4 AA 's that you put in the handle and you load it through the top . One thing is it 's really noisy but that really dose n't matter .
 OHHHKAY im a newguy to airsoft , This 'll be my first airsoft gun , and not to say with experience or anything , but this gun is awsome . At first when i saw it , the box was purple and all 90 's looking . It got here on the exact first day of shipping . I live in MS , and i think its shipped from California . Well i thought first day shipping is supah-kool . It shoot rlly fast , and perfectly strait , dosent matter the fps , or whatever , if u can see the guy u can nail him . The thing comes with 100 bullets , for testing i guess , because they run out fast -LRB- get lotsa bullets i guess -RRB- . I bought it on Nov. 17 or so , and it got her -LRB- once again -RRB- on the first day of shipping date -LRB- 22nd -RRB- . I cant wait to shoot some overconfident fool wif my gun.P.s . I wasnt sure if the people that rated this were real , -LRB- like some scam or sumin -RRB- but when i shot it , i knew they were real customers .
 I got this just to shoot at my friends but when it came i saw the power and was was amazed , i 'm going to use it as a side arm when i head out to the fields . Good purchase over all .
 THANKS SO MUCH . my gun is amazing . i bought the uzi mini and it OWNED EVERYONE . Pro
 Way mre reliable than any old spring pistol ! Faster , and easier to load ! An very quick to replace batterys . I recommend it !
 This thing is so fun to shoot ! I 've alreay wasted half a can of bbs shooting it in my backyard . I 've had this for 3 days now , and I have n't had to change the batteries yet . This is n't the most accurate gun , but it has a very good rate of fire . It 's got some weight to it as well , even without the batteries . I think it has a partially metal gearbox at the very least . The only thing I do n't like is that while I was firing it , a bb somehow made it 's way into the interior of the gun , and now it annoyingly rattles around every time I 'm playing with it . It does n't affect the performance or anything , it 's just annoying.Also , I would recommend buying this gun from Ultiprice . The shipping was very quick and very free . Their service was prompt as well , and very polite .
 This gun owns , I bought this from Sports Authority , the only difference it had was the back handle thing was different , on the box it said it holds 50 rounds . Just buy extra bbs for it , it is going to waste fast !!! I had it for a week and no jammed only once . If it gets jammed just pull the ammo holder front and back and you can fire again.Pros : Ownage gun50 round capacitySingle fire or automaticCons : No clips , but who cares it holds 50 rounds180fps barely hurts I shot myself on bare skin not even a welt.Sports Authority charged 25 bucks but I think it was better , it also was free shipping because I went to the shop lol.Pretty much it , it owns .
 this is really a great gun very accurate and fast shots it is Very loud and i like that :-RRB- overall worth the price plus more !!!
 It 's a nice gun.Just because the fps is like 150 its still good.It 's so good that if you see any suckish review do n't listen to it.Worth every penny!It 's about 1 foot long -LRB- Without the stock open -RRB- but if you open the stock it 's about 17 inches.If you are about to buy this , do n't worry how you think that it 's too small .
 This is my just like my dads gun only he got his from dicks . He hid it until he got 4 AA batteries . He said that we wold NEVER use it but i kept taking it behind his back . -LRB- lidertially he always put it in his back pocket . -RRB- one day i asked him `` why wo n't you share '' he said `` its mine '' then i said `` I do n't care you Have co2 powered steel bb gun that goes 500fps that could kill us and you want a 150 fps Uzi that shoots plastic bb 's .
 This is a great gun . Is is pretty durable and seems like it is pretty accurate . It also hold s a lot of amo .
 looks bad in picture but very good sidearm and very powerful . Only bad thing is that it holds about 50 bbs
 This uzi is really awesome ! It shoots a little faster than my electric pistol , and is surprisingly accurate . It shoots around 35 feet accurately , and holds about 30 rounds . this goes great with a pistol or another uzi because you can unleash a lot of rounds in no time . That 's sure to make your enemies duck out of the way . This gun is great , I have no complaints and for 20 bucks is a definite must buy !
 I really like this piece because its pretty inexpensive but holds up well . A little hard on the batteries but my kid has a lead finger . It fires consistently but not too hard . Better for up close combat as opposed to long range snipering . Loads easily and holds a pretty good amount of ammo .
 I 'm new to airsoft and was looking for a gun that would be fairly easy to operate . I chose this as my first gun and it is well worth the money , 4 double A batteries in the handle of the gun and you 're set . The only thing I do n't like about the gun was the stock . First off . . wtf ? Who 's going to use a stock for a gun a little bigger than a pistol ? And you could n't use it anyway because it 's so flimsy I 'm afraid if I looked at it wrong it could break . Another annoyance was that I had to hold to safety in order to shoot , the problem is that I 'm left handed and the gun is n't . Oh well .
 IT SHOOTS FAST DOSENT JAM COMES REQUIERS 4 BATTIRES AND COMES WITH 100 BBS ITS A GREAT GUN FOR BEGGINESO BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 do not try to change the saftey feature it will break if u dont really know what your doing otherwise great cheap durable gun
 This is a great gun and the only problem was the safety button you have to hold in is right handed and I am left handed
 This gun rocks I have a 357 magnum BBC gun and I lke this better . Shoots fast comes out nice and smooth I bought this for my brother now I 'm going to get one and a different one for fun . I highly recommend it .
 i had a gift certificate to amazon , so i bought this not expecting much . but tis great , me and my friend have wars with it all the time , only thing is it kinda skips sometimes and so there isnt a constant stream of bbs . but you are supposed to burst fire it anyway , so thats not really a problem .
 I bought this gun for my brothers as a Christmas gift not really expecting it to be that good or even arrive by Christmas . But within a week the seller had it processed and shipped and they arried on Christmas eve . And they work great too . I was shot in the leg from fifteen feet away and it hurt like hell . A good sign i 'm told . The battery life is pretty long lasting so you 're not throwing your money away in that area and they have n't jammed yet .
 The gun is very nice , its very lite to carry it around . the plastic is very strong , it shots very far away . I would say this gun is amazing and you should buy this gun and its very cheap too so you wont be spending that much money . Everyone should buy this gun .
 Fast shooting , seems to have a decent distance and spread , wastes ammo alot though . I would reccomend it for single shot and three spray bursts .
 Cant beat this airsoft for the price a fun gun just to mess around with still stings at about 30 feet not bad !
 this gun is really great the accuracy is kinda good but has a low capacity i do not like the stalk it gives me less control
 I love this gun . I 'm a new guy for airsoft and this gun help me so good.When I was fighting with my airsoft gun I bit evrybody in 4 seconds it 's an AMAZING GUN.It 's a good product.I think evrybody can buy this gu if you have money and I think a lotof people wish to have it.YOU CAN BUY IT .
 Pretty good . It took a little to long in shipping . Its a great gun ! The ammo capacity should be bigger . The worst thing about it is its LOUD !!!! But overall its a great gun ! The shipping took a while . My son was bouncing off the walls waiting for it . Very satisfied!Thank you
 I thought that this was one of the best Uzi air soft guns you can buy , however when i received it i did not know it did not come with a rechargeable battery . You have to use 4 double As , over all i think it is worth buying . As well it comes with a bag of BBs so consider buying this Uzi if any Uzi .
 This gun is awsome . Holds about 40bbs and they go in the top of the gun so it has better accuaracy I had this gun 4 like 2months it hasnt jammed once it needs 4 double A batteries the bad thing about this gun is u hav 2 hold down the safety switch 2 shoot its not dat hard shoots about 200 fps
 I needed a way to mount a light on my Mossberg 500 and I do n't have room to mount on the magazine tube and I hate those tri-rail foreends . This was a good solution for me . It 's rock solid and easy to attach . Just a note , the picture shows it fully assembled and attached to a shotgun but the only thing you are buying here is the flashlight mount , no sidesaddle or flashlight included . I would recommend the UTG Defender light to go with this .
 I recently put a top folding stock on a mossberg 590 , I mounted a sidesaddle to the stock and was trying to figure out where to put a weapon light on . I found this mount from TacStar and knew that it would work great , it did.It took all of ten minutes to mount the light and put it in the sidesaddle . With a top folding stock it puts the light off to the side with this setup I have the option of using a right or left side light . TacStar keeps coming up with novel new items that impress me ... Keep up the great work TacStar !
 It may have not been what I was expecting , but for the price , it is a good quality . Not to mention , it came in the mail 2 days later !
 These shorts are excellent quality . AFTCO is one of the finest and is known worldwide . These are heavy duty fishing shorts but dry quickly
 I was n't sure what I was going to get when I ordered this . I was pleasantly surprised when it came . I had to put it together , it has 2 different brackets included , 1 for an inch and 1 for a 2 inch trailer hitch . It is a metal cover and looks like it powder coated which is way better then paint . Go Ravens -LRB- next year -RRB-
 This Baltimore Ravens metal hitch plate cover is of high quality medal , with detailed art work . It came just as described and at an excellent value . This same product was found on other websites at three times the price of what I paid for it . I 'm ecstatic with the product !
 Works precisely as described . Has held up well so far . I 'll be interested to see how it fares in the snow and ice .
 very easy to put on . wish I was told that I needed to purchase the bolt to keep it in place . Luckily I had from my hitch that I used . Other than that I like it .
 fits my superjet perfectly ! it is a little big for my kawasaki , but will still work fine . company emailed me promptly with updates about my package a + service . decent shipping . overall very pleased !
 Lovely bicycle basket ! Same as the one I had when I was a child . Fits perfectly on the handle bars . Price was exceptional and shipping was very fast !
 This product is just what we needed . The delivery was fast . The price was the best at the time . It was easy to install .
 This is a very basic basket that works wonderful . I bought this with a rear basket and can get my grocery shopping done in one trip .
 This basket was bought for a bike for my daughter at college , was easy to install , came in a timely manner , and was completely affordable.You ca n't find one of these baskets like they put on old bikes in storesand for a vintage bike it was perfect . Thank you for your prompt delivery.EXCELLENT !!!!!!! A + + + + + + + + + + + +
 This basket was a nice addition to my Huffy bike , is deep enough and large enough to carry whatever and just adds the right touch to the bike .
 This basket was exactly the size we were looking for and was easy to install . Arrived promptly
 This basket is big enough to fit one grocery bag or one Westie dog when her short legs get too tired . This basket makes my bike more functional . I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 IAM VERY SATISFIED WITH YOUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE . MY FRIEND ORDERED ONEHE IS ALSO SATIFIED .
 Very sturdy construction and clear installation instructions . I especially liked the pieces of rubber included to protect the handlebars from friction damage .
 I purchased this to add to my beach cruiser for our camping trips . I carried my shih tzu around all weekend in it he weighs about 10 pounds . I went to the campground 's store & purchased 2 gals of water , they fit perfect in it . It is a great sturdy basket . My husband put it on in about 5 minutes . Everything fit perfect & it looked great on my purple bike . Even after my bike was stolen at the campground and wrecked , the basket held up great . One small little bend in the top rail , but no major damage , my bike had more damage than the basket did . I would recommend this basket to anyone looking to carry items on their bike . This is a great product for campers for those trips to the store for ice , water or whatever . It 's also super great for riding your favorite small dog around , and they love it too !! Highly recommended by me & my doggy FInnegan LOL !!
 My husband and I each got a basket
 Easy to install and roll . It 's sturdy and ca n't beat the price . Great for small trips to the grocery store or wherever you might want to carry small items . I recommend this basket to one and all .
 My Wald Bicycle Basket is wonderful . I received it in a few days after ordering it . It attached very easily to my 1970 Schwinn Breeze and looks awesome . It took me a few days to get use to the weight of the basket on the front of the bicycle and when the basket is over loaded with stuff in it , it 's a little difficult to balance . That is when I have to pay more attention when riding the bicycle .
 The basket is large and well made . The only reason that I did n't give it four stars is that the bag was missing a couple of screws and the ones that were there were too short to use the padding that cmae with it to protect the handle bars .
 I purchased as a Christmas present for my daughter 's bike last year . It set up quickly and it is perfect for her backback . We added a few small bungee cords to help keep items from moving around in the basket . Also when the bike is mounted on a bike carrier , the basket does not get in the way . I am getting ready to purchase one for my bike as well . A great product at a great price .
 Just got the basket and took me like 15 minutes to install it . It 's great quality all around . I have beach cruiser and the support arms are just fine length . I saw that someone else said they were short ... but mine were fine . Here 's a video of it I made for a friend after installing it :[ ... -RSB-
 brings back old memories . . Bought it for grandchild . . He loves it plenty of room and easy to install on bike , Very sturdy
 Best basket I 've found . Handles heavy grocery loads easily and looks good in a retro way .
 I was looking for a basket for my new cruiser bicycle and I wanted something chrome , relatively deep and easy to install . Got all three at a good price .
 too many bicycle baskets attach only to the handle bars and when anything heavy is put in them they will lean downwards even if they are securely tightened . this particular basket also very easily attaches to the bicycle frame and although the description says deep is is not so deep that it takes away from the attractiveness of the bicycle yet it is large enough to carry gallons of milk , 12 pack of drinks , etc. have ordered another one for my other bicycle .
 This front basket had the best proportions out of all the other ones I had looked at . Its deep and shallow in length . The basket came with the necessary hardware to install right away . The front basket is sturdy and looks like it will last .
 I started riding my bike more often , so I got this , to be able to cart things around without wearing a backpack.It 's quite large , so I can fit things in it just fine . It 's sturdy , so I have n't had any problems carrying too much stuff , although I have n't done a serious stress test -LRB- most I carried at once
 This is a great basket ! It is a perfect size for my bike . It is well made and a very , very sturdy basket . The rubber gaskets strips used between the metal attachment that goes on to the handlebars is a great idea . Once it is mounted to the fork there is no bounce , rattle and or movement of the basket . It stays strong !
 I just got my basket today and i LOVE it ! I got the silver one and it looks awesome on my black cruiser . Assembly was super easy and it fit perfectly . It seems really sturdy and spacious ! To test it out i took a 12 mile bike ride with my little dog in the basket and everything went smoothly ! -LRB- i did have to add a folded blanket on the bottom to make it comfortable for her -RRB- I really really like this basket and i would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND it to anyone that 's looking for an inexpensive and sturdy bike basket .
 This basket fits on my wife 's Electra Amsterdam Classic 3i . It fit perfectly . The rubber pieces were nice to protect handle bar . I had to take off the light and simply re-attach after the basket was in place . I really like the stability of the basket .
 I love this basket ! It was so easy to install too and I 'm completely tool illiterate and I figured it out and did it really quickly with no trouble . It 's sturdy and so convenient . I even put my dog in it and ride her around . It 's really cute . It holds quite a bit of weight and looks really good on my bike . The attachments are sturdy and I feel really secure about putting things in it . I highly recommend this basket over one without the extra support bars . It 's the perfect size for a paper grocery bag or something similar . Just be aware that putting smaller objects like a cell phone in it with nothing else ... well , these things have a tendency to `` pop '' out of the basket if you hit a bump so be sure your stuff is secure ! I bought little velcro straps from Lowes and if I 'm carrying small stuff in it , I will put the velco straps across the top of the basket to ensure nothing pops out of it , or just put something heavier on top of it . It works great though and was exactly what I was looking/hoping for . I 'm very pleased . I have it on my Schwinn mountain bike and there 's still plenty of room for a light to be attached and all that good stuff .
 I purchased this rack to add some utility to my English cruiser and was able to get it installed quickly and easily . However , once I started riding with it , I found that the strut length and basket height did not agree with my particular bike setup . Because of the length of the struts , I had to angle the handlebar clamps up -LRB- rather than down , as they are designed to work -RRB- to level the basket.Because of this , I found initially that the basket would fall down in the back as I rode , so that the rear of the basket was lower than the front , no matter how hard I tightened the clamps.The solution was simple - I put it in the level position and used zip ties to hold it in the upright position.Once that little fit issue was solved , the basket worked great for all around utility and grocery runs . It was a little disconcerting the first time with a heavy load in it , but after a few minutes , found that I was used to the change in feel.The basket is very well made and rattle free , and the silver color looked great with my old bike . For the money , there 's nothing that even comes close . I 've used quick release shopping baskets before , on different bikes , and found that this design rattles far less and hold more , all while looking far better.After a while , though , I discovered one other unforeseen fit issue , which I ca n't resolve
 I bought this basket for my mountain bike , wanting something less bulky than the `` quick release '' baskets . It 's less bulky , and still holds quite a bit -LRB- of course not as much as a basket for the back ! -RRB- , but the legs that came with it ca n't be used with quick release front tires , which was n't mentioned in the product description , and if it was , it 's pretty hidden ! you can buy special attachments at `` your local bike shop '' - so say the instructions , but i have n't bothered - part of the reason I bought it was because it was inexpensive . But even without the legs , it functions just fine , probably a little rattlier than it would have been with them , but it does n't fall on the tire or anything.Overall , I 'm a little disappointed , but with the selection I 've seen , I 'd honestly still buy this one again .
 This is the 3rd time I 've purchased this basket for 3 different bikes . I can tell you it is the best and I would never ever buy another . It is deep and wide enough for my huge book bag and plenty of room for some grocerys .
 I received 2 of these for my hybrid bicycles.Let me start by saying I was a little sceptical about how they would fit.As I opened the box I was pleasently surprised with the quality of these baskets.I read thru the instructions a couple of times before touching any tools.It took about 15 leisurely minutes to assemble and install each basket.They fit like they were custom made for my bikes.I can hardly wait to take my first trip to the grocery store!My hats off to WALDS for making such beautiful , functional products ... Right here in America !!!!!!
 The baskets are great , just what college kids need . They hold a backpack quite nicely . A bit of a challenge to attach to the handlebars due to the bike 's handlebars being a bit wider than the clamp , but doable .
 I wanted a sturdy basket that I could hold my bag and other items . This works perfectly . It was easier to put on then the directions made it seem . The directions where more complicated then needed .
 I read the reviews before purchasing this basket . The only complaint that I really found , of significance , was that the support braces were too short . I have a 24 '' bicycle because I 'm not very tall so the 26 '' bike was not an option for me . My husband put the basket on my bike and it did not have to be modified in any way . He is an engineer and was impressed with the quality of the basket and the ease of installation . I love that it 's deep and will hold a grocery bag without difficulty . The basket is very sturdy and can hold some weight . I will be riding my bicycle to work in the Spring and Summer and have some heavy items to transport back and forth . I am extremely pleased and highly recommend this basket .
 A hard to find item but worked well on my 18 speed womens bike . Good for the price . Installed easily
 I have purchased many Wald baskets for the electric bikes in my tour business . The design of these has n't changed much , or maybe at all , in 50 years or more . Why ? Because they got it right , and if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it.They have supports to the axles -LRB- unlike most cheap baskets -RRB- so they can hold a lot of weight without bending or straining . I do n't think there is a better made , and practically designed basket sold .
 Holds a good amount without falling . Sturdy and easy to put on . I would recommend nd purchase again . Nice basket .
 read the warning label
 There are more expensive baskets that are cheaper made . I had to add some extra hardware to make it fit on the wheel properly . But it went on and seems solid . It 's a nice looking and a strong feeling carrier . It 'll do the trick !
 Fits my Schwinn beach cruiser perfectly ! It looks great and has plenty of room for some drinks and sandwiches for picniking !
 Perfect ! Easy assembly . Sturdy . Practical and looks terrific . I was going to order the white , which was the original basket on the back -LRB- groceries and such -RRB- but the paint was cracking off the original basket leaving the chrome underling , so I ordered the chrome . Cheaper , and , as I said , looks great .
 We bought this for my wife 's bike , and she uses it constantly . It was easy to install and works fine . It seems to be well-made and durable . We 've only had it one season and it had no problems . It is not recommended for bikes with shocks on the front forks , but my wife 's bike DOES have suspension on the front that moves quite a bit , and it has never bent or affected the integrity of this basket . The basket just kind of moves with it without tossing out what 's inside .
 This is good and cheap staff . You will be happy with it since it is what it looks like . Do not pay more for other baskets !!
 Have had Wald Products before and they last forever.Just wanted to update my old bike with a new shinny baskeet
 Installation was easy . I attached the legs to the fender eyelets . If you do n't have fender eyelets , this might not be for you . Holds a large reusable grocery bag pretty well . It 's a bit heavier than I expected . Made in USA .
 I bought this basket to install on my Urban Lady Beach Cruiser -LRB- 26 '' -RRB- and I am so glad I did . It 's the perfect size for my reusable grocery bag when I go to the market or to just hold my purse when I 'm taking a ride around town . The installation was very easy -LRB- I did it myself with a screwdriver and a small clamp -RRB- and it does n't wiggle thanks to the reinforced legs that attach at the bottom . I am extremely pleased with this purchase .
 fits perfect on my cruiser , The bars provide additional support if you want to put heavier things in the basket .
 I love my basket - looks great and was easy to assemble !! It arrived fast , too so I was very happy all around !
 I had bought this basket for my daughter who had an older bike and it worked great . Unfortunately , my bike had a different type front wheel that made it tricky to get on .
 it 's a little bit smaller than what I expected . But it 's really good , very stable after set up correctly . And parctical !!
 I had my 20 year old Columbia `` rehabed '' & wanted to add a new basket . This one fit the bill perfectly . Resonable price , quick shipping and easy installation . What more could you want ?
 Pretty easy to setup but once on the bike , its pretty hard to take off . Otherwise a good useful bike basket . Fit my bike Giant 15inch .
 Excellent choice for the daily shopper . Holds one shopping bag full of groceries . I 'm not sure why so many are having trouble with the support brackets . I have a full size electric bike adjusted the handle bars a bit and it fit on the bike like a glove . Strong durable and easy to install .
 The bike rack is now on my bike and looks great . The only thing I think that may have been better are the instructions . I had to pay someone $ 25 to put the rack on because I could n't figure out by the pictures/instructions that you bend the attachments backward . It was actually very simple putting the bike rack on .
 Wald 135 front bicycle basket - very easy to install , looks great , reasonable price , fast delivery . Very pleased with product .
 Very pleased with this basket . Depth is great for safely carrying goods around town !
 I bought this for my wife 's bicycle . It is a Schwin . The basket fit up fine without needing any modification . It really looks nice . We checked and a grocery sack will slip right down inside of it.It is made well and came in good time . By the time I paid shipping I could have bought one at a local bicycle shop . However they did not have any in stock and I needed to make an order to Amazon for another item .
 This basket fits my 26-inch bike fine . It was very easy to assemble and install , and it quite sturdy . Also looks nice on the bike . Love it !
 I bought this for my daughter 's bike . She loves it !! It 's big enough for her backpack and is very sturdy . It was super easy to install !
 I needed a cheap basket for my new schwinn bike and this was perfect . I 've been using it for a few months now and it 's sturdy and stable , even after it took a few direct hits it 's only a little bent . It was easy-ish to install after reading the instructions . I would buy this again if I had to .
 This basket was easy to assemble . It is sturdy and it looks great on my bike . The price is better than most anything you will find at a store , and the shipping was speedy . I love my cruiser and I love this basket ! Oh and do n't let my title decieve you , the basket can hold a lot , take it to the farmers market and you wo n't be sorry with all the carge space you have .
 Added a silver version to a hybrid , it looks so good . The size is perfect for a backpack , but could be a little small if you are planning to use it for heavy shopping . Leaving the backpack off the back is a great deal . Adding the basket does n't affect the smooth steering feeling of the bike . A great add-on to a hybrid .
 Great value , great purchase , arrived in a timely fashion and easy to install - no surprises . I 'd definitely buy again .
 The demensions ARE listed , but for some reason I imagined it being larger . I bought mine to be able to haul a few grocery bags . With this I can fit only 1 plastic bag of groceries . Maybe 2 if their not too full.This product is exactly as listed . Looks great . Solid black color . Just make sure you know what dimensions you are getting .
 The basket holds a lot of weight and is solid . While it does make the front of my bike a little heavy - I carry it up and down a few stairs each day so that 's now awkward .
 Love it . It holds a lot of stuff and is fun for doing errands and seeing friends who like to give my magazines .
 This is a nice , sturdy basket . It is perfect for transporting small groceries and bags . Be careful not to overload it though , because it has caused my bike to tip when parked .
 Bought this product so that we were able to bring home some groceries from the store while we were out bike riding . It is sturdy and sets on the bike really well . I would n't hesitate to purchase this product again . We have been extremely satisfied with it .
 Easy to put on , fit my cruiser just fine . Seems smaller than the dimensions they gave but should work fine , looks nice too
 This front wire bicycle basket is perfect for carrying things . It is sturdy and will hold quite a few items . I bought this one for my daughter 's bike - mine has had the same basket by the same maker - I bought it at least 25 years ago so I can vouch for its durability ! It is also easy to install with simple directions .
 It took me longer to find the right size sockets than to install this basket . It 's very sturdy , fits perfectly on my bike , and is plenty big enough for small trips to the store .
 The basket was more than we had expected . It was easy to install and held a lot . The pity of the whole thing is that our bike was stolen but we would buy the same basket for our new bike .
 very good front basket for the price , nice finish against oxidation , it fits a big groceries bag or 2 gallons of water , or a small dog , easy to install , but according to bike brand , clamps could be little bit too short or too long , beside that I give a 4 star
 It 's sturdy , installation is easy and straight forward if you 're at all used to working with bike accessories . You ca n't install the supports on the hub if it 's a quick release , you 'll need to use the braze-ons on the fork .
 It fit my beach cruiser without any problem , and my husband said it was easy to install . It holds two gallon size jugs . I am very happy with it , and I like that it 's made in America too !
 My basket was easy to install and a perfect size ! Great for my retro bike . I feel 14 again ! Well , maybe not , but having a great time with bike and basket .
 Received basket with no problems . Mounted on bike easily , and carries my stuff , and a couple of spring clothes pins or equiv . are handy to keep papers etc from blowing out , so I keep them clipped to the basket .
 I bought is for my bike and assemled by myself.Assembly took some time but it is very hard fixed with upper clip to the handle and lower wheel supports.I am very too happy to ride with my belongings in it.In addition , make sure that white or black is better than silver .
 the basket was built well from what we could tell ; was n't able to use it on my cruiser bike ~ had to return it * at my cost * , which wasalmost the exact amount it cost , anddid n't get a refund on it ... so was out the $ 12 ~ MEASURE , MEASURE , MEASURE !
 I purchased this basket in black around november in 2011 and I am still completely satisfied . Although i would not recommend this size for groceries it is the perfect size for my purse with a little extra space . Best of all , it has not yet rusted as i suspected it to ! Its made my life so much simpler since i do not drive .
 It 's exactly as expected , and the company responded immediately to my emailed request for help . Despite the clear instructions , working in a frigid garage I must have botched the matching of nuts and bolts and thus damaged some . A replacement set arrived by first-class mail in about two business days . All you need for installation is a screwdriver and a wrench . The screw heads are slotted for blade or Phillips driver , a nice touch . The wrench , such as a 5-inch adjustable crescent , works the bike 's axle nut and the the basket 's four assembly nuts . Pliers would work for the small nuts , but might scar them . Believe the instructions , short-screw-hex-nut and long-screw-square-nut , and you 'll be fine -LRB- : - -RRB-
 The basket was relatively easy to install . I did it myself , and I 've never worked on a bike before . I had more trouble with the bike than the basket . I do suggest NOT following the directions exactly . It was much easier to put the supports on the bike before attaching them to the basket.The basket is small , or at least smaller than my last one , but it very deep and has a sturdy feel to it . I have n't tested it with anything particularly heavy yet , but I expect that it will do quite well .
 This is your typical Wald bike basket . Nothing too fancy , but immensely practical . I added some oak slats to the bottom of it to increase the aesthetics and functionality as well . It fit a 1979 Schwinn Suburban perfectly and still looks great over a year later .
 I 'm very pleased with this basket . It assembles very easily and is very sturdy but not heavy , which is important because you do n't want a lot of weight on your handle bars . I have a Shwinn hybrid city bike that I use to commute to work and I can fit my large purse and a change of clothes/jacket in it . It 's well priced and it shipped quickly !
 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this basket and the way it looks on my red vintage Raleigh Sprite bicycle !!! It arrived much sooner than expected and installation was so easy ! -LRB- I advise for anyone who owns a bike to have one of those multi-purpose bicycle wrenches-comes in super handy . -RRB- Unlike a wicker basket , this one has extra support with the two bars underneath and it is indeed very sturdy . Very satisfied . I was lucky that the bars were just the right length for my bike ... many beach cruisers may need an extension on the bars .
 Not a lot to add to the other reviews . It is a nice strong basket . I am adding it to my Daughters electric scooter . For some eason , they do not include a basket , and due to the light on the front , it is a lot more work to add the basket , than it should be . We ended up hanging it on the seat post , and using some pipe grounding clamps , from the electrical department at hme depot.The basket is great . it has all of the hardware needed to mount it to your bike . it easily handles everything we bought at 7-11 , and had room to spare . This included a gallon of milk .
 Excellent product , very easy to install . Holds two gallon plastic jugs of water with a little room left over for sundries . Low price . I should have had Amazon send two .
 I bought two of these baskets for my sisters since they walk to school and have to carry humongous high school books . We assembled them yesterday and we 're happy that they are very spacious and sturdy . A basket fits a think english book a medium sized math book and my sister 's backpack . I would recommend this product but the only bad thing I would say is that when assembling the baskets we had to use our own nuts rather than the ones that were provided because the screw did n't fit through the nut . We also added washers and locks for extra security . But overall it 's a good investment .
 The basket is great . I purchased it to outfit my Wife 's new bike I bought her for her birthday . We got back from Germany and saw all the healthy people riding their bikes around to do their daily shopping . This basket is easy to install and perfect for the task at hand .
 Not overly heavy duty , but strong enough to carry most bicycling basics and a decent amount of groceries . Very simple to install . I like the handle bar mounting system . It keeps the basket from wobbling and does n't let the basket scratch the paint on the frame .
 Just got this today -LRB- May 2 , 2011 -RRB- and put it on my motorized bicycle to be able to go grocery shopping . Installation on my Schwinn 26 '' beach cruiser was a no brainer . Was concerned the ends of the front forks would not be usable for the handles ... but the round part of the tube does not get in the way of attachment to the axle.The only reason I gave four stars ... rather than five is that the screws they provide are the cheapest Phillips head screws they could find to attach the basket to the handlebars . This means you will not be able to tighten them down enough to keep the basket stationary . Because of this ... went to the local hardware store and got some Grade 8 `` Allen-head '' bolts and tightened them down . Other than this ... looks and rides great . Also allows me to run my speedometer and light without interference.Other than the bolt issue ... I love it !
 Make sure your handle bars are the correct diameter and that there is a spot on your front tire to mount the legs of the basket otherwise this is not the basket for you ... i had n't bought a basket before and probably should have considered this stuff beforehand , the basket ended up fitting on one of my bikes .
 For the price , it is quite good . Holds up really well . Way more than 25lbs worth of stuff .
 I have been using this basket on my bike for about 5 months now . I really like the thing . My bag fits , so does loads of my groceries . Its just sturdy enough . One thing though is I have not yet figured a way to attach the bike light directly to it . My bag once in the basket , covers the handles and hence the light . All said and done - I would recommend this bike basket - sturdy , comfortable , easy to fix , convenient .
 I wanted a nice solid basket for my early 60 's 26 '' Schwinn 3 speed and I found it in the Wald 135 . I was concerned it would n't fit , but it 's almost like it was designed for my bike . It took me a whole five minutes to install , and is a nice quality piece . A standard-sized grocery bag fits in perfectly , to give you an idea of how big it actually is . Hauling a couple of gallons of water on the front was a little unnerving the first time I tried it , but I got used to it after awhile . I recommend keeping a small bungee cord strapped in to help contain whatever you 're carrying , but beyond that it 's a great basket .
 My bicycle is an older english-style 3 speed bicycle . The basket installed easily in about 15 minutes . It is the right size to hold a single grocery store paper bag although you should be cautious about putting too much weight in it and making the bike unstable . The basket is well built and finished . I 'm quite happy with it .
 I bought this one for my wife 's 26 '' cruiser and it fit perfect ! Very easy to install and very solid . I bought the delivery basket for my bike but I 'm going to get one of these instead .
 Exactly what I wanted -- ordered two -- received 4 days later -- excellent quality , easy to install -- and the lowest price for the exact basket & lowest shipping price .
 GReat price ! I love tennis and this strings last very long , I was just tired of changing strings .
 Solid small compass , packed away nicely of course . Helped me navigate the wilderness this past weekend .
 this is one of the best guns i have ever had ! Its not the most accurate gun but hurts when you get hit . people have become scared of it when i bring it to an airsoft war . all my friends have asked if i 'd get it for their birthday .
 this gun is the best . It has great aiming , fire power , and range . I recomend this gun to anyone !
 Im just kidding the gun is awesome . It shoots really fast and it hurts . When you play surrender you always win with it . I reccomend it . It is effective up to 100 ft. I call mine the Intimidator .
 These shorts are excellent quality . AFTCO is one of the finest and is known worldwide . These are heavy duty fishing shorts but dry quickly
 Ever since I purchased my gnome , my life has not only been happier - it has been more fulfilling . Now whenever I go to new locales , I can bring my gnome with me and take pictures of his travels . He even has his own blog now !
 This will look much nicer than the Gamecock gnome my cousins bring to our family rivalry party every year . Go Tigers !
 I like this guy , now to get the FSU one to stand next to him for our little in home/gnome rivalry .
 Great looking and great quality !! Bought as a Christmas gift for my brother and the UNC cheerleader gnome for his wife !! They will love them !!
 I purchased two of the Shamrock wrestling singlets . They seem to be well made and I will hand wash them in cold water to see how well they hold up . They look great right now .

 This was my third pair of sunglasses purchased with this company . Been very very pleased with all interactions ! Very customer oriented ! Would do business with them again .
 love the glasses . . there was one thing about them that I did n't care for at first . . they had a space at the top . . but that later adjusted out . . maybe it was because they were new . . Love the case they come in as well . .
 I love my sunglasses . They look amazing , were a great price and arrived in a timely manner ! I am very VERY pleased with my purchase !
 I just wear these around the house . I like the light comfortable fit . Quality seems good for the price being under ten dollars .
 I love these pants . I have 8 pairs , all colors , and a couple each of black and navy . Good quality , lightweight , no wrinkling , wear them right out of the dryer . Perfect length . I am 5 ' 4 '' . I wear my pants a bit looser than most women . It 's hot in Oklahoma and I need the air space . I even wear them to town in our small town.Now I have lost a bunch of weight and have to buy a smaller size cause I have to have them.Please get them in again before summertime .
 This is a wonderful product . The shaker contains a wide variety of spices that are fresh and can make almost any meal better . I use it in Afghanistan , where I eat pretty much the same food every day . These spices really add variety to my meals . My only complaint is that the shaker was cracked when it arrived . Nothing leaked out , but it could fall apart at any second.Also , do n't even think about refilling this thing when it 's empty , or replacing one spice with another . The top does not screw off the shaker .
 coat is warm and attractive . It 's a great value for the guy who does n't like a lot of `` weight '' .
 This jacket could not be any more perfect for me . Living in the South , it is light enough to not be cumbersome , yet it provides great warmth and comfort without being huge and bulky . The Trek Parka is a great cross between a light to medium jacket and a wind breaker . I am a huge fan of Columbia products and will continue to purchase them in the future .
 i use this in my everyday commute to school and when i 'm out to sea . it holds my lunch , my books and tech manuals with room to spare . It 's very durable and holds up well in any situation . the straps are very comfortable and easily adjustable . I like the top pocket that 's designed for a CD player , i use it to keep my wallet , phone and shades . I think it 's an all around great backback .
 I purchased two of the Shamrock wrestling singlets . They seem to be well made and I will hand wash them in cold water to see how well they hold up . They look great right now .
 I recently ordered the Adidas Liverpool Football for my boyfriend , since he is from the U.K. and he grew up loving Liverpool footie . The ball was so nice that someone recently stole it during a match at a crowded field . We were both heartbroken . I plan to buy him a replacement for Christmas . shhhh ...
 This scoop ball set was a new toy for the kids at my school during recess . They were really excited to play with something different than the standard ball or jump rope . So far the quality of the product has held up to 650 + kids .
 I loved this scoops . I like that they came in different colors so the students can be easily divided into teams when using them for PE activities . I think these are going to prove to be great tools for learning in my gym .
 Our entire family can play this game . It is worth the price as you can get a group as large as 12 to participate . Great outdoor fun , and good for developing hand - eye coordination .
 Love the fact that these were reasonable . Perfect for parties and team building events which are both services I provide .
 The shirt is great . The material is not too thick , which is good for warm days .
 Durable , super-adjustable , good rear view , holds adjustments well . My old one died after about 12 years of use and abuse , and I was delighted to find that the new one has EXACTLY the same high-quality construction as the original .
 Finally , a bike mirror that works and does n't come loose . The best design I have seen for a bike mirror . The parts are well made and well designed . One caveat however ... the assembly requires forcing the screws into tight threaded hubs . This is so the unit stays tight and does n't move while riding on rough ground . Using the small allen wrench provided , is a bit rough on tender hands . So I would recommend either wearing gloves during the screw tightening or using a better 3mm wrench such as a T handle tool or ratchet .
 it works great with my GT Avalanche 3.0 though I had to cut the handle bar grip at the end to install it , it was worth it . This is my second mirror and so far the best mountain bike mirror I 've seen around .
 We are very happy with this mirror which we bought for our 9 year son . Easy to mount and to store .
 When I started riding on the road , I was constantly paranoid and looking over my shoulder , but now that I have a mirror and lights , I feel much safer . It definitely helps knowing that a car is coming and how close it is instead of wondering or looking over your shoulder and taking your attention from what 's ahead . The mount is easy to install and sturdy . You can tighten it as much as you need to keep it rigid , but it 's better not to tighten it all the way so that you can make adjustments on the road if you need it . Also , the frame is plastic and you 'll damage it . Overall , it 's a great product and I highly recommend it !
 This mirror is very reasonably priced for the quality . It installs easily in the end of the handlebar . Best of all , the glass mirror itself is high quality with no distortion for a convex mirror , unlike some of the plastic mirrors I have used . Absolutely no vibration while riding which has been a problem I have encountered with more expensive mirrors . I liked it so much I bought a second one for my wife . Absolutely recommended .
 *** Updated 10/27/2012 Review *** After about three thousand miles of road use , mainly commuting and touring , the mirror is still going strong.Just ordered two more to replace the mirrors on my other bicycles . *** Original Review *** I have a commuter bike with `` Bar Ends '' . Bar End are those handles that get attached to the end of a handle bar that look kind of like bull horns.Most bikes do not have these ... If you have `` Bar Ends '' and are wonder if this mirror will work , the answer is yes.But be prepared to spend an extra 10 minutes setting it up . It might take a few tries to find a possition where you can grab the Bar End and still see in the mirror . But the extra 10 minutes or so is time well spent.If you do not have Bar Ends , then set up is a no brainier.The quality of this mirror is great . I have the mirror post that would normally go up going strieght forward , as to allow me to grab the Bar Ends . So it does work well.There is no vibration ... . Very Clear ... . Just be sure to read the directions . The placement of the Washers and all seem to be very important .
 I liked the one I installed on the left handlebar of my mountain bike ... had to get one for the right side ... as i ride in the city also ... need to see my `` enemies '' ... Ha ! Especially like the way the mirrors can be folded in while actually on trails .
 This mirror is easy to put together and insert into the handle bar end . It is easy to adjust and works well in traffic . One caveat
 Good product . Someones noted that they ca n't perform installation . In my case installation takes 3-5 minutes and it was not difficult . Now I feel very comfortable with this mirror when I 'm on bicycle .
 This is my first purchase of a bicycle mirror , so I can not compare it to other bicycle mirror products . But , I can say this - I love this mirror , great low price , 10 minutes or less install , very sturdy , and best of all , it actually stays in place while riding , once it 's positioned to your liking . The mirror is plenty large enough to provide a good view behind your bike . One of the important feature for me personally is the fact that this thing will swing inward out of the way so you do n't bump it on anything when bike is in storage or being transported on a bike rack . Many other bar-end mirrors I 've seen are fixed and stick directly out of the end the bars - I see this as being a real pain in the neck when storing bike , easily banged around or knocked off or bent .
 We both really like this mirror , it gets the job done , after reading other reviews , we went for this one , most 5 star reviews . It is tough , we have bumped it many times and it has not broken !
 I do n't know how I felt safe without it . I can see cars easily and know that they are not heading towards me . Watch the video of how to install it . I am not handy but was able it install it easily after watching the video . It is stable but moves easily when I need it out of the way .
 Installs easily . Gives great view of traffic behind . Image is very clear . Nice value for the money . Would and have bought again .
 Assembles easily . The only part you may not like is cutting the end of your rubber handlebar grip so you can insert the mounting stem of the mirror -- but once inserted and tightened you wo n't even notice it since it 's like plugging a hole.Very secure in the handlebar and easily adjusted up/down/left / right . Stays where you adjust it , although I have just been riding on streets and sidewalks , not mountain trails where there would be more bouncing . Great mirror , I 'm ordering another one for my adult tricycle .
 I 've had this product before on several bikes , when I get a new bike I always install this mirror . It is the only mirror I would recommend .
 easy to install and easy to adjust . Holds setting well . Great value . Doing triathlon tomorrow and glad I have this mirror .
 This is a well made and super easy to install mirror , after receiving the first one I ordered a second for the other side .
 I love this mirror ! It is adjustable and easy to move around to see behind you . When I bring my bike indoors , I can fold the mirror back over the handle to avoid bashing it on walls or doorways . My rides are much safer because I can see at a glance who is behind me . Mirror is clear , and the perfect size ! I have one for my bike , and just today bought another for my mother 's bike . I recommend this mirror wholeheartedly , and will encourage everyone I know with a bike to buy one .
 I mostly use my bike for aerobic exercise up to 15 miles a day . A lot of my riding is what I refer to as `` sidewalk '' riding along 4-lane type suburban highways and with fall coming , thus the days getting shorter , I needed more safety equipment like lights , mirror and reflective clothing.My first purchase was lights . I bought thePlanet Bike Blaze 1-Watt Headlight and Suplerflash Taillight Combination Bicycle Light Setwhich is very good.I next wanted a mirror and read the reviews on the Mirrycle MTB mirror . I did n't want one of the `` strap on '' mirrors . What I like about this mirror is that it has a really secure fit in my handle bar and it adjusts up/down and in/out . In other words , I have a custom view behind me now -LRB- especially when my family is out riding with me -RRB- . BTW ... did I mention that I actually bought three of these mirrors ? One for me , one for my wife and one for my son?I also like that the mirror is real glass so I can clearly see what is reflected . And just remember ... . Objects are closer than they appear !
 This is a great mirror very solid easy to use . Only problem I had was after changing my girlfriends handle bars to Richey bars the center was too small for even the smaller adapter .
 Its the one and only mirror to buy for a bicycle . Its the very best . easy install and adjust and great viewing .
 The Mirrycle Mirror is a quality product that works well . I have purchased several over the years for my bikes .
 This is a great mirror . It is easy to install ; it is infinitely adjustable ; and it does n't vibrate . Get one ... you 'll like it .
 Love this bicycle mirror . It works great -- does not vibrate -- shows whats behind me without me twisting around to see . Would definitely recommend this product .
 This mirror is great . Infinite and easy adjustment . I have one in each end of my handle bars . I can see 180 degrees with these things . I highly recommend them . Oh , and they 're very stable . No bouncing or vibrating that causes blured vision .
 Just what I wanted . After looking in all the stores and bike shops for a mirror exactly as I had that broke , I found one on amazon . Just the right size to be efficient and not too large .
 This mirror looks great on my 2009 Trek 7.2 FX -LRB- blue and black -RRB- . The main pieces are made out of a high-quality black plastic with metal where it counts . The mirror itself is convex for a great field of view and seems to have no defects . The mirror stays where you put it and I did n't notice any vibration unless the entire bike was vibrating . A great design that is well-engineered . You may need to buy a small exacto knife to cut out the end of your handlebar grip , but other than that everything you need is included . Riding on the streets of Chicago is much easier now . I have absolutely no regrets with my purchase and definitely recommend this mirror .
 I 've been commuting to work for more than 2 years now , during the summer days . This year , I finally got sick of twisting my head to see the traffic . So , recently I purchased this product from amazon and I must say that this is the best purchase I 've ever made . Better than the road slick tires , patch kit , rear rack , handlebar bell ... etc. . I am 10x safer with it . Adjusted correctly , it offers a perfect vision of the road and the lanes behind you for about a half mile.Installation is a breeze . Took all of 5 minutes if you grab a friend to help you . Also , I would ride up and down an empty road to get it adjusted perfectly before tightening the bolts and taking it for a commute . I have my mirror so that it 's very tight but I can still play with the angles.Over time , the mirror hex nuts will loosen a bit . So I 'd suggest carrying the included allen key with you -LRB- or a multitool -RRB- . You really should n't be riding without a multitool anyway.Topeak The Mini 9-Function Bicycle Tool
 I bought two of these and even though their optic is n't 100 % realistic , they still give you a good rear view . They are very easy to install once you have made up your mind to cut your original handle bar covers that is ... I have had them on my recumbent since over 7 years now and they have grown on me . I would n't want to miss them anymore !
 My husband & I both got these . I love them . I 'm the type to swerve when I try to look behind me to see if cars are coming . This keeps me straight on the road , and I love being able to easily see who 's coming up behind me .
 I have ordered replacement mirrors because bumping my handlebars against door frames , walls , etc. cracked the mirror a few times . The mirror itself is very good , provides a clear vision , and can be adjusted a number of ways .
 liked it so much I bought another . You have to cut a hole in the sideof your handgrip . I prefered this install method .
 This mirror works well with my Townie 7 speed bike . It stays stationary when needed and can be moved but stays where you move it to . I 've done about 30 miles with it and have had no problems . I would recommend this item for the the casual cyclist .
 Easy to install and to adjust to various riders . Gives clear view of road behind . Like it better than helmet mirror .
 Ease to install on both my bikes . I 'm very pleased with the visibility provided and the quality of the product .
 Both my wife and I have this mirror . It 's sturdy , relatively vibration free , clear image , and provides a good field of vision . I understand that a helmet or eyeglass mounted mirror is a better experience for many people . However , I find this bar-mounted mirror better for casual riding . Good price too.Update
 This mirror works great . I was able to put it together and install it on my Trek in about 10 minutes using just the supplied hex wrench . I 've only had it for a couple days but I think it will last .
 Nice mirror , good field of view , nice adjustability . I have two problems with it
 Real glass mirror that is not the size of a quarter.I have broken one but only by knocking my bike over onto a rockThis mirror has gone may hundreds of miles and I would n't want to ride a bike without one
 It is a very good mirror . It was necessary to break the rubber handle end of my bike to enter the adjustable mechanism , but it was very good . Easy to install and remove again if necessary . is compact and is also similar to the advertising photo .
 Durable construction and it even locks the handlebar grip into place . I find that so far its been a set it and forget it solution as in , I do n't have to adjust the mirror before every ride.Great product and already have another one on the way for the lady
 Just a glance and you have peace of mind rather than having to turn around to check traffic . That in itself could save you from a wreck - keeping your eyes on the road ahead . I toss my bike in the back of a truck to haul it to the park and just turn the mirror to keep it from getting broke . Fairly sturdy build but do n't expect it to survive a hard fall .
 I have these on both my MTB 's and they work fine . Once you install and tighten them , they take adjusting really well and wo n't need to be tightened up again.Have taken a few hits and have n't broken off so seem durable as well.Great mirror for the price
 I bought 2 Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror and gave one to my girlfriend . Visibility is great and it fits well into the handle bar so it is it in the way of your hand .
 This mirror fit great , was easy to assemble , and is a great quality . Have seen the exact one in cycle shop for triple the price , so this was great deal !
 Well made , quality product . It was extremely easy to install , on my Diamondback Edgewood . Would reccommend to any biker ; but especially to the casual rider , out for exercise and enjoyment , who cares about safety .
 Fits perfectly in left handlebar of my recumbent so viewing area behind me is in total view without right hand second mirror .
 I have tried and used six different mirrors over the past five years and this one beats the lot hands down . It allows a wonderful view of the back and Is large enough to catch the eye instantly even when not looking directly into the mirror ... you can still see motion . I now have one of these on my hybrid and one on my road bike . Installation -LRB- if you follow the directions , something I do not do too often , alas -RRB- is a snap . We have a horrid problem with `` Dukes of Hazard '' types -LRB- brain dead A.H.s -RRB- around where I live and this thing has literally been a life saver several times . I also travel over some pretty rough roads and the vibration on this one is almost nil . You can not beat the price they are offering here . I paid much more for mine at a local bike store .
 Man this is by far the best mirror I have ever use in my recumbent . Easy to install and adjust . It does n't vibrate when you cruising down the road . Is very solid and well constructed . I do recommend this mirror to any cyclist . Great product .
 I bought one last week and loved it , so I went to buy another one for my wife . However , it 's no longer available via Amazon Prime , and the shipping from the outside vendor adds over 45 % to the price . Bummer . Still a great product , but I 'm incented to find another vendor , or maybe even buy it locally .
 Works great and does n't interfere with the handlebar grip feel . One observation however is that the image in the mirror is smaller than the real image . I 've seen cars that look like they are still about a block away only to have them pass within a couple of seconds . It 's just a matter of getting used to .
 This is simply an aoutstanding product ; all the parts are highest quality . For example , it includes a special threaded brass -LRB- read wo n't rust ! -RRB- locking screw thread for the adjuster so that once you tighten the mirror , it wo n't loosen and move about . There 's no shake to the mirror -LRB- I have it mounted on a comfort bike with front suspension -RRB- . In this day of disposable products , you can also purchase a replacement mirror lens at a reasonable price . The mirror mounts in many positions and can be mounted above the handle bar or below . A super-high quality product at a very reasonable price .
 This is an excellent product . After installing , I rode 50 miles in rainy weather . It worked well , the mirror did not shake -LRB- as previous reviews have stated -RRB- and the image was easy to see . The mirror rotates to move out of the way when I put the bike in my car . I highly recommend this product .
 With the price of gas setting new highs on nearly a daily basis , I have decided to bike the 5 miles to work . My biggest concern though is not getting hit by a car . One thing I needed though was a way to see behind me . This mirror does a great job . It was easy to install and provides an adequate viewing area .
 The Mirrycycle mirror was easy to install , contrary to other reviewers opnions . All it involved was removing the handlebar plug at the left side of the handlebar and following the installation instructions . The vendor provided a replacement mirror when the original one I ordered arrived broken ; they were concerned my satisfaction . So far , so good with the mirror .
 This is a great product , easy to install and very useful in the road . It folds and gives me a great view of what 's going on behind me while I am on my bike .
 I really like this mirror . It assembled easily with good , clear instructions and was really just as promised . It 's sturdy , provides an excellent field of vision and pivots in or out for going through doorways .
 It is a very well designed mirror , that allows you to mount to securely and adjust in all dimensions you need . You can also set a permanent position for the mirror itself - it 's wonderful .
 I 've tried other mirrors , but this one is the best . The parts are high-quality and the optics are very clear . Some assembly is required but the instructions are very clear and easy to follow . It only took a few minutes to assemble it . Installation on my Trek 7000 was a breeze . I highly recommend this mirror .
 These are the only useful mirrors for your cycling . I have two now . Can not ride without them .
 Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle MirrorMy bike is a specialized Globe Carmel 700 3 comfort bike . It is a Commuter bike , therefore its main design use is traveling busy city streets . I do n't use my bike for that , but Occasionally I am sharing the roadway with busy traffic . It 's an important bike accessory for safety . When you are traveling in the direction of traffic , you can easily keep an eye on traffic behind you . This the perfect mirror for that . It has a relatively large mirror that presents a good view . It mounts on the end of your handlebar , so it 's out of the way . and easily adjustable . It 's easy to install . It appears to be made of a durable plastic , and is of good quality . I will offer a tip here . When assembling the top mirror arm just snug the screw up tight enough to keep the mirror from moving . If your bike should fall and hit the mirror , it will just rotate rather than break . I mostly ride bike paths , this mirror is useful for keeping an eye on other bikers coming from behind . I think this is the best bike mirror that I have seen . I researched a number of them . It is the one that I own . You can look at photos of it installed on my bike in users views .
 The product was as advertized , was promptly received and installed easily . It is very useful .
 What ... was I really tossing my neck from side to side on every bike ride ?!? This mirror works great and I feel so much safer on my rides ... plus the neck pain is now a thing of the past !
 Mirror is of good quality and works great on my Schwinn Hybrid . Very easy to install . You have to cut the end out of your hand grip . I used a new blade in my razor knife and it looks good . Easy to fold back for tight spots/storage etc. and easy to re-adjust while riding if need to .
 I ordered a pair of these mirrors , and was pleasantly surprised to find they were glass , not cheap , fuzzy acrylic . Though I may come to regret it , if the bike gets knocked over and the mirrors break . You can buy the mirrors , separately , as well as the bits of mountings , arms , etc. if they do break . The mounts are fully adjustable by loosening a few screws , and tightening them with a provided Allen -LRB- hex -RRB- wrench . You can tighten them enough to make them immobile , or leave them looser to adjust them while riding . I would n't have minded a nice set of mirrors like this on my motorcycle , back in the day.I ordered these a few days ago , and mounted them immediately , the only problem was not a fault of the mirrors but a fault of the cheap bar end plugs . When I attempted to remove them , to mount the mirrors , one broke off , and left the stump of the plug still in the handlebars . I was able to pry it out -LRB- screwdriver in the thru-hole -RRB- . These do come with very clear mounting instructions , in English only . If you read Spanish , French , German , instead of English ? You are Short On Luck , though the illustrations are quite clear . Where you see 3 washers put three washers , if you see one , put one . The only decision you need to make is whether to use the larger or smaller piece in the mechanism . Use the smaller if you have typical MTB bars , larger if you have bigger bars . If your bars are huge you may need to insert rubber , to make them fit.Clean clear mirrors , simple mounts , repair parts available , obvious instructions -LRB- with line drawings in case you DO N'T read English . -RRB- What 's not to like ? Well if break soon , it would be a pain , but the mounts/arms are structural engineering grade plastic , very light and strong , so I expect they will be fine.I 'll come back in a year or two and let you know .
 This is a nice mirror for my Trek bicycle . Not all mirrors will work for my bike . It lets me know if people are coming up from behind to pass .
 Excellent for use on mountain bike or comfort bike handlebars . I just ordered a second one for the right side . Very sturdy construction .
 In a nutshell
 The optics/mirror on the little MTB Bar End Mirror are of really good quality , it is somehow very much like the mirror on your vehicle and gives a condensed view that is really clear and relatively vibration free given what it is . I paid less than $ 20.00 for mine at a LBS and its the best handlebar accessory I have installed to date . I am very pleased with the quality and design of the mirror , it folds inward easily should you hit it with an obstruction or if you need to flip your bicycle over for maintenance . Its really a clever design and engineered well . I can HIGHLY recommended this device as one of the best bicycle mirrors I have ever used !!
 I ride at 5:00 p.m. on a fairly busy road , and this mirror is great . Lots of adjustment so you can get it just right .
 This is a nifty little mirror . It was easy to install . It does not get in the way of my hand on the grip . I can see vehicles behind me without having to turn my head .
 This is an excellent mirror . It provides an efficient convex view . It extends upward so as to position the mirror head at a good height . The mirror arm extends outward just enough to provide a good rear view without protruding too far . The assembly tightens sufficiently to eliminate vibration . Amazon offered the best price , which was $ 21.41 less than the first one that I unfortunately acquired from another source before finding the same product at Amazon . I subsequently will be able to get two more from Amazon , and both of them will still be less than the cost of the single one I had purchased elsewhere .
 No one should ride in any traffice w/o a rear view mirror on the left side of their bike
 I looked at several other mirror styles before deciding on this one . After reading several positive reviews and watching a You Tube video on the intallation , I picked it . It was a breeze to install and works great so far . I do notice it gets bumped out of alignment once in a while , but I 've been gradually tightening it up , so it 's getting better . Especially for the price , I do n't think you can beat it . Minimal vibration and good field of view .
 Works perfectly . Do n't be afraid to tighten up those screws so the mirror does n't shift position when you have a rough ride . Stays nice and tight when installed properly . Best part for me is it 's made in Boulder Colorado and is less expensive then most of the junk made in china . Buy American !
 Bought this along with a helmet mounted mirror when I first started riding in the city.Didn ' t install this mirror until three months later thinking the helmet mirror was good enough . A close call with a car had me installing this very sturdy handlebar mirror.What a difference as far as viewing what is coming up behind you in the parabolic mirror . Two lanes of traffic easily viewable and not as much mirror vibration as my helmet mounted mirror.It is very well constructed - the instructions tell you the parts will be hard to screw together but go ahead and use pressure - `` they wo n't break '' and when you have it together the mirror swivels in and out and up and down with nice resistance allowing rotation all the way in to protect the mirror when the bike is parked or being transported.I liked this so much I bought one for my riding partner who has trouble using a helmet mirror and she loves it also.Installation tools are included -LRB- an allen wrench -RRB- and you will have to cut a whole in your handlegrip end and/or remove the plug to install -LRB- I had to do both -RRB- . To sum up
 This mirror is superb . I have other mirrors from another company but this one is what I highly recommend . Easy to install and stays perfect with the bike . Bought 3 of them so far for all our bikes .
 I ordered this mirror for my own bike and for 4 friends . I installed them all and I can tell you that it is very simple and easy to install . It is made from sturdy materials , folds away so that when you lean the bike against a wall the mirror is out of the way , and it does not vibrate at all !! Great Product !!
 I received my mirror today , the first day in the time window quoted by Amazon for the expected delivery ... it was very easy to assemble and install -LRB- allen wrench provided with mirror -RRB- and the parts quality appears very good . After a short test ride , I was very pleased with the stability and adjustability of the mirror .
 I bought two . One for my bike and one for my wife 's bike . They were easy to install , easy to adjust and they do the job . I have read some reviews of people complaining about bouncing and shaking of bike mirrors . Duh , you 're riding a bike while looking in a mirror . What do you expect ? If you just glance at it to see what 's behind you it works fine . If you are staring at it long enough to be annoyed by bouncing you have bigger problems in front of you than you have behind you . I recommend this mirror . it seems very sturdy , good price and it stays in adjustment as you ride . What more could you want ?
 I just like the way this mirror works . It is fairly well made , if you leave everything a bit firm but not overly tight it can survive the occasional bike crash . The viewing area is larger than most mirrors . I will admit I have an older mirror for spare parts .
 Went on quickly and I only tightened the screws all the way on the third day after doing re-adjustments while riding.Now it stays put and I only once needed to re-adjust when someone seemingly bumped it while being parked.Sometimes fogs up on cold mornings - but I presume that all glass mirrors will do that if not treated with anti-fog stuff ...
 I had to cut the grip on my handlebars to install the mirror but it works great . It looks solid and visibility is excellent . Tightened up secure , instructions were easy . I like it .
 The hardest part of installing these mirrors is cutting away the bar ends . If you have plugs in your bar ends , there 's nothing to cut ; you just remove the plugs . If you do n't have a good sharp tool to cut away the ends , go to your local bike shop and ask them to do it for you . The rest of the installation is trivial.Each mirror comes with both a large and small wedge -LRB- which fit inside the bar ends -RRB- and they 've fit on every bike I 've tried using one wedge or the other.The image is clear , the mirror does n't fog , and it 's much more stable than typical helmet mirrors . I like having a pair of these , one on each side , for my recumbent bike although I was happier with my helmet mirror while riding my Schwinn hybrid . On the recumbent , it 's very hard to turn around to look behind , so mirrors are essential , plus your head stays in one place so the mirrors do n't have to be constantly adjusted -LRB- very much like riding in a car -RRB- . On the `` normal '' bike , I find that I change my posture a lot -LRB- sitting up straight , leaning way over the bars , and everything in between -RRB- which requires adjusting the mirrors all the time , so the helmet mirror works better for me on that bike.If you lose just a few parts or break the mirror , you can purchase just those parts directly from the manufacturer . Instructions and prices for doing so are on the instruction sheet that comes in the package.This is the best bike mirror I 've ever used . If you ca n't install your mirror in your bar ends -LRB- because you have bar-end shifters or some other reason -RRB- then I 'd recommend trying one of Mirrycle 's other mirrors . They 're probably just as good as these , just with different mounts .
 I purchased this bar end mirror for my new mountain bike . It 's easy to install and practical . I purchased another one for my folding bike . Very functional .
 I love this mirror . I bought two one for each side . The only improvement might be a little bigger mirror . Not even sure on that . I like it and would buy again .
 Looks very good on bike , quality made parts , easy to install , fast shipping . What more could you want ? It fit my bill ...
 I installed this on my Schwinn Aluminum Comp . Installation was straight-forward , quick and solid . I no longer have to turn to check traffic and risk falling or changing direction . No cyclist should be without one . I ca n't recommend it enough.Update . 11/21/2012
 Finally a good one . Stays firm in place , below the handlebar , as all the joints and screws can be tighten very well .
 I bought this to replace an older one that got broken when someone knocked over my bike . I love having a mirror , and this one works perfectly . Easy to install and it holds it 's position perfectly with general road biking .
 This was the best price I found on this Bike Mirror . It is perfect . Just like the other one I purchased for more money .
 In my opinion , a mirror is more important than wearing a helmet in terms of safety on the road . No more are the constant turning of my head 180 to see if there is a truck bounding my way . This mirror is made of durable , robust materials and it was very easy to install . I think it took less than five minutes . I admit , I watched a couple of YouTube videos on how to install the Mirrycle MTB mirror before actually doing it myself . I love how it feels it wo n't come off my bike and how adjustable and stable it is once adjusted . And it was inexpensive -- only $ 12 ! High quality at a low price . Highly recommended to any biker who will share the road with larger vehicles .
 I put this on my Giant Sedona ST mountain bike . Bit of pain to put on but it 's a good mirror . Fits nice and tight and does n't move . I like the mirror positioned inside/under . . less likely to get damaged .
 My Mirrycle MTB is now on it 's second bike . I did have to replace the mirror part after dropping the bike ... no fault of the mirror itself . It stays in place and gives a wide view of what 's behind you .
 For Bikes that do n't have drop bars , this is the best mirror . I have had about 6 mirrors over the years and this one stays put , but if tightened properly , allows you to adjust on the go . All those with bushings might not vibrate as much , but this one will not fall out on you . I have about 10 thousand miles on my bikes with this mirror and it never fell out . I ca n't say that about the previous mirrors I tried . Also , the vibration is minimal . At the time it does vibrate -LSB- high speed on a rough road -RSB- , you still can see the car in view . To me that is all you need see . This is a great value/quality mirror
 I had just replaced my handgrips on my bike and needed to plug the bar ends . I also wanted mirrors for driving in traffic . These mirrors solved both of my problems . They work well once you have them lined up properly and tightened so they do n't move out of adjustment when going over bumps in the road . They do make your bike wider , so you will need to find just the right tightness so you can swivel them inward when you need to pass through tight spaces , but they will still be in the right position when swiveled back out .
 This mirror was a replacement for an identical model that had worn out after about 10 years of use . The right-angle rise clears your angle of vision over your wrist and makes this mirror infinitely more adjustable than mirrors that extend straight out of the handlebar .
 Threw this mirror on my trek 7.2 fx -LRB- 2013 model -RRB- after adding these handlebars to the bike as well -LRB- http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I7PRUQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_title -RRB- and it still fit perfectly . Very secure and gives great added sight for when riding through nyc .
 Although it is n't mentioned in the product description , this mirror works great on road bikes too . The mount can be turned just about any way you want . On drop handlebars the mirror sticks out about 3-4 '' to the side allowing it to see around my midsection . I have to move my head a little to the side to see it when I 'm on the brake hoods but when I 'm on the drops or the center of the bars I have an unobstructed view . It even works when I 'm down on my aerobars . It partially obstructs access to the drops and I knocked into it once or twice but I 've learned not to do that now.Many years ago I bought a handlebar mirror but gave up on it because it slipped on every rough piece of road . The mount on this mirror is solid and it has never slipped even when I 've ridden the worst roads . The wedge style mount is similar to how handlebar stems used to fit into steerer tubes ten years ago . It 's easy to mount - remove plug , insert wedge , tighten with allen key.The mirror is almost flat so alignment is important . But once it 's aligned it stays aligned . The flatter mirror means you can see stuff while it 's still a long way back . I can see a car while it 's still ten seconds or so behind me . This is crucial . I 've used mirrors that were so convex you could n't see cars until they were within a couple of seconds of passing you so they were pretty much worthless.One upgrade I would happily pay a couple of extra dollars for is the ability to easily swing the mirror to the inside of the handlebars so I can lean the bike up against a wall . With this mirror sticking out to the left I can only lean the right side of the bike against a wall . Looking at the mount , I think this would be fairly easy to do .
 Installation was easy , at times the supplied screws are super tight which I thought would snap the supplied allen wrench , but it did n't . The modification of my handle rubber grip took majority of the install . The mirror looks good and it feels strudy enough to last for a long time . Overall I would recommend this . For the price of $ 9.00 how can you go wrong ?
 I did purchase this Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror for my Mongoose Snarl bike . This mirror is easy to assemble and look good on bike and is very use full . I 'm very pleased with this mirror .
 Made in USA ! Price is reasonable . Seemingly good quality . Clear and concise instructions . Assembles and mounts easily.This mountain bike mirror is just what it says it is . A compact , convex mirror with a head that will mount either above , or below the bar.After riding 5 miles in town with the mirror mounted above and out from the handlebar , I 've remounted it below and in . Both positions work equally well but I think I prefer the down and in mount . Very clear view mirror.Purchased from BIKEZILLABIKE SHOP through Amazon . Quick ship & good packaging .
 The installation was a bit frustrating , but once it is on the bike it works perfect . You can not see a great distance behind you however . If I have someone trailing behind me about 200 feet you can barely make them out . If there is anything within close proximity however you can see it clearly . The glass on this is not the strongest it only lasted me about three days , but this was after very a few intense rides . Still overall I am satisfied with this product . It stays in the handlebars snug and does what I need it to do .
 I have had the Mirrycle MTB on my bike for five years or so and have never had a problem with it . Unlike the Blackburn Multi-Mirror that I tried on my wife 's bike , it stays firmly attached on the bar end and can be quickly folded out of harm 's way when parking or navigating tight places . After the bad experience with the Blackburn , I found the Mirrycle here on Amazon at a cheaper price than I 'd paid for the Blackburn . Installing it drove home just how superior its mounting system is
 I was looking for a simple mirror that was n't too expensive and this one did just that . I was also interested in something that would not break if the bike tipped , so the option to mount this toward the `` inside '' of the handlebar instead of the outside was attractive to me.I noticed some of the negative reviews centered on the mounting `` screws '' being too tight and of a non-standard size . I found this to be true for me as well . The cap screws would only go in a couple turns before binding up and making me fearful of breaking the plastic parts . I tried to `` clean '' the threads with a metric tap and die but it appeared to be 4mm x .8 , which I did not have . In desperation I sprayed some teflon lubricant onto the threads . This worked wonderfully and I was able to connect all parts with the supplied hex-wrench without fear of breakage.This will now allow my wife to see how far I am behind her when we ride ! : - -RRB-
 As a semi-beginning biker that is not used to turning my head to the rear , this is essential . I installed on two bikes and it was relatively easy from the instructions . It 's especially useful on my bike that has a child trailer attached -- it makes me feel more secure that I can see what 's coming behind me as I bike with my child in tow . I stop short of giving it five stars because I feel I constantly adjusting it to get a good view and it does interfere where and how I can store my bikes , as it 's an extra appendage . But the peace of mind it gives is priceless .
 Buy this mirror you will be happy!This is my first review and of all things for a mirror !? Well , yes because it is that good ! I heavily researched bike mirrors before coming across this gem which met all of our needs . It is perfect in every way ! I bought one for my road bike and one for my husbands . We have been using them for a few months now and are very pleased.A few key points that made this model stand out are :1 . Ability to mount on a variety of bikes securely .2 . It sticks further out from the bike allowing you to see past your legs easily -LRB- a rare feature -RRB- 3 . The price $ 13 is great4 . The mirror is flat providing an more accurate distance guage for vehiclesIt is larger than other mirrors and sticks out so it is not as streamlined , but I believe that is also a plus so you can see a larger area.I was worried as to some others complaints that it moves and needs to be adjusted . However , I found that EACH movable joint it able to be tightened down as tight as you want . We placed each mirror where we wanted them and really tightened them down . Since then , we have not had to adjust them even after going over train tracks , and rough roads . Having a mirror makes travel much safer and easier ; once you get one you will kick yourself for not getting one sooner ! For the price and features this mirror can not be beat . Happy riding
 I purchased this item after reading several reviews for this and similar items on Amazon . I was concerned about optical quality of the mirror , how it handled vibration , durability and of course cost . This particular unit seemed to meet all my criteria and so it was purchased . I was not disappointed.Installation took all of about 10 minutes . I do n't remember now if the product description said whether or not this item could be mounted on either side of the handlebar , but it can -LRB- mine is mounted on the left -RRB- . Two sets of adapters are included to fit most handlebars , so there was no anxiety wondering if I would be able to mount the unit . A nice feature is that with the way all the `` pivots '' are set up . When in use , the mirror extends out past the handlebar . This is a precarious place for it to be once you are off the bike , as it is in `` harms way '' if the bike should fall over . Simply rotating the mirror on one of the pivots to a position over the handlebars puts it in a much safer position , and since movement was on only one axis putting it where you need it to be when you ready to ride again is trivial.The optical quality of the mirror appears to be good , and normal vibration on my `` hybrid '' bike has not affected the position of the mirror while riding as has been reported for similar mirrors reviewed on Amazon .
 It 's a mirror , and works fine ! It 's tough as I 've taken a fall on my bike before and the glass held up fine , just a few scratches on the plastic , but that 's not an issue . Installation was straight forward , and use is also easy . Adjustable while on the move , and provides a great view .
 I can see cars trying to hit me before they get close enough to do it ! Now I can live with out head trauma !! WOOOOO WEEEE !
 I have three bikes with these mirrors now and no complaints so far . One bike has had the mirror on for about a year now , and even though it gets bumped every so often , it can handle it . I will have to tighten that mirror on that particular bike , but the others are just great . They are easy to install and a great value for the price . No need to spend crazy amounts of money on more expensive models - it is n't meant for a fashion show ! It 's simple and the perfect size . Some smaller style mirrors create a problem where I try to scan for cars , etc too long . This is larger , maybe the size of a medium sized plum , approximately , and gives me plenty of time to move over if necessary . I have to mention that it was really easy to install - the toughest part was cutting a hole in the end of the handle bar grip , and then just screw it together . The construction is also pretty durable . Great value for the money .
 I got a new bike recently , have n't had one for 25 years . I decided I needed a rear view mirror . Never had a mirror on my bike before . I really like it . My husband installed it for me . When I was reading the reviews on Amazon before I bought it , somebody said the instructions were really good so do n't ignore them , I pointed that out to him . He actually read the instructions and it took him about 15 minutes to install it , and was so proud of himself ! It is easy to adjust , although it seldom needs it . Since it 's convex , I get a good view of what 's behind me . Very pleased with the product .
 These are the best bar end bike mirrors on the market . They adjust easily and tighten up so they will never move out of alignment . I have one of these on every flat top bike I own and even jury rigged one to work on drop bars . Think safety and have a mirror . This one is the best .
 This mirror was a cinch to install and now offers me a much safer way to see what is behind me while I ride .
 Since I couldnt wait , I bought this from a local store . It is a great mirror . I tried the one which goes on the helmet but frankly it did n't help me much as the viewing area is so small . I wanted something like my car mirror with a clear view of cars zipping by me when I commute . This mirror did the trick . Make sure you install it correctly as it is a real help to make you feel secure while riding on the road .
 I have had one of these on my recumbent trike over a year . I turn it around every time I put the trike in the shed -LRB- nearly every day -RRB- . It has never come loose from being adjusted twice a day . I can not count the times its been smacked/bumped/knocked out of whack and stays tight . It also has very stable clear vibration free view . It will also contort to work on most any bike.Ive never had a mirror I liked until this one so I bought another for my M.B. No one will ever talk me into something else
 I have used many mirrors over the last 2 decades and these are the best hands-down period . They are very tough during falls and very solid during your ride . NONE BETTER !!
 ... with this MTB bar end style bicycle mirror . I added this mirror to my older model mountain bike as part of its transformation to a hybrid road bike . This mirror offers a solid system by which it firmly attaches to the inside of the handlebar . It is very flexible and offers an incredible variety of positioning options . This is critical to realizing the most efficient field of rear view . The mirror itself is of good quality and offers a clear , undistorted view . I particularly like the fact that it can be easily folded down and under the handlebar when not in use to avoid accidental damage should your bike tip over when on its kickstand .
 A superior bike mirror . If you are worried about the installation , do n't . All the tools are provided and the parts are easy to assemble . If you do n't want to buy the Mirrycle because you have to cut your grips GET OVER IT !! Being able to see who is coming up behind you while bike riding is a luxury you ca n't afford to bypass . After your initial installation you will have to re-tighten occasionally as the natural vibration of the road loosens the mechanism . This mirror is fully adjustable and in my opinion is the best purchase you can make towards saving your own life on the road .
 had it few months and no problems . objects arent too small or too big in mirror . you get a good sense of where the objects behind you actually are
 I bought this mirror for my daughter 's mountain bike after having a good experience with the old school road bike version of the same mirror.Like the road bike version , this mirror is made of a combination of high impact plastic and metal , with a well-formed plastic mirror that shows little optical distortion . It offers three adjustment points -LRB- at the handlebar , in the perpendicular part of the stem and behind the mirror -RRB- to accommodate just about any riding position . All but the handlebar adjustment are designed to be left loose enough to adjust while riding . I believe that these features would also allow the mirror to survive a crash or five.Unlike the road bike version , this mirror is quick and simple to install , with well written instructions that include diagrams . The handlebar attachment is done using a quill assembly , similar to the way that a quill handlebar stem uses . Two different quill sizes are provided in the kit to accommodate most handlebar diameters . This method of attachment helps deter theft , as someone wanting to steal the mirror would need to come prepared with a set of Allen wrenches . -LRB- A correctly sized Allen key is included with the mirror , although a set of handyman 's Allen wrenches , available in most hardware stores and home centers - and amazon.com , of course - makes the job easier . -RRB- The one gripe I have is that the handlebar pivot for the mirror is the quill attachment , and it 's the one bolt that 's not designed to be left slightly loose for adjustment . -LRB- That 's for two reasons
 This mirror is very solid . Once you get everything tightened up , it is really snug . Still you can easily grab it and adjust it to where you want it . Because of the joints in it , it is possible to find the right angle no problem . It has a slightly curved mirror to give you a wide angle view . The price was right and I am happy with the quality .
 I can see what 's behind me now ! It works really well . And it 's easy to install .
 I absolutely love this mirror . It makes a great difference when riding my bike . . how did i ever ride without it ... great investment and easy to assmeble . you need a little elbow grease , but it 's worth it .
 THIS MIRROR IS EASY TO PUT TOGETHER , HOLDS UP WELL AND DOES THE JOB INTENDED . AM IMPRESSED .
 I used these mirrors for a motorcycle . They made a big difference . I can actually see behind me .
 This little mirror just eliminated my apprehension on the road . As usual it arrived quickly despite a holiday . Amazon is GREAT ! After opening the box you will see that it comes in pieces so you may have to engineer your way through the build . Look at the pictures in the instructions to see which of the 3 bolts and the array of washers go where . On a difficulty scale of 5 with 5 as nearly impossible without an engineering degree I give this one a 1 . Really easy once you understand the sequence . You will be tossing one of the angled ramped pieces because you get a large diameter and a small diameter . When you bolt the ramped piece to the mirror shaft keep it loose because this is the end that will go into your handlebars . Once installed on the bike you simple tighten it and the ramp end slides inside the bars to fill the inside diameter . You will have to cut the hand grip before you install the mirror . When you do do n't circumcise it just carefully trim it around the inside diameter of the handle bars . I used my mirror for the first time today and it is sturdy , simple to adjust and provides great visibility behind because it is convex . Not sure if or how this would work on road bike bars but on my straight bars it is SUPER . Take a look at my install pic .
 Origin8 Pro Pulsion Compe-Lite Bar Ends - Long Black , `` L '' ShapeI installed this great mirror after installing lite bar ends . Instructions are very good if you need them . I installed mine below the handle bar , seems to be out of the way , but provides a good view in back . Stays in place but can be adjusted if need be , does a good job and is great looking . I had installed at the same time grey lizard skins , Lite bar ends and then Mirrcle MTB Bar End Mirror . It turned out good with no problems and looks good too . And why did I do this to my 93 ' NISHIKI MTB ? Grips were split , bell MTB mirror was broke and my hands needed some rest , but the bike is still in good shape .
 What I like most about this mirror is its adjustability . I also enjoy its rock-solid stability , even in high winds and over bumps.What I dislike about this mirror is that unless it 's mounted relatively close to your face , the convex surface can be a safety compromise in some situations . On a pedestrian/bike path , it 's not an issue , but on the road , when you glance at the mirror , moving cars are indistinguishable from parked cars , houses , mailboxes , yard signs , etc. . A moving car can be one of many specks in the mirror one second , and passing you the next . To make this product safer for street riding , I bonded a flat mirror over the convex one.Due to my bike 's bar end grips , my mirror has to extend downward below the bars . Add that to the fact that I am over six feet tall , the mirror is quite far from my face . If you 're shorter or have the luxury of being able to mount the mirror upright , that will be a safety advantage . I would love to see this mirror offered in a slightly larger , less-convex version .
 Do n't get me wrong , this mirror does exactly what it was built to do . Reflect the area behind you.Installation was pretty easy , probably a 3.5 / 5 -LRB- 5 being the easiest -RRB- . However for those of you who care about aesthetics , this thing is pretty ugly . I took it off because I got so offended everytime I looked at it -LRB- and it also kept hitting the door frame when I went through doors . Would like to have a flexible arm to stow it away -RRB- . So there you have it . A totally shallow review of a perfectly functional item .
 I bought this mirror for my left side , i regret did n't buy both . Is very helpful and easy to install , just cutting your handle . I would prefer it to be 1/2 inch bigger . Very good material ...
 This is a very high quality mirror made from sturdy material . Only reason I took one star off was because the screws required too much torque to get them to tighten . But it 's for the best since this item is subject to vibrations .
 I see that there are plenty of well-deserved glowing reviews here about this mirror , but I wanted to comment on what I consider to be its main safety feature . My previous handlebar mirror had a very limited range of motion . If I had hit something with that mirror while riding , my handlebar would have moved with the mirror , and I would have immediately gone down , perhaps in front of a car . After a close encounter with a trailer , I decided that riding with no mirror was actually safer than riding with my old mirror . I removed it.This mirror is different . I can precisely adjust the torque required to pivot the mirror . I just set it so it stays in place during normal riding , but it is still easy to pivot by hand . A car 's rear view mirror could run directly into the Mirrycle MTB mirror while I was riding , and my mirror would just pivot toward the bike . My handlebar would barely move , if at all.Hurray for good design !
 I bought two of these for our hybrids . The packaging is simple but there are -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- a lot of parts so , be careful not to lose anything . The installation of the first mirror was a little challenging but that 's mainly because I was n't following the directions correctly . I dropped one of the little washers on the floor and had a heck of a time finding it . But I managed to get it installed . I really like the mechansism that is used to attach the stem inside the handle bars . It works REALLY well . When I installed the second mirror , I did it in about 5 minutes.The quality of the parts appears to be very good , especially for the price . I would definately recommend this product.If you are going to be riding in the rain from time to time , I recommend putting some kind of defogger/repellent on the mirror because it does fog up . I may try some RainX to see if it solves the problem .
 Having a mirror on a bike is extremely useful . Although you might not think so at first , turning your head around , although perhaps giving you better overall awareness and depth perception for what 's immediately around you , does n't give you as good of a reaction time to whatever maybe in front of you . With a mirror , you 're not moving your entire head , you are just moving your eyes.Also , normally I do n't really look behind me unless I hear something coming . Using this mirror , every now and then I 'll glance at it to see what 's behind me . I 'm more aware now of cars that are behind me for example , but not so close that I can hear them . With this mirror , I know when a car is behind me even if it 's 400 yards away . I have a significantly better general awareness on my bike with this mirror , than without one - which is important in preventing a bad accidents.I use this on my road bike , even though its advertised for mountain bikes . Its fits into drop bars just fine - have n't tried it for any other type of bar . I 've tightened the screws fairly tight , but I can still move the joints a little bit . Each ride I adjust the mirror slightly -LRB- without using an allen key , just by hand -RRB- to see directly what 's behind me . It keeps its position almost flawlessly . Between rides I 'll have to adjust it , but mostly because I 'm a little careless when I prop up my bike against stuff or put it up on my bike rack.I 've fallen on my bike , almost directly on this mirror , and I 've ridden through a really tight corner and smacked it against a pole . It 's held up very well , plastic has n't cracked or anything.I 'd strongly recommend this for riding in any sort of urban environment .
 I actually bought this for my wife . She loves it . Easy to install and adjust . Had a previous one and the mirror broke when the bike fell . Can get replacement mirror from Mirrycle which is nice .
 I bought one of these for my wife at the local bike shop , for the usual safety reasons . However , after finding myself forever craning my neck to see if I was getting too far ahead of her on our little rides together , I decided that I needed one too . Got it for a about four dollars less on Amazon . It installs easily and securely to the end of the handlebar -- though -LRB- as per the instructions -RRB- you may need to cut through the grip rubber at the end of the bar , and remove the little plug you find there . It has a great range of motion and a wide enough field of view . It 's a simple thing , but I love it . Essential gear for a commuter . If I ever break it , I 'll be buying another !
 This is a great bike mirror . Much better than the oval type because it enlarges your field of vision . I think the only problem is the tough screwing in of the two screws ; very tight and make you feel that they 're going in wrong . However , that being said , I would buy another in a heartbeat and heartily recommend it.Dave
 Great little mirror for my bike . Getting up in age a little , swiveling the head puts me all over the road sometimes , which is n't a good thing . This mirror requires the rubber to be cut off the end of the handlebar , but that was easy . Installs easy and gives me a pretty good view of whats behind . However cars appear very small until they are within about 75 yards and you may not see them until they 're almost on you . Would have been nice if there was a way to magnify what 's behind you , but the mirror is still the best I 've found so far .
 This mirror is replacing a previous end of bike handle mirror . This new mirror is a very sturdy design and the mirror has curvature which is very useful . Very well constructed . Screws that hold the mirror onto the mounting arms go into brass bodies that do not permit the screws to loosen . The instructions tell you that the Allen head screws are take significant force to install and that you do n't need to be afraid you 'll break the plastic handles . They were right . I was impressed how strong the plastic was based on the force required to tighten the screws . This is a very well built system which wo n't need constant adjustment .
 As I keep my bike in the closet . . I was pleased how the mirror folds inward and downward out of the way as to not stick out and cause the bike to take up any additional space when not in use ... . i keep the allen wrench that it came with on the bike in case i need to tighten anything but have not had to do any tightening yet .
 This was exactly what I wanted . I mounted mine below the handlebar , I would definitely recommend that . The convex is nice too !!
 Absolutely LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this bike mirror that I purchased from Amazon ! It 's my 3rd mirror because I had a bad kickstand ... anyway , I 've had 2 others to compare it to . It is wide and provides a great , clear rear view . While on the bike , it swivels easily for adjustment . Hubby said it was easy to mount . I love it !! Also , very fast shipper !
 The mirror installs easily and stays in place . It 's slightly convex glass , so you have a clear view of what is behind . The only question I still have is whether or not I want to put a second on my bike .
 Thirteen bucks well spent . Does exactly what I need it to ... I think the visibility is really quite good , though I suppose my expectations were in line with what a small mirror like this could potentially offer . Super easy installation , and you can crank it together plenty tight -LRB- as the manufacturer even specifically recommends in the literature -RRB- , which still allows it to be adjusted on the road by hand , without a tool . Highly recommended .
 Best mirror I have ever used from all aspects of quality , functionality and ease of installation . It can be adjusted to any angle and since the one I have is a flat mirror one is not fooled by object distance . It took less than 10 minutes to install and can be removed and re-installed easily . Plus it folds out of the way when not in use . You will not find better than this at this price .
 This is my fourth or fifth mirror -LRB- ca n't remember exactly -RRB- . But it is by far the best . The view is clear and big , and the mirror stays in place - I never have to adjust it as I ride - it does n't work loose like the others - that was my biggest complaint about the other handlebar mirrors . If need be , it swings out of the way easily , and its easy to bring it back into the right location . I tried a helmet mirror , and it was like riding cross eyed - one eye on the mirror and one on the road -- it was funny in a way , but dangerous , which was not the point - I put it in a drawer the second day without regret.The local bike shop now stocks the mtb mirror after I bragged so much on it -- the amazon price is better though .
 Purchased 2 of these based on reviews here . Install took all of 10 minutes to do both . Used an Xacto knife to cut holes in the grip ends and my bike had a plastic plug that I had to pry out of the handlebar with a screwdriver . Wifes bike just required cutting a hole in the rubber grip with the knife.Install is easy simply looking at the picture diagrams . I did n't take the time to read anything . Very self explanatory.I did note that the screws really tighten up when trying to drive them in . Thought the first one I did that I might have cross threaded it . Not so , they 're just a tad difficult with the small allen wrench included to drive them completely in . Other than that , great product , easy to adjust once on the bike . I feared they would look huge but no so . Fit really nice.I installed on a Giant Sedona XL for men and a DiamondBack womens MTB . Used the larger of the 2 included inserts into the handlebars on both bikes .
 Solidly constructed , the Mirrycle bumps along the road with little or no jiggling , the large mirror surface offers a good rear view without head movement , versatility allows several configurations , then easily folds away for storage or transport . As noted in the instructions and mentioned by several reviewers , you really MUST crank down HARD inserting the bolts ! A good bang for the buck .
 I 'm a little nuts for outfitting my bike , but this is by far the most useful piece of equipment I have . I ca n't imagine a better mirror
 The mirror was easy to install , just cut the end off your grip and it slides rights in . The only thing you might want to consider is that it does crowd you hand if you grip towards the end of the grip . It has n't moved or vibrated loose in 32 miles of riding .
 This product came with instructions that made it very easy to put together except I had to put a little drop of soap on the threads of the bolts it came with because they were very tight going in the barrels . Other than it I love it . Great product .
 This replaces a mirror of another type I used for 5 years until it broke . This new mirror was easy to assemble , secure to the handlebar , and to align for the proper sighting angle . The mounting parts have a very solid feel to them when assembled and tightened , and I have not noticed the vibration evident on my old mirror during road rides . I feel I made the right choice in changing to this product . I received the mirror in only 3 days too !
 Been using these for years - hope they never go out of production . Round mirror works best - no vibration - clear rear visibility - up and out of the way . Mirror is glass and can break if dropped , so buy several . To keep mirror in adjustment , I use rubber self-stick tape wrapped tightly around the 90-degree bend -LRB- or use a velcro leg strap or similar -RRB- . No adapter for some -LRB- rare -RRB- extremely small inside diameter handlebars . This IS the best mirror on the market , so do n't bother buying anything else .
 A great value and looks cool on my bicycle . It comes complete with detailed instructions and the appropriate Allen Wrench . The instructions call for using a knife to cut away the covering at the end of your handle bar . For a much safer installation , use a step-bit and drill.If I were to fault this mirror in any way it would be this
 The mirror fits perfectly on my curved handlebars and provides great rear coverage with minimal vibration .
 I purchased one thru Amazon for my cruiser bike . I liked it so well , I purchased three more thru Amazon . I will have two on my cruiser and two on my mountain bike . Even though this mirror was designed for mountain bikes , I think this mirror will work well on ANY bike and perhaps motorcycles as well . Very easy to assemble and the brass inserts act as locknuts which hold the screws in place without coming loose . Very easy to adjust and nice visability thanks to the convex of mirror itself . This mirror is very sturdy and does not vibrate with the exception of the vibration from the bike itself . TIP
 It 's a rare thing to find a product that 's perfect for its intendsed use . This is one of those products . Perfect .
 I have three , one on each of our bikes and one spare.Pros : - Well made , sturdy.-good field of view , much better than eyeglass clip style.-easy to install and adjust.-durable when wacked and easy to readjust.Cons : - not included with every new bike .
 This is a great bike mirror . Made of heavy duty materials and metal where it counts . I can see this lasting a long time . I also like the large -LRB- 3 &#34; -RRB- size of the mirror itself . I feel very confident using this mirror . Great purchase .
 Really like this mirror . Despite the slight increase in aerodynamic drag , this is more than offset by the increased safety advantage it adds . It will be hard going back to riding w/o a mirror ... . once you get &#34; spoiled &#34; having this addition .
 Counter intuitively , a friend told me to put the mirror on the right side . Because I thought he was wrong , just in case , I bought two , one for each side . My friend was correct and it is easier to see what is behind me in the right hand mirror and I did n't need one on the left side . However because I cut the hole in the rubber grip , I will keep it there and I can look in both . I was nervous cutting the hole in the rubber grips , but it turned out to be a breeze and the mirrors installed easily . They have several pivot points to be able to properly adjust to see behind way down the road . The mirror itself is clear and big enough . Because they are installed into the grip , unlike other mirrors that install on the bar , these extend far enough out past your shoulders to see behind you . They are a great safety feature . Instead of riding only along the curb , on less traveled roads , I now ride like a car down the middle of the road . When I see in the mirrors that a car is coming , I move over to the curb . Also when I come to an intersection and want to turn left , it is so much easier to look in the mirror and if there are no cars , to go into the left turn lane just like a car .
 I bought this mirror for my Electra Townie . It was easy to install and works great . Extends out far enough to give you an unobstructed view . Very stable . I liked it so well I bought another one for my wife 's bike .
 This looks like such a nice mirror , but sadly does n't fit the Trek/Bontrager IsoZone handlebar found on the 7.3 Fx and other models -LRB- turns out the handlebar tube is not a circular hollow despite appearances -RRB- . I learned a little late there 's a special version of the mirror for the IsoZone ; hopefully this review will help someone avoid buying the wrong model as I did .
 I found this mirror extreemly well engineered with excellent instructions for the do it yourselfer . The vibration is minimal and the visibility of the road behind you is excellent . The only tool required to assemble and install the mirror is an allen key which is included in the package . I have a Giant Cypress bike which required getting out a box cutter to cut out the end of the hand grip . After removing that , I found another plug which requred some cutting and then pushing into the handle bar to make room for the mirror mount . From that point on , the installation went very smoothly . The one concern I had while assembling the mirror was that the screws seemed to be crossthreading into the brass inserts of each mating part . If I had read the istructions a little more thoroughly , I would have seen that this was to be expected . It was in bold type but I glossed over it . The brass inserts are designed to grip the screw tightly to prevent the screw from backing out due to road vibration . Again an example of a well engineered design .
 I ride a mountain bike , mostly on roads with some trails . When on the road , I 've used a tiny clip-to-helmet mirror for years , and I find them frustrating . They do n't show much , get out of alignment too easily , and they 're fragile -LRB- at least the way I treat my helmet -RRB- . This seems better on all counts . I installed it in about 5 minutes - the hardest part was cutting the rubber end off my handgrips and that was not all that hard . It adjusts easily , yet stays in place well . It gives a great view of the whole road behind me.I ca n't really speak to robustness - I have n't dropped the bike , let alone taken a spill since I got it . But it seems well made and will probably just get knocked out of alignment , and then I can just push it back into position.Having a view to the rear helps me feel much better riding in traffic - and this is the best solution I 've used .
 I have operated a small bicycle repair shop for over 18 years . I have sold and installed many different types of rear view mirrors over the years , depending on what my distributors have available . The Mirrycle mirror is hands-down the best I have sold . Many mirrors have mounting brackets that are too flexible , and as a result , vibrations cause the mirror to produce a blurry image . Not so with the Mirrycle . It is great ! I feel that every bicyclist needs to know what is coming at them from behind whether biking on road or a trail . This mirror will do just that .
 Personally , I ca n't understand why mirrors like this are n't compulsory on bikes everywhere . No car or motorcycle user would dream of taking to the roads without at least one functioning mirror , so why should any bike rider ? In fact , just a few days after I fitted one of these to my wife 's bike , she claims it prevented her from being hit by a car and may well have saved her life . Once you get used to the luxury of always being able to see vehicles behind you as you cycle on a busy road , you 'll not want to be without this important safety feature ever again . I 'll admit I 've no experience of other brands of bike mirror , and that I chose this particular one because of the almost unanimous acclaim it 's received from other reviewers . But having used it for a couple of months now , I 'm happy to add my voice to all those others who say this is a quality product . It works extremely well and I recommend it highly .
 After using the Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror for a couple of weeks , I would not ride a bike in traffic without one . I recently bought a Specialized Sirrus hybrid bike and treated myself to a few add-ons , including this mirror . I 've ridden about 100 miles since installing it and I 'm constantly impressed with how useful it is.The image in the mirror is very steady and it 's easy to position it so that you get a good view of the road behind you . The gently convex curvature of the reflective surface gives a wide view without too much distortion . I often ride on a busy part of US Route 1 in South Florida . In my area , it 's 4-6 lanes wide , and sometimes includes a bike lane . If I need to make a left turn , I can easily scan the entire width of the highway behind me to see if it 's safe to cross to the turning lane . If I need to move to the left to avoid an obstacle , I can do it knowing that I wo n't get squashed by a bus.Looking in the mirror seems much safer and more effective than taking a furtive glance over my shoulder . That said , I do take that glance to confirm what I saw in the mirror before I dart across 2-3 lanes of Route 1 . The mirror saves me from turning around multiple times , only to find traffic that prevents me from crossing the highway.Installing the mirror was quick and easy . On my bike , I just popped the end plug out of the handle bar , inserted mirror assembly and tightened the threaded fasteners . It 's best to do the final positioning of the mirror while you 're on the bike , in riding position.The threads are very tight and this seems to be an intentional design feature to prevent them from loosening under the constant vibration of riding . I do not recommend , as someone suggested , that you run a tap through the threads to increase the clearance , since this might defeat their self-locking ability . I like that I can swing the mirror out of the way when I need to without the threads becomming loose .
 I 've tried all kinds of bike mirrors from helmet mounts -LRB- lots of bouncing around and continual adjusting to keep the bloomin thing focused to see what 's going on behind me -RRB- . Not good . Tried a sunglass mirror ... very unsatisfactory ... could n't keep the thing adjusted.I then bought a handle bar end mirrror called Third Eye . Appropriately named because I felt I always needed a third eye just to keep track of it while riding as this thing did a better job of bringing me reflections of manhole covers , , overhead foilage , sky , and everything except what was happening on the road behind me ... it was constantly working itself loose from its mounting.One day it fell off and cracked the mirror . Was this bad luck . . I mean you know about breaking mirrors?On the contrary.Although leary of another handle bar end mounted mirror , the Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mirror came highly recommended by my LBS so I.got one.This is a great product . It was a breeze to install ... stays put ... no vibration resulting in distorted image . I rarely have to adjust it . The mount is solid and has never needed tightening . Gives me a generous view of approaching traffic behind me . Very important because most of my riding is on city streets.Its well constructed as it has survived scrapes with trees , shrubs , doorposts etc. . Never regretted putting this on my bike 6 years ago.A lot of times when I have gone on vacation I like to take a bike tour and do I ever miss my Mirrycle Mirror.Glad I have one . .
 Less than two years ago a car passed me and turned right directly in front of me . The result was n't pretty . I had a mirror on my helmet at the time , but you go cross-eyed trying to use them . I have since put this on my handlebar on my flatbar commuter . It really gives a sense of security because when you hear noises , you do n't have to turn around each time to see if you are in any kind of danger . It gives me so much more confidence in my riding . I would n't go out in traffic w/o one now . I even bought the `` nerdy `` Mirrycle Road STI Bicycle Mirrorthat attaches to a Shimano road shifter for my road bike . It is fantastic too . Helmet , mirror , bell , horn , gloves , shoes , lights -- you have to get them all to be safe out there . These devices are very well thought out and have all the adapters for different configurations . I suppose the only one they do n't cover is if you had a certain type of bull-horn MTB ends that inserted inside your bar ends .
 To anyone who plans to bike in traffic , I highly recommend this product . Easy installation , durable material , good design , good price . I put this mirror on my bike and my paranoia went down by 80 % .
 I have had the mirror for a little over a month and it is working as advertized . Easy to install and adjust , easily folds when not in use and very little vibration on rough roads . Viewing angle is great . I have tried several mirrors before and this is the first one that I am completely satisfied with .
 Takes a few minutes to install . Directions for installation are adequate . Mirror holds tight but at the same time easy to adjust . Slightly akward at first with it resting against the side of my hand . Like anything else I got used to itIn general it does what its supposed to . I recommend this item .
 This is a very nice mirror with an excellent reflection . The only difficulty I encountered was at the moment of installing it . The instructions specify that the screw that fixes the mirror it self to the arm was `` extremely tight '' . Boy , that was n't an overstatement , I thought it was going to break , it felt that it just did not fit , but it does , you just need good tools and to turn the screw slowly and patiently . I do n't understand why it needs to be so tight , but I guess that that way it wo n't come loose . Otherwise it is an excellent product . It actually looks real nice and can be turned inward to protect it when not riding the bicycle . I recommend it , and hope that this review is helpful to others . Thanks .
 This mirror only took my husband a few minutes to install on my bike , and it 's great that it is n't scratching up my metal handlebars and is out of the way . I love it !
 I love this mirror . I would n't put up my kickstand without it!I was recently blinded in my left eye , so looking over my left shoulder for traffic no longer works . Also , a helmet/glasses mounted mirror would not work because it would have to go on my right side and I think my head would block my view of traffic.I was afraid that this mirror would get broken by me accidentally dropping my bike on it , but it is so important to me that I am VERY careful . Just in case of a flat tire I always carry the Allen wrench that came with the mirror so I can loosen it and swivel it out of the way , allowing me to invert my bike to service it .
 Easy to fit , sturdy mirror support with no vibration on the mirror itself . The mirror turns conveniently out of the way when not in use .
 Let me start off by saying the screws that hold the mirrors and elbows are difficult to screw in . I had to use a plier with the allen wrench to screw them in completely . The bolt that screws into the handle bar was easy . Getting past that part I really like this mirror . It stays on tight when traveling on roads . I have an electric bike -LRB- 63 volts -RRB- that does 31 mph -LRB- I am 171 pounds -RRB- . This mirror can handle that type of speed . The best part is it 's just as good as a motor scooter mirror in that you can not only see who is to to the left of you but you can see who is behind you to the right or left .
 Tried the strap on type and this mirror is by far the best . Very little vibration and great visibility With multiple tube sizes
 This was pretty easy to install , and it works great . I had to cut out a hole on the end of my handlebars to remove the plug that was in there , but once I did that , it was a piece of cake . It 's sturdy , but still adjustable , and is just the right amount of extra vision that I was looking for .
 I have used several types of bike mirrors and this is the absolute best . Very good quality product - definitely would recommend to my friends !!
 I 've tried three other `` XING LING FU MAN CHU '' brands - Cateye included - and ... just crap!This mirror really works well , with no vibrations and it 's built to last forever plus ten years , like the american made things use to be.I strongly recomend !
 very nice mirror , especially for the price , very stable on bike . putting one on all my bikes . gives clear rear view .
 Since a bunch of my riding is on roads , this seemed like a good safety item . It is . I 've bought a few different mirrors , and none were decent until this one . Solid and easily adjustable , I really like this .
 I think that this is the finest bar-end mirror on the market , at any price.It is composed of high quality plastic with very good hardware , along with a clear glass mirror.I have this installed on two mountain bikes . Bought one for my friend too.A mirror on your mountain bike can save your life-install one today !
 My friend had tried several bicycle mirrors and finally tried this one . She loved it , so I ordered one for me for a great price -LRB- less than in the bike stores -RRB- from Amazon . This is my first bike mirror and I 'm totally happy with it . Now I do n't veer left looking over my shoulder for traffic . It installs easily and swivels in two directions , to protect it when parking the bike . Love it !
 I needed to replace the grips on my Hybrid bike and saw this mirror while I was reviewing the available grips . My current mirror has a Velcro strap that wraps around the grip and constantly needs re-adjustment while riding . The Mirrycle slips into the end of the handle bar , after removing the end plug of the grip , and is secured in place with an internal wedge device . This mirror is rock solid , made from Polycarbonate -LRB- an essentially unbreakable plastic -RRB- and was very easy to install . I was so impressed I purchased two additional mirrors for my Wife 's bike and my Road Bike .
 Rec . today 1 day shipping !!!!!!!!!!!! and it is Great , easy to install . Very sturdy assembly , mirror is a very good size and you can see everything behind you , and on the side of you just great . Well worth the money ! I installed this on a 1989 Trek mnt bike which has been set up with 5.25 '' rise handlebars and a noseless seat for street use .
 Numerous similar products I have used were too easily broken in the city and were too small this one seems just right . The mounting was simple and as expected . The material is of good quality and allows for differences in handle bar size .
 Lots of flexibility in mounting this mirror ... For whatever reason the threaded bushings that make the mirror `` tight '' in the handle tubes as you turn in the screws were scary tight ! I thought sure I was going to strip out the threads or the hex head ; but , it all seemed to tighten up nicely , howbeit with nervous anticipation ... TIP : I did put a bit of household oil on the threads . Very secure and steady design .
 Installation was relatively straightforward . Quality seems good -- i.e. , mirror and mount seems sturdy . I can move the mirror out of the way for the trails and then back to being useful for seeing behind me . For the price , you get a big bang for the buck in terms of usefulness.Just one note of advice
 This mirror is very steady and easily adjusted to the correct viewing position to see cars coming up from behind .
 Easy installation . Does what it is supposed to do-allows an awareness of traffic behind you.I would definitely recommend it
 The Mirrycle MTB handlebar mirror is one must have great safety item for riding on urban or country byways . It provides the rider with a large convexed view to the rear to protect the rider from any type of danger approaching from behind . Easy to install and easy to move from outward extension to location less likely to get damaged while trail riding or when stowing or transporting bike
 For someone who is very cautious , this would be a plus . I feel safer when I ride with this and now do n't understand why someone would n't have it . When you are on the road , and need to swerve around a parked car , you can check behind you , when you are on the road , you can check behind you to see if a car is coming , if i should move closer to the side of the road . I just really think anyone who is a daily commuter should have this , esp . if you are on road where cars go 35 + mph.Easy to assemble .
 Mirror works great assembly was fast and relatively easy worth the price.I gought one for me and one for my wife we both like them
 I have tried other types , the is the best ... do n't buy anything thing else , very fast deliver also.I am ordering another one .
 I bought this product from a recommendation . It is a great mirror . It holds it position and gives me a great rear view.Be aware that the screws are extremely hard to put in .
 Installed without a hitch on my homebuilt recumbent . The allen wrench required for installation is included , along with more than adequate instructions . The two cap screws `` are an extremely tight fit when screwed into the brass inserts '' , but the instructions also tell you to `` do n't worry about breaking any of the parts '' . It 's designed with two hinge points so you can point the mirror at virtually any angle you need . Highly recommended ; its ' # 1 sales ranking @ amazon is justified .
 Easy to install , sturdy , works well . I have a `` comfort bike '' , and although the title says `` mountain bike '' , it fits mine just fine .
 This mirror is exactly what I was looking for . I commute a few miles a day , and got it for safety . It is very sturdy , and can easily be put in a variety of positions . Also , because of the way it 's designed , if someone bumps you , the mirror will just swing out of the way rather than breaking . I would highly recommend this mirror .
 easy to installstays in placeswings out of the way easy when neededdoes not vibrateI could not get used to glasses mounted mirror and I am so glad I picked this up .
 This is perfection . You do n't have to look any further for your next bicycle mirror , and you wo n't ever buy anything else . This one is the best.Sturdy , easy to install , just right in use , this is the one .
 This is my favorite mirror . You can adjust it at many angles with ease . I have mine mounted with the mirror under the handlebar rather than top so when you are in a riding position with your head downwards it is easy to peek underneath for a great view of both sides of the road .
 I got this to for my mountain bike after I have installed a babyseat . So far I have no complains . It was very easy to install using the supplied instructions and it works very well . It allows me to see the baby in the seat without having to turn around .
 Arrived as stated , installed as instructed , works as advertised.No complaints - accomplishes what I wanted/needed
 This mirror has all the features I was looking for in bicycle mirror . I have had to convert the handle bars on my mt. bike over to conventional upright style handle bars . This mirror positions secure and out the way on the left side of the handle bars . It is easy to adjust to view traffic approaching on my left . I have bumped into it a few times and it just repositions itself , needing only to make an easy adjustment for viewing.Good value for the money .
 Watched the wanna-be Nascar truckers approach from the rear and was able to easily adjust ; did n't get bumped over the railing of the overpass into the traffic on the Interstate below . Uneven pavement , cracks , rocks , all sorts of vibration did n't move the mirror out of adjustment ! What more can I ask for ? The design of the Mountain Mirrycle is great ! Fits into the handle of my hybrid Schwinn perfectly . Each element is able to be adjusted for a perfect view of impending rear-end disaster . This is a very high-quality mirror , well-designed and engineered in every respect . And the instructions are well-written and illustrated . You will not have a speck of trouble installing . The cautionary note about the tight fit of cap screws is ` right-on ' ; and even though a small hex wrench is included in the parts bag , I would suggest substituting a longer 3.0-size hex key , maybe a ` T ' handle style , which will offer you stronger leverage . You wo n't be disappointed in this mirror . It 's one of those perfect products that the manufacturer will inevitably stop making and will no longer be available ; glad I bought two !
 This was super easy to install and is very easy to glance at while riding , once I got it adjusted correctly . Very good product .
 This mirror is so easy to put together and stays on good and tight ! I was afraid it would wobble and make it hard to see , but it is very easy to adjust and it stays in place well ! I think I 'm going to get one for the other side and have one on each side of my bike !
 The quality of the mirror is well worth the money.The mirror was easy to preassemble before mounting on the bike.Securing the mirror fixture was not complicated and not a problem to mount.The kit also came with the tool to assemble the mirror fixture.As for the quality , the mirror itself is good because it is high quality glass material and not mirror image tape.The fixture is easy to adjust while riding.Mirror can be mounted on left or right side of handlebar.Vibration of mirror is minimal and does n't interfere with hand grip or hand shifting does not cause mirror mount to rotate inside handlebar.Be careful that the bike does n't fall over onto the mirror because it can easily break .
 Purchased a second bicycle and purchased this mirror to go on it . I do n't buy a product twice if I am not satisfied with it . Highly recommend .
 The mirror is clear and easy to install . It is a convex mirror . It would loosen after a few bumps on the road if not tighten to the point that I would afraid it could break . Adjusting it while on the road without the hex wrench could loosen it and make it unusable .
 I just installed my mirror and it is fantastic . WOW , there are no vibrations and you can see everything behind you . I was apprehensive about cutting a hole at the end of my handgrip , but after you install the mirror , you ca n't tell at all because it looks professionally installed -LRB- Hey it 's only a pair of handgrips if you completely mess up , but that is nearly impossible -RRB- . I used to have a mirror that was strapped on by velcro , but it vibrated and moved so much , that I always had to adjust and could n't see anything while I was riding , -- it was horrible.This mirror is sturdy and slighly concave , which allows you to see a lot of area behind your bike . The concave nature of this mirror is perfect and not annoying at all , it is perfect . I highly recommend it and I 'm buying another 2 ; 1 for my wife and 1 for my other bike .
 When one has to ride on a street , there is nothing like a rear view mirror to alert him or her to a vehicle approaching too closely from behind , providing an opportunity to know when to move over and out of the way . Additionally , because the Mirrycle MTB rises up at an angle from the handlebar end , it is less likely to brush against branches or other close obstacles . Lastly , if the bike should fall over on its mirror side , the chance of the mirror being damaged is reduced . It is an effective safety accessory which I am very glad to have on my bike .
 Best bike mirror I 've ever had , easy to install , easily swings out of the way when needed but does not loosen the mechanism . Very adaptable to different handlebars and installation angles . Forget those dime-size helmet mirrors , Cyclists . This is the one !
 Very pleased with the product . I had one previously but when my bike fell it broke . Searched all the stores for it but could n't find it . Was so happy to see it on Amazon . Reasonably priced too . Received it on time and in new condition . Thanks
 This mirror is extremely helpful when biking with children . It gives a nice clear view behind you and because it can be positioned well out to the side you can angle the mirror so that you can see a kid riding behind you on a trailer bike or even in a back-of-the-bike seat . It also great for keeping track of riders in your group who are following you . I strongly recommend it for families who bike with younger children . I had first tried the `` Ventura Flexi Bicycle Mirror `` Ventura Flexi Bicycle Mirrorwhich is a bit cheaper , but that mirror was awful . It vibrated like crazy , would n't stay positioned and could n't be placed on the end of the handlebars . By comparison the Mirrcycle mirror is absolutely wonderful .
 This product is easy to install and stays put . It is easy to adjust and stays firm without vibration making it easy to see behind you . I like this product very much .
 This is a very well designed mirror that installed easily . The only reason for less than 5 stars is that the quality of the mirror itself is not fantastic . I am pleased with the purchase and recommend it to others.Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror
 I have used this Mirror for 6 months and love it . Best mirror I have had to date . Would highly recommend it . For the price I do n't think you will find better ????
 Bought this mirror for my daily commute to and from work . Installation was easy and took less than 10 minutes . Mounted onto my hybrid Motobecane and it works great .
 This is the best bike mirror , and I have had quite a few over the years . Yes , it does take a little longer to install and adjust , but the optics are good and the mirror stays put , no matter the terrain . I have it on my road bike , so do not be put off that it is sold a mountain bike mirror .
 This mirror was sooooooooo easy to install that I felt I had to write a review to encourage anyone interested in a bike mirror to buy this one . I got this mirror and a Bontrager trip computer for Christmas . I 've spend 2 days trying to decipher the computer instructions which SUCK ! In frustration I put that aside and tried the mirror . Within 30 minutes the mirror was installed perfectly the first time . What a difference!I laid out all the parts , followed the step by step instructions -LRB- even had to cut the end off my grip shift grips -RRB- and installed it just as described . Tight , clean and easy . If you are looking for a mirror I do n't think you can go wrong with this one.jch
 I bought this as a Christmas present for a freind . It was easy to install and is good , sturdy construction . I ordered one for myself after giving it .
 Easy to assemble , and very lightweight . I love that the convex mirror is only very slightly convex , so although it gives the impression that things are further than they are , it 's easy to discern distances due to its wide viewing area . The only challenge came when it was time to install to my handlebar . I had to wrap the small wedge with a piece of rubber insulation because it was too small , and the large wedge was too large . However it was easy to stuff it in the handlebar end and I 've had no issues with it dislodging . It also helps in dampening some of the road bumps , as the mirro does not shake whatsoever.A few caveats :1 . The screws for the arms have a lot of resistance , however if I had read the instructions I would have noticed that there are notices telling you that it 's supposed to be this way .2 . While taking it on a trial ride , I noticed that the parts which I did not screw tightly would change position/rotate . Make sure to tighten the screws so that when there are bumps on the road the mirror does n't get bumped out of place .
 I have had this style before , and am satisfied with the mirror , it adjusts to my needs and sturdy enough to meet the road requirments , the sell was the price .
 TheMirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirroris the best mirror out there . I got my shipment 2 days back and I installed it yesterday.The installation is straightforward even for a newbie like me if you read the single-page instruction sheet properly . While tightening the screws , do n't worry about cracking any plastic parts - it is designed to be like that . Love the brass inserts that keep the installation screws tight and in-place . The build quality is good and I like it very much so far .
 Great mirror -- it 's actually glass so the reflective quality is perfect , not that wavy type you get from the foil reflective type . Down side ? It 's really glass , so it will break like glass . I broke one and I 'm getting another one .
 Based on several other reviews I purchased this mirror for use on my Surly LHT touring road bike . Even though it 's not designed for drop handlebars it works pretty well on mine.I LOVE the size of the mirror and the full view it gives of the road behind . Although it 's slightly convex and warns that objects are closer than they appear the distortion is n't bad.The only problem using this with my drop handlebars is the clearance between my hand and the mirror is a bit tight . This is most bothersome when trying to shift with my STI shifter levers , particularly shifting up . The mirror interferes slightly with the hand flex required to make the shift.Still , for the GREAT view it provides I 'm willing to put up with this minor inconvenience . It 's a shame they do n't provide an optional ~ 1/2 '' to 1 '' extender segment . Pushing the mirror out just that much more would make it perfect .
 I have tried a few bike mirrors , this one works great , very compact , light and great in size . But you will need to be careful if your bike falls since it could brake on impact . I suppose this would be true for any mirror . The adjustment is okay.Very well working product .
 Another great product purchased though Amazon , set the morror on my hybrid TREK 7300 and it has been solid as a rock . very nice product .
 I love my Mirrycle mirrors . They were easy to install , nice looking , and they have been extremely easy to use . They are nice looking mirrors but I do wish they were a little bigger .
 I 've had one of these mirrors on my bike for seven years . I liked it so much that I ordered one for my husband 's new bike . It 's easy to install and a tough little mirror . It 's been crunched several times and I 'm always able to readjust it just fine .
 I really wanted a smaller , real-glass handlebar mirror , one that was n't so awkwardly , `` stick-out '' big ; I really wanted to buy theThird Eye Bar End Bicycle Mirror . But although the reviews for that were quite positive , I was nervous it would n't fit my bike , a Trek 7.2 FX WSD . So I got this . And i can confirm that this one does fit - although you have to use the smaller of the 2 supplied ` wedges . ' I really would like a smaller profile , instead of this awkward-looking thing on my little 13 '' frame hybrid . But it really does the job . First off , the mirror is real glass , unlike some of the cheapie small ones that are nearly-pointless , warbly-warshy plastic . And it 's extremely well made ; the convex glass is smooth , no bubbles or warps ; the screws/nuts/washers are all finely fitted , etc. . My first couple `` test rides '' out , even over some major bumps and a ride thru a deep grassy culvert , it stayed in place . But I 've been keeping the little supplied wrench in my under-seat tool bag just in case I want to tighten things up.Was a little confuddled by the instructions - mostly the first part , about the wedges . I 'm pretty mechanically-inclined , but I had to play around with the wedges and the long screw and bolt to realize the point of the wedges.The pieces included are only JUST enough to do the job -- and some of those washers are tiny -- so take care to not lose any of the bits and pieces while you 're installing.Overall , this is a great product . The only reason I took a point off is because it 's so big and awkward-looking on my little bike.As another reviewer said , it takes commitment
 This mirror does the job
 This mirror is extremely helpful if you have a babyseat installed . It gives a perfect view behind you and it can be easily positioned so you can get a full view of your child behind you without having to turn around . It also great for keeping track of riders in your group who are following you . It was very also easy to install using the supplied instructions and it works very well . I strongly recommend it for families who bike with younger children .
 I picked one these up at a local bike shop and had it installed when I bought my bike . It does exactly what a mirror should do , is easily adjustable on the move , and can be moved out of the way when going through tight spots.What more is there to say ?
 Family member lost his mirror when the bike was on the a car bike rack . Fault likely vibration loosening bolts/screws . To avoid the same problem , I tie a nylon bag around the mirror and over the brake lever.Love using the mirror EXCEPT when mountain biking in the trees . Must remember to bring tightening tool on rides .
 Attaches easily and it is also easily adjustable . Well made . Easy to see what 's behind me . I liked it enough to get them for my other two bikes .
 This mirror is great , good visability , well made . I 've had this for 8 months , I bought two more for the rest of the family bikes .
 Took me less than 5 minutes to mount it . Takes longer to get used to looking down , but , once that is done , the view to the rear is clear .
 After trying several mirrors and throwing money away , we found this mirror . It is a permanent type mount -LRB- although it can be removed -RRB- that is easily adjusted and provides great visibility .
 A few of bike shops in my area only carried these , because &#34; they are the best out there . &#34; They come in really handy when on bike , especially on the street . Without them I tend to swerve when I look back , which is dangerous . Fold mirror in when you store bike . I accidently dropped my bike and a piece of the mirror broke off . Good thing they sell replacements , although I 'm too cheap to buy it .
 I had a bike shop install this when I brought my bike in for repairs , and it has been a great thing to have .
 I can not believe how well I can see everything behind me at a glance . Solid and high quality . Would recommend it to a friend .
 Like many others , I have tried several different mirrors for my hybrid road bike . This is hands-down the best !! It gives a wide range of vision and is very stable . Putting it on my bike was very easy and I like the different ways it can be configured . I have had this on my bike for a month and have yet to adust , even while biking over rough pavement . Great mirror for the money .
 Bought a couple of these for our bicycles.Had to slightly modify my handlebar grip to install.When installed , the mirror is very secure , can be easily adjusted and maintains its position.I guess it 's about the perfect size for a bicycle.I would n't ride without this mirror now.Highly recommended .
 This bike mirror has a system that allows it to shim tight inside your handle bar . It comes with 2 sizes of shims to fit pretty much any size handle bar tube . The whole unit assembled very easily and mounted to my bike in a flash . All the screws are extremely hard to turn and can be cranked down tight . This is a good thing ! I do n't want to add to road litter by having my bike mirror fly off . Be sure to keep the hex tool that comes with this so you can adjust the mirror under different conditions . The versatility of this mirror makes it the best product out there !
 Tired of looking over my shoulder in traffic , I knew I needed a mirror . A friend recommended the Mirrycle MTB . It installs easily , is very versatile , and provides a clear view of the area behind you while riding . With sturdy parts and quick and easy installation , I think it 's the best one out there . Ordering through Amazon was simple . I received the product in 2 days !
 Terrific and perfect for my new Linnear Limo 5.0 underseat steering recumbent bike . Wow ! What an easy to adjust on the go mirror . I know it would work well on a mountain bike too if I were to need one . For mountain bike application I prefer to use a glasses snap-on mirror .
 I bought one of these first to replace broken a bar end mirror I broke . I like that it lifts the mirror higher than the bar so it is easily visible . It is more stable than most mirrors I have tried , and easy to adjust in each desired dimension . I also use one on the left to hold a `` Serfas Stop light '' led light on the left bar end to provide a wider look to the bike when cars pass me at night . It turned out to be an easy way to mount the light . When I bought the second one for this purpose , I thought I 'd have to glue the light to the back of the mirror , but I screwed the light mount to the mirror mount with only a little filing of plastic . The mirror is also mounted and I can use the mirror during the day , and the light at night . BUT the light is too heavy with the batteries in it , and it causes too much bouncing of the mirror to be useful . So I will remove the mirror and use the light only on the left . I still have a `` plain '' mirror on the right , and it works great .
 These mirrors are great because they are removable , adjustable & will fit on any sized bars .
 I 've used one of these mirrors for years , so am now buying them for my sons who are now old enough that they are not tipping their bikes over all the time , so a mirror should survive them .
 My husband wanted a mirror that had a more wide angle view , and this mirror was perfect . Easy to install in the tubing , and it folds out of the way very nicely . He liked it so well that he bought one for my bike too . Makes for a safer ride too with that larger view of what is behind you .
 This mirror is the best bar end mirror I have found . It stays in position no matter how rough the road , but it can be tucked away if needed . It does create a pinch area if you have bar ends , but that can be resolved by positioning the mirror more forward . Many bar end mirrors vibrate too much to be very useful on the road , but this one is rock solid .
 This is a great mirror . I like it because it is very steady and stable and nicely adjustable to any position . I also like it because it cleanly inserts into the end of my hybrid or road bike handlebars and does not vibrate . AND I liked it so much this is my 3rd one !! I do n't know why it is advertised as a `` mountain bike '' mirror because I have also mounted it on my Trek 2.1 road bike and it works just fine . The angles are all adjustable so you can make it fit any bike if you can remove the end caps of the handle bars .
 I bought this for my road bike and it fits in the end of the drop bar . I left out the middle piece and it works well . The only potential problem would be in case of a fall , as the mirror is quite rigid when installed . Great image quality , and I have grown quite accustomed to having a mirror in just a few weeks .
 The Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bike Mirror is the best mirror that I found for my Motobecane Fantom Comp mountain bike . I looked at as many as I could , and even considered the helmet mount models . I started with the velcrow strap mount model that looked good and had good reviews on another site , but it never stayed in place well enough . I looked at the larger helmet mount mirror , but did not like the idea of the distracting mirror.This mirror provides a far superior mount , and is stable once you adjust it . The mount is well designed and it works as well as I could expect , providing a higher level of safety without any distraction.I ca n't think of anything I would change about this mirror , and higly recommend it for mountain bikes ridden on the street .
 Handy bicycle mirror . Nice that it folds out of the way when bicycle is parked , or hung in the garage as is my case . The diameter of the mirror is a little small but one can clearly see behind you when riding .
 They say hindsight is 20-20 . This mirror proves that point . We put one on each bike . We are old and ca n't turn our heads anymore . Now we can see what is going on back there .
 I had one on my old bike and gave it to my son and wanted another , you can replace the glass seperate if you break it .
 Looks and works great , easy to install . Fully adjustable and can be folded in for storage or riding in the woods .
 This mirror is really a savior for me . It 's easy to adjust while riding , is light weight , has a curved mirror and is not made of glass ... features I required . For the price , the quality is excellent . As far as installation , they installed it at the bike shop where I purchased it , but I watched , and it seemed very simple . It also comes with a small tool to adjust it or change the mirror from sticking out or turned inward . At the bike shop they said if the plastic mirror should break , they have replacement parts . This might happen if I fell on that side . I now ride more safely because I can easily see behind me without turning .
 Easy enough even for me to install ! And it works well . Feel much more secure riding . I 'm still getting my comfort zone figured out so I still turn my head to look depending on the circumstances , but it 's very helpful .
 Can turn mirror head around making it possible to swing head above or below hand grip . when in narrow area the head can turn inward below handle so it is not extended out hiting passing branches .
 Its a mirror and it lets me see behind me ! It feels solid and stuff . Also you can turn the top part around so it doesnt stick out so far .
 I 'll be 55 in a few months and I have n't really ridden a bike in 35 years ... well the Doc told me a few weeks ago that my blood pressure was high ... I decided that I did not want to start taking a pill ... sooo I bought a bike ... Then ... I realized it was kind of tough for me to see the traffic behind me ... -LRB- guess I 'm not as flexible as I was -RRB- ... Well anyway after doing some research I decided on this Mirrycle MTB bike mirror ... It 's great ... It does just what I need it to do ... very adjustable and I do n't have to strain to look behind me ... The safety factor made a big jump :D ... Thanks Mirrycle and Amazon ...
 I purchased this bicycle mirror a year ago but did not install it until recently . When I received it , I realized that my handlebar did not have end caps and I would have to cut the end of the handle grips . Fearing that the mirror would not be that great and I would have to replace the grip if it was n't , I put off installing it.After rereading all of the reviews , I finally took the plunge , broke out the box cutter , and trimmed off the end of the grip . The whole installation took about 15 minutes and went smoothly . The pictures are more helpful than the words.Now I am not sure how I ever rode without it . It provides a great view of upcoming cars . I find myself turning significantly less and am more relaxed my rides .
 This is a very nice bike mirror . It has many mounting angles and you can turn it to the inside or outside of your bars without using any tools . It fit my Schwinn Solitaire with no problem - in fact it looks like the factory designed it for the bike.The instructions were clear and showed the hardware assembly sequence clearly . The mounting hardware is very high quality and well thought out . The washers appear to be machined instead of stamped , for instance . These nice washers allows smooth adjustment of the mirror over the long haul . The ingenious tapered thread tap job they did on the brass inserts , allow you to set the tension of the mirror arm mounting bolts exactly how you want them and not worry about them changing again . This allows you to adjust the mirror in a variety of ways using only your hand , similar to your car rear view mirror , and the mirror will stay adjusted where you put it.This mirror worked great on busy downtown streets at lunchtime today , it is way better than looking over your shoulder . Highly recommended .
 As others have mentioned , it 's likely you 'll have to trim off the end of your handgrip with a knife to insert this mirror into your handlebar tubes . But once mounted it is sturdy . I live in an urban area where a mirror is a must , and this is both unobtrusive and provides excellent rear visibility . Took me 5 minutes to install . Just fyi , if you have a Specialized , you 'll probably need to use the smaller of the 2 wedges provided -LRB- this will make sense when you get the directions -RRB- . Finally , it 's Made in the USA .
 The other mirrors sounded either difficult to see anything in -LRB- mirror material is plastic -RRB- , or the construction is poor , allowing it to move around a lot . This one has none of these problems . Crystal clear image and the assembly does not jump out of position while riding . You have to assemble it before installation on your bike , but that 's not a big deal . There are a decent amount of parts to pour out onto the table before starting , however , but just be patient . Multiple mini washers in between the joints of the support arms provide the ability to be moved into the desired position . What sold me on this one was the photo from another reviewer , who demonstrated that you can have this one positioned under the handle bar and facing inward . I now have it straight up and out , just like any standard mirror and it does not look nerdy or goofy at all . Very nice looking and the black frame matches my black grips . The standard adapter for fitting it into the end of the handle bars works perfectly on my vintage Specialized mountain bike . Very pleased . What made me look for a mirror was my last ride with one of my friends . The greatest danger in riding is not always the cars , but some of the knuckleheads who are out riding their bikes . This mirror tells me when 100 mph Charlie is about to come flying around me to pass on my left side .
 I bought this mirror after returning another one that did n't fit on my Specialized mountain bike . When I first looked at the mirror I thought it was made of cheap materials -LRB- plastic -RRB- . However , the mirror is well made . The attaching screws go inside metal threaded inserts within the hard plastic parts.Putting the mirror together was easy . I was a little worried when I was using the included allen wrench to tighten the screws . As I was tightening the screws I kept hearing what sounded like the screws are being stripped out . I was worried the metal inserts were turning within the plastic . I was wrong . The sound is actually the screw making a nice tight connection inside the screw inserts and I had no problem tightening the screws.The mirror is attached inside the handlebar using a flange -LRB- two sizes -RRB- for a compression type fitting . After attaching the mirror to the bracket it is easily adjusted for proper viewing . The adjustments are just tight enough to make the mirror stay in place , but not too tight to make it difficult to adjust while on the bike.I use my mountain bike to do some trail riding along with street riding . I took the bike on the road to adjust the mirror . It was very easy to see cars coming up behind me . After the adjustments , I took to a trail to test the holding power of the mirror . It passed with flying colors . The mirror never moved out of adjustment . The mirror does n't stick out too far -LRB- 4-5 '' -RRB- , but you do need to be careful when you store your bike taking care not to hit the mirror.I highly recommend this mirror . In fact , I 'm going to order another one for my wife 's bike .
 I have bought several of these , given them as gifts and have friends that use them . They work flawlessly - very little vibration on my Fuji hybrid road bike even with the tires pumped up to 85 lbs . The convex lens gives you a wide panoramic view , although objects are closer than they seem :-RRB- The Mirrycle seems almost break-proof . I have yet to see one break . If you rap it against a doorway as you 're backing the bike out , it 's easily corrected . If you 're looking for a bar end mirror , this is the one to get .
 This is an excellent mirror . It is not hard to install , and once installed and adjusted , it does not easily get knocked out of adjustment . And , if it does get bumped out of adjustment , it is an easy matter to move it back onto position , where it will stay . The mirror is of high quality , and gives an undistorted view , the mount is tight and does not transmit vibrations to the mirror , and the adjustment screw does not loosen when bumped . ******* Update 2011-10-20 *********** Seven months later , the mirror still holds its adjustment as well as the day I bought it , and has not been broken ! An excellent product .
 This is a very nice mirror . It is easy to install at the end of a handle bar , is stylish looking and can be positioned in any direction . Does a good job of showing a car behind you when you want to move from the right lane to the left lane . Each time I park my bike I have to turn the mirror into the bike so it is not sticking out . So far the hinge has remained tight and the mirror stays where it needs to be when I turn it out again to ride -LRB- received 2/11/2011 -RRB- .
 This mirror installed exactly as described in less than 10 minutes.It is easy to adjust in use and remains as set without a lot of messing with it .
 great mirror , , , a lot of parts , , the screws that mount are so tight i thought they were stripped after reading the instructions it states that this is normal , , , try , then read , a guy thing . . Nice well worth the effort , , , , , , , , , , ,
 This devices is really neat and works great . Price on amazon is fantastic too . Just be prepared for the mirror to crack if it bangs against something like a wall or the ground if the bike falls , this seems inevitable given it 's location on the bike .
 I 've spent hundreds of dollars on dozens of mirrors , over several bicycles . This is absolutely the best . The amount of space you can see in the mirror , the balance of staying positioned vs being able to be knocked into a new position after bumping something , the small extra lateral profile it adds to your bike ... this is the very best .
 This is a high-quality , rugged mirror . I have purchased several over the years for my bicycles . The real-glass mirror -LRB- not plastic that scratches -RRB- gives a wide view because it is slightly convex . I have one on the left and another on the right end of my handlebar so I can see a good rear view when riding on a curve -- one or the other mirror gives rear view when the opposite side does n't . I fell once and the mirror took the first impact . Only the glass broke . The manufacturer sells replacement parts at a reasonable cost with excellent service . The box even includes the hex wrench you need to assemble the mirror . I have only praise for this mirror .
 This is a great product ! The assembly is not difficult to understand , and the screws are difficult to tighten for good reason . There are brass inserts for the screws , that are tapered and slotted to insure a fit that wo n't slip . You will be able to tighten the screws to the point that you can still make adjustments as you ride . The picture looks like the mirror stem is flexible , but it 's not . The whole thing is made out of a tough plastic . I could n't be happier with this product . Plan to purchase another for my second bike , and several more for gifts .
 great item for the price . Bigger than other mirrors that I looked at in sports shops near me . I recommended to my friends . 5 stars !!!
 I have tried many types of mirrors for my bike -LRB- s -RRB- and and was not satisfied , until my local dealer installed these on my wife 's new bike . Now all the bikes in the family have them . The mirror has just the right curvature to provide a substantial view of the road behind the rider . It makes the bike a bit wider to maneuver in tight spaces , but it is a good compromise for increased road safety . Vastly better than helmet morrors or those attached with velcro .
 Great quality mirror.Once tighten does n't move.Very adjustable and you can set it and forget it.It has a big enough view where you can see all traffic or anything else behind you .
 The title should say it all . I have 2 bikes I ride regularly and when the latest one was purchased , the mirror was soon ordered ! It works well on mountain and hybrid bikes - I do n't know about road bikes . I found it easy to install , and changing width was quite easy . Since I already have 2 , it should be apparent I would recommend it !
 We just went on our first ride with these mirrors . Not only are they stable , but they give a big , clear view of what 's behind you.After reading the reviews we thought we would give them a shot and am glad we did . Also they were easier to install than I expected , after some of the reviews . First one took less than 10 minutes . The second one took less than 3 minutes . Easiest thing - look at the picture and follow it . Probably also a big help that we have TREK bikes and the larger holder fit perfectly . Great mirror at a terrific price .
 Fast shipping , solid/durable mirror !! Do n't look any further , this is the one you want . I trail ride in the trees & on the road . Works great in both cases .
 This works well on my Forge M-Street bike . I cut a small hole in the end of the hand grip with a single edge razor blade and then the plastic plug in the handlebar came out easily . The mirror mounting screws are very hard to turn but I guess that is what keeps it from requiring frequent adjustment . The mirror mount is rugged , I commute on buses and load the bike on the bus bike racks . The mirror has been clobbered by other cyclists loading and unloading their bikes , -LRB- one guy apologized after hitting it -RRB- but it has n't broken . I dumped the bike a few weeks ago and cracked the glass . The replacement mirror itself without the mounting hardware is available from Amazon for about half the price of the whole unit : Replacement Mirror For Mirrycle Bicycle Mirrors
 This little mirror does a great job of showing me what is in my blind spot . It sticks out far enough from the handle bars to get around my rather large body and show me what may decide to run me over if I am not mindful .
 I purchased this mirror many years ago to use on my commuter bike . It had stood the test of time . It 's solidly built and has endured the average daily abuse of a commuter that parks the bike in a communal parking area -LRB- where there are all kinds of people and bikes getting bumped and jostled around -RRB- . The mirror conveniently pivots/folds in to help protect it when parking , or navigating into tight spaces . It retains the position placed -LRB- whether folded in for parking , or fold out for riding -RRB- . I just purchased a tandem bike and decided to purchase two more of these mirrors for it . Additional note - they are very easy to mount/install .
 Works perfectly to see the traffic behind me . I tried it above and below the handlebar . Below the bar keeps it out of the way and allows good visibility with the mirror . Good product .
 What can I say simple and effective , oh yes AFFORDABLE!Whats not to like ; DONT THINK JUST BUY IT and feel a little safer .
 Upon receiving this mirror -LRB- cheaper on Amazon then in stores -RRB- , my husband installed them both in a matter of minutes on both bicycles . We went out for a ride and they worked great . We have had them approx 2-3 months and go riding recreationaly and they have held up without any problems . We are both happy with our purchase and feel safer with them on our bikes .
 I bought one of these handlebar-mounted mirrors after trying the helmet-mounted kind . I did n't like having a chunk of my vision constantly obscured , even by a tiny mirror , so I thought I 'd try the Mirrycle mirror . I much prefer having the mirror mounted on my handlebar , there to give me a look behind whenever I want it . It 's a nice safety feature . If you 're a racing cyclist into the latest high-tech gear and carbon fiber accessories , this may not have enough of a coolness factor for you . But I do n't care much about looking cool on my bike , so it does n't phase me.The mirror is a good size and provides an adequate view of the road behind . Installation was easy -- up to a point . For some reason , the bolt that connects the mirror to the arm is very , very hard to tighten down . My suggestion is to build the entire unit in the comfort of your house , working with a towel laid out on your work surface in case you drop the mirror -LRB- as I did -RRB- . Save the attachment of the mirror to the arm for last , as the rest of the assembly will give you more to grip , thus better torque to get this bolt dialed in . Then take the assembled mirror out to your bike and complete the job , again laying a thick towel on the ground beneath your handlebars in case gravity tries to do your mirror in . It 's really pretty easy if you follow this procedure.And let me give Kudos to Mirrycle 's customer service ! As mentioned above , I dropped the mirror on my cement garage floor while wrestling with the mirror/arm assembly , cracking the mirror . I thought I 'd try my luck emailing customer service , explaining what had happened . They had replacement parts out to me the next day , free of charge ! Now that 's excellent customer service .
 Product is very well made and is exactly as described . I do wish the mirror were somewhat larger to provide better visibility .
 i have been using this mirror everyday and it has not failed me . easy to install , stays on tight i love it if your looking for a mirror this is the one for you . font let the cheap price fool you buy it
 I ride a recumbent bike and this mirror type was recommended to me.For under $ 11 each , I got a pair and installed both within 5 minutes . Instructions are clear as are the photos on the box . They vibrate a bit when you hit a bump , but for 95 % of the ride time they provide a clear view of what 's coming up from behind , something not otherwise easily seen in a recumbent bike . They are infinitely adjustable and I set my left one to see the furthest behind me , right one to see closer . I would recommend them to anyone , quality item that does what you want it to do .
 easy to install and easy to see behind you with a large mirror surface . Used it for 6 months with no issues
 I picked up this mirror at my LBS . I 've tried one other bar end mirror but the vibration was so bad that it was useless . The instructions are easy & it does the job . I like that it folds out of the way when storing my bike in a tight spot .
 This is an awesome mirror . I 've had it for a few years and just bought a second one for a friend . I ride a road bike , long distances , it 's awesome . Very important to always see what 's behind you when riding in busy city traffic . I 've never had to tighten it once I put it on , no complaints , it 's very easy to move the angle when riding from upright posture to the drops . I love it ! The only thing is to be aware that the objects in the mirror are indeed closer than they appear !
 I bought two of these and installed them on my bike and my wife 's bike . Very easy to install - the instructions were clear . They must have updated this product after some of the earlier reviews were written , because the mirror comes with parts that will allow it to be installed in thicker or thinner handle bars . We 've been on several rides , and the visibility is great . They are easy to adjust while riding . I would definitely buy these mirrors again , and have already recommended them to friends .
 I checked out the pictures and thought , by leaving out a part , I could mount it in the end of my bull bar . Sure enough , it mounts that way . Very happy . Strong unit .
 I was looking for a rugged mirror that would stay put and also allow easy adjustment . My typical ride takes me on about 75 % blacktop and 25 % graded rock country roads . This mirror is very stable . I have had this mirror a month and the only adjustment I have to do to it is when I manually move it to store the bike . The convex mirror -LRB- some call it fish eye -RRB- is just enough so you get an excellent field of view but not too much too where things look distorted . The installation was very easy and is very sturdy . I would recommend this mirror to anybody who rides in or near traffic .
 I recently purchased this mirror to replace one that got broken when I lost control of the bike while trying to adjust the crummy mirror that had been purchased because it was cheap . It was always in need of adjusting with every little bump in the road.The Mirrycle mirror however , is an absolute godsend ... once it was attached to the end of my handle bars and adjusted the fist time , I have n't had to move it more than a few times . The size of the mirror allows me to see the entire road behind me , and since we ride on the streets in our development this is very important . The installation is very easy and was completed in mere minutes . It is highly adjustable so it can be maneuvered it the exact position needed for the riders safety.I would highly recommend this product for any one who rides a bike .
 This worked quite nicely on my drop-bar road bike by attaching the mirror directly to the mirror base and tossing the mirror arm . In giving that a try there was some concern about side to side adjustment in that there is n't any . I discovered that rotating the mirror base in the bar end allowed an adequate amount of left/right adjustment . Set so that my left knee was just visible , the view covers the road behind shoulder to shoulder . On my bike the mirror base 's arm needed to be set about 10 degrees above horizontal . The mirror is convex and gives a wide angle view which makes the adjustment less critical . It also makes approaching traffic more difficult to see at a distance . I 've been using , and like , the Bike Peddler eyeglass mount mirror which is flat and gives a better distance view and also lets you pan around by moving your head . However , it does n't work well on some glasses frames and not at all with fit-over sunglasses . Not an issue with the bar mount mirror.It 's sturdy , rigid and does n't shake nearly as bad as the helmet mount mirrors I 've tried which are especially bad on the so-called `` chip Seal '' -LRB- or what I like to call `` tar & boulder '' -RRB- road surfacing used on a lot of Oregon secondary roads.A worthwhile product at a good price .
 The mirror is wonderful for it 's wide field of view , easy adjustment , and makes biking in the city much more safe . Stable view too . Easy to install as well with included hex wrench .
 Mirror is easy to install though a little tough to tighten which the directions warns ya . Seems sturdy enough and functions well as a safety mechanism . Personally , I would not ride without a mirror and this does the job admirably . Nice purchase would buy again .
 After riding my new bicycle a few times without a mirror , I decided it would be nice to try finding one that I could use occasionally . Once I installed this ... it did n't come off . It is a great mirror for seeing things coming up behind you -LRB- other riders or cars -RRB- . It stays put but can also be adjusted easily on the road if needed . The installation was easy .
 The bar end mirrors are an essential part of safe bicycling . The only minus is that the bracket could be made out of aluminum over plastic for more durability , but taht also would increase costs for the product . Five stars and I would buy another set !
 Works great . Easy to install , folds out of the way , and gives a great image . I feel much safer commuting using this mirror .
 You are taking your life in your hands every time you get on a bike and ride in traffic . You have to give yourself every advantage you can
 Excellent . Good field of vision and a very stable image riding on the street . Bought a second one for my beach cruiser .
 best mirror i ever boughti use to buy the $ 7 wal-mart mirror that would always break if the bike tip overi bought this had another one before -LRB- got rid of bike -RRB- -LRB- too lazy to take it off -RRB- my old bike tipped over a couple of times on the mirror side and all it did was put a white scuff mark on the back and bent the peace where it connects to the handle bars and still worked perfectlyit did its job by collapsingall you do then is re adjust itcompletely recommendworth the money
 I LOVE this mirror . This is the second one I 've owned . The first was on a bike that was stolen . I replaced it immediately as I consider it to be a fundamental piece of biking gear . This mirror has made me feel much safer when riding on roads here in Colorado . I can see cars coming a long way away . I 've owned other mirrors , but this is by far and away the BEST .
 I put one of these mirrors on a mountain bike . Then , I bought a couple of old Schwinn bikes for the wife and I. I took the mirror off the mountain bike and put it on my Schwinn Suburban . I have a problem twisting my neck , but now I can keep an eye on traffic , my wife behind me , and my little dog who is riding in his trailer . This mirror installs easily and stays put . When I haul the bikes on a rack , which I do often , I simply swivel it out of harms way . This week I bought a new Cannondale comfort mountain bike and I am about to buy this mirror for it too .
 Specifics first , philosophy -LRB- and mounting tips -RRB- second : The Pros : * Reasonably rugged -LRB- it has already survived one bad fall -RRB- * Glass mirror that wo n't scratch easily * Convex surface -LRB- affording panoramic view -RRB- * Easy to assemble and mount * Replacement parts are sold separately -LRB- $ 6 for the mirror itself , a few bucks for the other parts -RRB- * Aesthetically pleasing * LightweightThe Cons : * Glass breaks * Instructions could be clearer * Convex surface -LRB- causing things to appear more distant than they are -RRB- The BLAH , BLAH , BLAH : At the beginning of this month , I bought a bike , after many years of not having ridden one . My previous bike was a mountain bike . This bike is a mountain bike . And you know what they say
 I purchased this mirror last year since I ride my bike in the city . This is very helpful for navigating through traffic and checking for cars behind you without having to turn to look . I noticed after using it for a couple of weeks that it would not stay in place . The arm would swing loosely no matter how much I tightened the screw on top . Also , the mirror would swing downward . I realized the problem was with the metal washers , they were too smooth and did not provide adequate grip . I replaced them with rubber washers that I purchased at the hardware store -LRB- 1/4M Flat washer in the plumbing department -RRB- . Presto ! It worked ! The arm no longer swings with the bumps and the mirror stays upright . I would recommend to the manufacturer that they replace the metal washers with rubber washers .
 Purchased additional Mirrycle MTB Bar End mirrors for our Dahon Espresso folding bicycles in New Jersey , after having used them on our Raleigh comfort bicycles in Florida . Great mirrors to watch for traffic from rear , that easily mount on the ends of the handlebars with included allen wrench , and fold out of the way when collapsing the folding bikes . Would recommend to others . Vendor sent quickly and at very good price .
 I 've bought two of these so far . I have no unsatisfactory issues with this mirror . It is solid , easy to install , provides ample rear-viewing sight , can be adjusted on the fly and most importantly , can hold up to the bumps and various other hits something like this will encounter . I strongly recommend this as a choice .
 * Installed easily in 5 minutes * Adjustable to anyones satisfaction * Provides very good rear-view coverage * I just bought another one for my wife 's bike * I would recommend this to a friend
 I was originally getting a mountain bike because I was used to them . But after finding out how nice road bikes are much faster and better for endurance , I got one instead . This mirror is fantastic for it . You just leave out the middle piece and attach it directly to the bigger end piece . Take out your stopper in your handlebar , put the right sized wedge in there , and tighten it . You will need to move the bar about 10 degrees from horizontally so you can see the traffic correctly . Once done , this is a great mirror that stays out of the way on a road bike great if you leave out the middle piece . If you do n't use the drop down bars at all , attaching the middle piece would work better .
 A great little product . Nicest bike mirror I 've ever had . Installed in a snap and readily adjustableMirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror
 My husband & I both bought & returned Schwinn mirrors & instead bought 2 `` Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror '' , which we LOVE , LOVE , LOVE ! This mirror has a fish eye for full street view with minimum adjustments & holds it 's placement . It 's just a few dollars more & a much sturdier & useful product ... good enough that we even bought one as a gift for a friend that 's a more serious rider than we are . I was nervous about installation after reading some of the reviews for this mirror but we put one on a Schwinn Mt. bike & the other on an Eddie Bauer Mt. bike with no problems at all .
 I just received this item in the mail and have already installed it within 15 minutes . That includes opening the box , reading the instructions and final adjustment . The instructions were very clear and even advised to expect tighter than normal resistance of the mirror and mirror arm mounting screws . That is to be expected with any system which allows for adjustments-on-the-fly . Seriously , the arms will not break if you tighten the screws by hand . I ca n't say what would happen if you used a power tool but I warn against that as I have seen such things occur in my career as a machine mechanic . That experience also allows me to say before any road testing that this product is going to work just fine . The delivery was prompt and the package arrived intact .
 A great mirror for the handlebar . Hardest part was pulling the end cap plug out of the handlebar . I mounted mine up side down as another reviewer recommended so that it does n't stick out from the handlebar and has a bit more protection it the event of a crash .
 My wife and I have each used this mirror on our Canon hybrid bikes for years . It provides a nice wide view of the street , stays in place and does n't vibrate while riding , and is easy to adjust the angle.This is far superior to the mirrors that attach by wrapping around the handlebars . The field of vision on those mirrors is not as good , and invariably the straps have to be tightened and repositioned periodically . That is why my wife and I stopped using that kind of mirror and chose this mirror instead.Bottom line
 I really like this mirror , it is very easy to keep abreast of traffic . I plan on taking this to Thailand this fall to protect my self on the road . With so many cars and motorcycles it is very important to be aware of all traffic .
 Whether biking on the road or on a bicycle path a rearview mirror is , in my opinion , an essential safety aid . A brief look in the mirror tells you if someone 's coming up and then be aware of precautions needed for unexpected vehicle turns in front of you . -LSB- As in driving an automobile , I also afterwards glance over my shoulder . -RSB- This mirror is quite durable . It survived a tumble onto pavement , just knocking it out of position . My recommendation is to not tighten any of the screws in any of the joints too tightly . If you can move the mirror with firm pressure it wo n't bounce out of alignment while riding and in case you tumble or graze something , the mirror can move . This reduces the possibility of breaking either the mirror or the mount . The mirror diameter seemed too small when I first got it . However , after adjusting it to see the traffic coming up I found it more than adequate . I would have given it a 5 star rating except for one weakness in flexibility . You can tilt the mirror forward/rearward at the lower handlebar joint as well as swivel the mirror from left to right it at the top joint . However , for ease in adjustment , it would be even better if you could also move the arm between the mirror and the handlebar sideways from left to right , in other words , not be in the rigid , fixed 90 degree joint angles .
 This mirror stays where you put it , which was my biggest concern . However , it is a little difficult to adjust just right , but not impossible . I have n't tried this yet , but I recommend getting it close and then painting some fine white lines across adjustable pieces so that you have some gauge as to how far to move it when making fine adjustments . Good value for the money ! I 'd buy it again .
 really every bike should have one , i brought a cheap one when i first got my bike , it wobbled all over the place and was just a waste of money , but this one is perfect , i can see behind it never moves , just like using a car one , i feel much safer with it
 As I continue to mature in my cycling , I wanted a bar end mirror that would allow me good rearward visibility . The mirror is convex glass . It sits high enough above my flat bar to provide good line of sight . It 's stiff enough that it does n't shift without intentional manual input . When on the road I do n't perceive any vibration . The arms and shims are plastic , and I 'm not sure if the bolts/washers/nuts are stainless , but thus far I have n't noted any rust or discoloration with the hardware . I was happy enough with the mirror to purchase a second mirror my wife 's bike .
 Installation was simple and straight-forward . It 's a little bit difficult to adjust the mirror once installed , but that 's only because it feels like you 're going to break something on the mirror when you move it -LRB- maybe I have it too tight -RRB- . View from the mirror is excellent and allows me to see cars coming up behind me . I 've had mirrors before this and the mirror on those always appeared too convex to see anything accurately . This one is just right for seeing vehicles quite a distance behind you .
 I 've had a few mirrors , bar and helmet , but have settled on the Mirrycle.I suppose it 's a negative that if you drop the bike it can break , but it 's hard to make a mirror which will never break.I 've generally used it leaving out the second -LRB- roughly horizontal -RRB- arm . It does n't serve much purpose as far as I 'm concerned , and adds unwelcome width filtering through traffic . Perhaps it would be less prone to breakage if I used it as is.I 'm going to try tucking it down and inwards next time - if that works it should keep my profile slim and be break resistant . We 'll see .
 This is a fine bike mirror at a reasonable price -LRB- and delivery from Niagara Cycle Works was speedy -- two days -RRB- . However , it comes with two `` wedges '' for inserting the mirror arm into your bike handles ... but neither fit my bike -- one was too small , the other too big . If that happens to you , try my solution
 It is the only mirror that I could find that do n't vibrate . You get the clearest view of any mirror . It also stays adjusted .
 You will not go wrong buying this lantern . Very bright light on low or high setting . Only have had it about a week so ca n't comment on how long the batteries last . Will try to add to this later .
 I bought this mirror because it was an in handle type mirror . It has worked just as I hoped it would . Easy to install and maneuver but you must be careful not to break it when going through tight spots ...
 Great product , have purchased 3 of these and will continue to use them in the future . Well made and priced right . Used Amazon points and got it for free !
 I recently purchased a Mountain Mirrycle through Amazon.com . I just installed it this past weekend on my Schwinn . I am extremely satisfied and pleased with this product . So much so - that it compelled me to take the time to write this review , which is a first for me , as no prior products purchased have ever caused me to do so.For something as simple as a bike mirror - it is an excellent piece of engineering . The ease with which I was able to install the product , and the level of quality with which it was made - surprised me . Products this well designed and manufactured just do n't come along very often in this day and age.When riding , the mirror has been extremely stable , and due to the clarity and size , I can see the entire road behind me.Kudos to the Mirrycle Corporation on a product well made .
 This is an excellent product , very easy to install and easy to adjust . It will take about 10 minutes max to install it . Easy to follow instructions .
 This mirror installs pretty easily and works very well . It adjusts to where you need it and stays put all while providing a good steady image of what is behind you . It appears to be solid and I expect it will last a long time . Very happy with my purchase .
 I needed these mirrors for my motorized scooter . Unfortunately they did n't fit but they came in handy for my grandson 's bicycle . My merchandise arrived earlier than expected in new and excellent condition . I would definitely transact business with this seller again .
 The design of this mirror was very well thought out and engineered . I fully recommend it as it fits into the end of the handle bar without clamps .
 Read reviews and searched for lots of mirrors before buying this one . I do n't like the ones that strap around the handlebar so I was looking for one that went in the end of the handlebar . This one fits perfectly . Just follow the directions . It took all of about 5 minutes to install and it does n't wobble or vibrate but yet adjusts pretty easily . The image is clear . Highly recommended . I 'm very pleased .
 A little hard to get just right , but once I got it adjusted it really does the job . This is a must on any bike . It really helps knowing if a car is coming from behind . A sturdy , well executed product .
 I love the way this mirror attaches utilizing the hollow end of the bike handle rather than wrapping it to the end with velcro fasteners . Once attached it is secure and makes my rides so much safer and much more comfortable . Installation was quick and easy .
 Bought this being slightly concerned that it would be hard to put together , but it 's incredibly easy to assemble , costs next to nothing , and works fantastically . Just went out on my first ride with it this afternoon and it was a wonderful ride , felt totally safe being able to see behind me , a total necessity for driving around the city streets .
 Put me on the list for a positive review . Replaced a cheezy Bell `` strap on mirror '' with this mirror . Not nearly as much shake from vibrations . Holds secure once assembled yet will still fold back without damage if you `` whack '' it on something . Some mechanical aptitude required for assembly.Mirror surface has superior quality . Spare parts avalailable from company.Clear , concise instructions in GOOD english.On a very heavy Currie Ezip and it 's holding up well after a few weeks , no adjustment has been needed . Could n't say that for the Bell which shook out of position on our rough roads every few minutes .
 This is the third mirror I 've tried and the first one I actually like . On my first ride with it installed I was pleasantly surprised to see a good , stable image with a wide field of view . The mirror itself is very well designed and constructed , so much so that these things are worth noting . As far as installation goes ... I 've seen a few comments on how much of a pain it is to assemble and those comments make me wonder . I mean , really ? There 's a schematic on the box and an instruction sheet inside . I figured it out while eating dinner and watching The Three Stooges lol.I would n't hesitate to recommend this mirror to anyone . Well built , stable with a good image and easy to adjust to one 's liking .
 6/6/2011 7:38 AM.Able to see behind.Great everything . Good service , good product and good quality .
 I love this mirror ! Super easy to install , does not move or shake , and clear , crisp reflections . Love it !
 When I ordered this , I was afraid , it may not fit my diamondback . But it fits perfect , is strong and swivels easily .
 Multiple adjustment points , super easy assembly , and 2 different adapters to fit just about any handlebar diameter you may want to use . I 've bought several of these , have other friends who use it , and my dad uses one ... it just works . Great mirror . Ca n't go wrong with it .
 These are the best bike mirrors available by far.The price was a very large discount , Great transaction in all respects .
 This is a very good mirror made for installation on the end of the bicycle handlebar -LRB- left or right -RRB- . It is very adjustable due to its `` L '' shape and the image is very clear . It is slightly convex making the images appear smaller than they are but due to that , it gives an adequately wide field of view . I would purchase this item again if the need for a bike mirror arose .
 This is the second mirrycle mirror that I have purchased and I have been very happy thus far . The mirror provides good vision to the rearand stays in place . It 's easy to install and is easy to adjust . This is one of the best available for those who want the mirror on the bike instead ofthe helmet type .
 This is far better than my old mirror that would readjust with every bump in the road . Super value for the bucks .
 As I remember amazon was a little slow shipping but that is on them . The assembling took some doing but nothing that is beyond reason . This was replacement so did not have to cut off the ends of the grip , had already put on bar-ends . Figure out which plug fits your handlebar and push it in , tighten it up .
 Great addition to bike a must have . If you ride where there is alot of traffic this mirror works great . nice addjustments so they will work for any size ridder , I 'm 6-0 my wife is 5-4 works for us both on our bikes .
 Great product at a good price . It fits great . Much better than a helmet mirror . Safety first . not much more to say .
 It sure helps to find behind cars and wife struggling to catch up!But bulky and hope it last couple more seasons .
 This is a pretty good mirror , it adjusts easliy and holds up under moderate trail riding.I would recommend this mirror .
 It has a big field of view and installed very easily onto my bicycle handle . Just make sure you have a hold at the end of your bicycle bar and it will install . Comes with two inserts . My mountain bicycle used the bigger of the two . You stick it into the handle bar and keep twisting the allen wrench until it expands inslde the handle bars and has a nice tight fit . I seem to have to adjust it everytime I go for a ride but I do bump it a lot . I can ride through the neighborhood and easily see anything approaching behind me with this . Well worth for the piece of mind it provides .
 I have purchased a lot of these mirrors . They are probably one of the best on the market . You can buy parts for these if needed . They are well made . But what i do not understand is why they do not offer an option of a flat faced mirror ? They are made with a `` Convex '' -LRB- Fish eye -RRB- mirror only - which i hate . I like a regular flat faced mirror . You would think the company would give you a choice between a flat face or a convex mirror . This mirror is made of about 4 , 5 , or 6 different pieces which is nice because you can replace any broken part easily by ordering parts from the manufacturer . The company that makes these mirrors are good people and provide good service .
 And after a mile of riding after mounting this , I wondered how I could have ever lived without rear view mirror on my bike . The only &#34; con &#34; is that it is very difficult to mount -LRB- you do need lots of strength to tighten it up -RRB- , but it 's also a plus because one it 's on , it stays one -LRB- you really do n't want the mirror to swivel or move every time you hit a pothole or go over a bump -RRB- . I 've dropped my bike a few time and the mirror did not break .
 This mirror is easy to mount & is made very durable . It does not vibrate & is easily adjustable . I love it , I like knowing what is coming up behind me .
 Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mirror , Round , Black 109519I 've had one of these on my old bicycle for several years . When I got my new bike , it was easy to see that no other mirror available would work as well for me as this one , so I ordered a new one for my new bike . Once mounted on the handlebar -LRB- pretty easy installation -RRB- , it 's solid as a rock ; gives me a clear view of all the traffic behind me , with no vibration or distortion . It easily swivels out of the way if I need to go through a narrow space , but stays put , otherwise . The mirror is easily spotted by the cars behind me , so they know I can see them and wo n't suddenly swerve in front of them . It 's a great design , both functionally and cosmetically ; works good , looks good .
 I love this mirror.I recently was T boned by a pickup truck.It was my fault , I carelessly blew a red light , assuming I could make it throught the interesection before the other traffic would get a green light . I was wrong . So , being a bit leery on my daily commuting , I have ordered many things to make me feel safer . This is one of the things I am so glad to have . I immediately felt my anxiety level lower the minute I pedalled off having installed this mirror . I am so glad to be able to look into this mirror and know what is coming , who can see me , and at what time do they see me and veer into the parallel lane due to my lights and hi-vis clothing , etc. . Assembly was not extremely difficult since I followed the instructions step by step . I hated to dig out the interior of my left handlebar end -LRB- new commuter bike -RRB- , but the end result is great . The image is a bit shaky , but that ca n't be avoided , I 'm sure . I can still see that there is a car in the mirror , that 's all I need , I do n't need to see the image in hi-resolution . Get it if you are constantly looking over your shoulder . Oh , the instructions say that you can put as much pressure on the allen wrench that you need to , it wo n't break . I thought , yeah , it wo n't break . But I have really put that little allen wrench to the test and it does n't break . I used a pair of pliers to turn it as tight as it would go , and it stood up . Be safe , be seen , see others .
 Contrary to another reviewer , I feel that the assembly of this mirror is ingenious , yet simple . The fact that the cap screws are `` an extremely tight fit '' helps insure that the mirror will not vibrate loose in use.This is by far the best bike mirror I 've used .
 Product was what I expected . It was easy to install , serves the purpose , and looks good on the bike .
 Hubby and I are new bike riders . We each got a mirror that attaches to the helmet . I realized right away that it would n't work well with my progressive lenses , so bought the Mirrycle instead and love it . We just got back from a 25 mile ride , and now my husband wants one , too . I highly recommend this mirror .
 I have tried several mirrors on my bikes . This is the best . The view is just right to see oncoming traffic at a distance that is safe . It is vibration free and very durable , does n't come loose like others .
 Bought this for my wife to replace a helmet-mounted mirror . She says this gives her any easy and informative view of what is going on behind her .
 This was exactly the type of mirror I was looking for . It gives a very good view of any traffic coming up behind me without having to turn my head . I also like the flexability in positioning it on my handle bar . I had checked local bike stores who either did not carry the mirror or it was way more than the Amazon price . Plus , I had the mirror exactly 24 hours after ordering . That is service !
 Great mirror . Assembly took some strength to tighten the allen bolts , but once together it worked perfectly . Good quality plastic and made my bike riding much safer . Great little mirror A + + + + +
 This mirror gets a 5 star rating for its durability right off the bat . I installed it and on my first ride I had a nasty spill that the mirror took the full brunt of the crash . It got gouged and scratched -LRB- the metal structure , not the mirror itself -RRB- , but it survived with flying colors!I 've used it quite a bit since then and it works as well as can be expected . If you are riding really damaged , bumpy roads you will get more shake but I do n't really think that can be avoided . It takes a little getting used to but once you do , you will love it !
 I 've tried at least a half dozen different mirrors for my bicycle , and they all were failures . THIS mirror is a very high quality item that WORKS ! Do n't let the word ` convex ' scare you ; it 's a very slight convexity that does n't make everything disappear after 20 feet . You can precisely tweak the adjustment ` tension ' to your liking , and it will not shift or shake . Highly recommend .
 I feel naked without it . I usually take it off when I hang my bike up for the winter . One spring I jumped on the bike and took off and rode a 1/2 mile on our country road and realized that I had not re installed the mirror . I rode home and put it on before I ventured out onto a main road . Just did n't feel safe without it . I have used it for 9 years and love it . The coverage is great . I do n't know how people ride without .
 The product is well made and durable , with lots of mounting angles . Many people have used this mirror on my tours and loved it . Mount it pointed up as in the product photo .
 This product is good . For 12 bucks , it serves its purpose . Not more , no less . It allows me to see cars from behind and you can adjust it on all three axis .
 Seriously , at $ 12 it 's a steal . If I lost it , I 'd happily pay $ 50 to replace it . Yes , I like it that much .
 Pros :1 -RRB- Super Sturdy ! 2 -RRB- Easy to install3 -RRB- Works even for my road bikeCons :1 -RRB- Maybe some air resistance at the bar end?I bought this items base on many amazon positive review . Installation was quick and easy . Just make sure to use the small fitter incase the large one does not fit in your handle bar . Also make sure you tighten the screw points so the mirror does not adjust itself during a bumpy ride.I also installed it on my road bike and it was fine . You just have to look down instead of left .
 I love this mirror . Although I 've always thought bike mirrors looked dorky , I went ahead and got two of them for my mom and I 's bikes . I had both of them installed within 10 minutes . I 'm not sure why everyone is complaining about the way the wedges attach to the bike . You put everything together and loosely slide it into the handlebar end , then tighten the screw - which in turn tightens the wedges inside the handlebar . The instructions are clear and the product is snug as a bug in a rug . Definitely recommend if you need a bike mirror -LRB- even if it looks dorky -RRB- .
 Cut the end of your grip with Exacto knife or razor and this mirror goes on effortlessly & works great , could n't be happier .
 The instructions that came with this mirror were easy and accurate . Mounting it was simple on a Trek mountain bike -LRB- did require cutting the end off the hand grip -RRB- . So far , it is stable and effective .
 I have bought several of these . I have one on my commuter , two on our tandem , and one on every other bike . They are easy to adjust , hold their adjustment as long as they are tightened properly , and are big enough to be useful .
 Picked this up for my hybrid bike , went with the overwhelming positive reviews here and was not disappointed . Two angles to position the mirror , and it will not rattle loose or out of position . Mirror works great as a mirror -- clear & easy to make out anything coming up behind you . Recommended .
 Some items do n't really need to be reviewed again because of the amount of reviews and how positive they are ... but I am going to say my 2 cents.I just got the mirror today and put it on my hybrid bike without much difficulty . It took me maybe 15-20 minutes to put it together and on my bike . The directions are very straightforward.I went out on my usually 20 mile route this evening and tried out the mirror . I have never had a bike mirror before so I was excited to get this one . I must say that I really felt more safe . I never had to look back and could easily see everything behind me . I have to bike on some busy streets so I am constantly being passed by cars . It was nice to know when they were coming and if they had a wide trailer . I can also say that the mirror is very steady at 15-20mph on rough asphalt . The mirror stayed in place and was very secure . When I got home I just turned the mirror in for storage.I would recommend it !
 Installation was straight forward , it is easily adjustable , and the mechanism holding the mirror feels solid . I like the up an out mount , so that your arm does not block the view . You may have to get used to the way that the mirror compresses the view to allow a greater range of vision . Although the cars behind you may look small and `` far away '' they are really almost right up next you . Once you can properly gauge the depth , you will feel much safer . When in doubt I still do full head turn checks just in case . Better safe than sorry .
 what can I say , always as expected.now i can ride in safety , seeing cars at a glance.thank youGary
 Just as promised - does what it says and folds out of the way . I recommend it to all for on trail or on road .
 Sturdy , strong , works like I expected . Decent price for what it is.I ca n't think of anything I would make different ...
 clear view of what 's behind me . I can keep an eye on my partner and see traffic at the same time .
 this item is easy to install , and comes with and extra mounting bracket for thinner bars , it gives a good few for the street behind you
 Well-designed quality product . Easy to assemble and easy to install
 I have tried all sorts of mirrors for my bike over the years , but settled on this one . Good visibility , easy to install and adjust . Looks good too . BUY !
 Works great on older STI Shifters , I understand it does not work on the new ones . For me the mounting position is perfect . I am a bicycle commuter and depend a great deal on my mirror . The optical qualities are excellent . Great mirror , would recommend !
 As most people do . . I researched all the mirrors and chose this one as it met my needs of being low profile , strong , yet versatile with several installation options . I 've had this on my Trek Fx 7.3 for about 4 weeks . The installation was super easy . It was harder to remove the end of my grip than it was to install the mirror . Now I can clearly see any traffic behind as well as my riding partners . The mirror doesnt vibrate nor does it get in the way of any brake or shifter levers . I have it installed going down and in towards the bike and it works great for me . This mirror seems to be very solid . This shipped and arrived very quickly and the price is very reasonable .
 This is a really nice mirror ! Installed in about 5 minutes , and adjusts easily . Took the bike for a `` test drive '' with this new mirror , and was pleased with the performance and view in the mirror . Probably would n't break unless your bike was n't properly supported or laid down when not riding!Looking forward to a long and fun riding relationship with this mirror!OVER A YEAR LATER : This mirror has proved to be very durable . It 's been on my bike since my initial review , and has been bumped into a few times . It 's been pivoted numerous times -LRB- I turn it in when storing the bike , chaining it up , etc. -RRB- and is holding together quite well . I 'd still recommend this product .
 I too own an Electra Townie and needed a mirror . This was very easy to install and is rock solidmounted on my handlebar . It sure beats constantly turning around to see traffic !
 I bought two , one for each side since I do a lot of city commuting and need that visibility.The size of the mirror is sufficient to see with clarity if someone is within about half a mile to a mile behind me on level roads.Assemply is squeeky , but simple , and the screws may be tightened to have the mirror be completely rigid or loosened to make it adjustable by hand while riding.I was n't a fan of how it hangs out horizontally as it widens the space I need on the roads and can get caught on branches and other obstacles , but you can position is such that it is bent inward so you look just above or below -LRB- I have them below to not interfere with getting my hand off the bars in a jiffy -RRB- your hand to see behind you -LRB- I have them below to not interfere with getting my hand off the bars in a jiffy -RRB- . I 'm slender so it works great.I am glad I bought them , and if mine ever break , I 'll replace them with the same . They suit my needs and are sufficiently durable and customizable in their configuration .
 This thing is great ! Solid construction . Real glass mirror , Mounts fine , I did not use the second L arm cuz you do n't have to & makes it kinda awkward looking . The threads are the same on both fittings . I only wished it twisted at the bar end so it would n't break in case of a mishap . I have my drop handle bars turned up '' Old school style '' for comfort . The best mirror I have found & I 've been through a few ! Got on sale for & 12.00 . Hell of a deal !
 This mirror was a little hard to install but doable if you are handy with tools ! I just love this mirror so much so that I ordered three more . Nice quality and easy to adjust and use . The Mirror stays where you set it , a must for safety , just a quick glance at the mirror and you know what if anything is behind you . Easy to use ! Worth every penny .
 I commute to work everyday , and I use my MTB with this mirror to get out of the way of the crazy drivers in my town . I also get to ride some cool MTB 's trails where I have crashed several times , and the mirror has handled it well . I did not expect it to make it after my last accident , but it is still working great . I would definitively recommend this to anybody .
 This is one solidly built product . The tough plastic has expanding brass threaded inserts , which allow the screws to easily be tensioned to the desired setting , while providing long life . Overall , a very flexible and durable product . It does take more effort to assemble and mount than most mirrors , but it is well worth it !
 I got this quick . Easy install . Cheap plastic construction probably wo n't last or survive a crash or impact . buy two !
 I really like this mirror because I can adjust it several ways . It is very handy for trail riding so you can see who is coming up behind you or where &#34; my slow friends are &#34; . -LRB- ha ! -RRB-
 mounted it in a couple of minutes . frame is hard plastic . Unit does not bounce or flex which holds the view you set . In particular I like the mirror size while riding to allow for a quick glance without effort or moving my head .
 I just got back from my first ride with the Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bike Mirror installed . Good experience!First thing is do n't think this mirror is only for mountain style bikes ... I used it on my Next Avalon comfort style bike . Second and probably most importantly is do n't be concerned about the screws being quite tough to get installed . They are tight and they will get rather warm from the friction . They are designed that way on purpose so the joints do n't vibrate loose while riding . I was very pleased with the shipping time too . It arrived 2 working days early using regular shipping . Ca n't hardly beat that . I 've always been apprehensive while riding along a roadway not having a good way to keep an eye out for `` distracted drivers '' coming up from behind . Now I can watch my back ... literally ! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is I do n't know about duribility yet . Great product and I will definitely recommend to my biking friends .
 This mirror fit my road bike handle bar end just perfect . Very adjustable and out of the way . No more looking over the shoulder . I am very glad of this purchase .
 Been using these Bar End Mt. Mirrycles , left and a right , since the turn of the century . Only downside is they extend the width of my hybrid handlebars 3 inches per mirror . No such problem with the `` Original Model '' for dropped handle bars . Anyway after 12 yrs . modified the Mtn . Mirror on my rt. -LRB- added an extension or two , comes with the mirror -RRB- to save 3 inches on that side , losing some visibility and adding a bit of shake in the process . Would n't commute or ride without these Mirrycles , Workman Horn and a tailight !!!
 I have this mirror on two of my bikes , and I 've bought them and given them to other people as well . I wish I could fit one on the drop handlebars of my road bike , because it 's really about the best rear view mirror I 've used on a bike.The arms do loosen just a little over the course of riding , but I do n't consider it excessive . I do adjust the mirror frequently depending on where I am and what I need to see , so that helps loosen the screws a bit . The mirror is clear , and while no bike mirror is going to be free of vibration , this one is pretty darn good.I 'd buy another in a heartbeat . Excellent product .
 best mirror yet . I tried a cheap handlebar mirror from the big box store , but it did n't fit my handlebars . I tried a helmet mirror , but it was too small and blocks your peripherial vision . This mirror is good quality plastic with metal thread inserts , has a large field of view , good optics and is easy to adjust . I would highly recommend .
 I ordered this for a mountain bike that I use on the road at times . The item was easy to install and adjust to any angle I wanted for viewing . The mirror is slightly convex so you see a larger area behind than with a flat mirror but be aware that the vehicles approaching are closer than they appear . The mirror is sturdy and does not vibrate as you ride over rough parts of the road . Unless the bolts are really tight , it is easy to make small adjustments of the mirror when needed . Additionally , it is easily removed for those days when you may want to be riding over rougher terrain where it might be knocked off by a tree . I would recommend this product to anyone .
 Finding that craning my neck to check for approaching traffic was just untenable , I decided to get a mirror for my bike . The bar end bicycle mirror is very easy to assemble and install . But the biggest value is the increased safety you will experience . No more turning your head around to check traffic while losing sight of your path of travel . It is so great to keep your eyes forward and just glance down at your mirror to check for traffic . This mirror has a large view area , is easy to install and very easy to adjust.I can not imagine riding without one !
 Very nice solidly made product and it 's nice to see it was made in the USA . Assemble the mirror arm to the mirror base FIRST as instructed . Just tighten each component snugly during assembly . This will allow later adjustment for your particular bike . Fully tighten after your first ride adjustment . When they say the small cap screws ARE a tight fit they are n't kidding . Unless you assemble the arm to the base first you WO N'T have enough leverage to tighten the mirror to the arm . Before assembling the wedge to the base check which will fit in your handlebar first . It will save removing it if it 's the wrong size for your handlebar . Also tighten wedge to the base so that it 's a tight fit AS you insert into the handlebar . If you do n't the barrel will just spin in the handlebar and wo n't tighten .
 Easy to install . I can see well . It was a decision between a set of these -LRB- one per box -RRB- , and helmet mirrors . I read a lot about the helmet mirrors being distracting . These were the best choice . I feel much safer being able to see behind me . Highly recommend .
 This mirror is actually better then I thought it would be . It was easy to install -LRB- though I reversed the process a bit , made it easier for me -RRB- . It fits my bike perfectly , its stable , it is easily adjusted or moved out of the way when not needed , and it makes it is easy to see any cars coming up behind me.Would definitely order again .
 Easy to assemble and well made.It has a glass mirror which is much better and clearer than the plastic ones.Would highly recommend this Mirror .
 I purchased this bike mirror in 2009 for my wife 's bike . It was relatively easy to install , and has stood up well over many rail trail and tow path rides over the years . We look forward to many more years of use !
 This is an awesome addition to any bike . For safety of course , but beyond that this is a solid heavy duty piece . I was amazed with the high quality of this product-some serious design done here .
 To make a long story short
 Title says it all , this is my third mirror of this type for two bikes . I broke one , but after all the abuse I gave it and the dropping the bike JUST RIGHT on broken up concrete AT SPEED . I can hardly fault the mirror or mount . Metal where it matters , durable plastic to save weight where it does n't . I have tried 4 other style mirrors and this is the best by far . Others were so low I could not easily see , or vibrated so much I could only see light/dark , or fell off as they were cheap plastic . This one is great . So good , that I plan to move to it to my next bike along with my $ 100 clip on pedals .
 This is a must have if you do any city riding or anything on roads in general . I 've knocked it a few times but it still holds up nicely . Not the easiest to install but it 's worth every cent .
 This mirror is a must . It stable , easy to view , a peach to install with no problems at all ... buy it !!
 I have two of these on my 700c hybrid , which I 'm using on rides up to 65 miles in length . Yes , the look of the bike with two of these is a bit reminiscent of Pee Wee Herman 's Big Adventure . Still , I 'd rather look a bit foolish than end up squashed .
 Setting it up , I thought I was going to break it when screwing it in , but after that I was amazed on how good of a quality mirror this is . The thing STAYS PUT where you move it to and it 's so easy to adjust!Note
 This mirror works great on my mountain bike . It uses friction nuts and to fit the hadlebar , an expansion wedge . It 's far better than my previous Fashion Mirror by Cateye , and is much better than Third Eye Barend Mirror . It 's very solid , gives a good field of view and is easy to adjust .
 I am happy with my mirror . I can easily see behind me without turning around which is the point , right ? A big bonus is that this mirror is n't too large . Installation was fairly simple even for a girl : - -RRB-
 The Mirrycle MTB Bar End MTB mirror mounts quickly and easily . It includes the hex wrench required for mounting . Rear view is good and construction appears to be good . Great value .
 Love ir ! Installs easy and is very adjustable . After buying one for my wife I bought another one for my son .
 A good bike mirror . Careful reading of the instructions , however , is essential because the screws form a VERY TIGHT FIT into their threaded fitting . First impression is that the wrong hardware was sent with the unit ! It feels lIke something will break ! Read the instructions !
 Easy to assemble and attach to my bike . Really wide field of view . I broke my old mirror and this one is superior . I feel a lot better riding with my mirrors to keep an eye on traffic behind me .
 Initially , I was surprised that it had so many parts to put together and which goes where , kind of thing . I left it for 2 weeks so I 'd find time to think of how to do it.However , one day I said that 's it . I am putting my money to work!I did it and it 's working as I wanted it to.So , follow the instructions in the paper as it apply to your bike . You will have to carve out the plastic in your handle bar to get it in , as it said . Something I did n't find as too kosher to do but hey , that 's how it worked !
 A snap to install and works great . The mirror has plenty of rear viewing and once installed is strong and holds position .
 This Mirrycle MTB Bar End mirror is the best . I have several others that are broke or did n't work satisfactorily . It is sturdy and the mirror has just the right amount of curve to allow you great vision . I highly recommend it . It is a little higher than some , but worth it .
 Assembled and installed in about 5 minutes . Very sold , and provides a sweeping view to the rear . Every so often I knock it out of adjustment but it does n't get loose , it stays nice and tight so easy to re-adjust . Impressive that you can buy spare parts for it .
 Easy to install product and easy to use . and of decent quality . I now have 4 of these and I recommend them to everyone .
 I did a lot of research and comparison before deciding on this model and it paid off . It 's sturdy , fully adjustable , easy to install and unobtrusive when riding . The mirror does n't move around when I go over bumps . I 've smacked against things a couple times when riding in a tight space and it took the impacts like a champ -- no dings or scratches!As far as I 'm concerned it 's an essential accessory for any commuter or rider dealing with traffic .
 Just bought a KHS Urban-X commuter bike from a local bike shop and had them put this on the left side . Went on a long ride yesterday and this mirror is perfect . . with the black bars and grips , it looks like it 's part of the bike design . It can be adjusted exactly where you want it in any direction and stays where you put it . The image is clear enough to see anything coming up from behind . It easly folds out of the way for when I put the bike in the back of my SUV . Well worth the small price.10-17-11 Update
 This is a great Bicycle Mirror , and if you ride in traffic an invaluable safety feature.Installation is easy but READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST ! The screws have a locking feature so they 're VERY hard to turn . Use an appropriately sized screwdriver , installing the assembled unit as the LAST step in the process . Tighten the screws just tight enough so that the unit can be adjusted following installation , but not loose enough that bumps will 're - adjust ' its position .
 Great product . As others have said - quality and design are outstanding.Installation literally took about 10 minutes -LRB- even with cutting out the end of handlebar -RRB- . Instructions are well written and illustrated . The way it tightens into the handlebar end is very creative and holds tightly.I loved it so much I bought my wife one for her bike - which installing the second time around was even easier.It is installed on a Forge Saranac CM Path and Trail Bike . Now that I have a mirror like this , I could n't imagine biking without one.Highly recommend ! As the title states - if I could give more than 5 stars , it would have easily been a 6 or 7 . : -RRB-
 I own a Schwinn Hybrid Broadmoor bicycle . I was worried about installing the mirror as other posts said they had to bring it into the bike shop . My install took all of 5 minutes and went just as the directions said . Also , the mirror position is very easy to see traffic . This is a necessity for riding in my neighborhood as cars whiz by going 40 mph .
 I bought a couple of these -LRB- one for me , one for my dad -RRB- . Installation is simple . The great part is you can easily adjust it once it 's installed . You can rotate the mirror inward so you have less worry about shattering the mirror should the bike fall over.for some wishes ... i wish that you could easily detach the mirror to fully eliminate the worry about breaking off the mirror.while it 's a nice design , it 'd be nice if it stuck a little bit farther out from the handlebar to improve the view . some people would prefer it closer out of worry about a car clipping it if it was further out , but I think if a car is that close to you to actually clip the mirror , you have other things more important to worry about.it 's a small convex mirror so it 's not so conspicuous to make you look like a dork , but it does make objects appear small and far away . making it convex helps with vision but I think projecting the mirror further out would have been better for seeing things
 I am using two of these on my TerraTrike Path 8 recumbent tadpole trike . The mirrors come in pieces but assemble really quickly with the included hex wrench and fit easily into the end of the TerraTrike handlebars using the smaller of the two `` wedges '' provided . -LRB- Obviously , they wo n't fit a bike/trike with bar end shifters . -RRB- One nice feature of them that might not be immediately obvious is that the knurled section of the mirror mount -LRB- which is parallel to the ground when installed on the TerraTrike -RRB- makes a nice place to mount accessories . I have a bike computer/speedometer readout on my left mirror and a headlight on my right one . Incidentally , the Amazon price is about the lowest that I found -LRB- and I got free shipping ! -RRB- .
 This mirror is fantastic . I bought it to replace a helmet mounted mirror when the stem broke on the helmet mount . I ca n't tell you how much better I like this bar-end mirror . It 's much easier to find this mirror out of the corner of my eye , and it provides a very good view of what 's behind me , both in the traffic lanes and directly behind me in the bike lane.I did have to mutilate the grip on my handlebar to remove the plug and cut out and opening for the mirror , so just trying it out requires some commitment , but once it is mounted the installation looks clean.I did n't have any significant trouble with the installation . The directions are a little bit unclear about what to do with piece that goes inside the bar -LRB- the directions say to `` secure '' it , but you need to leave it loose , securing only the nut , until it is inside the bar -RRB- . If you look at the piece and think about how it 's going to hold the mirror in place , it 's pretty obvious what to do with it.The mirror itself stays put very well on rides . It shakes a very little bit , but really only little . The stability is surprisingly good for a piece for which it is so easy to adjust the angles.All the parts can be replaced individually if broken for about $ 4 each plus shipping .
 I have now used 3 types of mirrors for my road bike for both commutes and long tours : Take A Look mirror , theMirrycycle round `` mountain bike '' mirroron the bar end , and the Sprintech bar end mirror for drop handlebars.Short review
 After trying another on handlebar mirror we were happy to find this one . It is excellent , giving you an unobstructed view of the road behind with a substantial size mirror . The fold-away aspect helps with storage .
 This is a fantastic piece of engineering ! When I first put it together , I thought it seemed a bit silly -- why does it take three bolts and half a dozen washers to strap a mirror on to a grip?Here 's why : * The first bolt runs into your bar end , pulling two plastic wedges over each other to expand into an internal clamp , providing a firm attachment to any size bar end . * Each other bolt/washer combo is not meant to prevent motion , but rather to allow it
 Excellent product - the mirror gives me a great view of what is behind without getting in the way and without vibration . Easy to fold up when not in use . This is one of those products you want two of so that if something should happen you have an immediate replacement . It 's not neccessary though since replacement parts are readily available . I ca n't imagine riding without it .
 This a terrific bike mirror , especially in `` View '' of the mirror extension . It assembles and installs quite easily -LRB- Good instructions too -RRB- . I have two and would n't buy any other .
 I used to do a lot of bicycle touring . One might say in a prior life -LRB- before kids -RRB- . On that old Trek I had a Mirrycle mirror that mounted to my hand brake . I logged hundreds of miles on that bike over many years , and the mirror was great and never gave me an ounce of trouble . I rode in the back country , in the city and across states , and it helped me stay safe every bit of the way . The mirror was an irreplaceable part of the bike , as far as I was concerned.Fast forward 15 years or so . I bought hybrid bikes with straight handle bars for the wife and I. I had forgotten all about my trusty Mirrycle mirror from the prior life . I searched local stores and could not find something that seemed right . I searched on Amazon and ended up trying theSunlite Deluxe Bicycle Mirror with White Reflector . Good price with decent reviews . I pulled the trigger and tried it -LRB- x 4 ; me , wife , 2 kids -RRB- . Good quality mirror and great price , but for the straight handle bars on our bikes , they did not provide a clear view behind us . Basically useless unless you fold your arm out of the way and lean to one side while trying to keep your balance and not run off the sidewalk or hit something . They were also a bit tricky to install tight enough so they would stay in place ; probably something that could be overcome if necessary/worthwhile . So I 'm back on Amazon searching for something better . Come across the Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror . Seems decent , good reviews . Let me buy 1 and try it . The wife would not be happy if I cut her handlebar end off and found out later that we did n't want to keep the mirror . I 'm so smart -LRB- well trained -RRB- . At this point I still did not make the connection to my old friend.The mirror arrives and finally I find the time to install it on my bike . I remember reading a review that suggested laying the pieces out in preparation . I do that , and it is all too easy , even for me -LRB- installs usually take me twice the normal time , and that 's just to figure out I did something wrong or to break something -RRB- . I am really impressed with the way the mirror installs , feels , functions , etc. . Starting to look familiar . I am pleased beyond reason . Feels like home . I walk over to my old Trek that is aging with neglect along the side of the garage . I check the mirror and smile . Life is good . I order 3 more and start typing my first review . And to attempt to answer one skeptic 's question , no , I do n't work for the vendor . Just an old friend .
 This is a great mirror . Just as others have said , very solid with very little shake . No problem seeing what 's coming . I had two concerns before buying it . First , I was worried it 'd be too concave and distorted . It is n't . It 's perfect and images are perfectly clear . Second concern , I was worried that it would n't reach out far enough to see around my shoulder on my narrow BikeE recumbent handlebars . Again , no problem . I can easily see around , yet it does n't stick out too far where it 'd hit stuff while trail riding . It was tough enough to take a fall , but I 'm sure if it lands just right , -LRB- or wrong -RRB- where it ca n't swing out of the way , it 'll probably break . Simple solution though . Do n't let your bike fall over . Also , assembly is no problem . If you 're smart enough to shift gears , you can put it together .
 I bought a Cannondale Cyclocross 6 to use for commuting and I was agonizing over searching for a mirror for it . Bar end mirrors seemed like they 'd be too low and too far back and would be blocked by my arm . I did n't like the idea of attaching a mirror to my brake lever housing , and my aging eyes are having difficulty focusing on things up close so a helmet-mounted mirror probably would n't work well for me . I read the reviews over and over again searching for something that would work . Looking carefully at the MTB mirror , I thought it would work on drop handlebars , so I took a chance on it . It does work , and very nicely . I placed a photo of mine in the customer photos for anyone who 'd like to see what it looks like on drop handlebars . It did n't take long to install , and I like the clever wedge design to hold it in place inside the handlebar . I still have to look down a bit to see the mirror , but it 's better than looking down at a mirror sticking straight out the back of my handlebar , and my view is never blocked by my arm or my knee . The mirror is big , so I get a great view of the road behind me . After I adjust the mirror , it stays in place , even after going up and down curbs and riding over roots . I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it interferes with my hand when reaching for the front of the drops , but I so rarely ride in that position that this really is a negligible point for me . That said , I think this is the best mirror option for my needs .
 This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface , which is great . It does n't minimise or enlarge the reflection , so is a true reflection . It 's very clear , even around the edges , and is actually glass and not plastic . Unfortunately , I dropped and broke it before I could use it , so I ca n't comment on how it functioned .
 This is a great product . Very straightforward assembly and installation . The company makes spare/replacement parts readily available if and when you need them , although it seems to be durable enough to last a while . The mirror swings out of the way when you park or lock up , holds its position very well if you tighten the bolts enough , and is easy to remove but hard to steal . -LRB- Unless your thief has the proper size hex wrench . -RRB- After about three minutes of riding in Manhattan with this mirror , I found myself wondering how I ever survived without it . You really get a much better chance to avoid buses , cabs , cars , other bikers , etc , when you can see them coming up behind you . Painfully obvious ? Probably.You wear a helmet so that you do n't crush your head in a crash . Use this mirror to avoid the crash completely .
 The mirror is large enough to give you a good , full view of what 's coming up behind you and is n't too big where it offsets the look of your bike . I 've got mine mounted on a Specialized Rockhopper and definitely need it riding around the twisty hills of Western Mass. . Great mirror and great design .
 I purchased both the Mirrycle MTB Mountain Bar End mirror -LRB- round glass -RRB- and the Zefal Dooback mirror -LRB- rectangular metalized reflective surface -RRB- . One I installed on my wife 's bike and one on mine . Comparing the two mirrors the Mirrycle is a better quality as the mirror is sharper and clearer . The Zefal uses a metalized foil of some sort for the reflective surface and does not give as clear an image as the Mirrycle . Both were easy to install and stay in place during our street biking . Both work fine . However , if the Zefal every breaks it will be replaced with the Mirrycle MTB mirror .
 The Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror is a well made and great safety addition to my road bike . It attached securely to the end of my left side of my drop handlebars and makes it easy to get a clear view of the road behind . The mirror is 3 '' in diameter and is highly adjustable -LRB- both side to side as well as the up and down tilt -RRB- in order to set it at the proper viewing angle . The pivots are secure and stay in place , without loosening in over 500 miles of use -LRB- the pivot tension can be adjusted with the hex screws -RRB- . The outer case is made of a durable plastic that is resistant to scuffs . Overall an excellent addition to any bicycle , highly recommended !
 I was VERY pleasently surprised when I went to install this to my bike . At first it looked rather flimsy , being with the way it assembles and such , but I was very surprised to see how durable , AND adjustable it really is ! Even AFTER assembly ! Unlike a few other people who 've put reviews here , my bar-end simply `` pops out '' -LRB- I guess it 's because I have `` climbing bars '' -LSB- or whatever they 're called -RSB- on the end of my 26 '' Mongoose Spark -RRB- it still fits , and quite well I might add ! It comes with two sizes of what I believe someone else called `` wedges '' ; still , once you 've figured which size to use -LRB- it gives you two choices , large or small -RRB- it seems to almost ` fall together ' from there . Also , as has been said before , it 's VERY stable , and shaking is almost non-existent ! MUCH better -LRB- and MUCH more stable than -RRB- the `` Third-Eye '' bar-end mirror I had before . One more thing , it 's a `` flat convex ' mirror , but it 's glass , and you almost ca n't see the convex part , but it helps it -LRB- and YOU -RRB- to see at a wider angle .
 Installed in about 5 minutes . Solid construction , solid functionality , solid hardware . Would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a good mirror . Installed on my Raleigh Mojave 4.0 setup for commuting .
 This is a good quality , solid , bike mirror . This is not a portable/removable mirror so once it 's intalled , it stays . Plus you have to cutoff the rubber part on the end of the bike handle inorder to intall the mirror and so , if you uninstall the mirror , there will be a hole at the end of your hadle bar . . just so you know ! Once properly installed , there is absolutely NO VIBRATION whatsoever.I installed this on my foldaway bike and there were absolutely no issues or obstruction by the mirror . All in all , I am happy that i went with this model instead of the other cheapo craps available at the mega dept/sporting stores.And the installion was super easy . If you have any trouble , just google `` Mirrycle mirror '' on youtube and you will find a guy giving a tutorial on the installation .
 Great once installed . I now have a very clear rear view when bicycling.I spent some time to figure out how to install the mirror . I had some trouble first . But Andy Kaylor 's product review helped me out . I second what he says here
 Works as advertised . The assembly was clear but the machine screws were somewhat hard to put in . Other than that I 'm entirely satisfied .
 I have been ridden bicycles for decades , and was quite accustomed to turn my head and look over my shoulders when I needed . After getting advices from a couple of commuters , I decided to try this mirror -LRB- dispite my bad past experiences -RRB- , and I think I can not live without this little thing anymore.The previous mirrors I tried were not convex enough -LRB- or at all -RRB- , or vibrated too much , or lacked adjustments . I also never adapted to helmet mounted mirrors . This Mirrycle one is steady and sturdy as a motorcycle mirror , but smaller.And it fits my handlebar without scratching my Ergon GC2 grip in any of the four positions .
 The Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror was very easy to install with the included allen wrench ... it look very well buit and after the first ride and some slight adjustment ... I do n't know why I waited so long to get this one .
 I 've never used a bar end mirror before on a bicycle . After reading reviews on this one , and considering a few others , I decided to go with this . I seriously wish I had found out about this sooner . It 's so much easier for the paranoid bicyclist to see what 's going on behind me . It is pretty easy to install . Required very few tools . And it has stayed on snugly for nearly a month now and for 100 + miles . The range of view is excellent . It 's a pretty big mirror so do n't be surprised if it 's slightly unsightly . However it 's form following function here so it gets an A + from me ! - Tip , I swing/pivot the top portion of the unit inwards to squeeze through tight spots , then return the mirror back to the regular position afterwards . Helps with storing and not bumping into it while it 's in the garage .
 I have this mirror installed on motor assisted city bike . It does not vibrate even with the engine on , and strong winds do not disturb it enough to be annoying . I like it very much . It is a little delicate , but if installed properly , it will allow the mirror to be adjusted by hand or swung over the hand grip to clear doorways when storing.ATV mirrors are a good choice also , but much heavier . This is a satisfactory bicycling product and I will buy another.If you follow the instructions , your grip will not be `` mutilated '' , and you can use a $ .50 handlebar plug if you take the mirror off for offroading or events . Take an exacto knife or razor , make a + shaped cut in the center of the grip 's capped end , reaching to the metal , then trim around the inside diameter of the bar .
 At such a low price I was skeptical that it would be durable enough for my use -LRB- I ride almost everyday -RRB- . The mirror is large enough to provide a clear view . I use it turned down and inward so that it 's positioned under my left hand . Well made and durable . Easy to install . A great buy .
 I was skeptical when I ordered this mirror , but now after more than four months of daily 7mi commute I must say I am very happy with it.It assembles easy , just the screws need a lot of torque to drive them into the metal inserts . At the time I was afraid that the plastic will break ... but it did n't . Easy to use , easy to adjust . It hols the position well , and it gives very nice overview .
 Great mirror and exactly as described . This mirror will adjust to any bike or riding style . Very happy with my purchase .
 I had to replace my Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror when the previous mirror was broken in a biking accident . It was easy to remove the round mirror from the bar end assembly and replace it . This small unobtrusive mirror gives a good view of what 's behind you without taking up much space . The arms bend in all directions so that the mirror can be positioned exactly as you prefer . And since the mirror mounts on the bar end , it takes no space on the handlebars .
 This mirror was easy to put on and easy to adjust . The rear view is very clear.Happy to see it 's Made in America .
 I just installed this today and I have to say I like it . The only thing I do n't like about it , is having to cut the end of grip off to fit the wedge . I plan on this being a permanent fixture for the bike , so it 's ok . The instructions are very simple . It has a nice clean look . I bought this so I can see my child in the bicycle trailer and to see cars .
 Fits on straight type MTB and hybrid handle bars . Its fully adjustable . It provides a good view of what 's behind you without restricting your movement or vision .
 I have owned these mirrors for years . They can be positioned under the left handlebar also , with the mirror pointing toward the stem . You can still see behind you and the mirror wo n't constantly clang into things and you wo n't look like some sort of Shriner nerd .
 I have tried the helmet mounts , the eyeglass mounts , the Blackburn bar mounts . None worked for me.This did . Not too much different than a car mirror.I liked it so much I bought two , one for each side . If I had a third side , I 'd buy three.Easy to set up , though the instructions could frighten you . I you have ever set a toggle bolt in a wall or used an expansion shield in concrete , you will be familiar with the process ... just a sliding wedge that you tighten with the supplied 3mm allen wrench . Much like the way that quill stems are -LRB- were ? -RRB- tightened.Stays in place , does n't vibrate much , easy to switch focus between the road ahead and the mirror behind .
 I have these on most of my bikes work great , good vision , easy install and adjustment .
 Ordered two mirrors.One was cracked . Messaged shipper , without even request of product sent a replacement.Still sent broken one back .
 I like this mirror and it works well is easy to mount and adjust . Swivels out of the way when transporting or storing the bike .
 I have this mirror on my electric scooter x500 and I love it very used full but the only think is that one time I hit it well I was riding my scooter with a little hit the mirror broke but it still worth 5 stars
 I have 3 of these , MTB , road bike , wife 's on , off road bike.All hold up very well , stay were you put them , take a beating , good dependable mirror !
 This is the best mirror I have ever used or seen anywhere . The mount is very solid , but it can be quickly and smoothly adjusted in all three degrees of freedom , as well as folded away for storage , or while riding in the bushes.One thing I sometimes wish were different is the angle of view , which I find a bit narrow , but I am a tall person and I ride upright , so my angle of view is limited by the distance to the mirror , rather than by its curvature . The only solution to that would be to have an even larger mirror , or use a head-mounted one ; this mirror is as large as a bike mirror can be , I think . I simply lean closer to it when I need a wider view.During assembly , the torque required to drive the screws in is so strong that it feels as if the screw is cross-threaded , giving an urge to back off and start again . But that is how the thing is designed
 I am using this product for a few months and so far I am very pleased with all the features
 The Mirrycycle bar end bike mirror is the best bicycle mirror on the market for the money .
 The Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mirror is easy to install and stays in place . I would recommend this product to anyone in the market for a bicycle mirror .
 AUTOMOTIVE QUALITY !!!! What can be said about a bicycle mirror ?? Well , in short , this mirror sets the standard by whichAll bicycle mirrors SHOULD be judged ! The `` other '' brand mirrorsare n't anywhere near this quality!NO - it may not survive the impact of your bike falling over-but would any other mirror ?? Automotive mirrors DO N'T SURVIVE light/mild impacts ... Hmmm ... Especially when this mirror mounts to the end of the handle bar !! Anyone aware of a mirror like this THAT WILL survive a blow-contact me immediately !
 What can I say ... great gift and no one will ever know what you paid for it
 I bought this beanie because the price waa so good . I 've washed it twice to look for defects but did n't find any . When it 's cold it 's hard to beat a beanie
 I purchased two of the Shamrock wrestling singlets . They seem to be well made and I will hand wash them in cold water to see how well they hold up . They look great right now .
 If you 're looking for a large board that is relatively inexpensive , this is it . Having the marker attached the board is an added bonus .
 This is a nice clipboard . It is bigger then I thought it was , but I like it , erasers easy . Would recommend this to anyone !
 it 's okay replacement lens , for my goggle.it 's cheap and easy to replace . others too expensive ...
 fast shiping , and good purchaise Do explain why you liked or disliked this product . Do compare to similar products and share how long you 've used this product .
 good product king of hard to fit but afther that work great , good sun protect no to dark good view rcoment this item
 This lens fits perfectly in my Crowbar frame , if its your first time installing a replacement lens dont get frustrated it takes a little finess to get them locked in to the attaching points . I used this lens at the Oregon dunes on a bright 85 degree day . Worked great and gave me excellend depth perception for the different sand depths and ridges . They are not as dark as they look in the picture but still provid excellent sun blockage . As good as a pair of Oakley sunglasses when it comes to sun blockage . Great set of lens , would recomment , buy again .
 Exactly as described . Took a little longer to receive but the sellers were great to buy from . I would definitely buy from them again .
 There super sick !!! They make everything an awesome color . And its the best lense I 've ever skied/snowboarded with !!!! You should deffinently get them !
 Our toddler is VERY active and loves to climb on everything . We bought this for her when she was about 18 months old and she continues to love it now at 2 years . We build obstacle courses in our carpeted living room with this balance beam and I 've found it to be very sturdy , safe , and durable . I also found it to be reasonably priced compared to other soft , indoor gym equipment for this age group .
 This is a great item for smaller toddlers , wide enough for them to walk on , soft enough to not get hurt when they slip , colorful too . Only issue is when an older child tries it , they tend to cave it in a little . Not meant for kids over 50 lbs .
 I like using these shirts for my kids who do n't like sunscreen . These shirts were the best value , are comofortable and good quality . Remember not to put them in the dryer !
 Got this gun as my first bb gun . Am very happy with it so far . Only problem is it is a little hard to cock , as there is nothing to grip on the top piece . A minor quibble on an otherwise excellent gun . Great feel too , nice weight to it.Also , the suppliers are aweosome ! Had this delieved in 5 working days !! Sweet !
 This gun is great except for few minor upgrades that could be put into future models ; for instance a safety , a speedloader -LRB- if possible -RRB- , and an easier to load spring . Also , I have dropped the clip a few times just by holding the gun , because of it 's badly placed clip release .
 This pistol is great . It 's east to cock , fires fast and hard , and is very accurate . The silencer is worthless , and if you put it on the gun is really inaccurate . Everything about this airsoft is real , from the clip release to the slide locking back when you run out of rounds . I would recommend this to any beginners or advanced players , cause its a great all around weapon , especially for indoor warfare .
 this gun can pack some firepower . my friend was using this and i had the super 9 pro sniper rifle . i had to dodge the bbs from this thing from 120 feet away . i was amazed . he had .20 grams in it but still it was shooting eccelent . he didnt even angle the gu up at all and it almost hit me from 120 feet away .
 This gun is good for shooting indoors . When u read the manual it says it is only ment for shooting 10-15feet and plinking . Which makes a super fun indoor gun or even backyard . Its not 4 small animals or distance 4 sure . But is fun and a super cool thing is it can shoot darts , bolts.pellets , and bbs so u have a variety . Also most guns dont shoot darts or bolts . For what the gun is suppose to do i give it a 5 it is made preetty strong and well .
 The Model 1010 is a classic Crosman BB gun ; not a powerful match grade pistol and certainly not a cheap toy.I remember it from the 1970s and it usually came with a tube of BBs , a packet of mohair-fletched darts in red , yellow , green and blue , and a dart board . Crosman never designed this to be for long-range , high-velocity precision target shooting but rather short-range indoor games and outdoor plinking . And it does all of these very well , therefore I give it five stars . Back in 2003 I found one at a yard sale and paid $ 10 for it . I took it home , cleaned it with a little WD-40 , put a few drops of 3-in-1 oil down the barrel and it sat on a shelf for years . Now that I have a back yard and a workshop I bought some BBs and have been playing with it , shooting at 1 '' blue foam insulation targets . At about fourteen feet it can still shoot a BB through the foam and ricochet off the wood side of the workshop . I would certainly recommend this as a starter for target shooting and for beginner pistol safety training . As with any weapon , I recommend the use of eye protection and basic weapons safety .
 Finally , I 'd like to add that you can buy PELLETS for this , making it more accurate at a distance and boosting its momentum power , if sacrificing it 's impact . You can even buy darts so you do n't have to hand toss darts . BBs are intended for short range , moderate power , as the ballistics of it being round cause it to be affected by air drag.In short , this is a multi-purpose , possibly indoor , air pistol with only 200 FPS , barely enough to go 15 feet with a BB , but 25 with a pellet or dart .
 I have one of these Marksman BB pistols that I bought back in 1997 for about $ 15 . It 's still going strong today and has never given me any problems at all . About once every 50 shots or so put a drop or two of 30wt motor oil down the barrel , set it bore up on a table for an hour so the oil will run down the barrel , & it 'll keep velocities up where they should be.First - what it 's not
 This pistol performed better than expected . However , it was not without its flaws . The pellet seating tool did n't seem to work to great , as in using the tool to seat the pellet , the proceeding to fire the weapon did not result in the projectile in leaving the barrel . However , using the dart seating tool in place works fine . It will feed BB 's reliably as long as you tilt it when cocking the pistol as to make sure a BB chambers .
 Well . I have to say 4 of 5 If this Is what you are looking for In a Repeater . It met all my standerds as to what I want . One warning though , I would not advise to use this in a match or battle . The haveing to reload by hand and so often makes It more of a pain then a pro . But haveing It just for poping can 's or what not Its fine . Nice color , Nice proformance and for the most part a good gun .
 Ok , first off , this is an AIR PISTOL . Not airSOFT , air pistol . That means it 's usually meant for target practice and not for airsoft wars , as if it 's too strong , it WILL puncture skin and go through , possibly even to the bone . This particular one is weak enough to be used as an airsoft gun , but whenever it says AIR PISTOL , do NOT use it in airsoft wars.This one is for shooting at cans and stuff in your backyard , as 200 FPS gets you about 15 feet max .
 I bought this when I was 15 -LRB- I 'm 28 now -RRB- . I do n't have it anymore -LRB- it broke 14 years ago -RRB- , but I remember that I had a lot of fun with it . I bought it in a blister pack , and it said it can shoot BB 's , pellets , and mowhair steel darts , and it did.This is a spring-driven pistol . It looks like an M1911 handgun and weighs almost as much thanks to it 's all metal construction . The only plastic part I could see is the barrel/breech assembly at the front where you load the BB 's , pellets , or darts . It 's also durable . I dropped it , kicked it , threw it , and used the heck out of it and it never skipped a beat.To fire , you have to release the cocking slide by pushing down the slide release on the side -LRB- like the slide release on a real handgun , except it works in reverse -RRB- , then pull back on the handle until it clicks , and push it back to lock it in place . Give it a shake to load a BB , and fire -LRB- of course take the safety off first -RRB- . 90 percent of the time a BB came out , other times it did n't load a BB into the breech . The breech/barrel assembly is one piece . You push in the bottom where the guide rod would be , and it tilts up so you can load BB 's in the magazine under the barrel -LRB- it will hold 18 , but I managed to shoe horn in 20 -RRB- , or insert a dart or pellet into the barrel -LRB- do n't load BB 's before doing this ! or you might get a stuck pellet or dart and make the breech hard to open -RRB- . This is n't very powerful . The Red Ryder BB rifle is much more powerful . You get about 175-200 FPS , less with pellets and darts , but it 's still powerful enough to hurt like the dickens if you get hit and enough to seriously damage your eye . It 's not accurate either . The barrel is smooth and only about 2.5 inches long , so it 's good out to maybe 15 feet at the most . Even from that range it has trouble penetrating a paper target , and puts a mean dent in a soda can . Firing pellets and darts is fun . Firing pellets makes it a little more accurate , but not much and the tighter fit in the barrel kills velocity . The darts are the best part . You can play darts with this and it 's loads of fun ! You can fire a dart much more accurately than you can throw it -LRB- with practice -RRB- . My friends and I would play for hours with this!I liked it so much that I wore it out from using it so much !
 Review
 Nice very real looking gun very sturdy and easy to use and very happy with this buy Its a lots of fun but like any other gun safety its firts
 Bought this gun so that I can practice shooting at close range with a handgun in the garage , without wasting time going to the shooting range . Got the darts with it and I put up a human dart target as well that I got for knife throwing practice . Overall its a great gun to practice with at 10-15 feet . It really helps with my accuracy without spending too much money on ammo . I also got the quick loader bbs for it and it came out pretty descent as well . The only difficulty that I have is the cocking mechanism was so hard . But after 500 rounds it loosened up and is now great to use .
 This gun works just like the description said it would . It is exactly what I needed .
 Its the same size and weight of a 1911A1 and feels very good in your hand . And the price is extremely inexpensive . Its hard enough to cock that the grand-kids ca n't , so an adult must do it for them and this keeps them out of trouble . Because its spring powered there is no CO-2 to buy , or anything to pump up . Its as simple as it gets , and makes for a lot of fun whether shooting at paper targets or beverage cans , and it wo n't break the bank . Its a &#34; ca n't miss ! &#34;
 Seems to seal up even the oldest of decks that have n't been sealed for sometime . Important to sand down the deck first .
 My daughter rides 2-3 horses daily , year-round , and I ride as much as possible . We both have had several pair of these Tuff Rider Ribb breeches , and they last forever ! No special washing/drying needed , which as horse women we do n't have time to mess with . The fabric does not attract dirt and hay as some other fabrics do . I especially like the zipper pocket - perfect size for horse treats or my cell phone .
 These breeches are super comfy and they last FOREVER ! They do n't need any special care which is a plus when you work with horses everyday . They 're great for schooling , but are nice enough for the show ring .
 I received the ribbed TuffRider breech in the mail today . The fit is very comfortable and flattering , if you like a waist high rise . Was n't sure if I would be okay with the deep purple , and , as it is actually not a deep purple , but in actuality more of a medium blue purple with periwinkle colored knee patches , it may not be for everyone , especially if you are color-shy . But I like the color and the comfort , so am keeping the breeches . The front zip clasp has a somewhat finicky closure , but once you get the hang of it , it 's fine . Very stretch , non-binding , so if you are true to size , it should be quite comfortable . They seem to be fairly light weight , so I plan to use them in the peak of summer heat . These are a colorful keeper .
 These pants are awesome . Size is great and extremely comfortable . The color is n't Taupe , however . It 's more like a Tan or Camel . Other than that , they are terrific and especially considering the price . Extremely well-made . I will definitely purchase again .
 Comfortable . I bought these for casual wear . They look great with boots and a shirt . They do finish at the ankle -LRB- regular length -RRB- . I would buy other colors in this style .
 I really love the way these breeches fit , they look great and with a pair of riding boots . i would reccommend
 The pants fit really nice even after giving birth to my baby I tried these pants on 6 weeks later and they still has a nice fit . The only thing I did not like are the logos on the inside of the knee patch . Had I saw that prior to me purchasing them I would not have bought them . I personally do not like the logo of people 's companies on my clothes
 Came extremely fast ... recieved it within 3 days from day of order and was just like the original one that i had that faded
 I found these shorts -LRB- 2 pair -RRB- to be better than expected . The product quality was good and the delivery was prompt . If you are looking for a good `` everyday '' pair of shorts at a good price , I do n't think you 'll be disappointed .
 I wear these all the time to work around the house , great , heavy material , all cotton shorts , longer legs than most which I appreciate since I am 6 ' 3 '' . Will definitely buy again . The review needs twenty words , so here 's a few more ...
 Finding these cotton thin mens ' shorts are difficult - they are the only ones my husband will wear . Their year-round cotton comfort and roomy legs and waist is what he wants . He likes the pockets and the drawstring waist too .
 This short is a very comfortable lightweight cotton short that has large pockets and a comfortable long length .
 I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR YEARS . THE SHORTS ARE HEAVY DUTY . THEY ARE NOT GLAMOROUS OR HAVE A FANCY LOGO .
 I purchased 3 pairs and washed them before ordering more . The fit is true to size after washing , a big plus for 100 % cotton , I like the feel of the fabric . Living in the South , I wanted something light weight , and the pockets are a good size . The inseam is the perfect height and comes above the knee , not to short .
 Recognizable manufacturer of athletic wear is a plus . These shorts are made of lightweight cotton jersey material , perhaps a bit lighter than some other athletic shorts -- as such , uncertain as to how long these will wear , but ca n't complain because of low pricing . Good proportions and fit . Was also pleased with Amazon 's wider choice of available colors -LSB- i.e. , other than Navy or grey -RSB- for this item . Was able to enjoy no tax or shipping charges with Amazon .
 Ordered these for a Christmas present . I 'll wait to see if husband likes them , I 'm sure he will ... stay tuned ! I 'll come back and let you know if husband liked these for holiday .
 Great shorts , very comfortable for joging , fits nicely on the body , highly recommendedanyone who buys it will enjoy them .
 I have two older pair of the same product . They seem more sturdy , but be ones are good . I would buy again .
 A gret pair of shorts for the gym , comfortable and they survive the washing and drying well.My fingers are crossed that they last well !
 Product was as described and advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied with my purchase , Price was good
 4 instead of 5 stars only because it shrinks -LRB- in length -RRB- after a run through the dryer . No other complaints .
 I like them because of the longer length in the legs , the lighter weight material and the pockets . BTW , I am a woman and find these so comfortableto wear around the house and am not the athletic type at all .
 I wanted something comfortable at a good price and thats what I got with these Russell shorts . The comfort of cotton at less than half the cost of similar items .
 I 've ordered 4 or 5 pairs in different colors for my husband who 's in a rehab facility after pneumonia and other things . He 's wearing these in lieu of hospital pajamas , and looks presentable in these . Easy for him to get on and off , they have pockets and fit him well , Great price , great buy .
 Item exactly as described . True to size . Good quality fabric.Side pockets are nice feature . My son likes this very much .
 this is exactly what I wanted . my husband doesnt like mesh . the fit is true to size . was received quickly .
 I 've been wearing Russell shorts for years and through many , many waist sizes.They last a long time , are very comfortable , and look good on you , even when or if you turn into a tubby like I 've become , but thankfully they have a size that fits even me .
 Muy buenos para salir a caminar , son ligeros y buena calidad , ideales tambien para el gimnasio o para simplemente usarlos en casa .
 The shorts were supposed to be a Christmas pres4ent for my husband but they were so great and fit him so well , he jumped into one immediately ! Great product , it arrived on time and we are very pleased with the transaction .
 Was happy to find.my husband likes these and they are hard to find . most athletic shorts are shiny and he does n't like them .
 These shorts were an excellent buy . $ 11.00 and free shipping . I only ordered one pair because the price was so low . I thought they might be poor quality . These are great shorts with `` POCKETS '' . Shorts without pockets are useless for me . The material is soft , light and breathable . I 'm gon na order 5 more before the price goes up .
 For the price , I think that these shorts are great . I love the material , the size , and the pockets . I see no reason why others would rate these shorts anything less than five , or at least four , stars . These currently are my favorite shorts , but there 's a chance it could be because they 're new . I will probably be buying more of the other colors , if it concerns you , I bought the Oxford Grey .
 I have used these shorts several different times over a 10 year period . They are used in a sports chiropractic office .
 I 'm a dedicated wearer of Russell sweat pants , so I figured that , with Summer just around the corner , I 'd invest in some shorts . I was also curious to see if Russell could gets the shorts to me as quickly as I remember receiving the sweats . I do n't know if I remember getting the sweats in three days , because that 's how long it took for my shorts to arrive . I ca n't stress the importance of knowing that , if I might need a pair in graphite , I will get them in lighting time . Sometimes , the shipping time makes all the difference when considering reordering . This is my sixth online order from Russell , and the main reason is the product ; but getting that product so quickly keeps me coming back for more . Thanks , Russell . Great job !
 I ordered Black , Navy and Graphite , all the same size . The Graphite was 50 % polyester & 50 % cotton , and smaller than the others , even though it was the same XL size -LRB- the description says the color Oxford is 58/42 poly/cotton , but Graphite is supposed to be 100 % cotton -RRB- . I returned it and got another Graphite , which was also 50/50 poly/cotton , but it was the right size -LRB- made in El Salvador , whereas the smaller one was made in Pakistan -RRB- . I guess you take your chances on getting the right size and material . Otherwise , these are good , comfortable shorts .
 My mother bought me these shorts when I was 14 years old for tryouts in high school . I wore these shorts repeatedly all the time to all my competition games and running outdoor . I 'm now 22 years old and I still wear them along with two extra shorts I bought from Amazon upon finding out they still sell them.Eight years and they still fit and feel great , except for the fade between these old ones and the new ones I just purchased.I love the material and its so soft , I may as well wear these for the rest of my life and they 'd still feel great !
 Just the right fit , the husband enjoys wearing them , I enjoying buying something that he enjoys wearing . Sized perfectly year after year . Thank .
 Ordered these for my husband after a knee surgery . The size was a little to large , but did not have any problems returning for the correct size . Seems to be good quality fabric , and were comfortable .
 Has pockets -- convenient . I like Russell Athletic Products . I have used them for several years worth of exercise in my quest to fight the battle of the bulge .
 With these shorts , you definitely get your money 's worth . They are extremely comfortable all-cotton shorts that are prefect for relaxing around the house or wearing to bed -LRB- I use them as pajama shorts too -RRB- . Durable enough to machine wash and dry . They come with a drawstring that helps ensure a good fit around the waist . Sure , there are higher quality shorts out there ... but not at this price point .
 I have always liked Russell shorts and sweatpants . These are great . They replaced another pair of Russell shorts that I finally wore out after many years of constant wear .
 These were just ok for the price . Fit was right . Stitching looks good . Nothing great , but no complaints . I would buy again because to shop at Target or Walmart would cost just as much
 I have purchased Russell Athletic shorts before . They are quality products . As with other Amazon purchases , the price is right and the shipping is punctual . The only thing that would improve the shorts would be better / stronger elastic in the waist . If you load up the pockets , they sag a little .
 these shorts are well made and last a really long time . My husband has about 10 pairs and they last for years . Great price , too . would highly recommend .
 These are VERY nice . Not sure what the people are wanting in fabric thickness and quality ... these are great quality and a nice medium fabric perfect for exercise shorts . The pocket is hard to find and very much a welcome addition ! Very comfortable . They do seem to run a bit large ... I read the reviews and got a medium and it fits perfectly . -LRB- Normally take a large -RRB- I 'll buy more . -LRB- I 'd never rate down for a size running smaller or larger in clothing ... that 's common . -RRB- Nancy
 My husband likes the deep pockets and wears these shorts when he exercises at the gym . He has liked the Russell brand for years .
 Seems to me these are sized a tad large . No big deal as you can use the drawstring , but it slips pretty easily under normal shoelace type knot . Material is very light , not bad .
 My husband had a pair of these that had holes everywhere but would n't give them up because they were his favorite shorts -LRB- like and old pair of shoes -RRB- . He likes them because they are soft , comfortable , and do n't fade when washed . They are very durable and wear a long time .
 Exelent product!For all kind of weatherconfortabledurable !! I wear everyday to
 These are nice shorts but sizes run much much much bigger than you 'd expect . I usually wear size large for my gym shorts so I went ahead with a large for these too . Nope . I was swimming in these shorts , I pulled the drawstring as tight as I could and I still felt like they were going to fall down just from walking around . I do n't know if the ones I got were XLs that got mistagged or what -LRB- they were indeed tagged L -RRB- . I like the shorts otherwise and am going to reorder in medium , if you go with these make sure to choose one size smaller than you usually wear or you 'll be spending most of your workout holding your shorts up !
 Good deal . These fit well and the pockets are nice and deep . I would recommend if you are in need of some cheap shorts with pockets .
 I ordered 3 pairs of these . I did not need anything heavy to run in , and I did n't want running shorts that were too short , and these were perfect . Great for running in and working around the house .
 Sized rather on larger size . Originally ordered an x-large and had to downsize to a large . Other than the sizing issues they 're great shorts .
 It is hard to find a pair of shorts with just the right length for my son , but these definitely fit the bill . Easy on the wallet , durable , wash very well , and are comfortable . Highly recommend .
 These were a little rough when first worn but they softened nicely after a few washes . I walk the dog everyday in mosquito infested Houston , this shorts are nice because they let the air flow due to the wide leg and the pockets are nice for the phone and the bag for doggie do !
 They 're NOT sweat pants , they 're shorts made with a thick cotton . I purchased 2 . I love them . I 'll be buying more .
 I love these because they have pockets to hold my music player . I 've been wearing them for years and they tend to last a couple years before wearing . When I got them , however , one of them had a hole in the pocket . That was a first .
 Good price , fast service , and the pair I had before were realy used up . I think they went to the washing machine at least 500 times before it showed some wear and tear . I play basketball and I run . They are good for both .
 I owned a pair of the graphite -LRB- well I think that 's what it started out as -RRB- shorts . The were made in Mexico and were great . So ... I decide to buy 2 of these . One in graphite , the other in black.The graphite is a cotton/polyester blend which makes for a softer , more comfortable feel . The black is 100 % cotton and it 's not a soft cotton.Although the quality is good , I think Russell should go back to what made them a good company in the first place . They should ensure their product -LRB- same model -RRB- is made in the same place and of the same material .
 Quality very good for inexpensice gym clothes , but the shorts are cut large . Instead of XL an L would have been better for my 38 in waist . .
 I love these shorts and have a pair on right now . I will be buying more and soon . bye bye .
 Nice and lightweight . I got the black in a 3X -LRB- I like loose fitting clothes -RRB- . They will be nice for Spring and Summer but rather thin for the colder months . I do wish the inner drawsting was 2 ties that you could tie together like shoelaces instead of a loop . I would purchase these again . The Soffee brand was heavier -LRB- and pretty good all around -RRB- but , could not get it in a 3 X. Really should just loose the weight !!!
 Great product especially for the price . The quality of the shorts was better than expected . . Arrived as promised too . Overall experience 5 stars !!!
 I wait a while to review clothing items . This was bought several months ago and worn several times.I look for good fit , waist band that does not pinch the heck out of my belly and lasts through wear and tear . This pair of pants hit all the marks very well . Good job.I like Russell , and bought several other Russell items . Will look for their products again
 Have purchased this brand before so it was no surprise in what I was getting . Fit , feel and price were all good .
 These shorts are a great value and quality . Great service thanks and would like to order . More pairs in different . Colors
 I ordered XXL and they are HUGE !!! I 'm wondering if I should have ordered XL . They have been shrinking when I wash them and run them through the dryer , so they 're getting closer to the right size . I love the way these shorts are made -- soft , sturdy cotton , side pockets , and with the covered waist band elastic . This is my favorite style !
 I 've seldom ordered a product that was far too large as these are . They are marked the size I ordered but could easily fit someone several sizes larger . Whether this applies through all sizes or whether I simply received an `` accident '' I can not know . In all other ways they 're the usual quality for which Russell is justly known .
 These shorts were almost exactly what I was looking for ; however , they were not as thick material as I was expecting . I had purchased a pair of shorts like these before at a store -- same brand , size , color -- these were n't as thick as those ones . Otherwise , they are good for working out , do n't shrink in the wash , and have pockets .
 This is a quality pair of gym shorts which will stand the test of time . They are sturdy , comfortable , and almost exactly what you would expect . I am very pleased with the product , and will be ordering more .
 Wear them all the time . Lightweight , cool , comfortable and very flexible . These are a bit longer in the leg which really suits today 's style . Will be buying more .
 These Russell shorts are the best ever . I wear them everyday and everywhere . They are so comfortable and do not make you feel hot like other shorts do . They remind me of the gym shorts that I wore in high school . I highly recommend them as I already have six of them . I have them all in graphite color . I hope Russell keeps on making these high quality shorts because they are the only ones that I will wear .
 Bought these for a guy who only wears 100 % cotton shorts . He says `` they do the job '' but wishes they were a bit longer -LRB- he 's 6 ' 5 '' -RRB- .
 I ordered these for my husband 's work outs . I found that I like wearing them too . Great product , comfortable fit
 the shorts were well made the fact that they made pockets was the selling points , well worth the money , would definately tell someone ofd the good deal for the money
 My daughter rides 2-3 horses daily , year-round , and I ride as much as possible . We both have had several pair of these Tuff Rider Ribb breeches , and they last forever ! No special washing/drying needed , which as horse women we do n't have time to mess with . The fabric does not attract dirt and hay as some other fabrics do . I especially like the zipper pocket - perfect size for horse treats or my cell phone .
 These breeches are super comfy and they last FOREVER ! They do n't need any special care which is a plus when you work with horses everyday . They 're great for schooling , but are nice enough for the show ring .
 I received the ribbed TuffRider breech in the mail today . The fit is very comfortable and flattering , if you like a waist high rise . Was n't sure if I would be okay with the deep purple , and , as it is actually not a deep purple , but in actuality more of a medium blue purple with periwinkle colored knee patches , it may not be for everyone , especially if you are color-shy . But I like the color and the comfort , so am keeping the breeches . The front zip clasp has a somewhat finicky closure , but once you get the hang of it , it 's fine . Very stretch , non-binding , so if you are true to size , it should be quite comfortable . They seem to be fairly light weight , so I plan to use them in the peak of summer heat . These are a colorful keeper .
 These pants are awesome . Size is great and extremely comfortable . The color is n't Taupe , however . It 's more like a Tan or Camel . Other than that , they are terrific and especially considering the price . Extremely well-made . I will definitely purchase again .
 Comfortable . I bought these for casual wear . They look great with boots and a shirt . They do finish at the ankle -LRB- regular length -RRB- . I would buy other colors in this style .
 I really love the way these breeches fit , they look great and with a pair of riding boots . i would reccommend
 The pants fit really nice even after giving birth to my baby I tried these pants on 6 weeks later and they still has a nice fit . The only thing I did not like are the logos on the inside of the knee patch . Had I saw that prior to me purchasing them I would not have bought them . I personally do not like the logo of people 's companies on my clothes

 My grandson Tanner is a BIG lover of the Cubs ... so he 's very happy with all the decals and logos that are on his wall ... good quality and price . .
 The decal I purchased was a heavy , good quality with true colors that have not faded . Good size and easy to apply.Go Cubs!Jennifer Slater , author -LSB- ... -RSB- Silver Lining
 I received this with in days of when I ordered it . It was exactly what I ordered and I love it !
 I got this as a gift . My son loves it . He hugged it for about 10 mintues because to him it WAS Superman . We filled the bottom with water since we did n't have sand , and have n't had any problems with it .
 Really nice watch . very pleased with the feel of it . very light compared to a metal band watch . and very tough . it is very bright and easy to read during day and at night . love how the dial markers do n't need a charge and just always work . only con with the watch is i had some condensation forming inside of the watch face . owned it for a few weeks now and super cold temps have hit my area , noticed the condensation when i was working outside . unscrewed the back and let it sit in my apt for couple hours where it was about 30 % humidity . no further problems . would recommend to anyone where you need a tough timepiece that you can read the time at any given point .
 I bought this to replace the same watch . Only reason I 'm replacing is cosmetic . The last one I have still works . I worked in the construction trades and bashed and scratched and tore the band off the watch while passing through doorways etc. . This is a watch you can WEAR WHILE WORKING and not worry about whether it will hold up . When the band breaks it 's easily replaced . Luminox also has a longer battery life than Swiss Army and has a gasket seal . The Swiss Army watches tend to fog from condensation after a battery change because they have no gasket . Overall this watch can take a pounding and still keep time .
 Very fast shipping and a high quality watch at a discount price ! I am very pleased with the quality and look of the luminox watch .
 Great watch . Exactly what I was looking for . Highly recommended . Glow in the dark feature is a good as advertised .
 I am very pleased with this purchase . Every one I show it to wants one and they know exactly what it is .
 the watch has a simple design , tough and durable . the luminated hands are an absolute must have for my paramedic son , he loves it
 This watch is bulletproof &#8211; and except for replacing the watchband pins , has been flawless in operation for more than three years . My son loves it wears every day . Should 've bought one for myself .
 this is the most awsome watch i 've ever owned . VERY easy to see at night . not just in darkness but also in low light lumination . the hands and numerals are that bright . the white face stands out and is very easy to read . others reviewers have commented about the band breaking after awhile . I solved that problem by making a paracord band as soon as i got the watch out of the box . it looks nice .
 I 've had the Luminox Men 's 30007 watch for about 3 weeks now and have been impressed at how accurate the reviews were regarding this watch in regards to its lumination in the low light visibility or no light at all . The crystal face has taken the outdoors well considering I 've brushed it against bricks while installing a patio in the backyard . I purchased this watch for the very fact that its illumination system does not use battery power to function but its own gas enclosed system . I had a $ 15.00 Casio watch that went into various regions of the world with me during my time in the service and it served me well . However ; in low light situations or a night time environment where you need to keep your hands on more critical task , it is good to know that this tough and light weight watch will display the time without the need for pushing a button .
 ThisLuminox Men 's 3007 Original Navy SEAL Dive Watcharrived quicker than expected and is exactly as advertised . I 'm not sure how Luminox describes its models , but I had aLuminox Men 's 3051 EVO Navy SEAL Colormark Watchpreviously that I understood was the genuine Navy Seals dive watch . Perhaps the 3007 is the ** original ** version . The 3051 is a bit bigger , better looking -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- but a bit more expensive . While the 3007 is a good watch , well built , accurate , waterproof and attractive , I think I 'd choose to spend a few dollars more to get the 3051 now that I 've seen them both in the flesh .
 What made me give this 5 stars was the price comparison . For the money this watch is good quality & carries the tritium dial which is a nice if not essential touch . It 's far brighter than the now extinct radium dials.The case and strap give every impression of being durable although I 'm not about to bash it around to find out . The general finish is good and the watch is comfortable to wear.The white face against the black moulded case looks very good in my opinion . I mention this only because it 's difficult to tell from the pictures on the web whether it 'll look good in real life , but I think that it does.I agree with the opinion of the other reviewer about the strap not being worth the money they were asking for replacement . The strap is good enough but not exactly special unless you 're fanatical about having the Luminox stamp on the buckle . The practice of limiting the warranty to exclude the strap is a little poor , but I suspect widespread and not specific to Luminox.One final niggle . If you examine the dial really -LRB- and I mean really -RRB- closely then you see that the second hand is n't absolutely and perfectly aligned with every second marker on the face . But you 'd need to have a serious OCD problem to worry about this on a watch of this price.Altogether very happy . Good price . Nice watch . Attractive tritium dial .
 I did a lot of comparison shopping for a sporty yet classy watch with a bezel , and it came down to Swiss Army vs. Luminox . My decision was made when I found this watch on sale for almost $ 100 dollars less than list price -LRB- thanks , Amazon ! -RRB- and well below the cost of the Swiss Army watches I was looking at . Some people complain about the rubber wristband , but I like it . I 'm sure it will break sooner or later , but no biggie . More importantly , the watch face itself is classy and easy to read . And it really is bright in the dark ! I love the fact that you do n't have to press a button to illuminate it . The bezel was a bit tough to rotate at first , but it 's loosened up a bit since I first got it . It may not be as prestigious as a metal band watch , but it suits me just fine .
 I have had this watch now for about three years and it is still seemingly bulletproof . I have , however , had to replace the band because it started to rip and would not remain on my wrist . The ruberized band itself lasted about 2 years which is good considering the a salesman for luminox said they normally only last a year . And in those two years , I barely took this thing off ; not in the shower , pool , gym , or for work around the house ; this watch is a quality time peice . The nylon band may last longer , but velcro does not work well if wet and in cold conditions ; the velcro becomes useless . The rubber band is also very comfortable . The housing and transparent shield will , inevitably , get scuffed up , but I have really abused this watch at times . Never do these scuffs mess with the ability to read the watch.It is really nice to have the day of the month as well , but this does not illuminate . But , this watch lights up so bright at night you can actually use it to read something if you really had to in pitch darkness . I have walked down a dark hallway at my house and this watch gave off a green aura that lit the way for me to see . It is also going to be a great watch for divers if it is not taken below 200 meters , which is a long way anyway . The rotating bezel allows you to set your time for oxygen or to time yourself at the gym like I do . The 60 second mark on the rotating bezel is also illuminated by tritium to find it easily . It has a lot of versatility for a simple design.Luminox uses swiss quartz and the face has 12 and 24 hour time markings , adhereing to its military roots . The blackened stainless steel caseback has the Navy SEAL emblem laser etched , along with Swiss Made , adding to the coolness factor of the watch . However , I wish the little screws used to hold the caseback in place were also blackened as they do rust from the corrosive sweat you give off . My other issue with the watch is the second hands dont quite match up with the tick makes on the face . This , to me , is very trivial but it may bother some people . This watch is very easy to change to time and date if needed with the pinwheel on the side . Over the 3 years I have used it , it has never fell behind or sped up time , it always keeps accurate time.Also , this is a super lightweight and comfortable watch you will forget you have on you unil you need it . I used to frequently wear my father 's Omega Seamaster -LRB- James Bond Watch -RRB- and the thing was just too heavy and it would cut into my hand . My Fossil watch does the same thing . This watch wo n't pull the hair out of your arms or cause discomfort in heavy use.This is my favorite watch and is the best I have ever owned . For the money , you get a great timepiece that will last a very long time . I highly recommend this watch to people like me who tend to unintentionally abuse things . A watch is an invaluable item to have on you and this is my watch of choice .
 I purchased this watch from Amazon about 3 years ago . I wore this watch all through Basic Military Training and Tech School and have n't had any problems . The crystal is strong and the face is nice and bright . Great for Entry Control during dark hours because you do n't have to take your hands off your weapon to check the time , there are no buttons to press ! While the rubber watch band did break at the 3 year mark , it was only after I got the watch caught on a piece of equipment . I bought a 22mm NATO watchband for $ 16 bucks and it looks great and will never break .
 Overall I am very pleased with my 3007 Luminox , and it has served me well for the past three years.PROs-The lume is very good-Bezel turns with ease-Battery is still going strong-White face edition -LRB- 3007 -RRB- is pretty cool in my opinionCONs-Strap needed to be replaced after the third year.While the strap did break earlier than I would have liked , I also really beat up on the watch , and am almost suprised it lasted this long .
 Some watches require two hands to see the time at night , one for the watch and one for the button . This watch is easily visible at night . It is also waterproof so I can wear it swimming or in the shower . I have always had one of these watches with a black face , and this one has a white one . The black numbers contrast well , and I think it is easier to see in the daylight than the watch with the black face . However , where Luminox watches are vastly superior to other watches are in that period of time where it is not fully dark . The black face works better there . I took off a half star for that.I am allergic to some kinds of metal . This is another good reason to choose this watch . The four very tiny screws on the back almost never give me trouble . The band is rubber , and it is stiff enough that the buckle is never in contact with my wrist for extended periods . When that band gives out , there are silicone ones on the market that work well too.The battery in these watches lasts for years . When I replaced the one in my last watch , I ruined the waterproof aspect . Since I kept forgetting and wearing it in the shower , it got moisture in it . Open it up and use a hair drier on it . Do n't do as I did in haste after a couple of times and set it on top of the toaster oven . It will melt . Apparently one is supposed to send the watch somewhere to get a battery replacement and `` pressurization '' to retain the waterproof feature . That service is less than $ 40 which is cheaper than having to buy a new watch . That aspect lost it the other half star .
 Very comfortable and despite the hefty look it is very light weight . Hands are easy to read both during the day and especially at night . I 'm so happy to have found this product line , I 've found the watch company who will have my business for life . My only minor gripe is the date is pretty small and hard to read . I have had several comments on the watch and do n't hesitate to recommend to anyone interested in trying the Luminox line .
 the watch is what was advertized.It is really light and I am nit sure if i is strictly the carbon fiber construction and design or ... Keeps great time and stays visible under all conditions . I did see on the Luminox site that one should be cautious when purchasing from anyone not an authorized Luminox dealer.I guess only time will tell . no pun intended .
 I read several reviews from other people that said this watch sucked . I beg to differ . I love this one ! It 's not too large on the wrist , and the illuminated dial and hands are great . The lights are not too bright so that it hurts the eyes or distracts you . Now granted , I have n't went diving into deep water , or beat it all to hell like a Navy SEAL might . But it 's a really nice watch . I recommend it .
 Quick and easy purchase . Ordered the wrong item and was able to change my order with no issues ! Great shopping experience .
 I may have reviewed this once before , but it 's worth stating again
 The only way to make this better would be to have a carved wooden handle . The plastic handle will wear down over time but the rest of the unit is solid and pretty hard to break . Consistently fires true , decent range of 10 to 15 meters , more with arc .
 Well made , durable , affordable and effective . Great device for many applications from survival to self defense . The classification of `` toy '' my be a stretch ... no pun intended . Add a .38 caliber steel ball and you have one silent but fearsome friend that really packs a punch .
 I ordered one for my husband to shoot the neighbor 's dog in the butt when it barks at 3am . We tried calling the police but they did nothing . We talked to the neighbor but she did n't hear it . It was a last resort after it woke the baby several times . It worked like a charm . No gunshot to scare and wake neighbors . No injury to the animal . AND it really lightens the mood when you are SO mad to be awake at 3am because of a nuisance dog . The dog only barked once a few nights later , and after it got another 38 caliber ball to its bottom , we have n't heard it since ! ;-RRB- This slingshot is a great price for what you get ! It is pretty accurate , and lasts . We 've had ours for more than a year . It 's been shot several times . We even decided since we were hard up for cash last Christmas to buy one for each of our nieces and nephews -LRB- with parent permission ! -RRB- . Everyone has enjoyed them , and no one has had an issue . You can shoot steel balls , marbles , or paintballs with them -LRB- rocks may tear the leather -RRB- .
 Title says it all . I have had a ton of fun using this product . Recently , I have been shooting grapes at other kids on campus from my dorm room window . It is pretty powerful . It took a bit of getting used to but after having used it for awhile I feel decently accurate with it . One thing to note is that this is not a folding slingshot . Because of this , it does take up more space when stored away , but I there are also less parts that will break . All around , great slingshot , very cheap , very fun . Worth every penny .
 I bought this for my nephew who is thirteen . It hasnt broken and works great . As long as the child you are getting it for is responsible with it , then i would recommend it for any age .
 This slingshot is a very solid design , 1 bent piece of aluminum with plastic hand grip , not much that can go wrong , and at only 4 oz , it still packs okay despite its non foldingness . . I was looking for a fixed position model for the durability it would have over a folding model , and I 'm not sure what you would have to be doing to break this thing , but definitely not shooting with it -LRB- which is a total blast -RRB- . For the price , you ca n't go wrong . I would recommend to a friend .
 Shoots pretty hard but not that far . My brother and I play with it often in the back yard . We dont pull it back to our face but across our chest because we dont have safety glasses yet . If you use this be safe and dont hurt yourselves .
 I needed this to shoot a line up in a tree and it did an excellent job with that . This is not a toy ! you can do serious damage shooting something like a marble with it .
 Been a wrist rocket shooter from an early age . I have yet to use this particular slingshot , but it its the exact same style I used as a kid -LRB- I 'm 49 lol . -RRB- I can hit a bird in a tree or kill skunks as I 've had to use it before . A little practice , a little patience and anyone could . Lots of fun , just watch for richoshays . In my youth with the same type of wrist rocket I could hit frogs between the eyes from 20 yds no problem . Not an indiscrimate kill everything type shooter , just getting rid of pests .
 The perfect little slingshot . I needed a sling shot to shoot some fishing line tied to a 3-oz bolt/nut over a limb about 60 feet high . This slingshot was very accurate and I could shoot the nut consistently thru a small opening 60 feet high . Great slingshot for probably any application . Sturdy and looks durable and long-lasting .
 I was wanting a sligshot , something easy to use , sturdy , compact , yet powerful , this does the trick for super cheap . awesome !
 Slingshot is of very good quality , bands are durable , leather is thick , aluminum is strong . shoots very well , powerful , heavier bands are available for even more power .
 I was so delighted to find that this slingshot is still around . My husband had one as a child and we wanted to purchase some for our grandchildren . The slingshot is well made and was just as described . Great purchase .
 This is everything a slingshot should be . All it requires is an accomplished -LRB- i.e. , accurate -RRB- user , which probably comes with practice . So far , the squirrels have nothing to fear from my random shots .
 A gift for my boyfriend &#8212; he was ecstatic ! Great distance , easy to use , good quality . Would definitely recommend this product !
 My husband and I got this so we could shoot peanuts are the woodpeckers destroying our house without hurting the woodpeckers . The first time we each used it to shoot a peanut -LRB- in the shell so much more difficult -RRB- , we were right on target . As we have never used a slingshot before and are &#34; Seniors &#34; , I would say this is an amazing product . Of course , we have not had any woodpeckers since we got it ; - -RRB-
 We purchased 2 of these for our boys and they were so excited . We took them out to a lake with a stony beach so that they could shoot into the water for practice . They loved it !
 This slingshot was exactly what I needed ! I used it to shoot my washers into the trees , so I could hang my snowflakes at Christmas time . In fact I could not get it away from my husband , he insisted on helping me this year , so this slingshot was exactly what I needed !!!
 I bought this in order to have some low cost fun `` plinking '' at cans , bottles and random targets out in the yard and when I 'm in the hills . I was very pleased with the cost , quality and performance of this slingshot . Best of all , I 'm having a lot of fun with it , as are my wife and children . We are having so much fun in fact that I plan on getting a couple more so we can stop trading off when were out shooting at targets.There is not a whole lot more to say , since the basics of this product are pretty plain . It 's powerful and well constructed and a great value for the money .
 So ... i received this slingshot for my birthday and it has been the best present i have gotten in years . No more stupid socks and ties ... just pure fun ! We live in fairly wooded area with lots of things to shoot at ! And the trees lining the house behind us have gotten abused . The neighbor wasnt happy . Why am i telling you this ? The house behind us is over an acre away and my girlfriend dared me to hit the trees there . I nailed everything i aimed for making this the most accurate slingshot i have ever used . Plus its very powerful ! So , if you are in the market for a slingshot i highly recommend this product ... by the way ... I am a 39 year old kid who still makes motorcycle noises and skateboards and plays drums in a metal band ! Never grow up !
 The design for this particular slingshot has been around for years . I had one as a kid and recently bought this one . Frankly , it 's a far better design than any of the other slingshots I 've used -- and you can pull it back farther than others with shorter rubber tubing . -LRB- I 'd recommend safety glasses when shooting any slingshot -- to avoid eye injury if the rubber snaps -RRB- . If you 're looking for a fully functional , ergonomically-built `` works as designed '' slingshot this one of for you.The only con I think of is that the pad that protects your wrist is a bit thin , so if you 're shooting a lot -- you 'll have to develop some toughness on your wrist . But honestly , this is a better design than the fancier-looking designs out there .
 This fires true every time . Great for scaring away seagulls . I do n't hurt the birds , i just load a small green tomato in it and fire over their heads , but they get the message . Now I do n't have to clean up all the seagull dung on my docks .
 This summer I took my nephews to a cabin for a week and brought with me my wrist rocket from 40 years ago and a new one for each of the boys . We used rocks from the beach and shot at cans hung from a line 30ft away . It 's not that accurate , as the kids had to get within 15 ft to hit the cans but , we had a lot of fun . Plus we were n't using the official ball bearing ammo which is better than a rock as being uneven rocks tend to veer . But hey , rocks are free.The kids all loved them and spent the week getting much better at it , both in picking a better shaped rock and in aiming.My wrist rocket needed a new band as the rubber had rotted but it 's nearly the same design as the new ones . While these do n't fold so they are harder to carry around , having only the bands to break , they are easily repaired and last a long time . What other toy is still as good as new 40 years later?Recommendation
 I wanted a low power device to play with and this slingshot worked super well . For my demand , it was accurate enuf and could be controlled well enuf to give me my desired target acquisition . Does make a whopping sound when one releases the sling so your presence is revealed .
 The Wrist-rocket has been around for decades now , but no one has yet improved on it . It 's cheap . It 's powerful . What more could you want ?
 This is a great slingshot . It shoots well , and is a ton of fun to play with.Its ' a great deal for this low price ... Highly Recommended !
 I just got this sling shot and took it out back to shoot some pebbles . I was able to hit the tree I was aiming at at about 25 yds 9 out of 10 times . I was really testing more for power rather than accuracy . Seems powerful enough . I also own a Daisy and Marksman that were in the same price range as this and this is certainly comparable . The replacement bands are inexpensive also.I saw that this got a few poor reviews . Hey , its less than $ 10 and the vendor shipped very quickly . It 's not meant to be a Mini-14 assault rifle ! I like it and for cheap , backyard plinking and scaring the squirrels its just fine !
 The Trumark Slingshot is everything great I remember about the original wrist rocket.This must have slingshot is lightweight , smooth , easy to pull and accurate . The split leather pouch is comfortable and holds the shot well . It 's aircraft aluminum frame makes the Trumark super easy to handle . It never feels bulky or awkward . The pull is smooth and even and the ammo exits cleanly with no hangups.Instead of using the steel shot , I use small river rocks I get from the big box store in bags . The River rocks are smooth and semi round , not crushed and you get thousands of rounds . It 's also a more natural material in your garden instead of the steel shot . The Trumark Slingshot handles this form of ammo perfectly.I highly recommend this awesome little slingshot .
 Item works pretty well . Takes a little to get used to the wrist stabilizer and the slight sideways angle that seems to be needed to aim the slingshot .
 I had one when I was a kid . now my son has one too . In fact I bought another so me and him can play together . I think it cost more 35 years ago when I had my first slingshot . Great . Value . Absolutely fun .
 this sling shot is a lot of fun . its simple design makes it so much fun . marbles are the best projectile for it .
 I have a folding slingshot . It works good but hard for my arm and the top v was not large . would break paint balls on the v. I grew up using the standard non folding alingshot so i fond one and purchased . My kids fit the folding one they use that one . We have fun and now I can shoor with better aim and further , also not breaking paint balls on v any more . Thanks
 Rabbits have been eating my garden and since this is a residential neighborhood , guns are n't exactly aloud for this sort of thing . So , I purchased this sling shot off Amazon.com for 15 bucks . I tried over and over again to kill these freakin rabbits but with no luck . Finally after my 5th or 6th rabbit I connected for a kill shot to the head . I went on the gut and eat it . The meat was a little tuff .
 I have an enormous pecan tree in my backyard . Every Fall , it drops thousands of pecans in my yard . I got this slingshot to have a little fun launching them at things when I had some free time.The slingshot is n't anything fancy . But what do you expect for under $ 10 ? The handle is made of a flexible plastic , and the forearm pad is a simple piece of high density rubberized foam . The slingshot shoe can be stretched a good 3 feet from the fork . It even comes with a nice soft genuine leather slingshot shoe . There 's nothing to it
 For those that have compalints this is a tested design and has been around for awhile . I had one of these when i was a kid and used to have a lot fo fun with it then in my early teens i had an older friend that told me these where great for hunting small game . One thing my friend taught me about these to increaes the accuracy and make them a little more powerful for hunting was you need to shorten the bands a bit how much is trial and error for each individual . I have killed rabbits by the dozens with this exact slingshot and this will always have a place in my backpack .
 My 8 year old and I are happy with this device -LRB- I highly recommend parental supervision with a slingshot -RRB- . We have been shooting .50 cal paint balls that we found on clearance for a penny each but will switch to cheap dog food ammo when the paint balls are gone . The quality is better than what I expected from a < $ 7 product .
 An extremely good product . for the price you can not get anything better , it also has the best bands you can buy for a slingshot and the folding arm brace makes it very compact . i have had mine for three or more years and only just recently had to replace the bands , but could have gone longer without replacement . -LRB- If you ever decide to upgrade your slingshot be sure to buy Trumark bands because it is the only brand i have found with a real leather pouch -RRB-
 For the price , this is a great little instrument . With no training or practice , I was surprised how accurately I could shoot . My shots would probably be even more accurate if I was using proper ammo , but for the sake of not littering the landscape with unnecessary steel balls , I decided to shoot dried chickpeas instead . They may not have the impact or accuracy of steel , but if all you want to do is scare away certain pests , they work fine !
 I used to borrow my best friend 's sling shot when we were kids . I could n't have one of my own then . We used to have a blast shooting cans and targets , and at the crawdad mud mounds . Oh the memories . I plan to purchase some steel shot as well and glass eye marbles . Both seemed to work well in the past . As usual Amazon Prime shipping is fantastic . Be careful though when opening the box for this item . Mine was positioned so that the rubber rubing was near the top of the box where it meets in the middle secured by tape . I used a knife to open the box , thankfully and barely , missing the rubber tubing or I might have sliced through it . The item was in the box as pictured , secured with air packaging . Ca n't wait to get outdoors and give this thing a test . Some of the other slingshots just do n't make sense to me . This one is basic , lot 's of fun , get 's the job done .
 I ordered this item not expecting much but I got much more out of it . It arrived very fast and the sling shot is just great . Right out of the box it 's ready to fire . It is very accurate with even rocks . Great product and a great price .
 this item shoots straight with no sting from the band coming back . it is a good purchase . dealing with amazon is always a pleasure
 I purchased 3 slingshots for the men/boys in my family to play around in the yard -LRB- we have a large , fenced back yard -RRB- for Christmas . We set up a target -LRB- aka cardboard box with a goofy face and body drawn on it . -RRB- These worked great . We had a lot of fun . I am no expert on how true the aim was but we liked playing and just used little rocks . My 5 yo boy was not able to get the hang of it yet but everyone else did . I loved it as a good hiking/camping toy to bring along . I would recommend supervision or at least setting up some rules if the youngsters are going to use it since the rocks do travel pretty far and could injure someone on the wrong end .
 Pigeons.I bought this item for the sole purpose of terrorizing the feathered population of winged rats that have been harassing my house for over five years . I 've had experience with a slingshot just like this one as a kid , but we called them wrist rockets , and it holds up to their name because with a good aim and the right pull , yea , you 'll send whatever it is you want rocketing out towards whatever you want it to hit ; and the aim is not too bad on one of these!No need for ammo here , I live in Arizona which means there 's plenty of gravel , rocks and such -LRB- my front yard for instance -RRB- for ammo to be found . As soon as I got it in the mail , I peeled it out of its simple cardboard sleeve , put on some shoes and headed outside to reap vengeance and reclaim my household . Just for theatrics I should 've played Wagner 's `` Ride of the Valkyries '' from my car stereo as I took a fistful of stones into my hand and started pegging pigeons one after the other off of my roof . Pure , controlled chaos as the damn things took off ! Oh trust me they tried to get away or hide but I know a thing or two about `` bullet drop '' and was able to scare or hit every single winged rat off of my property.This dangerously simple device does it job and does it job well
 I love this slingshot . If you practice with it , it can be very accurate and rewarding . It feels solid and comfortable , especially with full draws .
 Very easy to use . Accuracy is very good with a little prctice . Great price
 Great mix of quality and simplicity . Got one for my husband and son , they were excited to try them out and worked like a charm .
 My 7 year old son loved this slingshot . Great quality for the price . This slingshot takes my son away from the electronic games and brings him outdoors . He even enjoys hiking now and always brings this slingshot with him .
 decent slingshot for the price . not 100 % comfortable , but then what is ? Good sales and service experience , would recommend product .
 Great little slingshot . Nothing bad to say about this one ! I purchased it to shoot fishing line into a tree to pull up heavier rope for limb removal .
 this sling shot is awesome ! it is EXTREMELY ACCURATE !!!!!!!!!! unlike the other reviews said . yes , they curve , when they 've gone about 120 FEET !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a good shot with a good acorn or rock will yield a 30 ft can hit . p.s. , if yours dose n't hit a can from 30 feet , you need to practice more . and , if it dose n't live up to youre expectation , this is the top of the line , so do n't get another brand like marksman , because my friend had a marksman and it was n't half as accurate , not as powerful , and his bands broke 3 times . mine broke 0 times .
 Overall , the slingshot is very good in all ways . It has a very long range and is very accurate . The handle is great and the thing that goes over your wrist really helps steady your shot . It is easy to pull back and shoot , and it is very powerful . The only thing that could be an issue is that sometimes when you shoot , it can hit your fingers and cause momentary pain . But this is very rare and does not occur with most objects you shoot . But for anyone looking to buy a simple , powerful , easy to use slingshot , I would highly recommend this product .
 I test fired it once and it penetrated inside the can . I would consider people to buy this because is powerful like a bb gun . I used it for target practice only .
 I bought this because my Marksman folding version failed . It is a very good slingshot , but I miss the folding capability of the Marksman . Also , the Marksman has a flat vinyl strap that bears on the wrist , which is more comfortable for long sessions than the rubber padded steel on this one.I ended up using the vastly superior Trumark bands on the Marksman folder , and now have the best of both worlds .
 This is much better than the last two slings shots I bought off amazon , which were terrible because of the horrid position of the arm thingy . I was keeping this thing on a nearby shelf , and then started noticing this gross stench similar to baby or dog poop . It was giving me a headache after a long while and eventually I had to put it outside . So , if your wondering where some nasty stench is coming from all the sudden , now u have a new possibility of a source . I did n't test the slingshot yet .
 Slingshots are cool . This one has an excellent design , since you can slip your hand through it and brace the rubber pad solidly against your forearm to provide stability when pulling the sling back . This also makes it much easier to aim and gives you greater range . I use mine to shoot at squirrels and deer coming into my yard and causing damage - though I do n't get too many shots off at the deer because a -RRB- they usually only come out a night and b -RRB- they bolt the second they hear anything amiss , like me sliding the door to my deck open . The squirrels are a different story though . They think once they are up in a tree they 're safe , so they tend to sit there , just daring me to do something about it . It only takes me whizzing a few ball bearings or marbles in their direction to get them off and running as fast as their little rodent legs can carry them.I 'm not a very good shot , probably having hit my intended target at 25 yards -LRB- or so -RRB- maybe once or twice out of a couple of hundred shots . I suppose with practice I 'd get better , but I 'm not that worried about it . At that range , you 're not talking about a lethal shot , which is n't my intent anyway . I just want to scare them off , even though I know they 'll be back a few minutes later . Why this is entertaining to me , I do n't know , it just is . I suppose I could just let the dog stay out in the yard more to take care of deer and squirrel duty , but she lacks opposable thumbs and does n't understand the concept of slingshots either , so she 's not going to have as much fun as me.I have n't tried shooting small rocks yet , out of concern that the rocks might eventually damage the sling , but now that I 'm running out of the ball bearings and marbles I originally bought with the wrist rocket , I 'll probably start doing that anyway . I had a bumper crop of acorns this year too , so maybe I 'll give them a try as well . In any case , it looks like you can buy a replacement sling or two , or for that matter , at eight dollars a pop , I could probably just get another wrist rocket if I really needed to.All in all a nice little sling shot to give to your kid or play with yourself .
 This is the safe way to discourage deer from eating tulips and everyflower in your gardens by using small stones as ammo .
 I bought this slingshot to install a long wire amateur radio antenna between two trees at about 50 feet above the ground . I used a 2 ounce lead fishing weight attached to an old fishing rod and reel . This little jewel easily launched the heavy weight right where I wanted it , albeit after a couple of poor aiming attempts . If you 're trying to go higher , drop the weight down a bit.If you 're looking to do what I did , do n't waste you money on those all-in-one slingshot/reel combos that are made for this purpose . If you do n't have an old rod and reel with lighter fishing line , buy a real cheap one here or go to your local Walmart , etc. and you are ready to go . There 's also no magic about the 2 ounce weight that I used , but you 'll want to select something that 's heavy enough to drop to the ground and wo n't get hung up in the branches.BTW - do n't forget to wear approved safety eye protection when using a device like this ! 73 and catch you on the air .
 We have a squirrel problem here in the city and I bought this to shoot ice cubes at them to drive them off and away from my wife 's bird feeder . It has a lot of power ! I am not an excellent shot but did hit several in the head and it killed them . I found out that my state had recently outlawed all wrist mounted slingshots , so mine now sits on a shelf . It is a good one though and if your state has n't outlawed them , it would be great to have one for quiet kills . It 's well made too !
 I purchased the Trumark WS-1 Slingshot to aid in keeping `` wild boars '' out of my property . The Trumark WS-1 Slingshot is well made , sturdy and accurate . I 'm hitting targets up to 100 yards away . It 's range is listed at 225 yards . The natural feel of the WS-1 is comfortable in either hand and shooting position . The normal power bands are performing well . The WS-1 is large with the fixed wrist brace and is not made for concealment . A good buy for the price .
 It 's a basic sling shot . Good power and accuracy . The leather shot holder is very soft . The handle grip and wrist pads are el cheapo rubber tube , but work . I suppose that it fits the price . Waiting to shoot my first rat .
 I got this thing in the mail today and it works great . I 'm 37 and believe that you are never too old to enjoy simple things . My son and I were out shooting at home made targets and we had a blast . This thing works great and is fairly priced . I hope it holds up for several uses . So far so good !
 ... in the hands of someone who 's got decent aim . I tried for a solid 15 minutes to hit a gallon milk jug 15 feet away . Have you ever read the `` Clan of the Cave Bear '' books ? -LRB- Yes , I know , that 's a sling , and this is a slingshot . Shhh . -RRB- If Ayla 's on one end of the sling/slingshot spectrum , I 'm on the other . Still , except for the part where I have to wander the backyard , grubbing for rocks -LRB- why do we have no rocks in the backyard ? -RRB- , this is a super fun ... toy ? Piece of sporting equipment ? Gadget ? Whatever . I 'm probably not ever going to be bringing down a brace of ptarmigan with it , but someday , I am going to kill that milk jug DEAD .
 For the price you really cant beat it , it shoots pretty darn good too ... be a great weapon against pesky rodents ... Ive seen others that were twice as much and didnt deliver as well ... great with small metal balls
 I bought the gun about a year ago and it still works . its a good gun and shoots fast id say buy it
 i got it in the mail 2day and it worked fine . got it from hobbytron for 15 bucks and i love it . . the only thing wrong with it is that the barrel is bent and it screws up the acuracy . good gun i recomend it if you are having little wars with your buddies.the laser sight is AWSOME !!!!! and the scope is just a plastic tube with crosshairs
 These chips are the best for the price . Feel like pro chips at a fraction of the price . The case is somewhat flimsy but has held together over multiple trips to my friends house for poker night . The cards that come with it are poor quality but that really does n't matter .
 It was just as told !! I really love it and very simple to use . Has given me no trouble . i would tell all of my friends to buy , it ; s great !
 Accurate and an important part of my routine , it calculates everything I need to account for my work out . It works with both gym 's I work out in equipment I use ; from elliptical to the stair master . It is calibrated for use with my body weight index , and heart rate and it gives me the greatest accuracy for my work out . I highly recommend anyone who both works out in the gym and jogging . I do not have the foot accessory for this , but will invest in it later on .
 This watch is working very well for me . I really like looking at my statistics after a workout . There is a lot of information available through this watch , but it is not complicated to understand or navigate . I wish that Polar offered a female-sized version of this watch ; it 's a bit chunky for a female wrist .
 I 've had my watch for about a month now and I love it . I had a little trouble getting my personal sport zones in it because this is my first watch but my trainer was able to do it without a problem . In fact , the trainer liked it so much that the gym is now planning to sell this watch . The rest of the set up was very easy . I love that I can personalize it to display the info that I want to keep track of during my workout . I would definately recommend this watch .
 this product allows you to accurately measure your heart rate and is great for receiving quick , needed , health advice .
 I was recommended this device by my instructor at a local fitness center . Though he was trying to peddle me the ware sold by that center , I found this on Amazon for about $ 40 cheaper . This is an awesome device , and very compact . Though I have been a user for only a month , I find its capability , user design and benefit quite high . The online interface , and especially the method to synch data -LRB- sonic sync - or transferring data by converting it into sound signals and then using the computer 's microphone to listen to the device and interpret the data -RRB- is pretty awesome - in fact I have not seen this in any -LRB- in my experience -RRB- other human-computer interface - except R2D2 perhaps . The data transfer can be a bit buggy since ambient noise can influence the signal , but overall - pretty cool!I like the fact that I can program my exercise zones in and then use my instructor defined program completely to ensure a complete workout.The only thing I miss is a bicycle mount - so that I dont have to get my hands off the handle bar everytime I need to check my performance ... But all in all - great buy !
 I have always done cardio but with very little results . Being better able to target heart rates using this watch has been very effective in helping reduce weight and increase my general health . Buttons on the side have a tendency to come off .
 When I use the heart rate monitor , I get much better weight loss and more calories burnt . I still ca n't get the software to work with the computer as it uses audio signal to connect to the computer . A bit of a pain really . Nonetheless , the summary on the watch itself is informative enough . I use it to keep track of my heart rate so do n't really need to connect to the computer . It would be good though if I had that option .
 works good as a heart monitor , it does require the foot pod for full function , which for the price just get a nike Ipod much cheaper for distance and pace , and it does need special equipment to connect to the internet site .
 If you really care about your health , detail info about what you are doing during excercise I mean heart rate , time and calories with a look a your wrist `` THIS IS THE TOOL YOU NEED '' . Simple to test you phisical condition and set it up . Simple to Start , Stop , Check and Save the info about the excercise you are doing .
 If you 're a recreational runner who runs to stay in shape like me . If you 're a new runner , this works great too . If you 're a super pro , I think this would work but you might want one of the Polar higher end watches - maybe the RS200sd with the foot module , or some of their really fancy -LRB- and expensive -RRB- stuff.WHY ? - Easy Easy Easy to set up and use . I took it out of the box . The screen was blank and I panicked ... but there was the protective plastic that had a finger pointing to where I should press -LRB- the big red button -RRB- ... the watch woke up and went through a little set up sequence , enter time , day , date , birthdate , weight , age . After I was done , I wet the electrodes on the strap , put the strap on - pretty easy and comfortable . I pushed the Red button and it said , < start > ... so , I stepped outside -LRB- I was in shorts -RRB- , walked outside my door , and took off on a several mile run - out of the box and through the run I understood what the watch was telling me , time , heartbeat , the basics . So very usable out of the box with little configuration . - Lots of Features . After my jog , I dug into the features - Tons of Running Features , present cardio zones so the watch tells you where you 're operating at based on your age . I know mine by heart and I knew that at 176average bpm , I was in the 90 % to 100 % of my heart rate so did n't need to know . - You can really tell that the people who put this watch together a -RRB- know , care , and pay attention to runners and their needs and b -RRB- that they are very technically saavy and make the technology easy . - Could be worn as a watch . - Priced Right . I used to be the guy who would always buy the best of the best of the best but in this market where there are so many choices , that I 'm buying what is right for me . I 'm not a super runner and do n't aspire to be one , I 'm more than a beginner -LRB- been running for 20 + years -RRB- so this watch was perfect at the right price point with the right features . The polar website has a nice comparison on their products btw.HARD TO FIND THINGS ABOUT THIS WATCH : - It has a Sleep Mode so you can turn it off - The band has a replaceable battery with instructions on the manual on how to change them -LRB- I 'm not saying you should change your own or not , follow the enclosed instructions , I will probably change mine when needed -RRB- - The band is water resistant to 30 meters , and the watch to 50 meters - so you can swim with this but not dive -LRB- silly point , I 'm a diver and that 's a whole different ballgame -RRB- but if you 're a lap swimmer you can use this ... but its primarily a running watch . - It can tell your heart rate in Beats Per Minute or in Target Percent -LRB- % -RRB- based on weight , age - or from your Ownzone calculations . The watch has a feature where it can learn -LRB- you put it on and can make it go through a learning phase about you so it can calculate how hard you should work out -RRB- - To me , this is basically the RS200sd without the foot module - -LRB- sold separately for about $ 129 or as a a bundle with the RS200sd -RRB- . I do n't know if I need that , maybe at some point when I get in shape . - The watch has a history of your workouts so you can go back and see what you were doing and you an even upload to your computer and track there -LRB- I 'm going to play with that next when I 'm done with the review -RRB- . - Should you wear it as a watch ? Some people would n't notice that its a running computer , it might be a conversation starter for some , others might consider you too arrogant advertising that you 're a runner . Me personally , if its the first watch I find as I 'm walking out the door as its not too big , tells time , date -- I would wear it with shorts and T but definitely not in a suit and very definitely not to white tie state dinners . Up to you . - This watch has enough features that marathon runners could train with -LRB- and is designed from the literature for the runner who is more than a novice but not quite an athlete - Polar makes all kind of watches and am glad they made this one for me , not the top of the line , not the most basic ... I wanted a changeable battery on the strap ... just right for me -RRB- . MY FIT EXPERIENCE -LRB- a Con in here -RRB- : - The watch component is very adjustable from very small wrists to very large wrists would work - The strap component , It is stretchy but I found myself openning it up to its maximum and although I 'd like to say that I have a 48 '' Arnold chest for the ladies - I 'm more of a 40Regular kinda guy so just FYI if you 're a big big guy , you might need a bigger strap -LRB- I think Polar sells them but not sure and it has to be a special Polar strap that connects to the module -RRB- ... just FYI to your big guys out there or if you 're 42 - 44chest , would fit but would probably be a bit tighter than my personal fit.WHO AM I ? -LRB- So you can weigh my review accordingly -RRB- - Recreational Runner -LRB- between 9 and 20miles a week depending on my shape ... lately less than my minimum argh . -RRB- - Run to Stay in shape -LRB- not a marathon runner , although when in good shape , I go up to 12 - 15 miles ... not now ... at the moment still have n't gotten back from a broken leg , long story - recommend you do n't break your leg in tropical jungles of far away 3rd world countries , so long story short still in pretty poor physical shape and using the watch to keep me in a safe training environment as I work my way back up into shape . You can really tell , if you push yourself - you start to feel bad as you run and if you glance at your watch , chances are that your heart has gone up to 100 % or 110 % of your target heartrate for me about 190bpm but this instrument is really useful for that but more so because if your heartrate gets too slow , you know you 're slacking and should pick up the pace and this keeps you training in your zone -LRB- do n't know what your zone is ? no worries , the watch tells you -RRB- . I averaged 176bpm for 28 minutes on this first workout with a high of 187bpm and stayed in zone 5 for 96 % of my workout - not bad for an old guy with a bum leg -LRB- getting that from the watch computer log which it saves -RRB- . I did n't go very far and would n't know because I do n't have the foot module option -LRB- $ 129 separately , or you can get it with the RS200sd -RRB- . - I try to run a few times a week , love to travel allot , love photography , love technology , try to be good to myself - and this watch is helping me get fit again . - I do n't get paid for this in any way , I 'm just anonymous , enjoy privacy but do like to share my experiences , and usually I only share my good ones and really hope it helps you make an informed decision . It does seem like running computers are getting much much better these days - I 'm glad.DISCLAIMER - I 'm just a guy sharing my experience with my watch . Undertake physical activity at your own pace and consult a doctor before starting if you have any any doubts . I recommend against getting the watch , strapping it on , and going on a 30 minute run at 96 % of your heart capacity on a sunny warm afternoon if you 've never run before , are n't a regular runner , or have n't exercised in a while . I 'm not a great runner but I have run all my life so I can tell what my body is telling me -LRB- lately from this run , that I 'm not as young as I used to be -RRB- . I think that takes me to the Polar motto which is `` Listen to your Body '' ... and stay safe . I have a baby and using this thing to help me , not substitute for safety but as a helper to staying safe . We live in a litigious society and do n't want some guy going and getting a heart attack or worse having him get a heart attack and pointing the finger at me -LRB- yikes ! -RRB- . Be careful out there . - I bought this from Amazon , next day delivery , had it in my warm hands 16 hours later , was running 16 hours 5 minutes later , very happy .
 I got this watch to help me quantify the workload for my roadwork . It was replacing the Polar F-11 , which I was very happy with . The functionality of this watch is even better than the F-11 . It retains the interesting though not particularly useful `` test '' feature for estimating your VO2max , and retains the OwnZone calculation , both of which simplify use somewhat . It then adds the ability to define your own multiple heart rate zones to your own specification , and then define your own exercise protocols based on those zones . I find this invaluable for keeping my workouts on track . It provides just enough flexibility for me to define recovery walks , interval sessions , and so on , without having to do a lot of planning and configuration for each session.The weaknesses of this product are quirks of the interface . First of all , the buttons have a very cheap feel to them . This is not really a problem since htey have n't broken yet , but it is disconcerting everytime you go to push a button . Second , I found the interface difficult to use for some things . I often forget the sequence I should use to start a particular kind of session , or get a particular kind of display during the workout . I think the more commonly used functions could be made easier to use , and the less commonly used ones more complex instead . Things like starting a particular kind of workout should be much easier to do and require less experience and practice . That aspect is distracting.Overall , this is the best training monitor I 've had so far -LRB- it is my fourth HR monitor from Polar -RRB- . I tend to buy new ones every couple of years rather than going through the hassle of shipping it back to have the batteries replaced . For my purposes , I would much rather the batteries be replaceable locally , but that 's a complaint about Polar , not about the product.I recommend this product for anyone who wants to be able to quantify their workout intensity more effectively . I also recommend using Friel 's heart rate zone recommendations from `` Total Heart Rate Training '' rather tha using the default zones that come with the monitor.Total Heart Rate Training
 THe watch is easy to use and the chest strap is much improved over a Polar strap that I had with a prior model -LRB- more than 10 years ago -RRB- . Polar 's wide acceptance in the market is great because the monitor connects with some treadmills I use so that I can use it to drive the treadmill to leave my heart rate in target zones . My trainer has a Polar watch and she can monitor my heart rate when we 're working . Finally , the watch 's download capability is easy to use so I can keep a log of workouts on Polar 's dedicated website . Nothing to complain about here .
 I have used a polar heart rate monitor for my running/fitness walking in the past -LRB- Accurex -RRB- , and I really appreciate the new straps -LRB- sooo much more comfortable ! -RRB- and some of the features that are provided . The user-changeable battery is definitely a plus , and the weblink feature is kind of fun , although I ca n't seem to get my personal goals to stay programmed as a comparison for my actual sessions . That 's not why I purchased this watch , so it 's not a big deal , but I wish Polar would make it more consistent/reliable . I have been using my monitor on an almost daily basis in the gym and on the street , and have n't had ANY difficulties -LRB- yet ? -RRB- but I do wish Polar would make a watch that was n't quite so bulky or cheap-looking that still has all of the features -LRB- for women anyway -RRB- - the face of this one alone practically fits across my entire wrist . It really is time to bring these little babies into the 21st century!All in all , I am very happy with my purchase , and had no problems setting the features and settings to fit my needs -LRB- go to the Polar website to see a series of video clips that will actually walk you through the whole process ... -RRB- I viewed the clips while waiting for Amazon to ship -LRB- by the way - VERY slow shipping ! -RRB- and by the time I received my unit , I was able to walk right through the steps and get out the door to try this little baby out , and was very happy indeed .
 Purchased the Polar Rs 200 and love it . I am new to running and it greatly assists my workouts . The chest strap is compatible with my gym 's cardio equipment so it makes it easy to monitor my training sessions . Highly recommend this Polar product . I plan to add the foot pod shortly to better my 5k/10k training for events later this year .
 Have only had the Polar RS200SD for a few days but it seems to be exactly what i need . the footpad is not overly accurate straight out of the box , about 10 % off for me , but after calibration it seems very good , probably about the 1 % claimed . Autolapping is a good feature
 A wonderful watch to know the burned calories and heart rate makes you want to work for superb health and longevity in the only life you will receive . The ease of it all .
 For those who run , this is the best option . The price is ok and it works perfectly for what it was designed to . I am really happy about my last purchase .

 Like any Polar product , this heart rate monitor works great . It accurately reads my heart rate and has enough features and sub menus to keep even the nerdiest occupied . My only real complaint is the sheer complexity of the sub menus . I accidentally pressed one button too long and it changed the display to something that was n't useful for me -LRB- two lines of data instead of three -RRB- . I fiddled with it for a couple workout sessions until I finally gave in and opened the manual . After digging through the manual for 15 minutes , I figured out what I did . Not the end of the world , but it gives some indication of the complexity of the menus . I could have gone for something a bit simpler and still been happy . Overall I would still recommend this product .
 Everythings going great.HR Zone on board should be the best thing it had.It 'll be my best choice at this price .
 Many of my friends recommended this watch . I bought it four months ago . The wrist belt is a little bit uncomfortable but this heart rate monitor does a really good job .
 I have always purchased Timex Ironman heart rate monitors in the past and the strap or watch continually breaks down . So I spent a little more on the Polar RS200 and am very happy so far with the performance of this HR monitor . I really like the calorie counting function and the strap is very comfortable . I could live without the image of the runner on the screen but it does everything I want it to do . And it does not pick up other peoples heart rate ! .
 A friend of mine commented the other day that I only seem to write negative or less than positive reviews of products , which gives the impression that I 'm somewhat of a crusty old curmudgeon . Setting aside the fact that my knees constantly remind me that I am getting up there in age I realized that he was partially correct . It seems I only get passionate enough about a product when the product well and truly sucks . So I 've set the goal to go through my products I own list and write reviews for those I 've rated highly.And I can think of no better product to start with than the Polar RS200.In July of 2006 I stepped up on a scale , blinked , looked around , stepped back off it , shook my head and climbed back on . I looked down and could n't believe it . I was almost 200 pounds , and for guy that graduated high school 124 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal that was saying a lot . I got serious about losing weight , going to the gym , working out , jogging , even running , and I found that it was frustrating . It was slow , and the more I learned the more I had no clue as to what I was doing . One recommendation that kept coming up was to get a heart rate monitor -LRB- HRM -RRB- , something I could track and quantify effort with . Originally I purchased a Polar M61 HRM -LRB- which is currently unavailable -RRB- , and which I loved until I realized I had made a mistake . The M61 did everything I thought I wanted an HRM to do , but after having it for a few weeks , I discovered that I needed it to do a lot more than I thought it did.So I purchased the RS200 and while I 've flirted with other systems , such as theGarmin Forerunner 405 Sport Watch with Heart Rate Monitor Kit - Black , I keep coming back to the RS200 . It does everything I need it to . It keeps track of splits , records my workouts , tracks my progress , and provides it all in easily understood presentations . While using it , I lost over 40 # 's in ten months . It allowed me to dial in my workouts , it enabled me to look and see just how much effort I was expending , compared to how much effort I felt like I was expending -LRB- on a good day 80 % of max HR , can feel too easy , while on a bad day , 60 % can feel like its too much -RRB- . When I re-enlisted , it survived BCT and AIT -LRB- one of the joys of being out of the Army for 15 years -RRB- , and went on a deployment to Iraq in 2008 . The watch has never let me down . I 've replaced my battery , and despite advice and complaints you read about on here , I 've never had an issue doing it myself . Concerns about the straps and construction are unfounded . Its taken a beating and has kept on going much better than any Timex I 've ever owned.The only damage I 've found is that while in Iraq the clear front case got a little scratched up and the wear link strap has stretched out . Those are annoyances that I 'll live with . Its taken five years of use and abuse with aplomb.Now that I 've said that , the curmudgeon with the creaky knees does have to come out . While I love the watch and the wear link , the foot pod , while a nice idea , was completely useless . No matter how much calibration I did , I 'd get strange and wide variances on my distance results . Given that I own an iPhone and use it listen to music on my runs and rucks , firing up MotionX GPS app , takes care of my tracking distance requirements .
 I 've used this watch through a couple mini-triathlons and other races and it has held up pretty well . So far , despite changing batteries a couple times , the watch is still waterproof . -LRB- Actually they call it water resistant to 50M , but you know what I mean . I ca n't say the same about some Ronstan `` water resistant '' sailing race watches that I 've bought that have died in the face of water -- not cool ! -RRB- The Polar 200 does a good job of doing it 's main function which , for me , is serving as a heart rate monitor while exercising.The plastic front cover of my Polar 200 has built up a few scratches , but still works okay . The menus on the watch are n't designed particularly brilliantly , so you might find yourself poking around for a bit if you , say , want to set your watch for a time zone in a city you are visiting . Also , I 've found that the interface that it has with a computer is too kludgy to use . I interfaced it a couple times but found it was n't worth it . -LRB- I 've had this watch for a couple years , so maybe there 's something on the market now that actually has a better sync from the watch to a computer . -RRB- If I were buying a replacement these days , I might consider the Polar FS2C Heart Rate Monitor , that 's listing on Amazon about $ 40 cheaper currently -LRB- Just because it 's a little cheaper and seems to have most of the functions I use -RRB- . The only downside I can see with the Polar FS2C is that you have to mail it in for new batteries that I think runs you around $ 10 plus $ 3 handling or something like that . The replacement battery I just bought for the Polar 200 cost me about $ 5 from the drugstore and I put it in myself with one of those glasses screwdrivers . A lot less hassle.All in all , the Polar 200 has served me well . If you are looking for a heart rate monitor to help with your exercising it 's a pretty good buy .
 I love this product ... it works like a charm !! Tamara Simmonds
 I use if for training and for running 10K races . It has customizable screens that give you the information you need and want , . Perfect for beginners and intermediate runners .
 This Polar RS200 is a good beginning watch . From previous models owned , it has some quick start features that are nice . The most important thing is to take the necessary time to go through the entire set up process and then things work well .
 I have been using this HR Monitor for about 6 weeks and I like it quite a bit . the interface is easy I have n't had any problems with the watch talking to the strap via a wireless connection , no interference or something like that . It tracks the work outs over time which is nice . Overall I would recommend this to a friend .
 I bought this to replace the Polar F11 I had for a few years before . Even though the F11 is more expensive , this has more features which makes it more fun to use . I 've yet to get the foot pod but that 's not far off . People complained about the buttons but they feel just like the ones on my old F11 so I 'm not sure what the deal is . The extra button on the top is very useful when doing manual laps . If I broke the one I bought , I would definately buy another one .
 After a month or so of heavily usage -LRB- I had chance to jog a lot lately -RRB- , I can say that I 'm satisfied with this watch -LRB- it is my first hear monitor -RRB- . It looks like it is accurate -LRB- I tested it -RRB- and simple to use . I had to get familiar with terms -LRB- zones , ownzone ... -RRB- but after reading the instructions -LRB- I think you have to -RRB- it becomes easy . I 'm not using all the functionalities that this watch has , but I like the fact that you can create your custom exercises -LRB- playing with the zones -RRB- and the log of the exercises is showing a lot of info . Sometimes the buttons are a little unresponsive , but nothing major when you get used to it.In general I think this is a good product that as more than just the basic functionalities . I would consider it as middle range .
 This product works great and does everything that I need it to do . Only complaint is the display , I wish it would keep the display that you used the last time you worked out so I dont have to keep changing it . Workout records are little challenging to find all your information until you can remember where everything is within your workout report . Would like to get the foot pod if it wasnt so darn exspensive .
 I found the product as described to be . One function unique is a VO2 calculation of fitness . Personal settings are more than basic and some are automatically recorded after performing fitness test if that option is selected . I was disappointed with workout history data as it is primarily designed for runners . I use a powerbike with varying stress periods and while various work zones are indicated it would be necesary to review other data to relate the graph to heart rate numbers . All in all it is a powerful fitness tool . I lost the transmitter while travelling and ordered another chest strap for $ 50 . The monitor recognized the new coded transmitter with no problem . Accurate and I also noted that exercise equipment will pick up the transmitter and report out on excersize machines with heart rate info .
 I am happy with this product . There are times when it seems to lose full signal . I do n't know if this is the fault of the product or if it is the shirts I am wearing . Overall it is really helpful in my running and training .
 I have n't bothered with any of the advanced features yet but this one seems pretty nice . I especially like the chest strap . Polar has come a long way from their hard plastic straps of the past . This one is comfortable enough I forget it is on .5 if it came with the computer cable .
 The watch works good and has even more functions that i Need . The thing that I appreciate a lot is that it syncs with the lifetime machines .

 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .

 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color .

A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest

 My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this film . It takes the viewer along on journeys to places must of us would love to fish , and it 's masterfully filmed and edited . The single most intriguing segment was the one about the hatch of palolo worms that occurs briefly once a year and turns on the tarpon in the Florida Keys . Each of the other five segments is compelling in its own way as well
 I really enjoyed Rise . It 's not quite as good as Confluence Film 's first video , `` Drift '' , but it 's still enjoyable . The Florida tarpon fishing was the best part .
 ... this was still a good movie . Lots of amazing destinations and good photography , with enough story to tie it all together . I would still recommend watching it .
 My daughter rides 2-3 horses daily , year-round , and I ride as much as possible . We both have had several pair of these Tuff Rider Ribb breeches , and they last forever ! No special washing/drying needed , which as horse women we do n't have time to mess with . The fabric does not attract dirt and hay as some other fabrics do . I especially like the zipper pocket - perfect size for horse treats or my cell phone .
 These breeches are super comfy and they last FOREVER ! They do n't need any special care which is a plus when you work with horses everyday . They 're great for schooling , but are nice enough for the show ring .
 I received the ribbed TuffRider breech in the mail today . The fit is very comfortable and flattering , if you like a waist high rise . Was n't sure if I would be okay with the deep purple , and , as it is actually not a deep purple , but in actuality more of a medium blue purple with periwinkle colored knee patches , it may not be for everyone , especially if you are color-shy . But I like the color and the comfort , so am keeping the breeches . The front zip clasp has a somewhat finicky closure , but once you get the hang of it , it 's fine . Very stretch , non-binding , so if you are true to size , it should be quite comfortable . They seem to be fairly light weight , so I plan to use them in the peak of summer heat . These are a colorful keeper .
 These pants are awesome . Size is great and extremely comfortable . The color is n't Taupe , however . It 's more like a Tan or Camel . Other than that , they are terrific and especially considering the price . Extremely well-made . I will definitely purchase again .
 Comfortable . I bought these for casual wear . They look great with boots and a shirt . They do finish at the ankle -LRB- regular length -RRB- . I would buy other colors in this style .
 The pants fit really nice even after giving birth to my baby I tried these pants on 6 weeks later and they still has a nice fit . The only thing I did not like are the logos on the inside of the knee patch . Had I saw that prior to me purchasing them I would not have bought them . I personally do not like the logo of people 's companies on my clothes

 Overall , its a good gun , for the price . Its pretty fast , and pretty accurate . Only thing is the magazine is the magazine only holds 17 , and only of you take the time to stagger the bbs . Great if your just starting out with gas airsoft guns .

 I bought this tank almost 5 years ago and wear it religiously throughout the year . It is still in prime shape . It cools me in the summer and gives me a good base in the winter . It is slightly see through , so I would recommend wearing a thin sportsbra underneath if you will be in public . -LRB- It has a built-in one so you will be double protected ! -RRB-
 I love this style , in fact I prefer it over the usual UA fabric . Its a great layer for cycling but it is not supportive enough for any impact sports . Good for cycling , rowing , spinning and for a warm stylish layer . -LRB- not for B 's and above -RRB- Us small breasted women do great in this . Its flattering .
 I purchased Mighty Grip to help my grip with the fitness pole . I am so impressed and will definately be buying this product again . It works great ! It does n't transfer onto to pole , and does n't dryout my hands . Not to mention , you need only a small amount . My husband even uses it for softball and rock climbing . I have my friends hooked on it too ... drumming , softball , golf , baseball , rock climbing , weight lifting , tennis , etc. . A multi-purpose use that works great !
 I purchased a 2 gallon Igloo water cooler in 1988 and moved to South America . I use the cooler everyday because we have to boil the water before drinking it here . This cooler is awesome . Twenty-two years and counting .
 This is the sturdiest cooler you can buy . It will not break or leak whereas the others I have bought for a similar price have not lasted longer than a few months .
 We bought this to use as a source of water for Jeep trips in the southern California Desert . Perfect size , keeps the water cool and no leaks so far even on bumpy Jeep trails .
 This is a well constructed , high quality cooler . It is very nice . I 'm returning it only because the cooler is much bigger than I anticipated . I am trying to find one for my son to take on marching band trips . He previously had a two gallon water cooler that was lost , but it was still portable , about medium size . So I thought this two gallon container would be about the same size , but it is not , definitely not meant to be lugged around all day . I should have carefully read the dimensions in the product description . Still a wonderful container , I wish we had a use for it .
 I rented two of these for an outdoor wedding in August . It was hot -LRB- for us anyway , in the Northwest , 85 + degrees -RRB- . Not ONLY did these coolers keep the drinks cold , they lasted through the night and into the NEXT day when we returned to clean up the site . I had no idea I 'd still have ice water and frosty Arnold Palmers -LRB- ice tea/lemonade -RRB- STILL available for the clean up crew nearly 20 hours later . Truly amazing.I do n't need a 10 gallon igloo for my regular life . But I 'm seriously considering buying a 2 or 3 gallon one . GREAT product .
 I 've used the 5-gallon version of these on company trucks over the years . They 're pretty much indestructible as far as I can tell but the 5-gallon version is way too heavy and bulky for my personal use . For carrying water for one or two people in a small vehicle this is a great setup . It 's also a lot nicer on the back when lifting and moving around in a confined space since I wo n't be mounting this action on the side of my personal vehicle as we do with the 5-gallon versions on the company rigs.With plenty of ice and sitting outside uncovered in direct sun on the high plains , it 'll keep water very cold to cool for probably 12-hours based on my use so far . The handle seems quite stout , lid seals securely , and the walls are nice and thick , probably comparable to the 5-gallon versions . The spout appears identical to the one used on the 5-gallon version as well , nice and strong , seals well.The only design flaw -LRB- flaw is a strong word , it 's not really a flaw IMO -RRB- is condensation forms on the wall of the jug near the valve portion , I 'm guessing due to thinner insulation in this area , causing you to think the spout is leaking when it 's really not . I 've decided it 's not a big deal but was cause for concern at first when I 'd pick it up and was convinced my precious water was leaking out of the jug.Overall , a very nice piece of kit for the money and something that will probably last for many years .
 I 've used this cooler for the past 4 months . Dealing with outdoor summer temp 's of 110 + I needed a cooler that keeps ice all day . The back of my work truck can get up to 130 degrees . I love being able to refill it with water without having to add more ice in the middle of the day . The cooler has had some pretty hard falls from about 5 feet . Only the lid popped off . Very happy with my purchase .
 I work 12 hrs outside in the heat so I need a cooler that will hold a lot and keep it cool longer . This cooler works well but I dont like that it doesnt have a spout on the top so you have to unscrew the lid everytime you need a drink .
 this is the best cooler i have owned it have had ice after a 10 hour day at 108 on a glvanived roof . it is pricey but you get what you pay for
 The cooler arrived quickly and just in time to battle the summer heat . I needed more water during the day than my 1 gallon cooler could hold as I work out in the heat all day . The quality is very good and my water stays cold all day long . Good purchase !!
 I work in a fleet maintenance facility and needed a cooler with a lid that did not sweat in the Florida humidity . Tried a cheap cooler from a chain retail store and got exactly what i paid for . It did not keep ice for a whole day and the lid would sweat . The igloo cooler has been great ! I put in a gallon of water and fill it the rest of the way with ice . There is usually still ice cold water in the cooler the next morning . Holds ice all day long . I love the removable spout for easy cleaning . The handle is very sturdy compared to some of the cheaper coolers out there . Should provide years of trouble free use .
 This was my first purchase from amazon . I was very pleased with the variety off quality products and sources to order from . Through past experiance I know the 2-gallon igloo cooler I purchased is of high quality and will last many years , even on the job.Not to mention replacement parts that can be purchased .
 The fit is just right for me , and materials and build quality are spot on . Will buy more of these in the future .
 Exactly what we were hoping for . Pricing is high , but all 5.11 is , and it 's worth it . These are sturdy and last for quite a long time , so it 's definitely a deal .
 The shirts feel well constructed , and I like the pen pocket . My only comment is the color was much darker than the picture . The item was called dark navy and I am perfectly happy with the shirt , just be aware the picture portrays a different color than the actual shirt .
 This is a great shirt - great quality - it would get 5 stars except that shirts unavailable with pockets really drive me nuts !
 Awesome shirts , people ask where I got them , I should be getting a commission of at least 5 % ... LOL ... awesome shirts .
 We love these shirts ! The only complaint that I have is that the green color is darker in reality , it almost looks black is some light .
 If you are looking for a high quality and durable , yet lightweight polo , this is the polo for you . I had several of these shirts on my last deployment to the sand and I can tell you that they stood up to the heat , dirt , abuse , and washings in the field . Pen slot in the left sleeve is VERY handy - but I did n't use it as much as I thought I would . Nice to have nonetheless .
 Very nice polo . Price is about average for a decent shirt . 5.11 makes quality products and this is no exception . I bought the heather grey and it looks great . Will be buying more in the future . Highly recommended .
 I absolutely love 5.11 's clothing ! These polo 's are awesome ! They 're very comfortable , made out of quality material , and constructed perfectly . I have several of them and will buy more when I wear them out . Highly recommended !!!
 This is a great shirt and we wear them for our EMS uniforms . They take embroidery well and take heat transfers pretty well too -LRB- but you can expect some peeling if not washed and dried with care - best inside out -RRB- . The polos are soft and feel pretty hefty when you get them . I have washed mine 5 times though and as a uniform shirt it is not bad but the material seems a little more prone to snags and wear than I expected . With the 5.11 name and the great stitching on this shirt it 's really not bad . In fact the stitching is so reinforced and good that I expect the stitching to hold up longer than the material for the shirt itself.How could 5.11 improve this shirt ? I think if they were to create a blend or weave of material that wears a little better and is less prone to snags . Considering I bought one of these for non-uniform wear in black to wear with jeans , I will better be able to assess how it will stand up to a non-work environment . I also found the price of $ 25 for a black version of this polo outstanding since they sell for $ 35 on the 5.11 site . The price was great with Amazon Prime shipping thrown in , so I could n't resist.This is definitely a great polo with great stitching , a nice fit and potential ... there is something about the softness though that makes me wonder about long-term durability . One good thing is that the shirt seems less resistant to wrinkles than some of my other polos -LRB- like some Land 's End polo shirts I own -RRB- .4 stars - it would be 5 if I knew that these were a little more durable .
 very comfortable and looks great . it says they wo n't shrink will see after more washes . it would have been nice if it was more affordable ?
 Shirt was a Christmas gift for my son . He actually wanted another similar in appearance ; it was out of stock . Whew ! The shirt met all his expectations . Thank You it was perfect .
 Just got this in and It really is a great high quality polo shirt . It is a true black color not some off faded black that some places consider black . The fit for me is just a tad too large to what I like them but that 's what happens when you 're tall and in between the medium and large chest wise . I have a feeling I will be ordering more of these in the future .
 Very comfortable , wears great and looks outstanding . I have two more of these 511 shirts in red and green . I plan on getting a few more .
 I own a black version of this shirt as well and I 'm very happy with both of them . My workplace demands a certain dress code and the 5.11 Professional Polo looks and `` feels '' Professional . It 's made of durable material and sits perfectly on me . Just I 'd like to give you a heads up about the sizing . The Black color `` feels ' to be one a little bit `` roomier '' than other colors . But it 's not a deal breaker , has n't been for me , and honestly I like the black one better .
 I bought these gloves 3 yrs ago and while they have signs of wear , they have outlasted any glove by Calaway or Footjoy I have ever had !! These gloves are fantastic , fit perfectly and wear so well at the grip ! Hope I can find more !
 I might not be an expert on golf gloves , but I have never been able to feel the difference on expensive and cheap golf gloves , and I tend to wear them out in the same speed.For me this is a very nice and comfortable glove .
 This is a great cooler for making Kool-aid or Lemonade in the summer time -LRB- or any time for that matter -RRB- we have 3 boys who are constantly wanting something to drink and this cooler keeps whatever we put in it , COLD . Its great to take to the beach or to the park for picmic 's too ! the lid does not screw on , it presses on , but that has not been a problem and it has never opened accidently . This is a high grade cooler made with premium materials , we really like how well the spout works . There is a great handle for carrying this to the car , or picnic table or beach . I couldint imagine having any other beverage cooler after owning this one ! Holds lots and lots of ice and keeps everything ice cold ! enjoy !!!
 This is a great little cooler . I have used it for a 10 person team in a hot climate . I fill it completely with ice and then fill it with water . It will keep ice water for two whole days and even a little into the third day then I need to start over . The lid does not screw on it is pressure fit . Do n't forget to order a paper cup holder if you are using it as I am for a crew . There is a holder grip on the side but the cups and holders are sold separately . Highly recommended .
 I bought this item because the 3 gallon is so much easier to handle than the 5 gallon , and the 5 gallon was all I could find locally . This is great for camping , which is why I bought it . It has come in handy for gatherings at home as well .
 I want to have good drinking water at the campgrounds I visit locally and absolutely refuse to purchase bottled water . Campground water is typically potable , but I often do n't like the taste and simply prefer water as a beverage over other options that take up room in my cooler . Since many road crews use these I knew it had to be a solid , sturdy product that would maintain cold water and remain durable if handled with care . It 's more expensive than one you can buy at a large chain store , but those ca n't even begin to compare to this product in those same categories . You get what you pay for - this is a prime example.I use water from my Brita to fill this and also make 8 sizeable blocks of Brita ice from the disposable plastic containers that lunch meats come in . I took it on a 3 night trip recently and the blocks of ice were still nearly 1/2 intact at the end of the trip . I will fairly state though that the weather was a bit cooler than normal for the season and my campsite had complete shade . As far as it being in a warmer environment for a 3 night trip I doubt the ice blocks would still be maintained , but am reasonably sure that the water would remain at least on the cooler side if kept out of the sun as much as possible . If being used for a day trip on a very hot day you 'd be fine with having the water ice cold all day with already cold water going into it with a few ice blocks . I have a hitch mounted bike rack on my Jeep and when the bikes were removed it made a dandy place to hang it so that it could be easily accessed.If you are planning on using a full 3 gallons in this be absolutely sure that it is placed on a completely level surface while in transport . I had mine slightly leaned back on top of a plastic tote on my front seat and it started to spill out of the top a bit . Thankfully I had only gone a few feet from my home when I discovered the problem . Once leveled out evenly I had no further problems . The lid does not screw on -LRB- which likely caused the leakage I experienced since it was leaning back a bit -RRB- , but does stay securely in place with the white handle . My only regret about this product is that I did n't purchase it a few years back .
 Really works great and is durable . I am a soccer coach and I use this all the time . The only flaw is that the lid is not tight and it sloshes and leaks in the car . Also , almost everyone tries to pick it up by the red handle and it spills -LRB- you have to use the white handle to carry . But all-in-all a very good product .
 I am very pleased with the cooler as it is the perfect size -LRB- a 3 gallon -RRB- for me to carry to work .
 My husband is a UPS driver and drinks a lot of water during the day . I 've went to a lot of different stores trying to find this 3 gallon cooler and never had any luck finding it . The stores always sell a 2 gallon -LRB- which is never enough water for him -RRB- and a 5 gallon -LRB- which is way too much -RRB- . I love that I can always find it at Amazon and get it delivered in a timely manner . He 'll put ice in it first thing in the morning and by the end of his day -LRB- sometimes 10 hours later -RRB- , he still has ice cold water inside . This is the best water cooler I have found and he loves it !
 This 3 gallon Igloo cooler is awesome . At 3 gallons it is not too big . Great for our baseball team . The cooler is short with a wide base , so it does not tip over in the car on the way to practice or games . It is super tough and made to last . I looked at a made in China cooler by Gatoraid that was 50 % more expensive because of the `` Gatoraid '' logo . - The Igloo cooler is made in USA . I trust the USA plastic . Plastic from China could possibly leach chemicals into me and the kids . Better safe than sorry .
 Nice in between size from the 2 gal and 5 gal . my two gallon was a little small for the long summer work and camping trips . 5 gal too big to be truly portable . 3 gal fits the bill
 Previously I had bought Adidas shoes which did not last very long . I use them for extensive sparring -LRB- Taekwondo -RRB- and the toe got unglued on both the pairs . This time I decided to try a different brand and was not disappointed.This shoe feels much more secure specially around the toe area . It is very stable and comfortable.It also costs less than a comparable Adidas shoe . I did buy it half a size larger as recommended in the product description and it fits perfectly . I would definitely recommend it .
 These are by far the best pair of shoes I have ever owned . Recently , I had to return 4 different types of shoes that claimed to be for the martial artist , but I was unsatisfied with their performance . In my search I came across the Discipline Footwear company and subsequently this product . Having never heard of them I was a bit skeptical , but their focus on creating martial arts shoes was intriguing . Upon receiving the product I was pleasantly surprised at the quality put forth into the shoes . Even the box has a great design both visually and physically . The best thing of all is that upon wearing the shoes I instantly could feel the difference the company took in engineering this shoe for the marital artist . The shoes are very comfortable , especially in the heel area and arch areas . After a few exercise sessions , I can say that these actually have enhanced my performance , helping me to achieve better stability , balance , and movement . My feet were also not as sore as they usually are . Last , but not least , the aesthetics of the shoe have a premium look . If you are looking for a pair of shoes for martial arts , or just very comfortable , good looking shoes in general , I give my highest recommendation to this product .
 A fine shoe to have . So far it has worked as well as it says . It is a tight fit to my foot , but I suppose over time it will fit better . Almost everyone I know immediately recognized the quality of shoes . I hope they will last me a long time .
 I love these shoes . When I first wore them at training , they were a little slick on the vinyl flooring . I think it was because they were new because after a half an hour , they were just the right amount of traction and still allowed for a smooth pivot upon kicking . I ordered a 1/2 size larger per instructions , but found them to be a bit too long . I think I might try my exact size next time in the Jaewoo mid .
 I ordered a pair of the Disciple workout shoes and was pleasantly surprised . They fit very well and will save many layers of skin during workouts . They seem to withstand any punishment I can dish out so far . Very comfortable and well worth the money . I would recommend this shoe for anyone looking to save your feet during a martial art workout .
 This is a must have !!! I am always intertaining be it at home , or parks , this igloo water can is always filled with some kind of punch or drink ... Real life saver and thirst quincher !
 This item came very quickly , and was the correct fit for a jersey . Good customer service also .
 I spent the last year searching for a watch that had all the features and looks I was looking for and found it in this watch . There is absolutely nothing to not like about it , and I 'm extremely picky . Absolutely perfect in every way . I highly recommend it to all guys out there who want a great , stylish watch . It keeps incredibly accurate time , is easy to read in a dark theater , and is just the coolest looking watch around ... bar none .
 I wanted a decent looking watch that should be durable enough to be worn daily as my `` kick around '' watch . I am pretty tough on watches , and the Luminox reputation for durability had my attention . While durability was important , looks were also a factor . I did n't want a big ugly brick attached to my wrist.This watch is a good looking watch that can take abuse and function properly . I have been wearing this watch daily since it arrived , and have taken it on trips across the country . It shows no signs of wear . It performs flawlessly . An added plus for me is the illumination feature . It performs just as it is advertised . In short , I love this watch .
 I already reviewed this series , so if you want to see my full review , please just click over the black-face version of this watch . In short
 I have had this watch for about six years and it has been very reliable . Although I am pretty rough on it , it still holds up . My only complaint is that the crystal does get scratched up and after a couple of years the watch band does show wear . So far every two years I ship the watch back to Luminox for an overhaul . I have the battery , crystal , and watch band replaced . It runs a little over $ 100 . It is worth it to have a watch that looks like new again . If you are in the market for a Luminox watch , I would get this model versus the cheaper one that has the plastic case . This is the model that I started with . It lasted almost two years until the part of the case that holds the watch band broke . For a little more money , get this watch and it will last maybe forever with the stainless steel case .
 Do n't let the name fool you , this is a strong cleaner wax with a very very very mild polish . Does an excellent job of cleaning up oxidation but wo n't do much for swirls . Not only for Boats/RVs , works great on cars too . Makes the surface very slick and has great durability . You will easily get 3 months of beading on a car parked outside 24/7 , possibly up to 6 months depending on climate . Overall a fantastic product . Top with DG Aquawax for increased durability and even better looks.Pros : - Great cleaner-Durable protection-Nice shine-Doesn ' t appear to stain trim if wiped off quickly-A little goes a long wayCons : - Not much polishing ability , very mild abrasive package .
 I 'm in training for the NY Marathon and have been using the Polar RS200sd with footpod and heart monitor for 10 weeks . I made the right choice and I 'm extremely happy with the watch . Here are the reasons why : - Slimline and not bulky like other watches . I wear this for work and it looks just fine ! - Long life battery . Some of the other watches require constant charging . - Many useful functions . I 've only used maybe 40 % of the features so far . Most useful to me is ` heart rate zones ' and distance/pace measurments . - Logical and easy to use button layout . - Heart rate monitor and strap fits well and performs without problem . - Foot-pod . I 'm in marathon training and have not noticed any problems on short or long runs . Good battery life . I 've heard some other reviewers say it 's not accurate but I 've not noticed this . However , I 'm not concerned about 100 % accuracy ! It 's possible to calibrate the foot-pod but I 've never needed to do it . - Possible to configure watch screens to display data that you need . e.g. I set up my main screen to display distance and also my pace -LRB- my marathon pace is 9 minutes per mile ! -RRB- . - A nice extra feature is the abilty to change the data screens by briefly pressing the watch against the heart rate strap . I 've configured mine to activate the backlight . Useful when running at night ! - I 've also configured my watch to automatically take a lap-time at each mile . - All data can be sent to the webpage tool . The data is sent to the web sonically by placing the watch next to your computer microphone and clicking ` Send ' on the watch . The watch beeps for 10 seconds as it automatically sends the data to the webpage . You can then go online and spend hours looking at varous graphs ! Very Nice . - The wrist-strap
 excellent watch , best i could find for $ $ . If your not a pro you do n't need more
 I LOVE this Heart Rate Monitor watch !! It is just what I was looking for in a HR Monitor for running . I would highly recommend it ... It is easy to use and loaded with great features for runners/walkers .
 had a polar f6 before , fulfilled my need for a lap feature . the foot pod was larger than i thought it would be , have not used it yet . would recommend this hr to a friend .
 It 's more like a computer though , it 's super smart . A very helpful tool to track heart rate , speed , distance , time , etc. . The red is nice too .
 I love this watch-it is easy to use and can be used as a watch or with the heart-rate monitor and/or foot pod . Also tracks workouts . The only difficulty is the calibrating the foot pod-the calibration is calculated in Km instead of Mi and my treadmill -LRB- Iowa in an icy winter -RRB- does not have Km . Instead , I did the manual calibration in mi/hr . Buy it !
 I love this heart rate monitor , now I ca n't go running without it . The foot pod is great and it has worked every time . The watch is not too big and looks nice for everyday use .
 These boards were used for our karate test in October for kids ages 3-7 years old . They worked great ! Normally when I order from my other suppliers , one or two boards are broken and it kinda irritates me , but no broken boards here . Next exam I 'm gon na try the thicker sizes too and will probably end up making this a routine thing for our school . Price is the main reason as these guys have the lowest around . Thanks Tiger !!!
 This compass is designed specifically for orienteering . This is my fourth thumb compass and I like it the best . Once you line up your direction of travel line and turn until the needle is pointing North on your map , the needle also points to your direction on the dial since East and West are reversed on the dial . The dial does n't move so you will know if you 're going North , South , East or West by looking at the dial . It also has a 1:10,000 scale on the main line and a 1:15,000 on the side . The needle is fast and stable as well .
 I 've been using a Silva Jet spectra for at least 5 years now , and absolutely love this compass . I 've pretty much beat the snot out of it all these years and its still working -LRB- though a tiny bit cracked with a small bubble in it and I have to keep redrawing the some of the lines . . but since it tends to be on my hand when climbing , it does get scraped , banged against rocks , etc -RRB- . I would definitely replace it it with another spectra when I 've finally managed to kill it . The face plate is the best designed I 've seen for fast reading speed -LRB- with the color coding completely around the dial unlike with Moscompass -RRB- .
 This is the second poker top table I have had andthis one is the BEST ... lays over a regular card tablemaking it wonderful for 8 people to play pan or pokeror even to serve dinner for 8 people . Great additionto any home.Paula
 This item arrived in great shape . All you have to do is easily remove the cup holders and insert them to the other side . Looks and feels better then the picture . A must for poker games .
 This is amazing quality . HEAVY not at all like some of the others I have seen . The colors are bright and its real to casino table . If you have someone who loves to play the tables get this gift . Do not be fooled its heavy ! Does n't sit well on anything but a 70 round table .
 I had some reservations about a portable poker table top , but I 've used it quite a bit , and the portability is turning out to be a bonus ! Can go anywhere !
 This met and exceeded my expectations ! For the cost I was n't expecting too much , but it is sturdy , heavy -LRB- not in a bad way -RRB- , and the felt seems to be sturdy and the trays are what I expected . I priced making one myself to save money and I do n't think I could buy the parts to make this for what I paid for it !! Someone said they were n't sure if they could get 8 people around it ... . yeah um if all 8 people are sunk wrestlers I could see a problem . Plenty of room for my friends . Recommend for affordability .
 This is the best poker table I have seen . We use the solid green side for Texas Holdem , and prefer the felt without advertisng or stenciled markers . The smooth surface is by far the best.The quality is great and the price is reasonable .
 Perfect for poker and holding drinks and poker chips . All the guys were impressed . Fold for easy storage with plastic zip up case .

 My son and I take Tae Kwan Do and purchased these boards to practice for our advancement tests . The difference in strength between the boards is a little less than I expected . There is a difference in strength between the three with a greater difference between the red and black than the blue to red.The handles are the best feature as they allow a Martial Artist to practice breaking w/o having to use either a fixture or a human holder . You can easily hold the board with one hand , and strike with the other ; does require more precision on the hit . If you 're using the boards over a mat -LRB- like the kind found in many Martial Arts Schools -RRB- you may not want to try the single handed breaks as if the board falls just right , with the corner of the breaking edge down , it can put a small cut in the mat . An old towel over the mat would probably work just fine to protect the mat.After dozens of breaks , the boards do become slightly easier to break ; in other words , they 've become broken in . However , the person holding the board can compensate if they apply slight pressure to the handles and cause the board to arch slightly toward the hitter . Also , even with only bare feet and hands , the protective colored padding on the board has a slight tendancy to peel off in small pieces of less than 1/8 '' near the breaking edge . If you do n't care about looks , a piece of duct tape works nicely to prevent padding flake . The padding is a good feature as there is less damage to your knuckles compared to the unpadded plastic rebreakable boards or actual pine boards.If Tiger Claw were going to improve the product they could experiment with different grades of plastic to increase the life of the boards , slightly round the four corner edges , and perhaps apply a strip of rubber on each side of the break to better hold the colored padding in place.For practice , using these is much greener -LRB- and cheaper -RRB- than using actual wooden boards .
 Works great . After a few breaks , though , you can tell it has weakened a bit . It still works , but I think I 'm going to need the black board now .
 just purchased the blue board for my 6 yr old for TKD testing . tried it out for the first time and he had no problems breaking it with his side , front , and back kick . held off on having him try hand breaks . Actually easier to break than I thought , but I think that it is a good way to build confidence . The board is stiff enough that if he uses poor technique it does n't break , but not so stiff that if he uses poor technique it hurts . Overall workmanship seems pretty good . Joints fit together tightly . Will see how it does over time ... For kids who are a little older and stronger -LRB- our little guy is small for his age -RRB- it might be more worthwhile to get the red board .
 If you 're tired of getting your fingers kicked , these ARE the boards to have , bar none . I can purchase better branded at a very good price making them cheaper , but I buy these preferentially . : -RRB-
 I am very please with this productPro 's :1 . The fit between the two halves is very tight and it does create a try 2 . breaking experience .3 . The thing rubber padding helps avoid skin scrapes4.The two side handles are key to allow for appropriate support5.The difference between the three levels is consistence and gradual5.Once you master the black color level , you can progress by using two black color boards held together6.Useful for all times of attacks -LRB- hands , elbows , kicks etc. . . -RRB- . Cons : None observed so far.I am curious as to the lifetime of this board -LRB- i.e. how many times you can use it before it loses rigidity -RRB-
 This is a great tool for training , as a Martial Arts instructor I know that wood is better for feeling & exibition , but no need to waste wood on training sessions .
 This lamp is just what I was looking for behind my recliner in our RV . It is as advertised , looks good , and swivels nicely to obtain the best light source for reading .
 I have several pet peeves as regards watches :1 . Lose their luminescence in the dark2 . No date3 . Band does n't have correct adjustments.This watch has it all . With the Luminox illumination technology , I can see the time no matter how long it 's been since nightfall . Plus , with the velcro band , I can adjust it to any degree , allowing for infinite adjustments . It is also extremely comfortable , to the point that you will forget you have it on.This watch does have a date which , although small , can be seen when needed.I chose model 3903 because the diameter was smaller and less obtrusive . It also has a movable bezel to mark time when needed . Last , but certainly not least , this watch has kept perfect time .
 Had been looking at the larger LumiNox watches , but considered them to large for my wrist . This particular model -LRB- 3900 series -RRB- is a smaller version of the more well known LumiNox Navy Seal watches . Beautiful colors in the face , with very bright illuminated hands and dial .
 This watch is very useful and practical . It is waterproof to 200 meters and shock resistant . Being in the Navy , I wear it every day , and it is an excellent everyday work watch and great during physical training sessions . I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to wear it outdoors to work or play .
 I have had this same watch for over 10 years and it finally gave up , so I bought a new one . Same quality and ruggedness as before but a better band . This is a great piece especially for this money .
 I have had this watch now for about three years and it is still seemingly bulletproof . I have , however , had to replace the band because it started to rip and would not remain on my wrist . The ruberized band itself lasted about 2 years which is good considering the a salesman for luminox said they normally only last a year . And in those two years , I barely took this thing off ; not in the shower , pool , gym , or for work around the house ; this watch is a quality time peice . The nylon band may last longer , but velcro does not work well if wet and in cold conditions ; the velcro becomes useless . The rubber band is also very comfortable . The housing and transparent shield will , inevitably , get scuffed up , but I have really abused this watch at times . Never do these scuffs mess with the ability to read the watch.It is really nice to have the day of the month as well , but this does not illuminate . But , this watch lights up so bright at night you can actually use it to read something if you really had to in pitch darkness . I have walked down a dark hallway at my house and this watch gave off a green aura that lit the way for me to see . It is also going to be a great watch for divers if it is not taken below 200 meters , which is a long way anyway . The rotating bezel allows you to set your time for oxygen or to time yourself at the gym like I do . The 60 second mark on the rotating bezel is also illuminated by tritium to find it easily . It has a lot of versatility for a simple design.Luminox uses swiss quartz and the face has 12 and 24 hour time markings , adhereing to its military roots . The blackened stainless steel caseback has the Navy SEAL emblem laser etched , along with Swiss Made , adding to the coolness factor of the watch . However , I wish the little screws used to hold the caseback in place were also blackened as they do rust from the corrosive sweat you give off . My other issue with the watch is the second hands dont quite match up with the tick makes on the face . This , to me , is very trivial but it may bother some people . This watch is very easy to change to time and date if needed with the pinwheel on the side . Over the 3 years I have used it , it has never fell behind or sped up time , it always keeps accurate time.Also , this is a super lightweight and comfortable watch you will forget you have on you unil you need it . I used to frequently wear my father 's Omega Seamaster -LRB- James Bond Watch -RRB- and the thing was just too heavy and it would cut into my hand . My Fossil watch does the same thing . This watch wo n't pull the hair out of your arms or cause discomfort in heavy use.This is my favorite watch and is the best I have ever owned . For the money , you get a great timepiece that will last a very long time . I highly recommend this watch to people like me who tend to unintentionally abuse things . A watch is an invaluable item to have on you and this is my watch of choice .
 Since I 've only had the watch a few weeks , I wo n't report on duribility or long-term reliablity or accuracy . However , my first impressions are that it 's a great watch for the price . It 's very lightweight . I chose the blue face . The velcro band is a little hard to get used to if you 've never had one before , but you soon come to like it . The tritium hands and position markers are the brightess I 've seen . The dial is easily readable in all light conditions .
 Because ther were many reviews that criticized the watch band , upon getting my watch I immediatly changed it to a black plastic one which I think is much better looking . I periodically check the time on the Internet and the watch appears to have niether lost nor gained a second since I received the watch .
 Item came as described and looked better in person . Great watch for casual wear and outdoors . Been in the ocean a few times as well as in pools and no issues . Highly recommend .
 Great watch so far , no leaking like the Timex Iron man , only small problem is they could have included the day of the week , not just the date . After 6 months the watch leaked and I had to throw it away , no more of these for me , I did not even dive with it just showering and swimming .
 Great watch . Glows bright at all times . Band is comfortable . Just need to see how long it holds up . Seems to be well built and it is accurate .
 got this for my husband for christmas . Watch is great for night work . nylon band is cheap and tore off in 8 days .
 So far I am more than pleased with the performance of this watch . I had been wanting one for some time & Amazon.com had the best price .
 This is purely a simple watch that is legible , easy to see at night and comfortable .
 I do n't dive , but got tired of my watches getting moisture in them due to frequent hand washing , car washing , etc. . . This is a great water proof watch and the luminous features are wonderful . No buttons to hit , just look and see the time in any level of darkness .
 The watch was great , it was like I thought it was.The shipping was on time and fast .
 My boyfriend is into anything military related and he needed a durable watch -LRB- his last one did n't survive the swimming pool -RRB- . He absolutely loved this watch . It has a velcro strap that is easy to take on and off . It is water resistant and the hand on the face glow really bright at night . This watch seems to be a lot more durable , hopefully it will last .
 The service i recived was great and the watch is a very good product the price was the lowest i found .
 Sammy is a pretty hefty chunk of solid , unbending plastic , and you 're supposed to balance him on a 1-and-a-half inch metal spike that sticks out the bottom of one foot -- to simulate that cute little hop he does , right before a homerun lap . Problem is , the lightweight base has a very shallow hole to receive said metal spike , so Sammy 's body tends to lean heavily atop the shallowly-anchored spike once assembled on the base . You have to position him carefully , to avoid the whole model just toppling over . Also , carefully concealed in the box is a short black plastic rod which is necessary to mount the bat to the base . The rod barely fit the too-small hole the on the bat , causing some restrained cursing during the build process . Once assembled , I must say it 's a surprisingly lifelike and detailed model that does not disappoint .
 I saw a CBS News review of several practice golf balls . They said Qolf is the best . They were right . Although light you can feel when you hit it well . It is similar to a real golf ball except it goes about 2/3 as far and does n't `` plug '' in the mud . If you shank one into a house or car it might not break anything .
 what can i say about a simple hand held bicycle pump apart from the fact that it does the job it 's supposed to do .
 This little ice pack keeps frozen for hours . It 's normal use is for ice chests , but I use it for back pain . I can put it in a pillow case , apply it to the hurt , and it 's a big help . The cold packs sold in drug stores are filled with a jel that does not freeze , so they only stay cold for less than an hour . I like to use it while I watch tv at night to reduce inflamation before I go to bed . If you want to KEEP something cold for hours vs. minutes , this is a great choice for the price .
 My daughter rides 2-3 horses daily , year-round , and I ride as much as possible . We both have had several pair of these Tuff Rider Ribb breeches , and they last forever ! No special washing/drying needed , which as horse women we do n't have time to mess with . The fabric does not attract dirt and hay as some other fabrics do . I especially like the zipper pocket - perfect size for horse treats or my cell phone .
 These breeches are super comfy and they last FOREVER ! They do n't need any special care which is a plus when you work with horses everyday . They 're great for schooling , but are nice enough for the show ring .
 I received the ribbed TuffRider breech in the mail today . The fit is very comfortable and flattering , if you like a waist high rise . Was n't sure if I would be okay with the deep purple , and , as it is actually not a deep purple , but in actuality more of a medium blue purple with periwinkle colored knee patches , it may not be for everyone , especially if you are color-shy . But I like the color and the comfort , so am keeping the breeches . The front zip clasp has a somewhat finicky closure , but once you get the hang of it , it 's fine . Very stretch , non-binding , so if you are true to size , it should be quite comfortable . They seem to be fairly light weight , so I plan to use them in the peak of summer heat . These are a colorful keeper .
 These pants are awesome . Size is great and extremely comfortable . The color is n't Taupe , however . It 's more like a Tan or Camel . Other than that , they are terrific and especially considering the price . Extremely well-made . I will definitely purchase again .
 Comfortable . I bought these for casual wear . They look great with boots and a shirt . They do finish at the ankle -LRB- regular length -RRB- . I would buy other colors in this style .
 I really love the way these breeches fit , they look great and with a pair of riding boots . i would reccommend
 The pants fit really nice even after giving birth to my baby I tried these pants on 6 weeks later and they still has a nice fit . The only thing I did not like are the logos on the inside of the knee patch . Had I saw that prior to me purchasing them I would not have bought them . I personally do not like the logo of people 's companies on my clothes

 This is a quality product from a reputable manufacturer . The value/price relationship on this particular item can not be matched or surpassed by any of the big-box retail outlets . This is good for any sanding , painting or insulation related applications . 3M produces serious and excellent products for the professional and building trades , they know what they are doing . Highly recommended .
 The image of a very cute Naruto in his ` relaxing ' or ` playful ' pose!Item is very soft - does n't scratch , itch , bind or pinch . Can be worn by an adult or child , -LRB- stretches smoothly -RRB- .
 I have found this to be the warmest coat , i live in central ohio and there has been times that even though it was real cold out that i have gotten hot when i have this coat on outdoor . If you live somewhere that gets real cold i would recomend that even this coat is expensive that you are making a good choice and it will keep you warm .
 I bought this watch for water sports but I find myself wearing it more than my other watches because it 's good looking , waterproof , and can easily be read in the dark . The rotating bezel is faster and easier to use than digital timers . I only wish the date window were larger . I ca n't read the date even with my reading glasses on .
 If you are thinking of purchasing this car , note that the seat is small and the length to the pedals is short . Thefore , it is suited for small children . The description says children 3 + , but when our 4.5 year old -LRB- who is very small for 4.5 -RRB- tried it out , it was way too small . It was extremely difficult for our child to pedal comfortably . It has alot of interesting buttons for sound effects , but I would say that based on the size of the seat and the length to the pedals that this is more ideally suited for children 3 or 4 only .
 I bought the Batmobile pedal car for a friend 's son for his birthday . I wanted to get something that would be fun and cool for him but not too annoying for mom . Since he watches the Batman cartoon on TV I figured the Batmobile pedal car was perfect . He loves it ! He is always making up stories about chasing the bad guys and incorporating the sound effects from the toy . It 's so cute . My friend also liked that it had pedals to encourage a little more activity while he played . I would definately recommend this to other shoppers .
 The Batmobile car is awesome but the age limit is off . It should be for ages 1-3 it is much smaller than described . The only reason my son could ride it , is because he is short for a three year old . Other than that , the shipping was fast and my son loves it . Just wish it was a little bigger so that he could use it longer than a few months !!
 This was the only thing that my 2 year old son wanted for Christmas in 2005 . He has played with it most of the year and he is now 3 . I agree that the seat is small and should be listed for 2 or 3 years old . I believe that is hard for this age group to use the pedals and my be why the age group suggested was older . It is a well built toy and can handle abuse . My son LOVES it .
 Converted this into a mash tun to use in the brewing of beer . It 's been used to hold boiling or hot water and has held up well . Slight warping from the heat but not very much . I find it loses around 3-5 degrees F for a one hour mash . It 's a little on the small side but big enough .
 I purchased three Rubbermaid 5 gallon water coolers for use with our running group . We use them every weekend and haul them all over the place filled with water and/or sports drink . My only complaint is the lids will leak even if they are screwed down correctly and tight if they fall over . If you do n't put the lids on right , they will also leak while hauling them about as the liquid splashes inside the container . The lids sometimes take a time or two to screw on correctly as the threads do n't always line up correctly the first time . Insulation is ok , about what you 'd expect from a cooler like this . All in all , very pleased with the product as it has held up well over the last year of being hauled all over the place . One last thought , make sure you unscrew the lid slightly when you 're ready to use as it will sometimes create a vacuum which will keep the spigot from flowing .
 We use these water coolers to provide water areas on the outside fields . They 're easy to clean , and are sturdy enough to handle tons of day camp kids and staff . I 've bought these for years , and will continue to do so if one breaks -LRB- Usually caused by someone knocking off the dispenser in front -RRB- .
 Ugly orange - but extremely functional.Had to replace one -LRB- its spout broke due to too much traveling - we ` repretty hard on them -RRB- - I did n't even look at another brand .
 Sturdy enough . Top is easy to remove . I have seen no leaking issues so far , whatsoever , and it gets some pretty harsh use . The handles are on there good as well .
 We got two of these for our annual 4th of July party and they 're great . The full-width lid makes them very easy to clean ; our old Coleman five gallon works well , but sticking my hand a foot and a half in through the four inch hole to scrub it out while trying to see what I 'm doing is work for a contortionist . They 're extremely well insulated - my wife made a gallon of lemonade ice cubes to chill the three gallons of lemonade in one container , and they were only about half melted thirty hours later despite of the eighty-plus degree heat . I 've seen them a little cheaper at a local chain store , but it was worth the extra three bucks to not be advertising that store in five inch letters on the front of each jug . For the quality , the value and the ease of use , I highly recommend these containers .
 Very durable construction . Just like I remember as a kid at soccer games this cooler will be for my kids to drink out of at their soccer games . The spout is so easy to operate my 5 year old can use it . Will probably buy some more of these for camping .
 This is a very big water cooler that is handy to have around for gatherings and outdoor events . I fill it with ice tea for BBQ 's in my backyard and have gotten a lot of good use out of it . Build quality is excellent and construction is sturdy . A grown adult can even sit on this with no problem . It 's a nice , attractive bright orange color that 's fun to look at and easy to spot . The side has a cup holder , but I never use it as it 's clumsy to keep attached.The spigot is easy to push and automatically shuts off when its released . It enables one-handed operation
 This item is rugged , excellent for construction worker , I 'M a landscaper and it does the job perfectly , keeps the water cool and works just fine + + + the price was the best RECOMMENDED !!!
 First trip , I filled 2/3 of this cooler with ice then lay it on its side on a roof rack . A day later , I got it off the top of the car and although some ice had melted , I was amazed that nothing leaked from the lid . Filled the cooler up with water at that point and 2 days later , still had a little bit of ice.Second trip , filled about 1/3 with ice and water to about 3/4 full . Next day , most of the ice was gone even though outside temps were about the same as trip # 1 . So now I know not to skimp on ice -LRB- I already do n't like drinking water so if I have to it better be ice cold -RRB- but I 'm impressed the lid holds so securely . The spout is easy to operate with one hand and our 5-year old has no problems with it . Handles feel sturdy and are comfortable enough to carry a full jug with just one .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I have had my EP-550 for over 2 months now . It has changed my life . My sciatica was so bad that I could not walk around the block without suffering severe pain . I had to go to Macy 's one day to buy some sheets . I parked as close to the door as possible but I still had a great amount of difficulty making my purchase and getting back to my car.Sorry if I am off subject . Now I recommend the EP-550 to anyone who complains of back issues . I have just convinced my buddy in Germany to buy one ` for his wife ' . She is a pianist and he is a horn player . Both professions can lead to back issues . I am recommending that he buy these handles for his new machine . The short handles can be a problem at first until you feel comfortable and learn how to shift your weight to return to the starting position . I use a slight sit-up to get me started but many users are in such bad shape that they ca n't bend their head forward . Another buddy in Florida just had upper back surgery on C2 thru C5 . He is just beginning his rehab and will check to see if a table will be allowed later on . If he gets the go ahead , I will encourage him to get the larger handles too . In so doing , he will be able to return to the starting position without putting any strain on his upper back .
 Great product . My husband had his previous one for 15 years on a work truck . Needed the same one to be able to fit in the box.I would reccommend this product.Rubbermaid # 1683-01-11 3gal Orange Water Cooler
 I was looking for something to give more back to my employees throughout the day , this helped and was very reasonably priced
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 I was so pleased with this that I actually bought six of them in black and blue . I 've had them for about a year now , and the only thing I would complain about is that some of the seams are falling apart . Other than that , they 're comfortable !
 This shirt fits just as the image indicates . I 'm not sure why it 's called a `` muscle shirt '' when it fits far too loosely to show off anything other than your exposed arms , but as I said , it matches the picture . It looks much nicer than the cheap cotton sleeveless tees I usually work out in . In fact , an attractive woman in the gym started putting herself in front of me repeatedly to get noticed after ignoring me previously . You ca n't get a better indicator than that . It feels nice , gives me complete freedom of movement , and despite being polyester I did n't get warmer in it than cotton . In my own experience , the claim about it resisting moisture is laughable . My back and the back of the shirt were soaked half way through my workout , and the gym has good air conditioning . In fact I had to hang it up to dry before putting it in the hamper , just like my cotton shirts.Had there been no claim made about this item resisting moisture , I 'd give it 5 stars , but I do n't think anything that fails to live up to its advertising should get a `` perfect '' rating . I like it enough that I will buy several more . It 's a very good item , just do n't expect it to stay dry .
 This item is very comfortable and cool . Was originally purchased to use as a car work uniform , but this is too nice to oil it up . For the price paid , I was surprised at this . Very Cool and moisture absorbent design , I 'm speechless , and totally surprised . I hope this response wo n't drive the price up .
 When you 're doing mail-order , you 're never really sure of what you 're getting . With this one , I got lucky . It 's good-looking and is an ace at wicking away moisture during sweaty workouts . The material also means it does n't wrinkle . I 've gotten a lot of compliments on it , and this is my go-to shirt for hot-weather workouts . I bought it in black , but think I 'll get some more in other colors .
 It 's a good shirt . Holds up well in the laundry . Light weight and an overall good workout shirt .
 Great shirts for working out , playing basketball or any other sweat inducing activity . Not flashy but definitely comfortable and dries quickly.Price was very good as well .
 I use this shirt as an undershirt while officiating basketball and it 's excellent when it comes to dissipating away moisture while running up and down the court . It also does n't shrink unless of course you put the dry cycle on extra hot . Do n't too that or you 'll end up with a shirt 2 sizes smaller . Believe me I 've done that by accident .
 I have finally found a shirt that is comfortable and does not soak in the sweat and become heavy ! Great for running in the gym and outside . I have used these shirts for all of my races and at the gym and have no complaints . It drys failry quick if you are running a long time outside . Just do n't put this shirt in the dryer it will eventually start to shrink in odd ways ! Definetly will buy a lot more of these shirts before they stop selling them !
 I 'm 6 foot 3 and I would prefer the length of this shirt to be longer but its acceptable on me . I like the feel and fit while working out but I 'm not sure how durable this shirt will be after a few washes.I would order this product again if needed . Item was received as ordered in a timely manner .
 The quality of this shirt is good however the color is more of a maroon , and not a cardinal red . but nice shirt just a darker red/maroon
 I use this shirt for weight-bearing workouts . I also have Russell whisking shirts with sleeves , but this one has a perk that the others do n't
 Will get more . Comfortable under uniforms etc. . easy wash and dry fast . Color stays w/o fade . Great true fitDurable
 Great Tennis shirt at an even better price . This shirt was a present for my brother in law and he loved it .
 I have been wearing these for a number of years and they are the best . All colors look good but I prefer the black as it covers up sweat from a tough workout the best . That is one of my big issues with the cotton workout shirts is after a workout they look terrible . These are also made very well and if taken care of will last a long time , a few years for sure . I think these are simply the best workout shirt for the money on the market . I am a bit disappointed today in that they do not have any in stock to order , bummer .
 This shirt is just what I wanted . A sleeveless shirt that wicks . My girlfriend tried to help me and washed my biking clothes . When I put it on the next day I noticed all the stitching around the sleeves was coming apart . I asked her if she ran it through the dryer and she said yes . This would probably have happened anyway , but the dryer definitely sped up the process . This is a cheap shirt that comfortably does the job .
 Feels great and keeps me cool on runs . No complaints about this shirt . I think I 'll order a couple more . Plus it 's a lot lower cost than most other similar shirts .
 Purchased the item online and when item was received , I was pleased to see that the quality was good and image on online site was a good pick of the real thing ... thanks for the listing .
 Cotton is the way to go and the shrinking was expected but now the comfort is well worth it and looks nice .
 He was very pleased with this jersey ! He loves to wear his team apparel on game days and was happy with the quality

 A wonderful inexpensive option for swimming for those with a sight problem . My son finally was able to see while in the swimming pool , for P.E. class . It 's worth having a couple pairs .
 Switched to this from my current teardrop style racquet . Once I adjusted the vibration damper properly , I noticed more power in my swing and less vibration on my elbow when I hit . I am an intermediate C level player and find this racquet is pretty forgiving of hits off the `` sweet spot . '' I like it .
 I bought this racquet in November of 2011 and have been playing twice a week since I bought it , hold up great and have had not problems .
 This was a replacement racquet - after 5yrs . of crashing to the walls & floor my favorite racquet bit the dust . I was so glad to find it again . Light weight but extremely strong .
 love this product works like a dream , would recommend this product 100 percent . . try it for yourself you will love it .
 shipping and handleing were great . but not knowing how it plays , I am a diffent player now . This company needs a demo program , so that the buyer could feel the power or the sweet spot . forehand strock etc. . I know this would be tough on the stores or the sellers but racquets are too expensive for guessing . now I have a hundred dollar racquet that i might have to sell because i can not play with it !
 My new racquet has been great so far.I have n't had any real problems hitting the sweet spot and it is very durable .

 My daughter rides 2-3 horses daily , year-round , and I ride as much as possible . We both have had several pair of these Tuff Rider Ribb breeches , and they last forever ! No special washing/drying needed , which as horse women we do n't have time to mess with . The fabric does not attract dirt and hay as some other fabrics do . I especially like the zipper pocket - perfect size for horse treats or my cell phone .
 These breeches are super comfy and they last FOREVER ! They do n't need any special care which is a plus when you work with horses everyday . They 're great for schooling , but are nice enough for the show ring .
 I received the ribbed TuffRider breech in the mail today . The fit is very comfortable and flattering , if you like a waist high rise . Was n't sure if I would be okay with the deep purple , and , as it is actually not a deep purple , but in actuality more of a medium blue purple with periwinkle colored knee patches , it may not be for everyone , especially if you are color-shy . But I like the color and the comfort , so am keeping the breeches . The front zip clasp has a somewhat finicky closure , but once you get the hang of it , it 's fine . Very stretch , non-binding , so if you are true to size , it should be quite comfortable . They seem to be fairly light weight , so I plan to use them in the peak of summer heat . These are a colorful keeper .
 These pants are awesome . Size is great and extremely comfortable . The color is n't Taupe , however . It 's more like a Tan or Camel . Other than that , they are terrific and especially considering the price . Extremely well-made . I will definitely purchase again .
 Comfortable . I bought these for casual wear . They look great with boots and a shirt . They do finish at the ankle -LRB- regular length -RRB- . I would buy other colors in this style .
 The pants fit really nice even after giving birth to my baby I tried these pants on 6 weeks later and they still has a nice fit . The only thing I did not like are the logos on the inside of the knee patch . Had I saw that prior to me purchasing them I would not have bought them . I personally do not like the logo of people 's companies on my clothes

 The previous owners had left this bicycle outdoors in the weather and the headset bearings were totally rusted and fell apart , making steering difficult . I found the replacement bearings on-line for a good price and they fit perfectly .
 Slides tightly on my saiga and locks firmly in place . Has enough height on my gun to clear the iron sights and they are still usable . It is also centered well which was a problem with a different brand that I bought . Good mount overall .
 I bought this scope rail for my GP WASR-10 / 63 . It 's incredibly solid and works great with my BSA multidot scope . It is the genuine article , not the cheap knockoffs from Kalinka . All retaining pins are in place.My one problem -LRB- which very well could just be with my AK -RRB- is that it will not go all the way forward on my side mount . It stops about 1/4 inch from the leading edge . The clamp holds it solidly in place with some adjustment though.Overall it 's a good buy . Also , the fact that it 's a high rise rail that allows for the use of fixed sights as well is a plus .
 I tested twelve high end racquets before I bought the Ektelon O3 Silver . I told the sales rep that I did n't want to know how much they cost or even who manufactured them . And I did n't look at the frame to see who manufactured them . I hit for well over half an hour and it came down to two racquets . As it happened , both were Ektelon , and this O3 Silver turned out to cost slightly less than the other finalist . I did n't know that until I had made my decision.Now the racquet has developed a few small cracks due to poor restringing -LRB- I 'm never going to that place again -RRB- and I am in the market to replace it with the identical model . That should tell you how much I like it.It 's so light in my hand that sometimes I wonder where all that power comes from . I 'm 66 years old and someone once said that they 'd never seen anyone hit the ball that hard . It was a perfect rollout from the back wall and it sounded like an M80 going off .
 He was very pleased with this jersey ! He loves to wear his team apparel on game days and was happy with the quality
 What I would think would be the best advertisement for this lock happened two nights ago . I work in a place late at night , actually heard someone moving the chain link fence that the bicycle was locked to . Heard a few unkind words when they finally noticed the lock and decided to go elsewhere.One note , the holder for the lock is n't very durable so I would n't count on it lasting . In a few weeks after purchase , the holder started disintegrating and would n't secure the lock any longer . However , I do n't feel that the lock holder is a very important part of the lock , the lock has to secure your bicycle which this lock does .
 Lock is very easy to use , it came with 3 keys so I 'm able to confidently and securely use it anywhere . I would have given it 5 - stars except I had to mount it on the top frame of my mountain bike because the insert that attaches the lock to the bracket is on the u part of the lock , see products ' photo . The weight of the lock would not allow me to mount it any other way without it flopping to one side of the bike . The insert for the bracket that could have resolved this only made the brackets screws unusable , it separated the brackets ends so far apart the screws could not span the distance . This is easily solvable by getting screws the same diameter as the ones that came with the lock from your local hardware store , just measure the gap and get them to cover that distance .
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 This is an amazing gun ! I just bought 2 because they where so cheap . It 's definitely a $ 50 gun , and for $ 13 it 's a great deal.It shoots about 15 feet accurately then curves down or to the left.It 's has a very realistic feel.One of the guns i have misfires and then shoots 2 BBs the next shot , but it only happens every 30 shots . The other is fine.I enjoy this gun immensely it 's a great secondary and an amazing gun in itself.So for $ 13 I would say you should definitely get this gun . It 's worth that and more , plus it comes with a nice sample pack of yellow BBs . You definitely need to buy this amazing gun !
 This gun is awsome it 's very solid in your hand and it also has a cock lever that if you pull back strikes a metal plate it has a 16 round magazine . It is also a spring operated gun . The box did ` nt say where it was from . Another thing it comes with is a sample bag of bright yellow bbs . Overall I would say a very nice purchase i recomend it .
 The 9-Spike Lite is light and comfortable . The support is good considering the lightness of the shoe .

 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 I saw a review here from 2006 , where someone said they got tossed from a game for using this product ... I just wanted to make sure that everyone knows that these grips are definitely legal in just about all divisions now !
 The product takes bat grips to another level ! Makes me feel like the bat is part of my hand . Awesome product for elevating your play at the plate !
 Awesome product , definitely helps with my hitting . Was skeptical at first because I 've never used one of these before but love it . Trying to order more for my other two high end bats but seller is currently out of stock . Will pounce on a few more the second they become available .
 Was introduced to this product by a friend after trying it for a while I now have one on each of the 4 bats I own and my son has them on his 2 bats as well for Mustang league play you have a better feel for the bat with this grip the bat rolls of your fingers nicely no hard vibration when making contact on your lower hand and overall a way more comfortable grip a great product for those players looking for any edge they can find
 Bat grip feels great and the looks to . It 's a little smaller than it seems on the picture but I do n't have a problem with that cause you can rounded with your hands more efficiently .

 i recently purchased a brand new racquectEktelon O Blue Racquet Ball Racquetas i have started to play more seriously with friends and even in leagues at my health club . For the record i am a `` B '' or `` B + '' rated player , not that has any influence on the product but i had never considered the difference in playing with a better racquect and or a glove because my previous starter racquect always fit my needs and the fairly infrequent misplaced shots were never a concern or factored that much into my play.After having played a few games with my new racquect with people who i have previously beat i realized my control and placement were off because the racquect was shifting slightly when i was playing.I spent about 17.99 at a local big sports store for this glove , and feel its a greater improvement to my game that my 79.99 racquect was.The actual glove is super super sticky and tacky , i can actually still hear it peel off the grip after playing or when going for water . Ive used the glove for about 3 or 4 sessions now and noticed some of the seams are splitting a little and some strings are loose , but structurally it is still sound . If one game it actually splits i plan on asking Ektelon for a replacement and will update my review should that happen.Great product , if you are dead set on purchasing from amazon however i would suggest going to a sports store and simply opening a few packages and trying the gloves out before actually buying one , because the sizes and strange . Most stores should be ok with you doing this as long as you repackage them appropriately , if youre uncomfortable with this , simply ask .
 I have 4 pairs of different Ektelon glove . This is a very good one . The other most recent one with the Koolmax material and some padding on the back of the glove are not very good for playing . Buy this model .
 Comfortable glove , highly recommend it . Kept it 's tackiness for a long time . Do n't like that the inside bleeds onto my hand when I sweat though , but most gloves I 've used to that .
 I wear this glove at least 5 times/week whether while playing a game or just doing drills . It is comfortable and so far is holding up very well . I have had this glove for only a few months but appears to be better constructed than many I 've owned previously . I had to finally discard my previous glove due to my hand being stained with dye from that glove after I would play a game . So far this has not occurred with the Ektelon glove . The price is also quite reasonable for this item and I highly recommend it .
 For the price of this glove on Amazon , I would n't use any other glove . Light weight and tacky . I 've used the Head gloves and I ended up throwing them away so I would n't use them again .
 Although the glove is a racquetball glove I purchased it as a driving glove . It is the second I have bought in five years . I love it for its feel of the wheel , its quick on and off due to the velcrow feature . I thought the price was a tad too high , though .
 This is a great mid-range workhorse glove that delivers . As long as you do n't let it get soaking wet it will last longer than most on the market and it keeps a decent mid-level tackiness throughout its life .
 It 's a great glove , the only negative I can say is that it 's TOO sticky . Does n't seem like that should be a problem , but it takes some getting used to . Though I 'm sure it 'll wear off a bit with use .
 Very comfortable ! The palm material is nice and tacky so holding on to my racquet is easy and blister free . I highly recommend this glove . The price is right too .
 At this time , there is a 1 star rating by someone for this glove . I do n't know why folks give crappy ratings for products when there are shipping issues . A shipping issue does not mean the product is crappy.Anyways , I digress.I came across this glove on Amazon and ordered it due to the great reviews folks were giving it . While I waited for it to arrive I played a few games bare handed which I figured would be a great way to compare once I did get the glove.The glove finally arrived and I have to say - it makes a world of a difference . The racket no longer rotated in my hand and I was able to craft the shots I wanted to do.The great thing is that I do n't feel any of the stitching or seams and it starts to feel like second skin as I play more and more with it .
 I am not an expert in the game and I play just for fun . For my purposes , this glove has turned out just right . I have bigger-than-average hands , but not too big . I went with the XL size , which to my pleasant surprise was n't as big as I expected . So if you have big hands , try the glove in a store before you buy online .
 i had never played with a glove before so i figured while i had the card out and i was shopping what the hell . i 'm quite glad that i did because it changed my game.there is a semi-sticky surface on the glove that really grips to the racquet handle . after two weeks it has started to become a little less tacky , but i do not notice this during gameplay.i 'm not sure how this measures from one glove to the next , but i do very much enjoy this product . the fit is nice , and i dont even notice i have it on once i start playing .
 This is my first Racquetball glove . and I have played only about 5 times yet . Feels performs and looks great . Let 's see how it lasts ... Usually I sweat a lot and holding the racquet is real problem. , but this glove performs impressive
 This case seems well made and should hold up for many years of use . I like the large side pocket so I can carry along my full size Remington 28 '' barrel in a gun sock while my 870 Express is fitted with my 20 '' deer barrel . And , there 's still room for some ammo and a few accessories.I would give it 5 stars except that it was priced a bit high , came in only one color and had no sling for shoulder carry -LRB- a nice to have option -RRB- .
 This is a nice gun sock . It is a very good material and will protect my investment . My TC is protected
 I bought this to use with my oilseed reformer . It is sturdy , easy to hold on to -LRB- not slippery -RRB- and keeps me safe when doing standing exercises . Perfect height too .
 My daughter rides 2-3 horses daily , year-round , and I ride as much as possible . We both have had several pair of these Tuff Rider Ribb breeches , and they last forever ! No special washing/drying needed , which as horse women we do n't have time to mess with . The fabric does not attract dirt and hay as some other fabrics do . I especially like the zipper pocket - perfect size for horse treats or my cell phone .
 These breeches are super comfy and they last FOREVER ! They do n't need any special care which is a plus when you work with horses everyday . They 're great for schooling , but are nice enough for the show ring .
 I received the ribbed TuffRider breech in the mail today . The fit is very comfortable and flattering , if you like a waist high rise . Was n't sure if I would be okay with the deep purple , and , as it is actually not a deep purple , but in actuality more of a medium blue purple with periwinkle colored knee patches , it may not be for everyone , especially if you are color-shy . But I like the color and the comfort , so am keeping the breeches . The front zip clasp has a somewhat finicky closure , but once you get the hang of it , it 's fine . Very stretch , non-binding , so if you are true to size , it should be quite comfortable . They seem to be fairly light weight , so I plan to use them in the peak of summer heat . These are a colorful keeper .
 These pants are awesome . Size is great and extremely comfortable . The color is n't Taupe , however . It 's more like a Tan or Camel . Other than that , they are terrific and especially considering the price . Extremely well-made . I will definitely purchase again .
 Comfortable . I bought these for casual wear . They look great with boots and a shirt . They do finish at the ankle -LRB- regular length -RRB- . I would buy other colors in this style .
 I really love the way these breeches fit , they look great and with a pair of riding boots . i would reccommend
 The pants fit really nice even after giving birth to my baby I tried these pants on 6 weeks later and they still has a nice fit . The only thing I did not like are the logos on the inside of the knee patch . Had I saw that prior to me purchasing them I would not have bought them . I personally do not like the logo of people 's companies on my clothes
 I have been using these for about 6 months now and they have great grip . They are comfortable and my hands do n't get too sweaty in them .
 Just bought a couple more . This is a good glove for all-arouid play and it is very popular here , too .
 This racquet had been great preventing the racquet from slipping in my hand.I usually wear out the glove in high friction areas before palm grip wears out .
 The number one reason I buy a racquetball glove is to hold onto the racquet . Whether the glove is dry or dripping wet with sweat , I am able to hold the racquet with minimal grip pressure , even with the pinky off . This glove keeps the racquet from twisting in your hand , even on those shots struck outside racquet 's sweet spot.Ektelon paid attention to the details in designing this glove . Durable leather that drys soft , paneled finger design , spandex inserts , and neoprene knuckle protection . -LRB- Why knuckle protection is an important feature is unknown to me . If you 're diving for shots then you 're probably losing . At least that has been my experience . -RRB- This glove does retain a little more moisture than others , so a spare or two are recommended.This is the best gripping glove that I 've used in 30-years of playing racquetball . Less grip pressure and less racquet twisting means more power , more control , and more winners . What is there to not like ?
 Good fit , good grip , lasting longer than any other glove I 've tried . Will buy it again .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 The 9-Spike Lite is light and comfortable . The support is good considering the lightness of the shoe .
 I went online to check their size chart . My hand would fit an X-small . I 'm female , 5 ' 2 '' , small boned , and weigh around 117 . One of the reviews mentioned that she got a small and needed a medium , so I heeded her advice . Maybe it 's just because of my nails , but I 'm glad I ordered the small instead of an x-small . It fits just right . I 'm ordering a second one for my sister . Very prompt delivery , by the way .
 The last glove I purchased slipped and slid all over the racquet . This one `` fits like a glove , '' and has the perfect amount of tack for holding my racquet . Mind you , it is white , so if your racquet is black , your glove will also be.I am a tall , large woman and ordered a men 's large . It fits beautifully.Excellent purchase !
 I 've never used any other racquetball gloves before , and I 'm not a huge racquetball player , but I bought it and it really helped my grip , it fits well and its comfortable , and it looks good . I 've only used it for like 4 games , so I ca n't really attest to its durability down the road , but so far so good . I would definately buy it again .
 Bought this with the Ektelon Power Pack Plus Starter Kit , Grip 3 5/8 and it like the way it feels .
 I used to play a lot of Racquetball and started using this glove to keep my hand from sweating too much and loosing the grip . I now play , teach and coach competitive badminton . The glove is perfect for this also . Very thin leather lets you feel the handle . The glove works great .
 I have bought Ektleon for many years and I am always satisfied . This is a high quality glove . I have played for 25 years .
 Fits well , wears down quicker than expected . If you play more than twice a week , you might want to get some extras or go with a stronger glove .
 it was exactly what i need it . big difference between playing with glove or without . the only problem
 In the past two months of biweekly 90-minute racquetball sessions , I found the glove -LRB- in medium -RRB- to be true to size , durable , and quite comfortable to play with . The white material on the palm side did leave some white residue/stains on my racket handle during initial use , but no big deal . The top of the glove has a breathable mesh-like material that helps release heat . Why buy a more expensive glove when this bargain provides excellent grip , comfort and durability ?
 The glove is great , there is however an issue with the size . When you order , you can select a size -LRB- although there is no reference for newbies like me -RRB- , I selected large , but the glove is a bit too small for me . The gloves are unisex , maybe that 's the problem.Overall , the glove gives good grip on the racket , even in warm temperatures grip maintains .
 Works exactly as I thought it would . Have used the product before , so no surprises here . I 'm happy with how quickly the seller was able to send the glove .
 This glove is great . Best grip ever.I hope that Ektelon continues to make it ...
 I am not a professional Racquetball player but I do play very ofen and these are one of the best gloves.They absort sweat , grip is perfect no wear and tear after using them for 4 months . Good till now.Only draw back is I got them in white color and they are no more white now . They look dirty after all these months.I guess thats the only color they have .
 although target is only 10 inches tall and 5 inches wide it shows exactly where you hit it . has a nice slot where the bbs come out .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 I could n't resist buying this toy , even though I * knew * my daughter was too young to play with it -LRB- 5wks when I ordered -RRB- . It was such a charming idea and I figured I could use it for decoration until she grew some . When it arrived , I ended up amusing the two of us as I played with and she watched , figuring out what each segment of Charlie does . Now , at almost two months , she reaches for this toy and likes for me to hold it up for her to touch and look at -LRB- she 's still too young to hold it - it 's fairly heavy , but I guess since it 's for 9 month old babies ... -RRB- . Charlie even motivates her to creep toward him during tummy time . I love this beautiful toy and am certain she 'll like it for years to come . Also , not only does it have the look of a toy to be passed down , it certainly has the durability - my pit bull puppy loves to steal baby toys and this is among his favorites , but he has n't managed to injure it ... yet ... ; -RRB-
 This toy is too cute and my three month old loves it . It is a little heavy so he will probably enjoy it a lot more when he can pick it up on his own and play with it . For now he is happy enough to just look at all the fun colors and patterns and he likes to hear the noises the differrent sections make . Would recommend this toy .
 My son is nine months old and loves this toy . He likes looking at the bright colors as well as feeling the different textures on charlie 's body . He likes the different sounds it makes whenever he plays with it .
 My daughter played with this when she was a toddler . Very nice . The bright colors and cute design made it a favorite .

 Love this hat . As a former Chicagoan it brings back memories of the Cubbies . It is cute and durable . It does n't leave a mark on my forehead either from wearing it all afternoon . Great hat .
 This model is great for anyone especially if you love history horses . The Seattle Slew model is great not only because of his neck thing of roses and his tall dark and handsome shape but because he was a TRIPLE CROWN WINNER ! He 's just an awsome model and would be a great addition to your collection . The only complaints I can think of are that you have to be very delicate with the flower thing or the flowers start falling off and Seattle Slew 's back left leg bends in a little bit which prevents him from standing on carpet evan though he can stand on a hard evan surface . Make sure to check out the models , War Admiral -LRB- Triple Crown Winner -RRB- and Seabiscuit to .
 This is a wonderful piece with the nice addition of Slew 's blanket of roses from his winning Kentucky Derby . The likeness is remarkable , the quality and attention to detail top-notch . Breyer horses have come a long way since I was a kid , that 's for sure ! Slew has an honored place next to Affirmed and Secretariat in my china cabinet .
 a quality replica of a quality horse . rip , ss . the wreath is a bit flimsy , buyer beware .
 The 9-Spike Lite is light and comfortable . The support is good considering the lightness of the shoe .
 This sword is a spot on replica of the art work from the Drizzt books .
 I purchased a pair of these tekko with the velcro and a pair with the kohaze . Both were excellent . Very durable and have held up well . One improvement would be the heavey duty elastic like the kyahan have to keep them tight.I 've tried a lot of tekko and these are by far the best .
 Ordered this for a Christmas present and it arrived on time.I really like the gold and silver threads running thru the throw . It was better quality than I expected . My daughter screamed when she opened it and kissed and kissed the hugh pic of Tony.I was looking for Tony Stewart items and was happy to find this throw . I am a very happy customer .
 After shopping around for a 110v power connection to my newly remodel vw bus project , I found this 20amp plug would exceed my needs . It fit fine and it 's only flaw was - they did n't tell me it was a cross pin design on one pin . -LRB- - l -RRB- . Which is not really a problem as that is available at ACE . AND may keep people from `` borrowing '' my power cord .
 I have two of these on my big boat.They have a positive twist lock for the cable and then it thread on for a tight waterproof fit . I wish the stanchions on the dock locked so well.I had no problem with the wiring . It came correctly assembled and both of these have been in continuous use all winter without any issue . One of them has been in service for a year without problems .
 The plug was exactly what I wanted . BUT , when I hooked the plug up it flipped the breaker . I found that the factory had missed marked the positive and negative poles . The black screw indicates the hot and they had it on the ground side . As soon as I reversed the wires , it worked correctly .

 This product does what it says . Prevents rust much longer that most other brands . Since I display guns it 's critical that rust be prevented .

 We have twin boys and they love playing on the playmat . We 've had it for 2 months now and have no complains so far .
 However , I must say , that it 's way too expensive for a playmat and gym ! My gymni was half this -LRB- I believe -RRB- . I do n't care what it 's made of , 79.99 will buy a BUNCH of diapers ! I 'd rather keep my good old gymni . It does look really comfy though ! I 'd love to know from someone who 's used it how good it works !
 I got the Gymini playmat as a shower gift for my first daughter , and did n't really like using it because I have hardwood floors and it did n't seem too comfy . Then when my newest baby was coming , -LRB- she 's 3 months now -RRB- , I saw this one and bought it . I actually paid $ 90.00 for it at a boutique toy store and am not one bit sorry . My 2 year old loves to `` play baby '' by laying on the mat and pretty much abusing it , -LRB- whenever my little one is n't on it , of course -RRB- but when I put my little one down on it , she is so content ! She seems to love smiling and cooing to the cuddly creatures and I 'm not worried about her being on the hard floor . It is really a great value for the money ! I 'll by more Mamas and Papas toys in the future . High quality and style !
 a very well made and beautiful product . My 6 month old baby boy started using it since he was 3 months and still loves to play with it . He seems very happy and comfortable in it . It is worth the extra money .
 Nothing compares to the quality and enertainment that this play mat provides . I 've used it for almost a year with my daughter and she still loves it . The gymni may be cheaper but it does n't even come close to the Lotty Ladybird collection . I have both and would never waste my money on another gymni again when i could have this wonderful , stimualting , developmental toy instead .
 I just bought the Dylan Dog Playmat , basically the same thing , but a dog , for my month and a half old daughter . I brought it home and put her on it , and she loves it . She just kept smiling at the mirror above her head , and she was interested in all of the toys hanging around her . This is really the first thing that she has shown a lot of interest in besides her Pupsqueak toy . I ca n't wait until she wakes up from her nap to have her on it again.Besides all that , I think the construction and looks of this mat are the best that I have seen . I love the fact that it is fluffy like a pillow instead of flat on the floor like the others . I would highly reccommend this mat to anyone that I know .
 Our daughter did n't like it until 4 months ... now she loves it ! It is soft/comfy ... but make sure your infant does not roll off onto a harder floor surface -LRB- put it on a mat -RRB- . The dangling toys are fun .
 I bought this because I liked the reviews so far and was looking for something that had more padding than the other mats out there -LRB- we have hard wood floors throughout the house -RRB- . I could n't be more delighted with Lotty ! The pillow mat is great and the fun toys are educational and great for our 3 month old . Mamas and Papas toys are always of great quality and this is no different !
 This playmat is well worth the money . My 7 week old daughter loved it the instant she first used it ... and she was young for it . And so , every day she becomes more and more able bodied and therefore enjoys it more and more . Definitely choose this mat over the others . You wo n't be disappointed . She is now 10 weeks and plays in it nearly every day , loving it every time.New Mom
 This is a wonderful playmat . It looks small and rectangular in the pictures , but is quite big and almost round . I was thinking about buying the sunshine safari one because it looked bigger , but this one , in my opinion , is big enough . It is extremely well-padded and comfortable for my baby , even on our hardwood floors . I bought it for her when she was 6 weeks old - she was not interested in it all - by the time she was 9 weeks old , she started noticing the adorable hanging toys on top of her . She loves it and I can see that the older she gets , the more she will enjoy it . I always wanted a really nice playmat for my kids -LRB- I now have 5 -RRB- and could n't find a nice enough one . Now I found one and I 'm so happy with it ! I recommend this as a gift for someone else - it comes packaged nicely and would make an impressive gift , or for your own baby . Enjoy !
 We have a one month old and she loves the dangling toys . Our tummy time now is on the mat and she stays longer because she has colors to look at ! Thanks for a GREAT product !! Addie 's Mom & Dad

 It 's by no means a toy . Anyway , day one-opened box and confused about plugs . Oh wow , the ac and the dc are both built into the unit . Cool . Plugged in for about 10 hours on ac and aired up our raft . So far so good . We 'll see how well it works in a year or two as the Coleman one we bought two years ago only worked like 3 times and it was dead after that . Wanted something made better so we 'll see how this stands up . Let charge overnite and worked fine . Aired up raft quickly . Also used to air up dog bed air mattress . They say to charge everyonce in a while even if you do n't use it or it wo n't hold a charge like other items I have .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 I 'm smacking my forehead but maybe my review will help someone else . I thought I was getting 3 disks because of the photo . I realize now that 's pretty dumb considering the price but I do think the photo is misleading . But it 's a fine quality discus for practice so I ca n't knock them
 This practice discus is as shown on the site . My nephew plans to use it for middle school and high school track practice .
 came as described , and just what i was needing . practice , practice , practise.the price was right and they should last as long as a tire
 This discus is perfect for practice . It has a nice feel in the hand and is very sturdy for an inexpensive disc .
 Excellent product , excellent value . Quality construction . Great training aid . This discus is a very nice product for the money . I would highly recommend .
 I have been a runner for three years and am going to be throwing and running next season . I purchased this discus to use as a roughneck to practice with and develop my throw properly . The weight feels correct and it 's really durable . The rubber is not perfect and mine has a small bump just off the center . This does not however affect the throw or flight path any and is hardly noticeable . You 'd only see it if you were looking for it . If you are looking for something that will last and will be great for practice , this is definitely what you should be looking at .
 Training for the up coming Senior Olympics in STL , MO wanted a discus to practice with but did n't want to spend a lot.So this was a great item ...
 good functional practice disc . Stands up to lots of bangs and landings . I use it often and no nicks or breaks .
 Its good for practicing the real thing except this has alot more grip , never tested weight but it feels the same compared to a metal disc , the outer edge is a little crooked but it IS a practice disk
 My son has used these practice discus a couple of times and says they are fine for practice . They are a good price and the shipping was reasonable ... as opposed to other discuses with similar price but astronomical shipping . I would recommend these .
 Reasonable price and good construction . It was a bit larger than I expected , especially for a smaller kid . I would say that these would fit a child 12 -18 yrs old . I gave these to another friend 's daughter and purchased Bike jr knee pads for my kids as they offer various sizes .
 These knee pads are great for the little girl just starting out . They fit perfectly for the skinny legs ! Sturdy material and good quality !
 This sturdy and weighty piece of weather-monitoring equipment looks quite lovely hanging on our living room wall.I was a bit skeptical at the price , but after reading many helpful reviews on Amazon and other sites , I decided to go ahead and risk getting this barometer , sight-unseen as it were.I am not disappointed . it appears to be very solid , it came with a simple yet almost ingenious way to hang it on the wall ... easy and allowing one to take the barometer down as desired.Easy to calibrate -LRB- if necessary -RRB- and very pretty in it 's simplicity . I am very pleased with this purchase and would be quite inclined to buy another one as a gift should the appropriate situation arise .
 This item is being given as a gift and so I ca n't yet speak to the fitness of the product . Dealing with the seller all went well . Thank You .
 lets just say these bradheads are awesome . i havnt got to try them on a turkey yet but i grabbed a 2 inch hickory limb and cut it in half the first time . two blades broke the third time . will def buy these again
 I ordered this machine for my 70-yr . old mother who has high blood pressure . I am hoping her medication along with regular aerobic exercise will help lower her blood pressure . The machine is manufactured in China , but is obviously American designed . It came by a freight truck and took two people to unload the box contents . It took me 2 to 3 hours to assemble all the parts . I have used this machine for a couple of weeks so far and my impression is that this is a very decent machine in this price range . The quality and features naturally do not compare with a gym-quality machine costing several thousand dollars , but then again I only paid $ 600 for it , so I evaluate this machine with this in mind.From the specs and appearance the EX55 is identical to model EX22 , except that the EX55 has a larger LCD screen and a couple of extra largely unimportant features on the electronic console unit . The EX55 is one step below the EX33 in features . The must-have features I looked for before settling on the Horizon Fitness EX55 were
 I ordered this machine because I could never find the time to hit the gym . I 'd done extensive research on the internet looking for something that will hold up to almost daily use but would also fit my budget . I finally settled on this machine based on reviews of similar models , as well as reviews about Horizon ellipticals in general . I chose this one over the higher-priced models because it had everything I needed . If you want a fan , speakers , more programs , etc. , then you 'll have to pay extra for it!It took me roughly two hours to put it together , which was n't bad . That time includes opening and unpacking the box , as well as moving the base and flywheel to the location I wanted it . If you can put IKEA furniture together , then this should be fairly easy for you ! It 's designed well and looks very attractive.The machine is very quiet and glides smoothly . While the programs leave something to be desired , I 'm not complaining because I set it on manual and do my own workouts . I 'm only 5 ' 2 '' and the pedals and handlebars still work well for me , as well as my 6 ' 2 '' husband . The heart rate monitor takes about 10 seconds to stabilize , which is n't a big deal for me , I figure as long as it works I 'm good to go!Overall I 'm VERY pleased with this machine . It did n't break the bank and is a sturdy , well-built machine .
 I really loved that I was able to make my workout a little more convinient . Although assembly was a little complicated it was and ok experience . A little confused with the AC plug as it was not located in an abviouse location and it was not noted in the manual . I had to call in to Horizon and they advised me where it belongs . Monitor doesnt light up.For the price you cant beat it .
 Out of the three airsoft guns I have purchased , this is by far my favorite . Assuming you are skilled , you really can hit a quarter from 25 feet . Since it is spring loaded I do n't have to worry about batteries . You just have to be sure that you use a quality airsoft bb of the correct size and weight . I use it simply for practicing my aim and technique , it may not be right for you if you are using it for other purposes . It can be a little difficult to cock , but that should tell you that it definitely has some power behind it . I have been using it for over a year without any problems .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 We chose these gloves & I am so glad we did ! They were a quality glove at a great price .
 It 's a good buy for the money.I ended up purchasing several more.Bought some for my friends too.She liked it .
 I decided to try the Intech Ti-Cabrettta Glove , Ladies left handed medium , after being disappointed with the gloves I was currently purchasing . This glove was very true to size and it is very durable compared to more expensive gloves . I have 10 rounds on one glove and it is still in excellent shape . I would recommend this glove , especially for the price .
 This is the first ladies Intech glove I have purchased , but my husband has been using Intech gloves for several years and loves them . The quality is high and the price reasonable . It is on par with -LRB- or even better than -RRB- the name brand gloves on the market . Hard to find leather golf gloves for this price . Fit is good too . Highly recommend !!!!
 Even tho the fingers are a tiny bit too long , the glove fits well and feels good . The leather is nice and soft .
 Glad to find a glove that was available for left hand and right hand . I wear both , so is nice to have gloves that match . Price was great . Will buy again .
 I 've tried different golf gloves on but this one fits perfect and feelsgreat ...
 Great quality and value . This glove is a good fit for my long narrow fingers . Breathes and moves well . I would recommend and will buy more !
 I bought these for my daughter who 's just taking up the game . Soft and good fit , she loves them . She does n't have enough experience to compare and I could n't fit into them , but they appear to be good quality and she reports that they have good grip and are comfy .
 These gloves are great . They are soft and the price is unbeatable.Good as Taylormade or Footjoy . Try them & you wo n't be disappointed .
 I had an occasion to use this glove on my last golf outing . It was well fitting and comfortable . I had originally purchased it as an `` extra '' for my bag . I like it so well , it may be my go to next time out .
 I bought 4 pair of these for a goodie bag for one of our tournaments . The ladies loved them , they held up as well as more expensive gloves . They are true to size , no wiggle room . If you like a loose fitting glove get a larger size . The price and color are perfect for any Breast Cancer function .
 For me it really does not matter what gloves I wear ; I go through these things like most babies go through disposable diapers . No matter what brand or make I buy , the simply do not hold up like you would think.Well rather than paying top dollar constantly , I have been buying these gloves . They last no longer than the more expensive but they fit well -LRB- they run a bit small by the way -RRB- , feel `` right , '' give me a great grip in my club and most important ... they do not cost a King 's ransom ! I can buy these three and four at a time and I am never left without.Using the same product over and over for me is a big deal ... it is like I use the same brand balls , shoes , socks ... hey , I even use the same brand of knickers when I golf ! -LRB- Note that I do change ... I have more than one pair ! -RRB- It is a psychological thing , I know , but what are you going to do ? Anyway , due to the cost I can stick to the same brand here and not grow broke buying gloves.These work fine for me and I will stick with them .
 Good quality ladies golf gloves . True to size . Definitely would purchase again . This is an excellent price for Cabretta leather .
 These gloves are awesome in quality , especially for the price . I have a Nike golf glove , and these are much thicker and have a solid feel to them . It stretches very nicely . And I love that the whole palm is covered in real leather . I will definitely be ordering from this company in the future when I need a new glove .
 Was satisfied with this purchase - however , I have to order the other hand because I did n't know that what hand you are dominant at you actually need the other hand glove ! But other than that it was great quality and good shipping time and condition .
 This is my second purchase of these inexpensive gloves . Great fit and on time delivery .
 I orders an extra small because I have child sized hands . The glove was a perfect fit and has held up to 4 rounds of golf so far . I will order more when I can find them
 Just getting started in golfing , got a set of clubs from a neighbor for free , so I 'm working on getting accessories .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 Let me just say that I like this thing . The machine feels gym quality , and the weight rack is probably better than the bowlex rods.It had free shipping , but the shipping company called and said that unless I was prepared to get it off the back of the truck myself , it would be another 50-dollar charge -LRB- which I paid -RRB- . Probably could have gotten it off , it was in seven separate boxes and total weight was ~ 550 lbs , I believe.That being said , this thing is an absolute beast to assemble . I am pretty handy , used to work with my hands and am now an engineer . It is several hundred steps to put this thing together , and some of them rely on a specfic order . However there were only five instruction `` steps '' included ... each `` step '' was a mechanical drawing with dozens of components on it and often not a clear depiction of where they went.I spent a good 10 hours the first day of assembly and ended up with a number of things wrong . I e-mailed a complaint to their customer service -LRB- still have not heard back -RRB- . Then I found a newer set of directions on their website that was considerably improved . After another two hours , everything is working . Only problem right now is that I paid for the upgraded weights . Turns out that two pieces are supposed to be omitted -LRB- the thing the weights rest on -RRB- , and that is one of the first steps . If I am to assemble properly , probably looking at 2 hours to dissassemble and pull those two pieces out and then another 2 hours to re-assemble . Still have not done it.All in all , the machine is solid , the excersizes feel `` real '' , and I think it will last for many years . That is why it is four stars , I deducted one star due to the terrible instructions included that cost me many hours of assembly time . Since the machine was drop shipped from the manufacturer , there is no excuse for not having the most up to date instructions included!Satisfied with the machine , but be prepared for the assembly .
 The home gym is a winner - good assembly documentation , well-constructed , easy to use -LRB- although only been using it for a week -RRB- . One of the large frame items was manufactured poorly and Body Solid replaced it within one week without any questions.Be aware of the vendor - Big Fitness . After purchasing , I realized that the shipping company was freight shipping , not one of the recognized shippers such as UPS or FEDEX . There are all kinds of restrictions on shipping -LRB- e.g. , drop the shipment at the curb , unload yourself , etc. -RRB- . And the shipping company called twice to reschedule and the system was delivered 1 week later than originally scheduled.Big Fitness was n't particularly helpful about shipping issues and the customer service person was rude . Big Fitness also offered no help on the poorly manufactured part , washing their hands of everything after the sale had been made .
 I purchased this home gym two months ago and am very pleased and excited with the decision . I started exercising -LRB- cardio and dumbbell -RRB- and eating right four months ago . Once I added this home gym , the weight started to fall off and the muscles started to build . In four months , I have lost 34 lbs and 13 % body fat -LRB- 35 % to 22 % -RRB- . One note ; if you have the opportunity to have a professional assemble the gym , do so . It gave me a headache just looking at all of the pieces and took two people who have put many together over three hours .
 It 's got a good weight to it , which I realize really means almost nothing when it comes to actually judging the quality of a watch , but they got the weighting just right -- not too heavy , not too light . The dark centerlinks in the band look like their simply painted that way , but after over a month of use , I have yet to see any sign of wearing off . There 's barely any scuffing/marking of the brushed metal of the rest of the band where it rests against the desk while I 'm typing at the keyboard.Time is easy to see , but it 's still `` busy '' enough to look good . It 's masculine without going overboard , and it 's a large watch without being one of those silly looking giant face watches that Invicta loves so much . They look like something Flavor Flav would hang around his neck . This is a much more normal size man 's watch.It 's taken over as my daily wear default choice , and I anticipate it staying that way indefinitely .
 This watch looks a lot more expensive than it is . It looks like a $ 400 watch and costs a little over $ 100 . I have only had it for a couple of months so I can not speak of reliability yet . However , I am very satisfied so far .
 This is my 3rd Invicta watch and I think it is the best of the 3 . The 1st one I purcahsed is the Elite 4894 and loved it from day 1 . This new watch is just as high quality but not as large as many of the Invicta items . It is a nice change from the size and weight of the Elite.A + + +
 I 'll echo some of the other things that have been written : Substantial watch , but not too big . Feels nice on the wrist.Chunky without being bulky or heavy.The date dial is just about useless . And the seconds stopwatch is seconds only , not 1/10th sec.It definitely only glows in the dark for a few minutes , no matter how long you `` prime '' it with light.The band is very nice and the finish of the SS on the whole watch is beautiful.The bezel only moves counterclockwise.So far , in the week that I 've had it , the time has been spot on -LRB- to the second -RRB- . I calibrated it to my system clock after I had had calibrated IT to the Navy atomic clock.I 'd add that the big second hand is only a stopwatch hand . IOW , it remains at 12:00 unless you need a timer . I thought that was a little weird as I 'm used to a moving second hand . Basically , you rely on the 3:00 dial for your moving seconds.I was happy with the watch at $ 126 . I 'd have been even happier at $ 110 . Fit and finish on the watch is top-notch .
 I own several Invictas and this is my favorite . It looks great , has a sapphire crystal and is substantial but not humongous . The Swiss quartz movement is not as nice as having an automatic but it keeps better time . Highly recommended .
 I 'm a big Oris and Tag guy . I was n't sure what to expect from this product but when it arrived I was extremely pleased . Great quality and craftsmanship . I will be purchasing another Invicta watch .
 This watch is big but very nice . The color combination is very nice and elegant .
 The Invicta sports chronograph is a simply beautiful watch to reveal from the packaging . I already own two Invicta dive watches , and was impressed with those , but am even more impressed with this watch . I have to say I was very pleased with the product , particularly for the price . -LRB- I got it for less than currently listed on the Daily Deal -RRB- I currently have a well known Japanese made quartz sport chronograph that is stainless steel tinged with a gold finish and is very handsome , but I needed another watch that did not contain the gold trim , as I wear a significant amount of white gold jewelry . I needed a watch with these functions that would not cost a lot of money , kept good time and was entirely stainless steel or , as this watch is , stainless steel with black accents . In addition , I was looking for a watch that I could wear when going out , as well as on an everyday basis . This watch will fit the bill nicely.The hands are well proportioned and the watch is easy to read . The face is somewhat difficult to read for those without 20/20 vision , but I also have that problem with all chronographs . The bezel does not move in both directions , as the ad states , although for the price I can live with it . The bezel does , however move quite smoothly . The weight of the watch is hefty , without being too heavy and it feels substantial . It is larger than the dive watch I bought from Amazon , and would look funny on a smaller wrist . Finally , the clasp is unusual and very well made . It would be very tough accidentally open the snap and lose the watch , which has happened to me before on cheaper watches.I would say the watch is well worth the money . It is well built and striking to look at .
 I bought this watch for myself right before father 's day , so I 've been wearing it for several weeks . It 's a very nice watch . The embossed finish on the face of the watch is really much more attractive than the photograph indicates and it 's drawn a lot of compliments . This is a massive watch - it 's larger than most men 's watches and it 's very heavy . That being said , it 's not uncomfortable to wear casually . This watch has two date indicators with one easy-to-read number located at the 4 o-clock spot , and also a calendar dial function with 31 tick marks located at the 6 o-clock spot . To me , the dial calendar is useless as it is hard to read and duplicates a function already on the watch . The stop watch buttons feel a bit squishy to me , with no definite ` click ' to indicate stop and start . Also , the stop watch only measures seconds - no tenths . These complaints are minor though . The overall quality of this watch is very high and I believe it to be an excellent value for a swiss watch . I bought it at the amazon sale price and received the 4 year extended warranty for free . Invicta returned the paperwork on the warranty registration in less than one week .
 I have tried a few chronograph watches from different makers , this one was my favorite .
 i own some models of Invicta , this is another great deal , very well designed , maybe it is not available anymore but i am sure you will find one that you may like around amazon
 The watch is great and good looking , but the only thing my husband did n't care for was the big , white lettering on the black dial .
 Had this watch for a few years now , , Works and looks great ! Always get comments on the looks , , the Automatic works great even if not worn or wound daily !
 Received this item yesterday in the mail.Delivery was quick considering I used the free shipping option -LRB- about a week and a half to get -RRB- . Piece of cake to assemble , instructions are clear and easy to follow and the bolts and nuts are packaged into 8 or so little baggies one for each step in the instruction set -LRB- this way you do n't really have to figure out which bolt they are referring to -RRB- . I assembled it by myself , did n't need more then one person which is nice . The hardest part assembling it by myself was the first step , which is to attach the front stabilizer bar that has wheels on it . This requires you to lift the front end slightly and keep it elevated while you screw this piece on . Once you have it on though it is easy to move at that point because of the wheels.Gave it a try and it runs smooth and quiet for me even with high resistance I can still watch TV without turning the volume to a crazy amount.So far overall I 've found it great to use even though I 've only been using it for a day ; -RRB- The only problem I had was the back right stabilizer bar got dinged and because of that the plastic cap on the end cracked . It is a decorative thing but that has been my only problem . I watched them unload and carry it into my apartment -LRB- Eagle freight -RRB- and they were not gentle at all so that being the only thing broken makes me happy .
 My wife and I assembled this elliptical a week ago and have been using it quite a bit . We love it . The stride length and pedal design make for very smooth rotations , with minimal up and down motion . That was a must for us , since my wife wanted to be able to read magazines while using it . We bought ours from a different online source , and for some reason , it was missing the power adapter . I called technical service at Horizon Fitness , and they immediately shipped an adapter to us in 3 business days . I also called them ~ 3 weeks ago when I was doing research on ellipticals , and they were just as friendly and helpful then . The only other problem was that there was a small crack in the top-right side of the elliptical 's plastic housing , but it is not very noticable , has no chance of getting worse , and is entirely cosmetic . Overall , we are very pleased with our elliptical .
 This elliptical is great , I was able to put it together in 1-2 hours . I 've had it for 2 weeks and so far works like a charm . The only reason I give it 4 stars is that every time I turn the console on it makes a LOUD beep -LRB- by design -RRB- , which is a problem because I usually workout late at night , when the kids are asleep -LRB- loud noises sometimes wake kids up -RRB- . There is a mute option , but it only works after the console is turned on . Other than that -LRB- which is really a minor annoyance -RRB- this machine is great !
 I bought this elliptical machine a few weeks ago . Delivery was no problem - they called the day before to let us know when they would arrive . Assembly , as others have mentioned , is a piece of cake . Each step has a separate bag of parts and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.The machine itself works great , offering a nice range of resistance levels , programs , and information -LRB- heartrate , calories , speed , watts , distance , strides-per-minute , time , etc -RRB- . I chose this model because it was significantly shorter in length than many of the others available , and so far I have not seen any downside to this . It is fairly compact , as ellipticals go , fits in our small space very well , and is surprisingly easy to tilt up and roll around on the front wheels . Overall , it 's a great machine and I 'm very happy with it.I only have 2 minor complaints . The first someone else mentioned - it emits 3 loud beeps when you turn it on . You can turn off the beep once the machine is on -LRB- and it emits a beep to let you know it 's off too ! -RRB- , but if you are trying to be quiet , this is especially obnoxious . Second , after using it for a couple of weeks , it started periodically making a clicking noise . It took quite a bit of effort to finally determine that it was coming from the joint where one of the `` arms '' connects to the `` leg '' . A simple tightening of this made the noise go away immediately , but it was a pain to have to troubleshoot a problem so soon.Those two items were minor and would n't dissuade me from recommending this elliptical to anyone looking for a great , compact , workout in this price range .
 I purchased this Horizon EX65 two weeks ago . And I 've been using it everyday , and its always nice and smooth stride . Sturdy and it has the durability and quality feel to it . And also easy assembly , it took me about half an hour to get everything going . So for all you who wanted to start looking after your health or looking for a good elliptical machine . I totally recommend this.Horizon EX65 Dual Action Elliptical Trainer
 After looking at other ellipticals and reading reviews I know I made the best choice , Great machine even my kids enjoy working out.It also has a Great warranty for the money you ca n't go wrong with this Elliptical
 I need to do pool aquatics due to an orthopedic surgeon permanently crippling me during a hip replacement procedure . I do aquatic therapy on a daily basis in my pool and the HydroFit buoys are a great help in keeping me buoyant enough to walk in the water . I 've had the same brand -LRB- 2nd set -RRB- for 5 years now and could n't be more pleased with their usage and reliability . Well made and I think NOT in China .
 We 've been using these water weights at our local rec center pool as part of their water exercise program . We find them to be very useful and gentle to work your way into . I started with 10 minutes and am using them for up to an hour . Highly recommended
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 I purchased these for my 13 year old girl for volleyball . I was worried they would be too big-she is 5 `` 01 110 lbs but they fit perfectly . The are secure and do not slide off . The padding is very comfortable too she says .
 I have had my knee pads for almost year and they still are working great . They have good padding but are not bulky . They also fit well enough around the knee that I do not have to wear a knee brace with them . I would buy another pair when the time comes
 they work great under your jeans when roofing my house and worked better than regular knee pads that strap on over your pants
 I bought these pads thinking that the padded areas were very thick but when they arrived they were normal sized and I began to have doubts.That is where I was wrong because with actual usage on the volleyball court the padded areas were extremely effective when contacting the floor area.Beautiful design and fit and I will recommend them .
 It was summer , a special VB clinic and no knee pads -LRB- the other 4 pair had been stolen since the end of last season . -RRB- Quickly to Amazon and these arrived within two days and are still be used !!
 I ca n't see why others have complained about this product . It is well made , easy to install and does the job . I could not find the seperate components for less money with free shipping , well worth a benjamin . For my installation , in the skirt of my 5th wheel trailer , there is a small problem , it is not totally waterproof at the rear , but then it was not designed to be installed in a wet location . A few big globs of Goop fixed the problem and I no longer have to cram the cord into a small box compartment . The instructions were confusing and almost illegible , but if you need instructions for a job like this , get someone else to do it . I would give it 5 stars if it had been waterproof .
 I found this kit to to be quite simple to use and a direct replacement for my mouse hole . I looked at the instructions from the manufacturer 's website first . I priced as many of the separate components as I could find and decided it was not worth the hassle to buy several different parts without gaskets or the most important adapter ring . The kit itself it great . Installantion depends on your mechanical and electrical abilities . Dont forget to use liquid soap or the plug cover will never slide on .
 I had wanted to replace the pull-out shore power cable on my trailer , I always considered these `` Mouse hole '' styles to be the biggest hassle to stuff the cable back into . This kit has everything you need and it goes together easily with a few common tools . The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the white metal cover plate that is meant to cover where the original cover came off is a little on the small side -LRB- as the Marinco socket is a little smaller diameter flange -RRB- and the three holes do not line up with the original -LRB- I thought maybe it was unique to my install , but a quick look at CW shows my original was by a common manufacturer and the holes are the same for several brands I looked at -RRB- . If you a careful to line up the adapter plate and gasket and drill new pilot holes you can cover the top two holes and almost completely cover the bottom hole . When you put it on use a little sealer and you are good to go .
 After having mice access the RV via the power cord opening ... they can get in smallest places , around cord , etc. . . i found this product . Fantastic design , no rat can get in now . My second of these kits and worth every cent , either for an older RV or your brand new unit ... fix EVERY tiny opening you can or else you will have mice inside eventually . This product solved my problem . Install is easy-moderate and can be done in two hours . Worth every penny .
 This was received quickly and just as described , at a MUCH better price than found locally or at most other web sites . I purchased with intent to make it easier to connect and especially store the heavy 30amp cord . The original frequently ` knotted up ' in the storage compartment when trying to pull it out of the ` rat hole ' and then when trying to store it , repeated attempts had to be made to get the line back into the compartment . I would usually open the compartment in the bumper and reach in to straighten to pull out or coil it to store it , but this was a tight and dirty job . The ParkPower set makes the use of the 30 amp shore line as simple as a large extension cord , and the lock does a great job of making for a tight connection . This would have been a very easy installation ... but we traded in our trailer for a new one that already had this power connection standard ! So I returned the box for a very quick refund by Amazon !
 I installed this mod on my RV a couple of weeks ago . It was very easy and works well though I do have some negative comments :1 . The instructions are less then clear as there are at least three `` versions '' of how to install this mod . Mine required the one on the back side of the page , but I still made some alterations2 . There are parts and pieces to do all three version - and you have to buy them regardless which inflates the cost of the kit3 . The instructions recommend that you use a 2.5 '' hole saw - it 's too big tho will work but be REAL careful how you drill the attaching screw holes or risk not having enough meat to hold the mod in place . Measure THREE times , cut once -LRB- or use a smaller hole saw4 . The attaching machine screws are too short and carbon steel . You need at least 1 '' stainless steel screws - especially if it 's for a boat and even more so in salt water.Do the mod - it 's better then dragging a long wire out of a tiny hole , leaving access for -- mice !!
 This kit was easy to install and so far is very durable . I like the standard Twist-Lock style plug . The `` Mouse Hole '' that it replaced on my trailer had a bolt hole pattern that did not match the adapter plate . Not a big deal , just drilled some new holes and it worked great , just wanted to let people know , I was caught off guard by it .
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .
 Im not a competitor or anything so I only use this gun for target practice i.e. shooting cans or targets . It 's pretty powerful for a pistol . I love the laser and the flashlight feature however the silencer is useless becasue the sound of this bb gun can not be muffled . After a while of continuous shooting of this gun It might start to hurt your hands every time you reload because this is a spring powered gun . It comes with glasses which are a nice safety accessory
 This kit arrived complete and on time , but the expiration date is less than a year away . It will probably be expired before I use it .
 Good Product they do what they are supposed to do . Great shipping got them to me on time to get on the water !
 It looks like good quality . I got a good price . . better than in local stores . . Looks nice in children 's bedroom !
 I bought two of these ten years ago , and they are the best . Still good after all these years . And I disagree that they are too roomy -- they have fit me perfectly .

 Bought this for him a year ago and it is still in great shape . Very durable , heavy , and looks cool . Plenty of funcitons if you need them .

 The item was delivered on time and easily installed in my SOSpenders PFD . Even better price and IN STOCK than at a local marine supply store
 This arrived at my home packaged nicely and it 's in great shape . It 's really good quality . We try to add a NY Yankees ornament every year -LRB- and pretty soon we 'll have a whole Yankee tree -RRB- . We added a few this year thanks to this nice ornament and a few others.Very nice ornament .
 Very nice , sturdy piece . Colors are as vibrant as shown . This is my hubby 's 1st Yankee ornament and he loved it !
 Was impressed to find a cheap NY Yankees ornament that was of good quality ! I would definately purchase more ! Great stocking stuffer too !
 I bought these for my 2 1/2 year-old grandson and they are wonderful for playing in the snow . They are warm but not too bulky in his boots . I have SmartWool socks myself and I really like them . They wash & dry without shrinking . I would buy them again .
 the product is good but the size is not accurate . consequently everything we received is too big .
 These socks are the only thing for cold winters in Maine ! My whole family wears nothing but smartwool socks in the winter . They 're warm , wash and wear well and we love them . The great price was an absolute steal !
 We live in the Northwest so warm socks are a must and these fit the bill . They do shrink if you put them in the dryer so hang dry if you want them to last !
 I got these for my toddler to wear with his snow boots . I got the XS and they fit my 18 month old with just a little room to grow and he normally wears a size 6 toddler shoe . I am very pleased with the quality and fast shipping . I wish I had bought another pair , I 'm sure we will misplace at least one of these socks before we even get any snow .
 These are nice socks . Very thick and seem nice and warm . A quality sock , however , they pill a lot after one wash .
 These are a popular brand in our cold weather state and the only cold weather sock I can find for a 1 1/2 year old . XS fits pretty well and they are a comfortable feeling material .
 Love these socks especially for winter boots -LRB- either galoshes or snow boots ! -RRB- Not sure what else to say about socks but I have to write at least 8 more words . : -RRB-
 Who does n't love Smartwool socks ?! I was born , raised and still live in New England . I am very well-versed in winter survival products . Cold feet will ruin any outside activity in the winter . A lot of socks get wet easily , make your feet sweat , are too warm , too cold , too thick , too thin ... not the case with Smartwool.These particular socks in an XS fit my toddler 's size 8-9 feet perfectly . I think he could wear them again next year as they do stretch a bit . The color is a very attractive taupe and they are really soft . He 's worn these all winter and has not once complained.Excellent purchase for my little guy !
 These socks are terrific ! Very nice material and they keep feet warm and toasty without them getting sweaty . Definitely recommend them . : -RRB-
 great socks perfect fit will buy more thank you for making great socks , we would like more colors though thanks
 These socks are perfect for my 5 year old . Super soft and stretchy so she can easily slip them on herself . Some wool and thermal socks are so tight you have to struggle to yank them on ! Not these . They 're also warm , not hot and sweaty , and very nice colors . A great buy .
 Loved these socks as they fitted my small feet perfectly , kept them toasty , and did n't cost a fortune either . I would recommend them to anyone who needs to keep themselves or their kids warm in the wintertime . : - -RRB-
 I already have several pairs of these socks and I love them . I wear them over my other socks when I wear boots , I give them 5 stars .
 perfect fit and keeps 3 yr old feet very warm - daughter loves them - true to size - recommended
 Howdy!We bought these for our 1 3/4 year old and he wore them every day while we were in Wales in 30-45 degree weather and still wears them now . They fit him a little big but it did n't matter since we could pull them up and he can still wear them now that he is 2 yr 1 month old . He should be able to wear them until he 's 3Cheers !
 SmartWool for everyone ! These are a little big for my 2 year old grand daughter but she loves the feel , and the color . She 'll grow into them .
 these were way too big for my kid so I gave them to someone else . They said they are extremely warm and comfortable . My only complaint is the blue pictured here is not what the socks look like
 I got these for my 4 yo who needed some warm socks for playing in the snow . He absolutely loves them ! He has worn them for 3 days straight . I guess its time to peel them off of him . I will have to get some more !
 My husband and I have SmartWool socks so we decided to get some for our son . He loves them and did not want to take them off ! I may be ordering more for him . Great product and really good price .
 Love the Socks ! My grandson is nice and warm and dry . Love the dry . His toes are happy ! I would buy them again . Thank you for providing these great products .
 Not much else to say - they work well for hiking . Have n't had them long enough to rate durability . They 're socks .
 These socks were a gift for my 3 yo granddaughter . My daughter reports they are great little socks!they keep her feet warm when playing outside or riding behind her Mama on a bicycle .
 I LOVE these socks ! My preschool-aged son had a pair last winter for sledding and outdoor fun , but we lost 1 sock . This year , I returned to purchase 2 more pairs to prepare for this year 's winter adventures ! These socks are super-warm and lightweight . They are not the bulky , heavy wool socks of our childhoods !
 I love these for my son on those cold nights and outdoors . Highly recommend and will be ordering future sizes .
 I love Smartwool products and was thrilled to find these toddler sized socks . -LRB- Our whole family wears Smartwool socks . -RRB- We had some baby Smartwool socks and those were great too . It is really hard to find toddler size thick wool socks . These have been perfect . They are well made and last . I 'll definitely be purchasing more .
 These soft wool socks are great for hiking and keeping feet dry even when they perspire . They are durable and thick enough to provide some cushion without being overly bulky . Goodbye cotton socks !
 Great paddle , put it in my duffle bag for trip to costa rica , then shipedon bus , not a mark or damage works perfect .
 The fact that the paddle collapses but when put together is very sturdy is a huge plus ! I live in a space apartment with limited storage so this was the right fit .
 I purchased this paddle because it matched my requirements . It still does n't fit in my inflatable-kayak pack , but I 've only used it once since I got the paddle . Perhaps I 'll find space for it as I use the kayak more frequently .
 Simply put , this is a great elliptical trianer . I was impressed upon taking it out of the box . It was the easiest piece of equipment that I have ever put toghether . Each step had its hardware in a separate bag -LRB- bag 1 , bat 2 , etc. -RRB- and all of the tools needed to complete the assembly were included.I was n't sure if I would enjoy the workout after years using a stationary bike that finally bit the dust , but it provides a much better overall workout . The only complaint that I have is that I do n't like the location of the water bottle holder.The warranty is also much better than any elliptical in the same price range , which was the primary reason I bought it.If you 're in the market for an elliptical , I urge you to consider the Merit Fitness 710E .
 My husband and I were looking at some ellipticals to buy before we decided to buy this one . We did n't buy it from amazon but from local sports store , Dunham 's Sport.We were eye balling at Horizon EX-65 before but stumbled by the price that is too far from our cash range . So , we were trying this model from them.After trying for a while in the store also compare them with other ellipticals on the display , we finally agree to bring home this one.The feeling from both of them almost the same . We barely feel any difference , of course the EX-65 have more features but since we only wanted to have something to help us exercise instead make our wallet empty , we choose this one.All the parts needed including hardware and instructions are very clear . We assemble this only within 1 hour . The warranty is not that bad either.After using it for about 1 week now , we can say that this is really nice for the price . We got it little bit less than from the price in here and we also bought the mat from the store + taxes.You might experience sore knees and ankles , specially if you never exercise or working out before . My husband and I were both enjoying it though . When our knees and ankles hurt , we pause and continue immediately.This thing really makes you sweat ! and red like tomatoes!Conclusion
 I have been using this Merit 710E Elliptical Machine for approximately 8 months and it has been a pure pleasure to use . It is very solidly-built and glides as quietly and smoothly today as it did the day I got it . Since durability was the biggest factor in what machine I purchased , I am pleased that this machine 's build quality has lived-up to my expectations.The display -LRB- Pulse , Calories , Miles , & Time -RRB- is powered by two AA batteries , which means there is nothing to plug-in and nothing to get in the way , and the machine - though not small - is cleverly compact . The one drawback about the display is that it resets all counters to zero after 60 minutes . For many people , this wo n't be a problem - but some might find if frustrating . Since I use an Oregon Scientific PE 830 Pedometer with USB PC link , I really do n't pay much attention to the display anyway , but others may and I wanted to point that out.Assembling the machine is not as hard as I was anticipating , but expect to spend about an hour or so . The moving parts -LRB- articulations -RRB- come already pre-lubricated , but a few were only slightly lubricated from the factory . I ended-up taking some clean , new motor oil and then rubbed it onto those joints with my finger and everything still rides smooth and quietly today.As for the actual workout , it hardly gets better than this ! I am also a jogger and even light jogging has impact you can feel on your joints , but I feel great after a long workout on this machine.All-in-all this has been a great machine and a great investment in my health . I still enjoy getting on it every day !
 I think this is a great starter piece of equipment . It was very easy to put together . Was only missing one washer , that was just for looks . Took me 3 hours to put together , but that counting how long it took me to get it upstairs by myself . It took two guys to bring it in , and just little old 5 ' 2 160 pund me to bring it up that stairs . My dogs were no help!Husband likes it he 6 ' 5 and I am 5 ' 2 it works for both of us . Timer box little cheap but it works . Not impressed with the thumb print pulse , but for the price ca n't ask for to much!Update 2/14/08 : Still loving machine , use it everyday ! Have started to hear a little noise but going to try WD40 !
 This is an excellent machine for the money . Truly , it is a good machine for any price . If you research the bowflex treadclimber , you will find that their low-end/no-frills machine costs far more than this one . With financing , it would cost far more . This machine is affordable and can be paid for in one shot . Most importantly for $ 395 , you are getting a machine that you can keep for at least five years vs. $ 1200 in a year at the gym.Putting this together , well , I am a girl and I did it all by myself - it was frustrating at times but due to my own errors . I was never able to attach the resisitance knob but I find the machine works fine without it . -LRB- I 'm sure you 'll be able to attach the knob I just gave up and then misplaced it . -RRB- The machine comes in easily labeled sections and includes all of the tools that you need.I find that I have to tighten the bolt on the main console every once in a while but its truly not a big deal . -LRB- The long silver piece under the main console . -RRB- The machine works well . It tracks your calories and I can see results . It was a good investment .
 quick delivery and easy assembly ... very clear and simple direction with parts in separate bags . Only took an hour to assemble . Great workout !
 This purchase has been a great one ... easy on the knees , does n't take up alot of space and still going strong after having it over 3 yrs . I 've been able to lose the weight and have not had to workout like a dog .
 I did n't have a problem purchasing these glasses from somthin ' `` Beauty '' . They delivered on time , like every Online Purchase should be . The glasses were new and everything was in the box , that I know of . Purchasing these online saved me about $ 40 - $ 50 .
 I bought this boat last year and it is a great little boat . The reason I bought it is becouse I drive a sports car and it fits right in the trunk . And there is still room for all my fishing equipment . It is very sturdy . I have accidently hit stumps and floating debre in the water and it was fine . It is very light and with the coleman pump I can have it inflated in under ten minutes . Four people in the boat might be a little tight but if its two adults and two kids im sure you will be fine . It is very sturdy in the water I have stood up in it before . It was a little wobbly but I imagine if you bought or made a plywood floor for it you would be fine . I just got a motor for it and there are no doubts in my head that it will work perfectly . If your looking for a reasonally priced inflatable boat this one will exceed all your expectations .
 A little damp without one , dry as a bone with one . Very effective at keeping water out . Note
 Spray skirts are like umbrellas - if you have it you do n't need it and if you forgot it then you 're in trouble . I take this spray skirt with me on every kayak trip -LRB- even perfect days -RRB- as a preventative measure . I 've had to use it around 10 times and it 's performed really well every time . Completely waterproof and I like the handy mesh pouch in front . I removed the shoulder straps because I found that , with a life vest , I did n't need it . Take your time to adjust the band around the base of the skirt to make sure it has the right tension -LRB- not too much or too little -RRB- . And definitely practice installing the skirt while sitting in shallow water . The first few times I used this skirt I found that I was n't reaching back and securing it well enough behind my back . Result
 I bought the spray skirt for my Advanced Elements inflatable kayak
 we went on a long road trip . this was very nice making coffee driving down the road . it is a handy product to own for any of our road trips short or long . i would recommend this to anyone if you are a coffee lover as we are . it takes a while to brew the coffee but it does the job good .
 I am a large man , and like a lot of large dudes , I do not care for inside the waistband carry . most outside the waistband holsters are bulky and cause a lot of printing issues against your clothing so you have next to no concealment . i LOVE this holster . not only is it a better than adequate solution for the larger man for concealed carry , but it also includes a retention lock that makes it about 1000 % more secure than most slide holsters . those that have ever had to sit down in a public restroom while wearing a slide holster will know what i mean ... I have a lot of family in law enforcement that swear by safariland or galco , and they make some really nice gunleather , but this number from bianchi is a total winner for me .
 I purchased this patch to go on my medic bag . It 's one of those numbers that has the spot for a velcro patch . It came quickly as described , took well to the velcro backing that i managed to find , and now sits securely on my bag.The thread on the back is snug , the edges on front are uniform , the white lettering is n't crazy bright but still visible in low light -LRB- not reflective -RRB- , and it 's spelled correctly -LRB- you 'd be surprised . . -RRB- Sorry i ca n't give some epic 3 page review giving pro 's and con 's . . but come on , it 's a patch . I 'd buy another since i ca n't find many the same size that just say `` Medic ''
 i like the texture of the bandit size is relatively small compared to other g-shock models and this is very niceFunctions are the basic , buttons are hard to press on but you get used to themthe Green light of the screen is very old , i wish it was the blue version
 I would n't say I 'm running trails everyday but I am a dad of two and soon to be three kids . I can keep this watch on all day long and never worry about water , juice , toys being hurled at maximum velocity , etc. . Its size is smaller than some of the other G shocks which I love . I used to own a G shock back in the early 90 's and loved it but when all the new models came out I felt they were big , ugly , and gaudy . I 'm very happy with my purchase and at a price you ca n't beat with a stick .
 this gun is one of the best guns that you could ever buy for a pistol . it has semi burst and auto and it rapes everyone . it goes 340 fps right out of the box . i would recommend this gun to anyone . the one upgrade i would get is a high flow valve to increase the velocity . lata
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 I picked up a Glock 20 SF -LRB- 3rd Gen -RRB- as the 4th Gen Glock 20 is no where to be found and the standard size 3rd Gen Glock 20 is almost as hard to come by . No biggie , but the 3rd Gen Gen Glocks are n't that grippy , and my large hands would n't mind a larger grip . Alas a rubber slip on grip addresses both challenges -LRB- or rather solving the former with a happy side effect of the solving the latter -RRB- . Anyway , enough of my back story . What you get is a soft , durable -LRB- extrapolating at this point , but will update in time -RRB- , grippy , solution . It is big enough for full sized -LRB- even over sized like a double stack .45 acp Glock 21 or double stack 10mm Glock 20 -RRB- , and it 's flexible enough to fit &#34; slim &#34; framed versions of these uber Glocks and the more typical Glock 17 et al. . It 's a snug fit , and there is no magic lubricant or trick -- you simply have to stretch and pull . It will take 5-10 minutes , but you quickly know that it will never come off without a lot of intent -LRB- and perhaps an xacto knife for the impatient -RRB- . Once on the grip will be thicker , but only by a trivial amount . If you 're grip is borderline too big , it may be too much . The transition from the Pachmayr grip to your gun 's standard grip is almost imperceptible to the hand , and the grips size makes it very much on the periphery . The lines also help make it fit nicely . Lastly , do note that the plain grip goes right over my Glock 's finger groves , and they remain -LRB- other grips add their own fingers , which may be good or may be bad -RRB- . I definitely recommend it to 3rd Gen Glock owners , as they are a but lacking in the grip . 4th Gen Glocks also benefit , especially if you 're looking for rubber vs raised plastic , although you may want to go without a back strap to make installation easier -LRB- I imagine all straps would fit with enough effort -RRB- . 1911 and Springfield XD owners probably want to pass due to this likely negating any grip safety .
 I ordered this shirt and was pleased at the quality andthe speed in which it was processed and shipped . I orderedit only one week before Christmas and had it in time to wrap andgive to my brother . Thanks so much!Karen C from Chicago
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !

 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .

 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .

 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .

 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big

 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !

 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !

 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen

 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 good quality ! . . good price !! . . My fiance will love it ! It was about same price through Arkansas website , but love it !
 Very well built bucktail . I have a few of these in various colors and sizes . Excellent for Pike , Muskies and stripers
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .

 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Was a present from a friend , a great gift , looks great in the collection . With the zippo name you can not go wrong .
 Bought as a gift , both very pleased with it . Great quality . Had it for about a year now and still looks brand new .
 Mailing fast , high quality , good service attitude , very satisfied &#65292; I gave my friends back home , this is a valuable gift &#65292; we are very pleased
 Received my 2 lighters , was worried about the scrimshaw aspect , they are perfect , will have them engraved and make super gifts . Nicely boxed and presented , thanks again
 Im so glad i bought this item . It was for my father and he absolutely loves it.It looks better in person then it even does in the picture.Fantastic buy for the price . Fast shipping too.A + + +
 Thanks a lot , Item as described , shipment well packed , fast delivery , Seller recomended . A + + + + + .
 I like this product . Fast shipment . The Scrimshaw Ship emblem is very nice . Due to the slight movement of the lid I could not gave a 5 stars .
 I wear these shorts for brisk walking , and find the inseam length to be perfect ; short enough to be comfortable , long enough for modesty . The best feature is on-seam pockets for Ipod , housekey , tissues , etc. . Finding athletic shorts with pockets is nearly impossible , so this was a very important feature for me . They are very comfortable as well . After purchasing my first pair , I bought two more .
 I love these shorts ! They are the prefect length and look and feel amazing ! They are absolutely perfect for the gym !
 Irish eyes were watching over us . Very well made socks in exactly the great bright green that I wanted/needed . Fast service , excellent shipping . Great combination . I will use this distributer again .
 I bought this as a christmas gift for my mother in law who collects nutcrackers and is also a Yankees fan and she absolutely loved it !! This was a perfect christmas gift : -RRB-
 I bought this for my son who is a big Yankee fan . It was very nice with good workmanship and nice size . He loved it and I am happy to say it made a big hit with his friends .
 I 'm a huge Yankee fan and a nutcracker collector , so this nutcracker was a must ! I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price . It did need a little TLC -LRB- some glue for the hair and a little wood putty in the back -RRB- , which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 .
 I use Daisy pellets for several of my pellet guns . These flatheads work great in my 1377 modified , far more bulls than some off the other pellets I have tried so far . The 008 Daisy , Cam over CO2 puncture arm , which I just Love also use these pellets with good groups . Your results may be different because all guns are not the same as most of us know .
 if very good product , I have tried different types of birds and the result has been explosive . I will continue shopping .
 I wanted to purchase some inexpensive pellets for target practice with my Crosman Quest 1000 . I decided on the Beeman .177 Hollowpoint , 7.2 grains . Below is my review of the pellet.First , I was pleasantly surprised at the performance and quality of the Beeman Hollowpoints . The pellets shoot very accurately in my Quest . I was able to shoot 1-inch groups at 15 yards.Second , the uniformity of the pellets seems to be excellent . I did n't find 1 deformed pellet in the tin of 250 . Although the pellets are manufactured in China , their quality meet the Beeman standard.Third , the pellet seemed to reach a higher velocity compared to other pellets that I have used . The graphite-like coating and the 7.2 grain weight may be the reasons for the velocity increase.Fourth , the Beeman Hollowpoint is a clean pellet because of its coating . The pellet leaves little or no lead dust after handling.Fifth , in my Quest , the Beeman Hollowpoint produced impressive penetration and expansion . The pellet easily penetrated a 3/4 '' pine board and expanded nicely.However , initially , I was concerned about the shallowness of the cavitiy in the nose of the pellet -- it is not a deep-cavity hollowpoint . This lack of a deep cavity does not seem to affect the pellet 's performance.In short , I am highly satisfied with my purchase of the Beeman Hollowpoints . I am surprised that I found such a high-quality pellet at such a reasonable price .
 My review might not count for much as I feel I am not expert enough in this subject to provide much objective data . Subjectively I am pleased with the product . I have had no lead residue on my fingers , which was my primary concern . Visual inspection shows they all look alike to the limits of my vision so my impression of quality control is high .
 I am very impressed with how they look and there perfomance is consistant . Still testing as it superiority of other brands . But definitly on the high side of quality .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .

 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 The Bulova Marine Star chronograph is a nice quartz chronograph . I 've had it for about 10 years now . It has a solid case , polished links and is water resistant to 100 meters . it 's got a beautifully detailed ivory face and Roman numerals . It 's got three blue sub-dials for the chronograph for the sub-second , minutes and hours . My one glaring complaint is that the hour and minute markers are very thin and hard to see , especially against the blue sub-dials .
 Great Quality Product ! Authentic and Great Colors ! Shirt was larger than expected though . I ordered a Large and it was unnecessarily wide . I wish I would have knew or I would have ordered a Medium . So you might want to try a size smaller than you usually buy unless you are a wide person or have worn Puma Brand Shirts before . But it 's definitely a nice shirt !
 Great service and was quick arriving to our APO address . The shirt is great just the colors are reverse of what we thought we bought !
 This ship 's clock was a gift for my husband 's birthday , to replace one he had for many years . It is elegant , keeps perfect time and the chimes are delightful , although not as loud as I would have liked . We spoke with the Weems & Plath people , who were very helpful and courteous , and they said that some people do n't care for loud chimes . I ca n't imagine why , but that is the case . Anyway , my husband loves his clock and he tends to listen for the chimes , and all in all , he is very pleased with it and so am I . It is solid brass and beautiful . I purchased a stand for it , which adds to its elegance .
 I have looked high and low at ship strike clocks the past month . Ultimately , a great price brought me to the Weems and Plath , Orion Quartz Ship 's Bell Clock . The bell is not loud , but nice and in an office or study , about perfect . For a hall or major piece on the mantel , a bigger chime would be needed . That said , this clock is very well machined in the brass and enameled brass case . The screw off bezel is easy and the battery compartment and chime `` off or on '' switch , all easy to find and manipulate . Though my heart prefers a wind up , my budget could not allow it , hence this purchase.I am in every way pleased . It is larger than I imagined , despite the size described with the spec 's it is a `` full '' sized clock . It fits the Weems and Plath stand , also on Amazon , nicely . The bell tone is soft , but reliable . So far , the clock is keeping good time and chiming on cue . I 'm very pleased . This goes in my work office as a reminder , my customers are given 30 minutes time , and with the 30 minute ships chime , it 's a nice way to remind them that time is up.As a past sailor , the connection to the nautical history alone is worth having this clock . I do see a wind up model in my future for home .
 It 's a beautiful clock , and it 's the right size for my office . But , everyone was right , the bells are just a bit too muted . Unless it is very quiet in my office , the bells can not be heard . Otherwise , I really like the clock .
 my husband loves his clock . He has wanted one for years since he worked many years on boats . The clock made it christmas eve .
 Beautiful clock , excellent fit and finish , the bells areway too soft . I was disappointed that I ca n't hear thebells better , had one before and it did not have thisproblem .
 This clock is absolutely a great work of art , just wish the bell was louder . You can barely hear it in a room . Almost have to put your ear right up against it . It sure looks great though .
 The clock looks great and keeps perfect time , but the chimes are too soft . The chimes can be heard only for a few yards .
 Purchased this ship 's bell about 6 months ago to adorn the wall over our bed in a new motorhome . It is very nice in appearance , keeps good time -LRB- does gain about a minute a month ; no big deal -RRB- and the quiet chime others noted is really a plus since the clock is not too loud for the area we use it . We have many antique clocks , including a real Chelsea ships clock and that one has a much louder chime . It also weighs about 8 times as much as this Orion clock so was not a good choice for our use . We are very pleased with this clock and recommend it .
 This unit has kept accurate time for me -LRB- in my office , not at sea -RRB- and sounds great when it chimes . I specifically wanted one that chimed ship 's bells and this does the trick . It looks really nice paired with the stand .
 I love this fold-away , water resistant junior-sized cot !! As a physician I have used it to settle ill young children who need close observation for more than a brief office visit . This cot can be situated in even the smallest of rooms and is so comfortable that a child will sleep for hours while napping or recuperating . It fits a child up to about 100 pounds very comfortably . A must-have for any doctor , nurse or parent who might need a cozy spot to rest a child .
 This cot is perfect for small kids . My 6 yr old who is big for her age has been having bad dreams . So we bought this cot so she can sleep in our room but we still have our bed to ourselves . She loves it because the cot she was laying on was an adult size cot and much too long for her body . She feels more secure in with the smaller frame that fits her body . I 've been looking for this size cot for years so I glad I finally found one . I was thinking -LRB- my oldest is 16 -RRB- someday my grand-children can use it to stay here with me and grandpa ! Lol .
 I bought this cot for my 2-1/2 yr old son to sleep on at nap time at his grandparents house . -LRB- They babysit while we 're at work . -RRB- The size is great ; he 'll be able to use it for several years . The only thing that one might consider a drawback is that it creaks when he shifts position . It is super sturdy ! There was no assembly so there 's no parts to break off or lose .
 My little girl has always nap in a bouncer due to acid reflux when she was a newborn . When she turned 12 months , I finally and reluctantly have to put away the bouncer because she has outgrown it . She still refuse to sleep in her crib for naps and I decided to try a cot since it has a similar hammock-like feel as that of a bouncer . After searching the internet , I 've found there really are n't many cots out there for small children and most of them are used for odd occasions like camping so are not build for everyday wear and tear . I finally settled on this one even though the price was a bit higher than I was initially looking to pay . I was a bit concern at first that my child might roll off , but since cots in general have that hammock-like dip with two metal bars on the side , I think she instinctively just stay put in the middle . Also , the cot is only 14 inches off the ground . I have to say I am very please with the result . Now nap time is no longer a problem and what else is great is that there 's plenty of room to grow and I can use this for several years to come.Pros : - No bar in the center . It seems all other children cots have a bar in the center of the cot which would be uncomfortable for your child if they are laying on their back.-Sturdy . From the reviews and my own experience , this thing is pretty solid and can withstand daily usage.-Easy to use and put away . This cot came pre-assembled , and you just basically unfold it and can use it right away . It has a canvas bag with a nylon strap that you can put the cot into once folded . However , I just skip the bag and just leave this folded-leaning against the playroom wall.-Easy to clean . A quick wipe and it 's as good as new.No cons that I know of yet
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Great shorts , have had them over a year . No problems , no snags , not coming apart . Good buy , except they keep sending their stupid catalog now that they got my address .
 The shorts were cheap , but the shipping and handling was absurd . It made the overall product double its listed price . Good product , expensive service .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large .

 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !

 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 it 's what i expected and well , when expectations are met , smiles usually follow . thumbs up!FCS `` Longboard Stretch Cover '' Board Bag
 I have been using Hatch Operator gloves for years now and they are always great . Awesome dexterity and longevity . Great gloves that are worth the money .
 i whore these gloves for 3 months in *********** they held up very well . only complaint i have is the thumb on 1 of the gloves was a bit tight and there are no loops on the back inside the glove to hook them on your vest . a bit of cord sewn on them fixed the loop prob and a bunch o sweat fixed the other . i would buy another pair .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit

 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 Great for spot cleaning the car and boat . Takes out even red dye stains . Works better than spot removers I bought at the auto parts store .
 This spot cleaner removes oils , automotive fluids , and even ink from carpet upholstery and I 'm not ashamed to admit I used it to take the oil stains off my drive way !! Great AMAZING product !
 The 303 Company makes fabulous products from their Fabric Guard -LRB- best water repellant on the market -RRB- and Shower Shield to the Carpet Cleaner . They actually work as advertised !
 I used this to remove stains from my headliner , it worked great . I purchased this based on the good reviews and I 'm happy I did .
 The cleaner , in conjunction with the Aerospace Protectant , keep car interiors looking great . I have used it for years , and even in an older car , the plastic still looks new .
 You never have too many cleaners ! especially ones that WORK ! this is one of them and i will continue buying it !
 I recommend this to all boat owners ! I use it for the floor and the seats to keep it like new .
 I did the whole interior of my F150 , front and back seats , carpeting etc with less than one bottle . Some stains were years old . Great stuff .
 Prior to this , I had not played a NBA video game since NBA 2k . Yup much has improved since then . The graphics , sound and physics are excellent . While most players have a great amount of precision , some players look outright scary . -LRB- like Ginobili -RRB- The arenas , the fans and the mascots are lifelike . Ca n't say the same about the fly girls . The create a player mode is also detailed but is very tedious . What I liked most in the game was the 24/7 game option . I would definitely recommend this game to any fan .
 First things first , NBA 2K7 is a fantastic basketball simulation . Easily the best one this year and one of the better ones in recent memory . However that 's all it is , do n't expect much , if any , off the court excitement . The people at 2K focused all of their attention on the hardwood , which is fine , but leaves the finished product just a little lagging . One or two more features , off the court , could have pushed this game into the stratosphere but , sigh , we 'll have to wait until next year to see what they can do.The 24/7 next feature is a vailant effort , but quickly becomes a laughable attempt at the streetball genre , still it 's their for those who want it , and that 's better than nothing . Also , the ability to set you practices as the coach is a good idea , but it does n't even take a minute to do so and any rewards from this task are hardly noticeable , so it 's mostly just a time waster.Still , with a fantastic game on the court , which is definately the most important part , this game is a gem , and with a little work off the court it could be a star .
 with the xbox 360 this game has really good graphics , really easy to play and very enjoyable with friends , plays 4 players .
 This basketball game is about as perfect as a game can be right now . The franchise mode is one of the deepest in the industry . The actual game simulation is completely life like , down to EVERY single player 's personal shooting form . Defense AI responds very realisticly , making you set picks and work for every single shot.Of course this game is not without it 's small gliches . Sometimes player animation miss steps , or jerseys and shorts just disappear briefly -LRB- weird ... -RRB- On the very rare occurance the AI reacts differently than it should , but overall it is pretty solid.Don ' t bother renting this game , just go buy it !
 This game is the best game to ever be created . The graphics are awesome , the gameplay is sweet and the game modes are the best . 24/7 Next is one of the funnest stories that I have ever played . Season mode is always a blast and The Association is so cool . The court come to life as there 's moving fans going up and down the stairs , moving mascots and even some floor moppers and cameramen ! The shooting styles are accurate . Shawn Marion has that funky release and Shaq has that hesitation on his free throws . This game has personalized this game so that you feel like you are actually in the game . The controls are easy after a few games . The Shot Stick is awesome . Though it will take a while to get it down , you 'll be swishing shots before you know it . The realism is a big factor in this game also . No more can you swish every single shot is this game . You have to work hard for your wins as it really is in the NBA . No longer can you score over 100 points in five minute quarters . You 'll be lucky if you get to 60 points . This game is definitly a next-gen game ! Buy and you 'll be very happy with the amazing results !
 2k7 is one of the most playable , fun basketball titles to be released on a high-performance console , and the online play never gets old . Being able to control nearly ever single aspect of movement , as well as easy to access play calling with the D-pad , makes you realize that you are finally playing a true basketball sim.A must-have for any die-hard basketball fans .
 I love this game , people say NCAA Hoops 2K7 is better , but to me its not . NBA 2K7 gives you total control of the game even in the franchise mode . Whatever yo want eo do you can do , not just to your team but to the other teams as well . Change positions , change player heights , and change player ratings , all of it . Override trades has always been my favorite , I wish NCAA Hoops had something like that for recruits . I know these advantages take away the challenge of the game but I really do n't care , you can be challenged by choice . I hope they improve 24/7 feature though . I like that you can save at anytime , but I wish they would show your player stats and attributes , and even your outfits . You really ca n't tell your player 's strengths and weaknesses , and how to mold his game . I love this game I wish NCAA hoops was this good and did not have the gitches that it has .
 Bought this game for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it he plays it for hours
 This is easily the best and funnest nba game series . EA 's NBA Live and that other NBA game are just garbage . The Live series has actually regressed too . The NBA2K series has been pretty similiar year to year , with mostly minor tweaks every year added . The biggest difference I noticed was the free throw system this year . While it 's very different using the analog stick to shoot free throws on Xbox 360 , it really only takes a few free throws to get it down . While the game is n't 100 % perfect , it 's pretty close to being . Using the analog stick instead of the buttons to shoot and do layups and dunks makes a ginormous difference , and recommended . And this game is incredibly fun too ! Get it !
 It does n't get anymore realistic than NBA 2k7 for the Xbox 360 . The graphics are unreal , and it so much fun to play . What a game , highly recommended
 Graphicaly , I think this is a big step up from 2K6 - there appears to be a lot more player animations and the game has a more realistic feel . This truly plays like a simulation . The addition of on the fly substituions is a tremendous feature and speeds up the game - although the game seems to move slower due to the various animations when the whistle blows can be little frustrating . The online experience is pretty good - I did n't notice as many hiccups as last year.On the downside , Ive had a couple freezes early on but I hope that 's an abberation.All in all , this really is the best basketball game made - I gave up on Live years ago so I ca n't compare it .
 If the guy below is complaning cuz he cant score 200 points in a 10 minute game then this game is not for you . Go buy NBA Live which allows you to score 500 points at will . Everybody knows that NBA 2k games are sim games . Also dont write a review if you do n't know what you are talking about . In the options menu you can change the style of play from sim to arcade for little kids who want to dunk all game long and score 500 points like you do ... learn to follow the options and learn about the game before you come here and make a fool out of yourself ... This game is awsome . It represents what basketball should be . If you want to play a game where teamwork is needed then get this game . If you want to use Wade and Kobe to dunk and score 100 points with each then get live .
 After playing 2K6 I was a bit hesistant to pick up 2K7 . After doing my research between 2K7 and Live , the answer was pretty clear - my research proved to have worked out in my favor . 2K7 is simply sick !!! The game lives up to everything you see in the commercials . This game has every single player 's `` trademark '' move wheter it is a sloppy jump shot to crossing over 50 times before you reach half court . The graphics are crazy - 60 FPS and some of the smothest gameplay I have ever experienced . PLUS for franchise dorks like myself there is three team trading ! I ca n't wait to see what they add for next year . Definitly the NBA game to pick up this year .
 I bought NBA 2K7 for xbox 360 for my great nephew for his 12th birthday . He wanted some of the old games and Amazon had good deals on this one . He loves sports games .
 I enjoyed the game . Unlocked all the achievements in less than a week -LRB- except the online ones -RRB- . It was a very good game .
 I dont understand why some people spent 60 bucks on games like fifa 12 or nba 2k12 when they could have gotten this for 4 bucks ? I mean seriously the graphics are almost as good , the gameplay is basically the same , only the teams are different but so what ? Great game , very cheap , BUY IT
 This game is awesome . When i got the game , it said that it was used , but it was wrapped up and everything , with no faults and no signs of usage -LRB- or an amazon sticker -RRB- . I am glad that I ordered this product !
 This game is based on the NBA going into the 2006 season . Besides the lack of an updated roster , the only complaints I have is I was only able to one of about 20 free throws my first game and am about 5 for 40 in 3 games on a season . Overall , I was satisfied with Kobe Bryant getting 40 some points my first try even if I lost by 50 points and he shot about 40 percent . If you 're a basketball fan by all means pick it up ; the outdated roster makes it collectable . I could n't find anything online to help with franchise mode and free throws . Overall , it 's halfway realistic gameplay , and the computer subs your guys and does time outs . But not bad for my first try . a passes , b steals , Y blocks shots and the right toggle stick you have to hit twice to shoot . So very simple basic game components on the controller . I found out how to save and continue me franchise - go to `` Main '' and press `` load / save '' and load your season from there . I 've already unlocked 7 achievements in 3 games on a season . Besides the free throws and outdated rosters , it 's a decent but stressful game - who wants to sit through a losing season ?
 Great game , very rewarding for spending times and learning combination moves . I have owned this game for a couple of years , and still go back to play it occasionally . Very interesting achievements to unlock , including `` record a 5X5 with Andrei Kirilenko '' . Pretty tough .
 when first i bought this game i had high hopes especialy since playing the college version . the only reson i wont give this game 5 stars is because of those nasty menus because the way 2k has them set up you will be pulling out your hair in no time . Thats not to say the rest of the game is like that . There are plenty of games on those nasty menus to keep you busy for along time . the new in season scouting realy does this game a favour . although this game has great graphics the players still look like freaky mutants . almost all the players have their own shots that have been digitly captured and gives this game a personilized touch . overall i thought this game was an improvement over last years it still has some things that need to be worked out .
 By far the most enjoyable and realistic basketball game i 've ever played . if the graphics improve on next year 's model , you 'll be looking at the perfect basketball game .
 Everything about the game is great . Smooth game play its the clear choice for NBA . I play every day !
 After playing Live throughout my childhood , I turned my attention to the 2K series in 2001 when they released NBA 2K2 . I 've been with them ever since . I 'm 23 years old now , so my expectations of games has definitely changed over the years . I now look for games that challenge me and force me to sit back and strategize rather than button mash . NBA 2K7 definitely succeeds in that . This game captures the NBA better than any other NBA licensed game released ... Ever !! Keep in mind that this game is very complexed and if you are new to the series , expect about 1 to 2 hour learning curve . If you 're a vet to the series , like myself , then you 'll feel right at home when playing this game.The thing that separates this game from similar games is a new feature called Signature Style . Signature Style captures the moves and mannerisms of your favorite NBA players and translate them to the video game world . Pretty much every player in the game has their signature shot -LRB- that 's right even down to the 10th and 11th man on the bench -RRB- . Albeit , some shots are not accurate , but you are able to go and edit anyone 's shot to one that you feel is more accurate . Some players also perform dunks , passes , and dribbling animations specific to them.The atmosphere in this game also hits the spot . What blew me away is seeing people in the crowd walking in the stands -LRB- i.e. leaving or going to their seats -RRB- . Also during timeouts , you 'll see the cheerleaders and mascots take the center court to do their routine . The crowd reacts to everything on the court as well.Bottomline , this game is so deep I honestly do n't feel like writing anymore lol . All I can say is this
 Not comparing to Live 07 , I do not have the game , but 2K7 is not a floaty dunk fest like I heard Live 07 to be.With 2K7 , you have to tweak the sliders to get the game to where you want , but after that , its good as gold , unless you are into 150-145 dunk fest games , then 2K7 is not for you.The basic minus for 2K7 is no All-Star Weekend , but I did not pay $ 60 just play the All-Star Game .
 Is a good game , a lot of fun ... but the graphics could be better . A litle bit squares in my XBOX 360 but very realistic control .
 do n't even think about live 07 its garbage this is your best bet holla !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 111
 Smooth as silk fluid gameplay and animations are the stars of this show . Decent Next-gen graphics that can not be fully appreciated unless on high-def . Those who say otherwise , must be kidding . There is no way the original Xbox or PS2 could handle such renderings . Renderings , animations , shooting and dribbling styles are practically personalized for every player . Each character looks remarkably like their real life counterparts -LRB- in a somewhat cartoon-like fashion -RRB- with a few scary exceptions mentioned in other reviews found here . It looks like a souped up arcade in the tone of graphics and powerful fluidness that plays strictly like a sim . And this is where the game falls on its face if you are coming off of Live.The controls at first chance seem unnatural , clumsy and backwards . Pulling off jukes , crossovers etc is not controlled by the right-stick and who knows why . Instead the signature 2K Isomotion -LRB- fancy dribbling -RRB- as they like to call it is handled by holding down the right trigger -LRB- the one you are already using for running , turbo -RRB- and using the left-stick -LRB- yes , the one that you are already using for movement -RRB- . Jabbing the left stick around in specified directions while holding the right-trigger will cause your player to perform crossovers , jukes and other various ankle breakers.However , if you are like me and you are coming off of Live -- you 'll continually find yourself going to the right stick to pull off such moves . Which instead shoots the rock as the right-stick is assigned to the shot-stick -LRB- isomotion for a variation of Js , post-ups , lay-ups and dunks -RRB- . Imagine how frightening this can be at first for former Live players . I 'm dribbling down the court with Nash , I go to pull a cross over on my opponent to give me some space to make a run yet instead -LRB- accidently hit the right stick -RRB- I fork up a brick well beyond the arch . Left astonished and with my pants down , the D grabs the easy board and goes for the fast break on the return . I want to stomp on my controller into pieces before the end of the first quarter of my first game.Now , do n't get me wrong -- the shot stick actually starts to make sense after a few disastrous plays but comes with a heavy learning curve . One that is very awarding when succesful and even more so if ever trulymastered . But it 'll take some time . Your first drained three with your favorite star -LRB- ie Nash for Cash -RRB- feels like an overwhelming accomplishment in itself . Remember , this game is a sim and a strict one at that . If you are looking for the easy ride and mediocre learning curve , look elsewhere.This is the golf of NBA video games ; Frustrating , demands devotion and will kick your a __ as soon as you think you have it figured out . But with great challenge comes great awards and that could n't be any truer here . Each play down the court will have to be well planned and executed ; this game leaves little room for error . The days of 2nd nature , almost thoughtless gameplay have been throw out the window . Live fans will shreak in horror as I have and will want to run the otherway . Give 2k7 some time , patience and little bit of effort to grow accustom to the controls and you may find this game more awarding than any other you played before it . The shot stick is very intuitive and maybe too much so for its own good . The days of one button for every type of shot are long gone . Yet realize the shot stick allows you -LRB- the player -RRB- to almost fully control exactly what your player executes that is very dynamic to each scenario . Instance
 if you want the most realistic basketball simulation game out there ... this is it . no more dunkfests kids . learn to play real basketball by running plays and knowing how to shoot the ball . the graphics are awesome . signature style is as cool as it sounds . if you do n't want to play a simulation bball game , just turn option to arcade.makes nbalive irrelevant .
 - I recently snagged this game and immediately played it non stop . The intro is neat but after awhile I wish I can skip it . - The ridiculous `` Kid Pix '' retroes are still there . They have yet to fix that . - There are no starting lineup introductions . The halftime show `` Stamp Of Approval '' is alright but maybe it will be skipped after playing several games . - The mascot is not stationary this time , it goes around the stands , does stunts , and basically , it 's not boring anymore . The cheerleaders/dancers are clones though ! It is scary ! - Speaking of scary , the player graphics took a step back , some players look identical , but some are downright freaky . Especially Nowitzki , he looks like a zombie , Ginobili also looks like a weirdo . There are a lot of `` generics '' used for the rookies . Steve Nash has his long hair in this game , even though he has it shaved recently . Maybe they anticipated it growing back for opening night . - I like the individual shooting styles . Elton Brand 's is not that accurate , but for most of the stars they got it down . Kobe , LeBron , Iverson , Wade , Marion , Allen , and of course Shaq . Some players have generic shooting styles . There are also individual celebrations , but they are not overdone . You can edit any player 's shooting style . - Free throws are kind of hard because of the individual shooting style but you 'll get the hang of it . Like Shaq 's , he has that hesitation and it really feels like you are controlling him and the way he chucks those bricks . Larry Bird also has his shooting motion . - The Legends team has changed as well . The Nickel is gone , and so is Barkley and Jordan . In their place comes Karl Malone , Hakeem Olajuwon , and Tim Hardaway . Jeff Hornacek and Iverson are also legends . I find it weird that the PA and annnouncers do n't say several legend 's names , just numbers . Payton has a flattop in his legends incarnation , and Snaq is a legend but with 90 's West yet the number is # 32 . - Announcing team is back - Kevin Harlan and Kenny Smith . For some reason the commentary is still similar to 2K6 . It needs to be improved upon . Craig Sager is also there , but he just has canned comments . - The right stick menu is awkward . If I want to exit , I can not use the controller 's back button . I have to use the right stick and it takes me to the main menu and not the submenu that I was in . - Yes , there is edit numbers in the game . It wo n't allow you to assign a player number if you have another player in the same team with that number . Not only can you edit numbers , you can also edit positions , headbands , ratings , and even the player 's height - you can make Jameer a 7-footer if you want . Also the shooting animation for any player can be edited , even the generics . It 's funny to see Iverson shoot with the Marion animation , or assign the Shaq animation to Boke . - The shoe color can also be edited . - There is a create your own team in the game , kinda like the Custom Jammers from NBA Live 's past . - The rosters are as of August 1 . The Magic do n't have BO in the game but he is a FA . Augustine is nowhere to be found . At least 2K7 has Battie unlike Live . The default starters are Jameer , Redick , `` G '' , Howard , and Battie . - Ariza is in the game but the announcers and the PA do n't say his name for the third straight year in this series . What 's odd is the PA and announcer say the rookie 's names -LRB- like Redick . -RRB- - The PA announcer is glitchy . Sometimes he will say the full name , sometimes just the first name , and sometimes just the last name , and sometimes - not at all , just silence . - Th inbounding stupidity is still there , the inbounder will step inbounds before throwing the ball . - A nitpick , the Spurs baseline logo should say `` San Antonio SPURS Basketball '' yet this damn game flipped it it says `` Basketball SPURS San Antonio . '' Coyote does not have his name in the back of his jersey , but Clutch does . - Speaking of mascots , Stuff looks weird , particularly the head . It looks like it 's bigger than the body , or something . - Dwight Howard seems small , I think Joe Johnson is bulkier than him . He also , by default , wears black shoes at home . - There are several rookies in the game , the Bulls also have Safolosha , and the Lakers have Farmar . Speaking of Lakers , Boke has the new # 24 in here . - The Magic dome is definitely a generic . Phoenix , LAL , LAC , NY -LRB- called Knicks Arena -RRB- , New Orleans Arena , SBC Centre , and Toyota Centre are definitely authentics . There might be more . The scoreboards are all real , however . The Magic 's banners only say `` Division Champions '' and not the year . - One neat thing about this game is that when you view stats , there is a section called `` Scoring Summary '' and it has every player who scored and what time they scored . Then you can do a instant replay of that particular score -LRB- it keeps it in memory . -RRB- You can basically make a highlight reel , but you have to save them individually . - The overtime stupidity is still there . In OT you do n't switch baskets but in this game you switch to the other basically you are gon na be shooting at the hoop from the first half . - The handoff is also in the game and is very easily picked off by the comp . - It 's hard to pickup a loose ball for some reason . The player gawks at it first and then it hesistates before the animation changes . - The game defaults everytime to auto subs , timeouts , and late game fouling . - If you do the D-pad substitution you can not sub a guard in the Center position unless that guard 's secondary position is F or C.Overall this game is the best in this series . It is still kind of similar to last year 's game as far as gameplay , and the graphics particularly the player faces took a step back .
 I finally got the opportunity to rent this game from a local video store after only being able to play it in Best Buy for a few minutes . I must say that I am VERY impressed with the realism and realistic appearance of this game . It is definetely a step up from the always crappy , arcadey , unrealistic NBA Live series . My last game of NBA Live was when I was playing at a friend 's house , it was the most boring game I ever played in my life , nearly every shot was a dunk and it was too easy to score . I switched over to th 2K series that same year and was really impressed with the dreamcast version . Since then , admitedly I really have lost interest in the NBA overall due to whinny players , so I stopped playing B-Ball games all together . However after seeing NBA 2K7 on display in my local Best Buy I had to try it.First off the graphics in this game are VERY impressive , the court look life like , if you are not looking close enough you would think its a real game , the courts actually look wooden like their real life counterparts and from what I have seen so far the game captures every detail of the home teams court . The crowd looks lifelike and not flat . The game even has the floor moppers ! A lot of attention was given to detail and that translates to great looking game . In addition to the courts , the players look pretty good as well . My only small complaint is that the faces and facial expressions could have been done a bit better . Close ups of the players ' faces can look very weird at times , but this does not really take away from the overall appearance of the game.What good is great graphics if the actual gameplay sucks ? Fortunately 2K7 does not suffer from this flaw that many next gen games do . The gameplay in this game is very fun and realistic . Unlike NBA Live , you ca n't just run it in and dunk every play , nor can you shoot 87 % from the field . Shooting the ball is pretty difficult , but at the same time realistic . On average , a `` good '' shooting night for a player is around 50 % - 55 % and this game reflects that very well . Do n't expect to hit EVERY shot , and even if you are wide open , you may still miss , it can get frustrating at times , but hey , it happens in the real NBA as well . The default quarter length for 2K7 is the standard 5 minutes , but since this is a true SIM game , if you want realistic scoring , you have to raise the minutes to 7 or 8 minute quarters . Do n't expect to scors 100 + points with 5 minute quarters as you can do with NBA Live , and I perfer it that way.The controls of the game can be very cumbersome , expect to be fumbling your fingers all over the controller trying to figure out how to do things , because buttons do n't always seem to be in the right place . There is also a shot stick -LRB- R-stick -RRB- , but I rarely use it , because it feels unatural . The left thumbstick controls the dribbling and movement , and you can use it to do fancy moves with the ball based on your player 's dribbling skills and signature moves . The shooting takes some effort to perfect , and until you get used to it , you will find yourself bricking seemingly easy shots . Some players like Shawn Marion -LRB- Suns -RRB- on Josh Childress -LRB- Hawks -RRB- have very strange releases which makes jump shooting with them even more difficult . Speaking of shooting , free throw shooting is also pretty difficult , you have to have use the right thumbstick to control the player shot motion and since each player has different motions , this will take a lot of practice as well . Another thing about the controls is the the right thumbstick controlling the menus , it is very confusing and frustrating as well.As I said before , I am not really into the NBA until it comes to playoff time , so I have no idea how accurate the rosters are except for the obvious players . Of course AI no longer plays for the Sixers , but obviously he is still on the Sixers in the game , since the pending trade is VERY recent.Other game modes include Pratice mode which can be used to perfect your shot . There is also a street mode in which you can play 1 on 1 up to 5 on 5 using any players you like . It even has the old playground favorite of `` 21 '' in which you can play against 2 or 3 other guys from the league . There is also a seemingly deep franchise mode , which I probably wo n't be able to get into since I only have this game for 5 days.I am HIGHLY impressed with this game , so impressed in fact that I am considering purchasing this game once I turn it back in . Good thing EA did n't buy itself out of competition with the NBA , or else we would be stuck with NBA Live and all the arcadey crap it has to offer . 2K7 is for true NBA ballers that know the game is a lot more than 50 inch verticals , 85 % FG percentages , and pretty dunks . This game is HIGHLY recommended if you want a true NBA sim .
 While EA Sports have made great strides over the years in making their sports titles -LRB- Live & Madden -RRB- look better and better , 2K sports pays attention to where it counts
 I 've been playing NBA Live for years . I was a very loyal fan of the EA series . Then , the Live games started to lose its swagger . I turned to NBA 2K5 one year and absolutely loved it . The next year , I went ahead and bought Live 06 just to give EA another chance . Big mistake . 2K Sports reigns supreme when it come to a great basketball game.NBA 2K7 does n't dissapoint . It 's probobly the best basketball ever made to this date . The graphics are amazing , and so is the NBA arena 's . The arena 's make you feel like you 're really at an NBA game . The players are so realistic and resemble the real life player . LeBron bites his fingernails , Gilbert Arenas throws his jersey in the stands , Allen Iverson has his killer crossover , etc. . This game is as real as it gets.The player ratings in the game are much more realistic than NBA Live 07 . It seems like 2K Sports has done more research about EVERY NBA player , or they just know more about basketball than EA Sports.The gameplay is also a key factor of this games success . The shot stick is wonderful and makes each players shot so much more realistic . Like I said before , you 'll actually think you are LeBron or D-Wade or whoever you are playing as.This game helped me realize that NBA Live is a thing of the past for me . From now on , it 's strictly 2K Sports that will deliver my basketball video game crave . I love this game , and you will too .
 i havent played nba live so i ca n't comment on the quality of that game or how it compares . But i have put in work on 2k7 and i must admit the first time u hit a jumper with Vince or Kobe u will instantly fall in love with the game play . Everything feels right , u cant just dunk every possesion , the defenders rotate well and the animations make u watch the replay every other play . The only negatives i have is passin on the fast break as players tend to break into animation to catch the ball which cause the break to slow . If anything u can use the new lead pass button which does remedy this problem some what . Also the menu can be confusing cause u have to keep flickin the right analog . Other than that 2k7 is a must buy for any basketball fan !! Long live 2k7
 My first sports game for the XBOX 360 , and the best sports game I have ever played . Amazing graphics , great gameplay , and just the right amount of challenge . And playing online with other people is so seamless , it feels like you are in the room with them . A must buy !!
 I 'll be honest . I have n't played too many basketball games since Super Nintendo , but I know quality when I see it and this game has an all around good feel to it . The controls allow for quick movement and slick ball control . The character movements and actions are among the best I 've ever seen and give the game an extra realistic feel.The graphics are so-so when I look at it on a whole with other next-gen console games . It also seemed like the higher I set the difficulty setting , the dumber and less talented my team would get . I 'd miss multiple layups in a row and set an all time record for bricked dunks.On top of that if I started getting a decent lead on the opposing team I seemed more prone to get foul calls from dumb teamates I could n't control like 3 seconds in the paint or fouling a shooter outside the paint . I understand this makes the game harder but I do n't think frustrating teamate A.I. is the answer.Also I 'll be the first to admit that I 'm not crazy about rap but even somebody that loves to listen to it would tell you that the music is garbage . There 's bad rap and then there 's really really really bad rap.To top it all off Kenny 's Halftime show with his stamp of approvals does n't have a whole lot of variety . I think there 's about ten different stamps total and you 'll have seen them all after playing five games or so.I know it sounds like I 'm downing this game bad but it 's really not a bad game . I enjoy it and I 'm glad I bought it . I just figure you should know its shortcomings before you invest in it .
 Bar none , the best NBA game on the market . Do n't just take my word for it -- every expert reviewer is able to see the plain truth also.Xbox360 and PS3 versions are nearly identical . Just do n't waste your money and time on NBA live.Great gameplay , signature moves , and special features . Would take me a year to play it all!mark
 THE LAMP IS GREAT . THE FIRST ONE I GOT WAS SUPER AND THE NEXT ONE WAS CRUSHED BUT SOON AS I CONTACTED THE COMPANY THEY REPLACED IT.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM AMAZON THEY STAND BEHIND WHAT THEY SELL .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 I purchased this to combat allergy attacks when I was doing my lawn work . The effect was amazing . No more sneezing or runny noses ! I could n't be more happy with this product . It is comfortable to wear and has held up well .
 Great Product ; Fits very comfortably and it filters perfectly . I am affected by airborne dust allergies and laundry room particles and lint . Doing my laundry is now allergy and headache free with the easy slip on mask . Provides cool air while breathing as compared to cheap masks . This is a mask you will like wearing for the dusty jobs .
 This product works GREAT , the ONLY problem , for me personally , was that it was a little hard for me to breath easily , without some effort , through the mask .
 I have been plagued by allergies and asthma attacks since my daughter brought home a puppy about a year ago . I had childhood asthma and suffered terrible bouts of bronchitis but had not had an attack in over 25 years until I began living with a pet in the house . I began sleeping in a sealed room with an air filtration system and actually dreaded 3-day weekends where I would be in the house for 3 days without a break from the pet dander . The doctor put me on advair and that helps alot , but I still have random asthma attacks . I bought the 3M HEPA Mask last week and it is a life changer . Sure , I feel silly walking around with a mask and pink `` Princess Leah '' filters -LRB- Why do they have to be pink ? -RRB- . But the mask has me breathing normal again even after the 3-day Thanksgiving weekend . As soon as I feel my lungs beginning to strain , I put on the mask for a few hours and am able to breathe easy without having to leave the house or lock myself in my sealed room . You may ask , `` Why did n't you just get rid of the dog '' ? Well , she has beautiful brown eyes and I fell in love with her the moment I saw her . I get to play with her alot more now that I have the 3M HEPA Mask . Also , the mask is easy to use , and the straps are very comfortable . The only drawback is the mask tends to stick to your face if you sweat . But hey ! Who cares ? I can breathe again !
 Bought this because hay fever kept me out of my garden and pasture . It works well at filtering pollen and allowing me to breath . Much better than a hospital type mask . Once in a while the exhalation valve gets stuck , but blowing out hard will clear it . Very nice fit around the nose , mouth and chin . As comfortable as it can be and still keep allergens out . I can work in the garden and even in the hay fields without feeling like I 'm going to die ! Have no idea how it might work to keep out poison gas .
 bought this product to relieve seasonal allergies . looks silly in public , but as a sufferer of severe seasonal allergies , it prevents almost all of my symptoms!Cons - condensation after prolonged use ; some discomfort round the nose for a good fit .
 This mask is awesome ! I suffer from life-threatening allergies . Wearing this mask has actually reduced the number of visits I have to make to the hospital . Great buy for the money !
 I am using the respirator as a pollen mask , and this product seems to be working to my satisfaction .
 My husband is undergoing a Bone Marrow Transplant at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto , CA . These face masks are givien to patients that have a compromised immune system . Dust can be deadly to these patients .
 Due to severe allergy conditions currently , my wife is wearing this mask around the clock . We can say with the mask and medications she has been stable and out of the hospital . Grateful for this product
 I Ordered this right after I took the tour of the Pig Farm in Mexico City while I was on vacation . I think It is working , cause only my Uncle got sick , cause he refused to wear one .
 It fit 's a little tight . I think it will loosen up some as time passes . Double stitching on the seams appears to be well made . . Cost almost as much as the Total original purchase ...
 Seems a bit tight but hopefully will stretch out once out in the rain and heat . I was soooo happy to see it with the scalloped edges !! The pictures and description do n't show the scalloped edges and so I thought they did not offer it anymore . Very happy : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality .

 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job

 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-

When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 First off - I am very happy with this purchase as it is exactly what I expected . And for the price , it 's hard to complain.The vest fits very nicely , i got the green large . I 'm a male 5 ' 11 '' and about 190 lbs . It fits me very nicely . Sometimes these vests bunch up around the gut looking dumpy but not this one.I have washed it a few times and it seems to be holding its colour , shape and stretch . It blocks the wind nicely and is perfect for cool autumn weather/early winter when it 's not too brutal but a t-shirt just does n't cut it.The collar is one it 's best features - it folds down nicely to keep your neck warm or you can turn it up to avoid the wind . The material is very soft and feels great on your skin.As for complaints , I find that i really miss having a breast pocket and I wish the pocket zippers went up to open as opposed to down.Since neither of these features were advertised , obviously i ca n't complain about their absence - i just prefer them and will be looking for both on my next vest purchase.One thing that I will knock off a star for is the depth of the pockets . They are quite shallow causing things to fall out easily - especially if you are sitting . If you are going to make a jacket with shallow pockets i think the pocket zips should go the other way ... Just make sure you remember to close the zips ! you can fit your entire hand in if you are trying to stay warm , but there is almost no downward angle to make a good pocket for holding your keys , phone or wallet.While we 're on the topic of zippers i will say that the quality of the zips on this jacket is top-notch . it will open or close from almost any angle and i would be very surprised if they stopped working.At $ 20 it 's hard to imagine a better purchase !
 Columbia fleece vests are the best I 've ever owned -LRB- it 's the third Columbia fleece I 've purchased -RRB- . They 're warm and very durable without being too bulky , making for a good fit and a nice appearance .
 My Significant Other needed something easy to get into because of shoulder surgery ... Perfect for him ! The warmth is wonderful ; the sizing worked out great . He did n't have a vest like this , but now he 's talking about getting another one , in another color . Pricing is perfect too . Ca n't think of any negative !
 Definitely get one size smaller than what you normally wear . I almost always wear an XL and when I tried this on it was baggy and roomy and with an item like this you want it to be snugger .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 I got two of these , the blue and the Cattail , which is just brown . They are nice and warm . They look good . They run a little bit big . I got an XL , and I usually wear an XL in everything . I 'm probably right in between a L and an XL . I 'm 6 ' and 240 lbs , if that helps you order yours correctly .
 My son really loves this vest . We ordered two in different colors . It looked very nice on him and he wore it every other day with jeans . A great vest !
 Bought this for my dad for Christmas . He really llikes it . Fits really well and was just as promised and described .
 Perfect fit - this was purchased for an elderly person for indoor wear . It 's not black and it 's not grey - more like graphite . It is very lightweight and keeps him cozy and warm in these cold months .
 We 've been wearing our own Columbia vests for quite some time here in Wisconsin , but it only recently occurred to me that it was just the thing for my 93-year-old dad in Florida , who 's often cold , despite fairly warm temperatures . He loves the vest 's softness and is enjoying having something more youthful and &#34; cool &#34; to wear . I 'm happy to know that it 's easily machine wash and dryable .
 I picked this up to use as a stand-alone or extra layering depending on the temperature . This vest is great - it 's like wearing a soft fleece blanket.It fits easily under all my jackets or sweatshirts . A nice bonus is the zip pockets - they 're great for my phone or warming up my hands very fast .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .
 All I wanted was a basic vest for cool summer days . Does the job perfectly . Will not stop the wind or keep you very warm - but if you are a guy needing pockets for your wallet - this works well .
 I have wide shoulders -LRB- 50 Regular suit jacket -RRB- , and the XL fit me perfect . I was especially pleased with the collar - which was shorter when popped than the previous Columbia vest I had owned . My previous fleece vest from Columbia lasted me about 2 years , so I have high hopes for this one as well . Very soft , great fit , extremely comfortable and versatile .
 Purchased this vest as a team vest for our local biathlon team . The fit was slightly large , but that is good for winter wear . The length was just below belt line . This is ideal for keeping the lower back warm while skiing and also shooting . Everyone that got a vest on our team was very pleased with the fit and the look . Great for training and looks good too !
 Dumb me , I ordered the wrong size . No problem with this purchase . It was easy to return and reorder the correct size . Credit came through for this purchase with days of me shipping wrong size back . This firm is `` On he Ball '' when it comes to handling a situation like this .
 While I do n't get too excited by clothing , and this is no exception , I do find this is a well made , comfortably warm vest , that I am glad I purchased .
 I wear this as an insulating layering or by itself over a shirt . It looks much better than my Columbia fleece which does n't have much shape . I like that it is super light and moderately warm .
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Wonderful vest at retail price , the Amazon has outdone itself.For $ 12 + tax , it seems like a steal to me.The material is very soft and of good craftmanship.thank you , Amazon and Columbia
 This product is a good value . Nothing spectacular , but a good deal . I use it as a good layer for skiing to provide warmth for my core without restricting shoulder and elbow movement . It more than adequately provides what I need .
 Every piece of Columbia clothing that I own is top quality and this is no different . It 's a lightweight , and yet warm vest perfect for those crisp fall days .
 Not a whole lot to say other than it 's well built , the fabric is very comfortable and strong feeling and the vest looks great . I 'd buy it again if I had the need .
 this is a very nice vest . looks good on and fabric is great . color stays true when washed as well
 Good light weight Vest.Material soft and flexible.Deep pockets . The fit was great . I wear mine in the office . I would recommend .
 This vest is similar to my Columbia Fleece jacket -- both are excellent and perform very well , especially at this price point . Fast delivery too .
 Was just what i was looking for . Brand new with tags and shipped very quickly . My husband loves it . Color looks exactly same as shown in the pic as well .
 I bought this for my husband because he likes a fleece vest with a collar . He is very pleased and the vest looks great . The collar is big enough to really keep the wind off your neck .
 Its comfortable , warm , a little short in length but overall a really nice vest for me to wear in all types of weather . If I had to complain about one thing it would be that it is not fleece like I thought it would be so make sure you know what you 're buying . Other then that a nice product though !
 The vest fits well and is well made . If it had a zippered breast pocket it would be ideal and would get 5 stars . I would order it again .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .
 fits great , the blue is amazing , its warm but not too warm , I simply love this one . also got the black one and this a great product .
 I received just what I had ordered , which was the same brand I 've always worn and it was received very quickly before the expected date was even close to being up . I love my Columbia vests .
 Estoy muy contento de haber encargado &eacute;sta prenda . El color es muy suave y elegante . La prenda es muy c&oacute;moda .
 i liked this vest , , , the texture of the fabric is ideal for all season with style the thing is there is not enough pockets , , , , , , but it really serve my life style , , , , ill going to buy two more , , , i love it.i recommend this vest for all walks of life in style .
 Just the right weight to be outside in the Fall or Spring doing things . Keeps you warm without restricting mobility . Looks good and is very functional .
 I like Columbia garments for myself . So I bought one for My Dad for Christmas . It fits well in the XL and is nicely made.Washable too !!
 Quick service , good price and no complaints after wearing this for a month . Considering ordering another in a different color .
 Great vest for cool sunny days . Vest is a little on the thin side . It looks great and feels great . The only problem occurs is that it lets wind in and out very easily . I would recommend this to a friend , but do n't look for a whole lot of warmth from it .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !
 A gift for my Grandson , quality and craftsmanship excellent , could not ask for a better product , or reliability . Thank you for a great fitting product , my Grandson absolutely loves it .
 I gave my husband this for Christmas and he is pleased , so I am too . Looks good , is comfortable . Have only had it less than 1 week .
 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 I ordered several of these in different colors . The quality is great and the sizing is true . Furthermore , they have come out of the washer & dryer looking like new each and every time . If additional colors become available , I wo n't hesitate to order more .
 Ordered this vest for my husband for Christmas . Beautiful red shade , and fits extremely well . He is very happy and I was pleased that it arrived so quickly and in perfect condition .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good . This large fit nicely over a bit more belly than desired but would still fit well minus the extra pounds .
 I bought this vest for my husband for Christmas . It was perfect . He 's 6 ' 2 '' and about 220lbs and the XL fits him perfectly . He loves wearing it . It 's great for Southern winters were it does n't get too cold .
 This vest is very warm . It fits snug to your body keeping in your core body heat.The pockets are large . . perfect for someone who likes to carry a lot of things with them.The collar can be flipped up to cover more of your neck , or folded down when it 's not as cold.The fleece is very soft , and the vest overall is made well . I recommend this vest if you ` relooking to keep warm this winter . . either worn solo or as part of your winter layered clothing .
 I have been wearing this vest everyday since i got it . the color is great and the warmth is perfect . its not cold enough to wear heavy down jacket but this is just right for the cool days and nights here is S. Calif. thank you
 I ordered this one night , and had it in my hands within 3 business days - with regular shipping . It is a very good layer to add to any winter gear . It has two side zip-up pockets , and the collar zips all the way up if you need . It is super lightweight , and very warm -LRB- for a vest -RRB- . This vest does stop a tiny bit of wind , but not much . On a cool rainy day , wear this underneath a non-insulated rain jacket -LRB- shell -RRB- , and it 's perfect ! -- Very nice !
 This vest was exactly what I wanted . It has a furry texture -LRB- not all fleeces have that same texture -RRB- ; it has pockets that completely sewn into the garment -LRB- some sew it only on one edge -RRB- ; it has room in the pockets all the way to the side edge -LRB- and not just to the edge of the zipper -RRB- . The fit was good ; the sizes run large , so a L fits an XL person . I am very please and will probably purchase another .
 I was trying to purchase this tie for a grandson 's Christmas gift . I tried a couple of places and they would cancel on me . It was a couple of days late but this company came thru for me .
 I use it to take Body Balance liquid vitamins and needed a 2oz glass so I bought it .
 I bought this as a Christmas gift for dad . He has a pool table with walls that are little tight on the long side . He wanted an adjustable cue for lenght and weight . He tells me this a quality pool cue and since he has years of experience I feel confident to pass this recommendation .
 My son has definitely improved his game with this stick . He is 7 and loves it .
 These flat fenders are great for slips that are a bit on the tight side as they are flat but still provide excellent protection .
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He is very fussy and almost always finds something -LRB- even if it is really minor -RRB- wrong with anything he either buys or receives . He has worn this vest 3 times and has only had it for 6 days ! The fit was on target a large is a large . The craftsmanship above average . The price very good .

 Fleece is fleece , but this vest is surprisingly well put-together . The only thing is it missing is a third pocket -LRB- the small vertical one near the left center that most other vests have -RRB- .
 I was very satisfied with the vest . I would get a size smaller than your usual size , they run big .
 I had to replace a vest the job gave me because it was wearing out . I decided to order these vest in different colors . They go great with whatever I wear at the job . The quality is good for the money . I 'm known as the vest guy now .

 very nice vest . light yet warm enough and not too hot during warmer days . the run a little big , I ordered a Large and had to exchange it for a M and I run on the larger side ... in all great buy I would recommend to a friend hands down ...
 I lost a vest that I previously owned , so I was looking for one to replace it . I am very satisfied with the fit and color of the one I purchased .
 Not the first vest of this type from Columbia that I 've purchased . Exactly what I wanted , soft , light weight but provides the warmth I want . Seems easy to mantian , wears good over time , easy to fold and carry if not needed . Satisfied .
 Awesome vest . Better than expected , well packed and arrived quickly ! I give it 2 thumbs up and my highest recommendation !

 Honestly do n't know what 's all the hype about the North Face is . The good old Columbia looks great , feels comfortable and is well made . Navy color is very pleasant to the eye . I am very happy with the vest .
 My husband absolutely loved his vest I got him . We have even bought these in different colors . We would recommend this to anyone looking for a vest to wear as a casual attire or even a dressy attire .
 Bought this vest for my brother and he loves it . I really liked the color of it because its so different .
 The fit , number of zippered pockets , and quality of fabric are all in keeping with a fleece vest that might have cost $ 15 or so more .
 Got this as a present for my dad . He loved it . Ordered an xl should have gone smaller product runs big

 I bought this as soon as the Winter cold hit NM and love it . The XL I first purchased was a bit short -LRB- I 'm 6 ' 5 &#34; -RRB- so I then bought an XLT which I put in the morning and wear till I retire at night . Excellent warmth and comfort . Excellent value for money .
 These vests are the most comfortable and great lookingAnd are very affordable and go great with any causual outfit
 My wife bought a couple of these first . I saw them and liked what I saw . Then I learned that she had bought a men 's vest , so I was pretty sure I could have one , too ! The zipper on the pockets is necessary , since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out . I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist . I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that . The material is pleasingly soft and warm . They clean up in the washing machine.My wife 's two vests are the same size , but the waistband is larger on one than the other . They were manufactured in different countries .
 As it usually happens , Columbia makes the best and tis vest is not an exception . comfortable , nice and well made .

 What 's to review ? It is fleece , warm , I picked the color and got what I wanted . I did get a better price than I expected.Here is something review-worthy
 This is a good vest and I enjoy the heck out of mine . I actually own two in different colours , since I was given another one several years ago for my birthday . There are already a lot of reviews and opinions here so I will not be too redundant.The vest is Polartec fleece -LRB- 200 mid-weight -RRB- so it keeps the core warm and comfortable down to about 40 degrees F. Any colder and I must go to a higher tech solution . It works wet or dry , and drys pretty quickly if soaked.It 's a cozy piece of gear and I think a perfect gift item for a loved one since they will think of you in the comfort and warmth of it . I actually LIKE that short fuzzy fibres starts to clump and pill like a snuggly , familiar stuffed teddy bear after only a few washings . I often use it as a throw blanket or a pillow -LRB- esp on airline flights -RRB- . It is also very easy to maintain and as I have two , I often have one in the wash as I 'm wearing the other one.I like the roomy sizing as I use this for layering , and this is an intermediate layer . When zipped all the way up , it practically serves as it 's own Polartec scarf around the neck . Being a taller/larger human , I appreciate that this vest is available in extended sizes too.The design of the vest is simple with a stand up/fold down collar , 2 zippered side slash pockets at the waist , and the Columbia logo on the chest.Herein lies , my first minor criticism ... value . For a simple , unlined vest without any `` extras '' -LRB- like chest pocket , map pocket , interior pockets , drawstring at the bottom or the waist , throat abrasion guard , dbl access zipper , uppers shell , back hook loop , even zipper pulls with whistles , compasses and LED lights -RRB- I would expect a basic level price . If you shop around even online you should quickly get a feel for what the no frills model vs. the all the bells and whistles model are comparatively worth.The two pockets that it does have utilizes this elastized sateen material as the interior . Not only is this pocket lining not very warm , but I find that it snags uncomfortably on little dry skin flakes , hangnails , and tiny dry skin spurs on my hands . It might be just me , but it makes it unpleasant to put my hands in the pockets -LRB- for warmth -RRB- . On both of my Columbia vests , I have replaced the pocket liners with nice non-snagging flat mesh -LRB- like that found in luggage pockets -RRB- . Well the world is what you make of it , so of course I have made some heavy mods to my vests , which have made them my favourites and practically daily wear for me.Columbia makes consistently high quality products -LRB- overseas -RRB- geared toward the outdoor person , so paying a little bit extra for the brand name logo is not that painful I guess .
 This vest is very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear . Most of the time I wear it with short sleeved shirts . When zipped , it 's just right for those 45-50 degree days -LRB- as long as you 're not out in the chill for really long periods - but fine for car-to-store , or short walks -RRB- . It 's also great around the house when you want to drop the thermostat a few degrees to save a little on heating costs . My only disappointment is the main zipper . Sometimes it takes several tries to get it started , and it often sticks mid-zip -LRB- as if there was grit or something in it -RRB- . It always ends up working , but not always smoothly . I 'd definitely recommend the vest , and I suspect my zipper issue is not a design flaw , but rather a production glitch , which would not likely affect other buyers .
 I have purchased Columbia products I have liked in the past . So this was not a difficult choice form me . It is sized correctly for the big guys . I ordered a xxlt and it fits just the way it should . I nice way to add a bit of extra warmth under a jacket that need a little help . Good price and a quality product that was shipped fast .
 Ca n't beat the price , but the vest is larger than I thought a large would be - should 've got a medium .
 This Columbia vest is a quality product and is equipped with a durable zipper , style and feel .
 Works for what I wanted . Something to wear while walking in cooler temps , where I did n't want a full coat .
 This product was first class -LRB- not a second -RRB- and was as ordered and on time . Ca n't get any better than that .
 This vest is soft yet rugged , true to size and just right for my son for Christmas .
 It 's hard for me to find some shirt with right size sleeve and collar . But that would be a problem for a vest , :-RRB- . I do n't like the zippers on the pockets , i never put any stuff in the pockets . Overall , this is a good vest for me , I wish it a little bit warmer .
 Columbia sizes are really big so just be a little conservative in ordering for sizes . Buy is for less than 20 bucks for getting value .
 I was satified with the product my only concern is that the color was off black insteadof black .
 One of the better purchases I 've made , in terms of satisfaction and value.The product is well-made and durable , which you come to expect from Columbia . It can be had for a good price and should last for a long time . Fits true to size , zipper works fine , and it does its job
 I purchased this vest for my husband . He finds them to be warm yet keeps his arms free at work . This Columbia vest is very nice and thick . Very nicely made and of good quality .
 Bought this for my husband , and he really liked it . The vest is generously cut and well sewn . It 's also very soft and the color is true and pleasing.Just right for those chilly nights when a long sleeved sweater would be `` too much . ''
 Have several different brands . . this is the best value of all ... fits great quality stitching and best price of all seen
 Extremely pleased with this purchase . After having ordered the wrong color by mistake , i quickly ordered again . Came exactly as described and within given time . No disappointments here !
 The vest is great -- second one I 've purchased ; however , the zipper , as the vest ages , has a tendency to pull apart at the bottom . The reason is the very short insert piece . Increase the depth of the insert and this vest would rate 5 stars . I bought my first vest at Mervins and when they went out of business I never found this make of vest again until I checked Amazon.com -- a great source and great products .
 I bought this vest for a casual look around the office and not at all disappointed . The sizing is about average , the look is great , and as it is Columbia , the material is of good quality . It will keep one warm in the winter months .
 This was a Christmas gift for my husband that he actually loved . Thanks for a great buy . Will be back !
 I 've had this vest for about a month now & I really do enjoy it.I 've had similar vests in the past , but I needed something newer to wear around the office and under my winter coat when a sweater or hoody just does n't work.The vest is very soft & does n't get caught on much . I bought the dark grey hoping that it would `` hide '' my dogs hair unlike the black vest . And it does . I have a beagle , and I can barely notice when -LRB- a few/decent amount -RRB- of his white & black hairs get on it . Some fleece seems to attract dog hair & never let go - this does NOT.The only negative I have about this vest , as others noted , is that there is n't a pull string around the waist . This has n't really bothered me , but I would like to tighten it up just a little bit.I work outdoors so this is perfect for helping me layer up but allowing me something to wear that wo n't bulk up & slow down my arm movement which happens if you wear too many sweaters or hoody 's . I plan on buying another in a few months so I do n't wear this one out too much . Awesome price too . I checked a couple of stores online and no one had the same price as Amazon .
 I just want to say that is the best way to keep you warm , high quality product and very comfortable .
 My experience with this Columbia vest made me feel it was spot on for size . The side pockets a bonus for a mid-layer piece . The vest itself let me wanting a little more . The collar is double the weight of the main body of the vest . It is a nice vest but thin for use as a mid-layer . I myself would have preferred if the body was equal to the collar in weight , but for the price I paid I 'd have to say it matches the quality . I guess I expected a little more from Columbia , as I own other products from them that always went beyond my expectations . Guess I 'll just have to be a little creative in my layering to get the best use out of this purchase . The style and color are nice , but I also got the `` bunching '' effect during active use , maybe better as a low activity use item , walking around town and such . It really comes down to what you 'll be using it for , activity level and quality of other layering items .
 Ordered the Large in Green color and was a great value . Quality was excellent as you would expect from Columbia .
 These vests are well made , stylish and fullfill their purpose exceptionally . They provide a little extra warmth at home when the thermostat is set down low to save energy . But being sleveless they do n't make you sweat . The sizes are exactly as specified . I normally wear large in shirts and jackets , and the large vest fits perfectly .
 Fits great and what a great price -- medium weight - true to size for mens large . Priced locally at $ 65 dollars
 love columbia products , it helps keep my chest warm so I can lower the heat in the house during the daytime .
 This vest is exactly what I wanted , lightweight yet warm , does n't hinder arm and shoulder motion ; very soft comfortable material .
 I chose thie vest because of the brand and color . It is good quality and stylish . Shipping was fast . I 'm happy , happy , happy !
 Fits just right , material is a nice weight . very warm . Columbia products are always nice . ca n't go wrong with this vest .
 Vest is a nice weight , not too heavy or too lightweight . Great over a long sleeve t-shirt or henley . The charcoal color is really nice . It holds up well through repeated washings . He got this vest last year for Christmas and recently lost it but he loves it so much he asked for a replacement . So if your husband is forgetful like mine you might want to get two . : -RRB-
 Absolutely a fine purchase . I really like this vest -- the fit , the breathability , the warmth . Excellent quality . I recommend it highly .
 My wife wanted one for Traveling , got it , Love 's it , She is very Happy and i am very Happy . Thanks
 We are very pleased with the Vest that we purchased and are looking forward to giving it to my Father in Law for the holiday . I am sure he will be happy . Sizing looks accurate as does fabric and style . It will be a great gift for him
 Great extra layer for the winter.Very good quality . Generous pockets.Extremely comfortable.Logo over the breast is pleasantly inconspicuous .
 Most of my winter gear is from Columbia and I 've never had any complaints about it . It 's about half the price of a comparable North Face garment and works just as well .
 Like all Columbia products , this item arrived true to fit and size . I purchased this item for my husband and he wears it all the time . It washes well and is very durable . We have had this product for two years and it still looks and feels brand new .
 I bought this to layer under my coat when the weather dips below freezing . It 's comfortable , soft , and keeps me warm . I also like the blue color . Dropped one star because it seems to be made for people with pot bellies . I 'm 6 ' 1 180 and the medium fits perfectly lengthwise and in the shoulder/chest area but there 's a lot of extra fabric in the middle .
 Nice color and Im wanting to buy another vest different color . I highly reccomend to buy , columbia has great cloths .
 I wear this nearly every day in the office to stay warm . It 's fleece is perfect , and I love the freedom to move my arms . Size is perfect . No complaints .
 Great extra layer to add during the winter months for a fair price . Looks great too around the office or at home .
 My son and my husband loved their new vests . They love the feel and fit and the colors . I will have to remember to get them some more .
 Ca n't beat this vest especially for the price ! I have purchased 3 of them !
 My son was very pleased with this vest . I liked the price for a name like Columbia Sportwear . I also liked how fast it was sent to me .
 The vest is comfortable and roomy , though not the very best of materials .
 This was a gift for someone . From what I saw , he was very pleased with it . The item arrived in a very timely manner .
 Purchased two of these for Christmas gifts . Was very impressed with the quality . Would definitely buy again !
 I bought this for my husband last year , for Christmas . At this point in time , no complaints at all from him . Washes well and wears well , and its light color does n't show white dog hair , which was a must for a new vest !
 Quality is good but I need Longs and they dont seem to have many longs
 Warm and made well and comfortable . Husband wears a large but had to order in medium size . He loves it but beware it runs large . Price was great too !
 Bought this at half the price to replace an old Columbia vest in which the zipper fell apart after a year . Wore it 5 days a week for work so I got my monies worth although I paid full price for that one .
 Columbia Men 's Cathedral Peak VestAmple sizing for stout waste . Soft , good feeling fabric with good zippers and warm comfort.Good color and value for a casual look.It can be worn most of the time for a light jacket or coat . Easy to maintain .
 Like the columbia fleece product they are soft . I got the same product from a discount store and it was cheaper even after tax . I have to rate it as 4 because of the product quality .
 This is my second Columbia vest and I really like them . I would recommend this vest to anyone . I like to wear it to work with my dress shirts and ties . Looks sharp .
 I have received this Vest , It is according the picture and it is beautiful , I like the color and I recommend to the people buy this product .
 This vest is the best value in a fleece vest that I 've found , hands down -- for quality , comfort , durability ... I travel constantly and I like the charcoal color because it shows no lint , hair etc. . I lost one of these and replaced it immediately . It 's perfect for layering in cool or cold weather ... but also for that little extra warmth I need in a refrigerated movie theater . -- When I replaced my lost vest I looked at other brands again and was reminded that this Columbia vest is the best thing out there for the money ... by far .
 Lightweight . I wear it mostly at night in my hammock to keep warm throughout the night . Layers well . Added a drawstring at the waist . Easy to do but would have preferred it was included .
 Although the product is great . It was not the exact color as published . It does not have a different color on the neck
 It was wright for what I was looking for . It arrived in good conditions but the coulor is a bit different that in the picture anyway it fits well , thanks .
 Very nicely made Vest.Columbia has great products.Like the texture of the material.Pictures on amazon page could be better .
 The fit is not too loose and the cypress color is a gray-green cross . Nice neutral color for men . This was purchased for use in winter time , but it 's rather thin to wear alone . It 's better suited for use in spring-time or under a jacket since it 's not bulky .
 Great ! The fabric felt very gentle , and it 's very light . My husband love it very much . I also introduced it to our friends , one of them placed an order , so I bought it again . The size is a little bit bigger .
 The product was made well . It looks good has a lining but I found that it was not as warm as a similar product purchased over 10 years ago . I did not return it as when the weather gets warmer or when I will wear it inside .
 He likes it . A basic black vest . Seems well made unlike some brands whose zippers are not the best quality . If you are not broad shouldered though the sleeve area in the large size is a bit &#34; wingy &#34; looking . My husband is tall but not bulky so it is a little too big in that respect .
 Second of the same type for me . Perfect for cool weather . Yes indeed . comfy warm not restrictive . All one could ask .
 Columbia gear seems to be priced much lower than other companies like Patagonia and North Face but I feel like the quality of Columbia 's clothes stands up.This vest is exceptionally warm and comfortable .
 The most important factors for me when purchasing a vest were warmth and comfort . This vest is just what I wanted in both categories . It gives me just the right amount of warmth when I go for my morning run without getting too hot once I get warmed up . It 's also comfortable and soft . The pockets have zippers so I can put my keys etc in there and do n't have to worry about them falling out . The only fault I can find is the zippers jingle a bit as I move . Overall I 'm happy with my purchase .
 This was a great purchase for my husbands birthday . Very well cut and designed using quality materials that wear well . I purchsed the navy color and it is a very nice shade more of a navy/grey that goes well with everything . My husband wears a size 42 jacket so I purchased the large since the medium I bought him before fit a little too close for his liking , the large is a little roomier . Columbia is always a good product and the price was good too .
 This is a beautifully made vest and my husband loves the color -LRB- bark -RRB- . From another review I was tipped off that the vest runs large , so I got a size smaller than my husband 's usual size -LRB- XL to L -RRB- . It fits perfectly .
 This is a great vest . I ordered a medium , I am a 38 &#34; in chest , yet the medium was too big for me really -LRB- if you want a close to the body fit -RRB- . I will get this vest again in a smaller size and other color .
 This vest is of decent quality , not quite as good as the previous Columbia fleece vest as it is thinner . The color is more of a faded black or dark grey than black . I think I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price but for $ 25 it is worth it . I would buy it again .
 everything in order , very good quality product , service stock.came charging according to the agreement.excellent , recommended to all users .
 I ordered this as something to layer underneath my work jackets . It fits well , so it should be comfortable when layering . Even if this just lasts through this winter , it was a great deal at this price.I have a lot of Colombia jackets -LRB- fleece , rain shell , omni-heat jacket , etc. -RRB- , and I have never been disappointed .
 This vest is just right when a jacket is too much , or when a less bulky additional layer is needed . It is true to size and is well constructed . I plan to add other colors to my collection .
 Quality is good , not as thin as some said . Fit is small than usual . I wear a medium usually but was glad I got a small .
 The vest is comfortable and is made well . The size is my only reason for giving 4 stars . The vest runs on the large side . If you want a tighter fit you will have to order at least one size smaller than what you normally wear . It would be better with an elastic draw string too .
 Bought this for my son in college after he asked for a black fleece vest for his birthday ... He thought it was perfect .
 Got my Columbia Cathedral Vest yesterday . Fits great and does it 's job perfectly.Paid 36 $ for it and its worth the money . It 's also much cheaper than similar products from North Face.Great for a run !
 The product was easy to use and accurate . It is also a great buy !
