 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 This is the second time I have bought this jacket . I wore the first one out ! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman . I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size . This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old .

 Definitely not disappointed with the quality of this product , but I 'm not sure about the claim that &#34; one size fits most . &#34; Maybe most football players . Very large , but shrinks a little with washing .

 Excellent purchase , can not go wrong with Cocoons , have tried the cheaper imitations sold at the drugstores and these are far superior in comfort , styling , and quality of lens . I am back to Cocoons for life ! Great seller and service !
 just like the title says . Warm , comfy but run a size too big . I do n't wear them out as they are just for lounging , so it 's not that big of a deal for me .
 As is the case with most adidas products I 've owned , my 3-stripe fleece pants are made for style , fit , and durability . They are just the right weight of fabric for those cool winter mornings in Southern California -LRB- not so for 85degree summer days , when I 'll stash them away for cooler days to come -RRB- . My size is somewhere between a medium and a large . These adidas pants are amply cut , but maybe a tad too roomy for my particular build . A medium would probably be restrictive when I 'm doing calesthenics or some weight exercises . This being said , I am nevertheless very happy with this product and with Amazon 's superior service .
 I received the size I ordered and they fit perfectly . Normally , I am unsure when it comes to children clothes , but I am pleased with these pants .
 I ordered these for my five year old in size 6 . They are pretty decent pants but just one addition would make these pants a five , if they added the adjustable waist band feature that most of the pants her size have -LRB- the one with stretch and a button inside the waist band -RRB- . Other than this one suggestion they wash and wear well .

 These are great pants . They are really comfortable and easy to care for . I 'm saving money too because I do n't have to take these to the dry cleaners . I love the `` Individual Fit '' waste band . Who would n't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size .
 These pants are really great . They fit well and rarely wrinkle . I like that they are really classic - I can wear them at the office and then I can wear them if I go out later in the evening as well . I have owned a lot of Docker 's pants and they all last extremely well .
 This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size -LRB- inseam -RRB- ranges than other Dockers products . And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs .
 We had a hard time finding Dockers in 29x30 . This place had them , and they fit great . Shipping was quick . We would buy from again.Recommended !!
 The Dockers `` individual fit '' system works well , in that one can get by without `` odd '' waist sizes like 33 , 35 , etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to . These pants are very durable , and still look presentable after washing and machine drying . An ironing every so often would probably be useful for `` business casual '' . A good value .
 I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants . The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores . I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length . The delivery was quick -LRB- especially during Christmas -RRB- and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose .
 The pants were just what I was looking for and the seller , Beals Florida was prompt and courteous .
 Ok so these are great pants . Come on guys . They are pleated . Even though the stores sell pleated pants does n't mean you should be wearing them.The only thing the pleats do is add bulk to the waist line area and make you look fat or fatter.Just get the flat front Dockers and do all of us a favor .
 This product was just what I was hoping for , and I had no problem with shipping . I highly recommend this product .
 `` Package arrived before the estimated date , and actually was delivered the same day as another item ordered from another seller which was sent 2nd-day air on the same day ! Way to go Bealls ! The pants fit fine , right colors , right size , so that 's what counts . ''
 Good communication and super-fast shipping ! Item arrived exactly as described -LRB- I am actually wearing them right now ... -RRB- . I have never had a better online purchasing experience . Thanks a million !
 very happy with the look and fit . the fabric feel is great , do n't even think of them as `` khakis '' .
 The pants are very soft and comfortable . The color holds up fairly well , but I do wish the darker colors held better . I do recommend them .
 To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers , but not here . These are real Dockers slacks with real quality . These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price . I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section . Pleats seem to disguise that nicely . I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well , and these are true Dockers.CA Luster
 Product arrive well ahead of schedule , met expectations , and price was better than local retail .
 received the pants when you said . they fit . i am pleased with the purchase and the delivery
 I absolutely love these -LRB- white -RRB- Dockers pants ! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton . For summer wear , you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen , DKNY , Pierre Cardin , Geoffrey Beene , Stafford or other such brand . The `` individual-fit '' waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort .
 I hate shopping anywhere but online . Pant sizes , however , tend to be so irregular that I 've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl 's -LRB- or Walmart , if it 's closer -RRB- . Finally , a solution
 Pants fit real nice . They have the individual fit waistband that is real nice . No complaints so far .
 I bought these for my father who is 6 ' 5 '' for father 's day , in black -LCB- 36x36 -RCB- . They are excellent quality , have a great fit , and look perfect on him . Great range of sizes !
 I really like these pants . They fit and are a little stretchy in the waist . It is just enough to make up for some of the mid-life expansion my body is going through . I bet it will work for you too !
 I bought these pants for my husband for work and he loves them . They wash well and still look good !
 I did not pay extra for shipping and thought I might regret it . I received my son 's pants within 3 days !!! Awesome !!
 It 's tough to beat Dockers for casual pants - good looks and a good fit .

 Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times . It 's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher . The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette -LRB- most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly -RRB- . I 'm pleased with the product . One thing I will say on the negative side is that I 'm rather short . These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I 'm 5 ' 1 '' . Not an issue , it 's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants , but I 'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans . Not the best for sitting , whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely would n't do that . The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised .
 I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all . I do suggest finding your correct size , not the size you think you are . The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape . It flattens your middle so your blouses , tshirts and dresses look much nicer .
 I absolutely love all of squeem 's products . I gained about 15 pounds while I was unemployed & wearing sqeem really helped me get my figure back . Went from a size 9 back to a size 4 in 2 months & lost about 10 inches off my waist , stomach & hips .
 I actually bought this item to give my hips a little more definition and it did just that ! At 1st I thought I was never going to be able to get it on , but once I did I realized I could have set it on the tighter hooks . It 's pretty comfortable , unless you 're having to suffer 100 degrees of humidity like we do here in Chicago . I 'd suggest wearing it for about an hour the 1st day you get it and slowly working your way up if you 're planning on wearing all day . I will warn you though ... It 's pushing and squeezing everything together . So expect to have to use the restroom a lot . I 'm VERY satisfied with this corset and I 'd suggest it for almost any outfit . The closure in the front will give it away with smooth form fitting clothing . I bought it to wear under a form fitting ruffled dress and you ca n't tell . Oh the sizing ... . I 'm usually a dress size 4-6 but I ordered the medium 8-10 ? and it fits just as well . I 'd still like to be able to breathe so if you 're not a 0-2 I 'd suggest going one size up .
 This product is wonderful ! I have a tight and small waist from long term work out , but this product makes me look even more hourglassy . It 's very comfortable , however , it can give me some chest pain after 4 hour straight use though . I suppose it 's caused by the reduced oxygen intake since I work out a lot and have a relatively big lung volume .
 I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back . This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL . Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips . EUREKA !! What a difference this made now i 'm loving it and hardly leave home without it . I originally bought the XL nude now i 'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product , my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer .
 I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus . I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive . This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you can not wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation . I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me , going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones -LRB- I am 5ft 4 -RRB- The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably , enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss ... but I think I will give it a try .
 I now have two Squeem corsets - one in nude and onein black . They really work . With my corset on I havea flatt tummy again and my clothes fit well . I do nothave that `` girdled '' look and no one can tell . I amvery happy to not need stockings or panties and onceit is on in the morning I am set for the day . Withmy Squeem on I am comfortable , look nice and evenforget that I have it on . I would not leave homewithout my girdle .
 I placed my order on Sunday February 13th and was not expecting to see it at my door until Thursday on the 17th ... WELL I received an email confirmation that it was shipped on Monday the 14th as promised which I kinda figured , but when I opened my door this afternoon -LRB- 1:00 PM -RRB- on Tuesday the 15th my order was here and I was BEYOND HAPPY !! Not only with the promptness of delivery , but the product as well . Of course everyone immediately takes flight to try on new stuff as I am no different . So after trying on my new `` Magical Lingerie '' not only did I smile but my better half did too . `` AMAZING '' does no justice in describing the magic performed by this new accessory . THANKS FOR THE SMILES IN A BOX !!
 I 've worn everyting from Spanx to Flexees after a hernia surgery I sought something with more structure so the I could give up the bulky , velcro ladden wrap the hospital gave me . It lead me to Squeem . I will suck you in 2-3 inches and is well made -- making it worth every penny . When I wear it , I turn it so the eyelets are on the side since sometimes they are noticeable in a fitted shirt . The `` pressure '' helps to keep my diet in check too -- makes me think twice before overindulging . I 'm definitely a squeem fan !
 I wrote a review yesterday but it has not posted yet . I wanted to give an update so people considering this purchase can benefit.I am 5 ' 4 '' 165 lbs and normally have a 33-35 in waist . I ordered the medium . After only one day , I realize I will have to transition quickly to a small to meet my goals . It 's all good ... on day one , I was only able to fasten the medium cincher on the first set of hooks . Before I went to bed , I moved the fasteners to the second set . While this is not entirely comfortable , it is obviously quite tolerable and I think I will `` graduate '' to a small -LRB- already on order -RRB- very soon.If I have good success , I may have some mediums that are barely used to pass on .
 she liked it and I think it defined her curves an makes her appear alot slimmer . she said it is somewhat tight but also stated she gets used to it after a few minutes .
 This was one of five products I ordered at the request of my pain management physician for an L4-5 bulging disc after a series of epidural steroid injections . In addition to providing an hourglass shape it does provide excellent back support for me , helping me to maintain good posture throughout the day and providing stability . Be patient when putting on the first time as it was difficult and seemed impossible . I took this to the Dr 's office with me and he agreed it was an excellent product and in face asked me for details to recommend to his other patients . This is my # 1 pick of the five I ordered , followed by the Mueller back support at # 2 .
 I ordered my size based on the sizing provided . I am able to hook on the first set of hooks . It does provide the curves I was looking for , but I NEVER forget that I have it on . The area below the waist was flipping up the first week that I wore it as I do deskwork all day ; lately it has n't but i do n't know if that is due to additional weight loss or the fact that I was wearing clothes that did not allow it to do so ! After wearing for several hours , I do experience a little soreness where the stays are pressing against my ribs . The lines of the squeem will show under a close fitting garment if your are near the upper limits of your size ; and if someone is holding you , I believe they would be able to feel the support structure .
 I ordered this waist cincher because , although petite overall -LRB- 5 ' 4 & 107 lbs . -RRB- , I have a very `` straight '' figure with little waist definition and I have always wanted more of an hourglass shape . I also have poor posture and occasional low back pain , and I have heard that a firm compression shaper could help with both of these things.I have had this shaper for several weeks now and have been wearing it on and off . I am giving it 4 stars because , while you are wearing it , it truly does fulfill its promise of changing your shape . For the first time in my 30 + years , I have curves !! While wearing it , it makes an instant and very noticeable difference in the way I look . It also feels good on my low back because it holds me in proper alignment . For me , that is the biggest reason for wearing it and I would use it for this reason alone . I can not speak to whether it would make any permanent difference in one 's shape/weight because I am not using it for that purpose and currently only wear it a few times per week . That is also why I am not giving it 5 stars -- because I know that expectation of permanent results is there for some people with respect to this product and I personally do n't have that answer . I therefore reserve one star.Another reason I chose to write this review is to help with accurate sizing . The smallest point of my natural waist runs between 25 and 26 inches depending on `` the time of the month '' and I ordered the Extra Small -LRB- designed for natural waists 25-27 inches -RRB- . It was definitely the correct size . I can fasten the outer set of eyelets with minimal difficulty but have no desire as of yet to attempt the inner set of eyelets -LRB- which , honestly , would be daunting ;--RRB- . I understand that the idea is to eventually be able to fasten the inner set of eyelets with minimal difficulty after consistently wearing this product for awhile on a daily basis . Also , for reference , upon fastening the outer set of eyelets , my waist is reduced by exactly 1 inch . I hope this helps .
 It is actually pretty comfortable once you get it on . Smoothed my `` lumps '' and `` bumps '' out nicely . The only bad thing about it is that it has a very strong rubber smell to it . I have n't had it long enough to see if the smell eventually goes away or not . It does n't roll down or pinch . It does n't make it hard to breathe or sit down . Once it warms up , it is pretty flexable but still keeps you sucked in . I think it was worth the price . I am between a xl and 2xl . I ordered a 2xl but I think the xl would have been a bit better so I reccomend the smaller size if you are inbetween sizes . I has two rows of hooks to pick from . And for the ladies , it does n't squeeze you so much that you have the muffin spill over on the top of your body around your back and underarms when you have it on .
 I am pleased with this item . It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso , but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well . It is rubbery , so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires .
 This product is fantastic , got alot of compliments on how much skinnier I looked and it is also comfortable , can wear it for hours . It took me about a day -LRB- actually a few hrs -RRB- to get comfortable wearing it
 I 'VE BEEN A FAN OF THESE GIRDLES FOR YEARS . I CAME ACROSS ONE LIKE IT , IT WAS CALLED BRAZILIAN BODY SOMETHING AND WAS ONLY $ 24 AT A BOUTIQUE IN SMYRNA , GA. . I WAS THRILLED B/C I HAD IN THE PAST BOUGHT TONS OF GIRDLES AND THEY DID NOTHING LIKE THIS ONE , MOST LEFT PUDGE OUT THE TOP OR BOTTOM , THE BONING WOULD BULGE OUT AND FABRIC WOULD UNRAVEL AFTER A WASH OR TWO AND COST WAY MORE MONEY . THE OTHER GIRDLE I 'VE HAD SUCCESS WITH IS THE STRAPLESS BRA FROM VICTORIA 'S SECRET BUT UNFORTUNATELY I 'M A WOMAN WITH VERY LARGE BREASTS SO I COULD NOT WEAR THAT $ 80 BODY / BRA GIRDLE AFTER I GREW PAST DD 'S 10 YRS AGO . I TRIED JC PENNY 'S AND TONS OF OTHER ONES . BUT LET ME TELL YOU , THIS ONE IS COMFY FOR HOURS , IT MAKES YOU SWEAT AND YOU CAN VISIBLY SEE YOURSELF SHRINK WHEN USING IT DAILY AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE THIS AS A DAILY UNDERGARMENT . I WOULD HOWEVER PERSONALLY RECOMMEND BUYING 3 OR 4 SO YOU CAN LET THEM DRY FULLY AFTER WEAR B/C I LOVED IT SO MUCH AND HOW I LOOKED THAT I USED IT EVERYDAY AND WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE STORE I PURCHASED IT FROM , THEY WERE CLOSED DOWN !!!! SO I DID RESEARCH ONLINE AND CAME ACROSS THIS ONE WHICH IS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE I BOUGHT FROM THE BOUTIQUE . THIS GIVES YOU A FLATTERING WAIST AND TUCKS ALL THE FLAB IN ! AND YOU CAN GO OUT DANCING WITH IT B/C WHEN I 'D GO TO THE CLUB , I WOULD NOT LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT . I 'VE EVEN WORKED OUT IN IT WITH SARAN WRAP UNDERNEATH , AND THAT DOES SUPER WONDERS FOR YOUR WAIST !!! YOU WILL BE DRIPPING SWEAT BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE RESULTS YOU WILL BE ADDICTED AS I AM . I AM BUYING YET ANOTHER ONE B/C I HAVE LENT THESE OUT TO OTHERS AND THEY KEPT THEM ! EVEN IF YOU 'RE A REALLY BIG/FAT THIS WILL WORK FOR YOU , DO NOT TRY TO GO A SIZE SMALLER THINKING IT WILL HAVE A BETTER EFFECT THOUGH , CHOSE THE RIGHT SIZE , THIS IS A VERY STRONG GARMENT AND WILL NOT LET YOU BREATHE MUCH IF YOU DO THAT AND SINCE IT DOES N'T GIVE -LRB- IT IS SUPER STRETCHY , BUT IT PACKS IT ALL IN !!! -RRB- IT WILL MAKE YOUR BACK FAT STICK UP AND OUT FROM UNDER IT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF PUDGE WHICH WILL BE A DEAD GIVEAWAY . I 'VE WORN THIS WITH SUMMER DRESSES AND SINCE ITS STRICTLY FOR AROUND THE WAIST , YOU CAN WEAR IT WITH ANYTHING . BY PICKING THE RIGHT SIZE IT WILL GIVE YOU THE PERFECT SHAPE . I KNOW B/C MY SISTER IS MUCH BIGGER THAN I AM AND I LET HER USE ONE AND SHE LOOKED AWESOME IN IT BUT ALL THE TOP FAT STUCK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB . THIS WILL BE THE LAST GIRDLE YOU 'LL EVER BUY ! TOO BAD I 'M NOT GETTING PAID FROM THE COMPANY FOR THIS REVIEW ! BUT I DO N'T MIND LETTING A GREAT PRODUCT BE KNOWN ! ;-RRB- AND AT THIS PRICE FOR WHAT IT WILL DO !!! AND HOW LONG IT LASTS !!!! FORGET ABOUT IT ! YOU 'LL BE A FAN TOO !
 It actually helped me with my weight loss !!! I was actually skeptical at first but when I started wearing it , it helped tummy control . This product rocks !!
 The squeem is verry comfortable and offers great support ! This product runs true to size and I love the adjustable clasps .
 Some companies charge an arm and a leg for a good corset , this is affordable and worth it . Helps with posture .
 it fits well and durable i wear it everyday , i will recomend this 100 % . especially after having a baby this is the best way to go . .
 Since I got it , I have been wearing it for at leat 10 hours a day . It is confrotable , and it make me look great.My stomack is flatter , my waist is smaller and when I take it off , I fell that I am smaller . Love this product . Will buy another one soon
 this product does exactly what it says it does ! the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on . the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier !! Do n't give up it is worth it !
 I enjoyed this waist cincher ! it corrects my posture , and makes me look slimmer!However , I think it stretched out a bit ... Or I lost some inches !
 So , first I would just love to say that I was so impressed at how fast I got my item . Literally two days after I placed my order . It was so nice . So I have used the item four different times since receiving it . It works miracles for real . So it is a must have for any woman 's wardrobe . Thank you so much .
 I purchased the Squeem Magical Lingerie , not sure what to expect . I love it . It really makes you look slimer and compliments me very well . I totally recommend this product .
 It works wonderfully but I think I am going to order another one in a size Medium because this small is suffocating me !!!
 provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it -LRB- I ordered a size small -RRB- . The size chart is very accurate , it fits like a glove .
 Uncomfortable for a whole day wearing , but really can looks better !! Anyway , I think it worth to own it cuz good shape is more important to me :-RRB- -RRB-
 I heard about this corset from many mothers and decided to give it a try . I am already seing results in my belly , shrank a bit and i only wore it 3-4 times . Looking forward to more results .
 I am 5 ' 6 '' , but I have a long torso . That resulted in a 2 '' section of skin/fat that was squeezed out of the bottom of this thing . I ordered their vest to see if it would be a better fit for me . 4-stars though , because it did actually work , and appeared to have sturdy construction . It was a bit constricting at first , and it definitely felt good to take it off at the end of the night and breathe deeply -- but it helped me look much better in a tight-fitting cocktail dress than I looked alone or with spanx !
 I should have gotten a size up , but I went with the large . The product is a little tight right now , but I can see that it will shrink my belly pretty soon and I will have to go down a size ! I got it to help with my muffin top or curtain belly , I sure hope it takes care of it . I enjoy the extra clasps so that I can wear it for awhile longer before having to go down a size . I also enjoyed the price was reasonable .
 works well . arrived on time . I have been using it to train for bikini fitness show and it does help a bit .
 I do believe this product is very good but , in my case , the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything . I am already petite , so the cincher does n't significantly reduce my waistline . It does , however , make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like . You can not really wear it under thin clothing , as others have pointed out , and , for me , it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product . It is a very good and very cool cincher . I think it can even be worn on top of clothing , for a goth or fetish look . It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you .
 I 've been using this product for the past 7 days for approx . 7 hours/day -LRB- during work -RRB- along with a firming gel for abs . When I first tried to put it on , it was quite to button up so I thought it would be uncomfortably tight . But I was wrong ! I forget I am wearing it and it does give me a nice smaller waist and also it helps on my posture .
 I bought this item for my wedding dress ! I wanted to make sure that I `` tried out '' the cincher before my big day and it works really well ! I started out with this same item , in a Small - but it gave me `` back fat '' which I do not normally have ... I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm . When wearing the cincher you have two `` size options '' with the double hook closure . . which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your `` natural '' waist to create a better shape . It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material -LRB- def makes you sweaty ... but it DOESNT move around -RRB- Totally worth it!Kinda painful ... the boning pushes into my `` under/side boob '' probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs ... -LRB- size 36 DD -RRB- Ladies , if it helps . . I am 5 ' 2 135lbs busty , not super skinny but not fat -LRB- size 27 in jeans -RRB-
 I like the product . Helps trim me down a little under the clothing . The rubber makes you sweat . After a couple days of wearing it , I really do feel trimmer in the middle . The immediate compression is n't as much as my steel boned corsets , but is pretty decent for shapewear . I 'd say an inch plus a little more in the areas that need extra smoothing.However , I do n't recommend it for all day -LRB- 10 hour -RRB- wear . I 'm so itchy by the time I get home . It is cotten on the inside , but it still itches by the end of the day.In terms of fit , I am a 20 , usually . Sometimes an 18 . I bought a 3XL . It fits fine . I am short and it does indeed go from hip to just under the bust .
 Wow that stuff works!I have been looking for one of this and I came here and got convinced by the reviews , that are actually true , it does works , but I think that you need to choose the right size for you.It gives you that nice thin waist so you can party slim the whole night even after that huge dinner!I would recoment ! I would buy another one , but I dont think that I will because this material is of great quality !! Perfect buy !
 I bought the small size . Wish it was longer . I have a short torso and this thing still is n't long enough for me . Either you have a bulge on top or at the bottom depending on where you position it . It 's made fairly well . The clasp on the larger size are coming out of the stitching . Gets uncomfortable if sitting for a long period of time .
 Love this . I had been looking in I do n't know how long for this kind of product . I 've had 2 babies so far and have n't found a product like this . I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette , but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up . I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts , but I 've had it for a week already -LRB- I ordered all 3 , black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps -RRB- and I 've already got used to wearing it everyday , it 's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look . I love it , now I 'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist . I 've read that it can last up to over a year , so deffinitly worth the money . Would recommend this to everyone .
 Squeem will definitely make you fit better into outfits , but beware that you will be quite uncomfortable especially when you sit down .
 I 've been wearing these little babies for years and let me tell you , it is truly amazing at how instantaneous and beautiful they `` smooth things '' out . I am 53 and thick in figure but these babies make me see that `` I 've still got it ! '' -LRB- smile -RRB- Well worth the money . Another good thing is that it has a rubber side that cause to minutely sweat and lose inches off of your waist too . As you lose , you can even sleep in the old one and buy a smaller one . WELL WORTH THE MONEY !!
 I wore this under my dress for my son 's wedding and it worked out pretty well . It 's firmer than shapewear which I liked . It 's not perfect but since I can sew I plan to take in the seams to fit my shape . It 's a typical corset garment with 2 sets of hooks all the way down across the front that adjust to your body type . The main problem I had was there was n't a size chart when I ordered it so I had to return the first one and order another one .
 I got this item within a few days of my purchase . It is exactly what I wanted -- I look a whole size smaller , instantly . I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love , but they were asking almost $ 200 for it ! I highly recommend this item and the seller .
 Bought this after the birth of my daughter , to hold in all the extra stomach weight and provide support from the c-section . It works well but after 3 to 4 hours , it will start to crease if you have been sitting . There is a little bit of a rubber smell but nothing that is noticeable to others . It really does work .
 I love this product and I would tell anybody to get it . It works wonders . Its a little hard to get on the first time but it dose exactly what it said it would do .
 Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture . It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down . I 've been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone . Of course , you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money .
 This works to reduce belly fat and it gives me great posture , i feel supported when i wear it . It gives me an hourglass shape & i will be purchasing the next smaller size soon . the boning can irritate your skin at certain spots but i use raw shea butter before wearing it , wear a thin tank top under & i recently removed the boning from the back .
 Very firm and sturdy . Still very tight after wearing for several months . I have yet to use the second row of hooks which are even tighter . Totally camouflages my belly and gives me the appearance of having flat abs . I would highly recommend to anyone!Although one of the bones came out the first week I got it , I just sewed it back on to the fabric portion , and it still works like a charm .
 Love it ! Have n't lost any weight or inches but I look good wearing it !
 I love the squeem waist cincher , at first it took a while to get it on . After a while it molds to your body . This is a great product if you are looking to slenderize your waist line . The problem I have is that I ca n't wear clingy or tight fitting tops because the clamps are visible to the eye . After a while it starts to hurt . It 's a great product , but you have to get use to it .
 quick shipping & a great product . Very comfortable , and , while not advertised as such , makes a great goth/steampunk fashion piece .
 I got both waist cincher and vest because of the comments below . Although I agree that it gives an excellent control when both are worn but practically I do n't think it 's easy to wear a vest . Rather , I find the waist cincher is easier to wear and I use it everyday.Pros : - gives a good control and tightness and makes a waist line - helps control your appetite and dietHowever few things ... - The color `` nude '' is not quite nude . It 's pinkish bright nude . I wished it is beige nude though . but that 's fine . - Th studs in the cincher are shorter . I am not sure if it was designed like that for comfortness . - my skin got irritated at the first few days . It 's been two or three weeks and now I feel much better but still itchy after taking it off at the end of the day . It could be because of my skin type . Although slight itchy it does n't bother me much.Overall I am very satisfied and using it everyday . I was in fact struggling my appetite & diet control but with this I was able to reduce the amount of food and lost 2 lbs . Thanks to Squeem .
 I am a size 6/8 woman , medium frame . I have the characteristic ` mommy-tummy ' syndrome . I purchased this product mainly for extra shaping under special occasion dresses . It does a nice job of flattening out my tummy and tucking in my waist a bit . It is n't uncomfortable and i 've worn it to parties and nights out , even to full workdays under some dresses . You are aware of having it on , though , and it 's nice to take it off at the end of the day . If you are doing something active , like fast dancing , it hinders your breathing a little bit.My biggest drawback is that the material tends to develop wrinkles at the points where my waist bends . The reinforcement rods in the seams actually have wrinkled . This has become permanent , even after I take the garment off . It still works fine , but the ridges will show through thin or clingy fabrics.I ca n't take seriously the idea of wearing it all day , every day and seeing your waist shrink permanently . It does a fantastic job of giving you a little extra shaping while you have it on , though .
 I got the XL the first time and felt I could take the pain of a size smaller . So I gave the XL to my mom and bought the L. Now , the sizing is very accurate -- I am 5 ' 7 , 180lb , so I should be in the XL . But if you really do n't mind squeezing -LRB- which I did n't -RRB- I got into the Large and I looked fantastic . However , be aware that being 10 lbs over the weight is OK to buy the size smaller ; but if you are 20lbs over , it will not work !! Also , the squeem does not work under tight tops because you can see the front clips ; however , layered like a tight top with a cami/slip under it -- could work it that way . But it truly cinches those inches so it makes you look fit and curvy !!
 I first purchased this product back in 2008 but never did write a review for it . Not that it was a bad product , it 's just that I forgot I purchased it because it worked so well I had gotten down to the third set of hooks within about three weeks -LRB- this is without watching my diet of Mc ` Donalds , burger King Popeye 's Ect . I ate the same fast food junk as usual -RRB- I ended up tossing it in my dresser and not ever thinking about it again until I came across it last night . I was a size 14 and barely got into that when I first purchased this . After the three weeks all my size 14 pants around the tummy area falls off of me . I have to steal my boyfriend 's belt to keep my pants up . Now a size 12 fits me snug like the 14 use to but 14 wont stay up on my waist anymore . I have to downsize and buy a new one in a L in stead of XL and work my way across the hooks again . I wore this from the time I got up for work which was 5am til I got home at 5pm . If you wear this everyday and you are active at work or throughout your day like me -LRB- I work in a hospital so I do more running around and less sitting at my desk -RRB- you will see the results after a while.Since I did stop using this I have downsized my eating portions because I dont want to go back up a size , I go to the gym 3 times a wk to maintain the size I am . Because the material has a lot of rubber on the insides it may cause you to sweat a whole lot -LRB- I would come home soaked -RRB- so I suggest you run it through the washer every 2-3 days as sweat will irritate your skin and eventually cause you to rash up like nobodys business -LRB- seen my friend who bought the same item not wash hers for two wks and she broke out in clusters of rashes that only went away after agrresive treatment of Lamisil cream twice a day ! So yea basically not washing your sweaty corset will give you fungus after a while so wash it often ! -RRB- Other than that mine got a little worn , it started to fold and bend and roll up once it started to get too big . BUT keep in mind Im very active at work . I lift , bend , strech , run patient charts around the building for delivery to various departments , then at home and I often forgotten I had it on and end up cleaning up the house in it . It was used vigorusly so for the price it is worth it because it didnt start to bunch and roll until it started getting slack . So if you are not as active as I am then yours will last longer . Plus I kept this thing on way beyond the reccomended time of 4 hours so I dont expect it to last very long after extensive use.I love this product , and as for the shipping it took 5 days to come but I am not complaining because I saw the great reviews and knew that no matter what this was what I wanted . When I first got it I ordered a L and it was too small . I was able to exchange free of charge and got the right size in 3 days so returns are fast and hassle free . This is a great product overall , less risky than ordering that exspensive body magic shaper & then you have to guess what side is right & even if you guessed wrong you can not change or get a refund . Do you really have $ 65 - $ 150 to throw away like that ? I suggest you get this one cause at least if it is the wrong size amazon will switch it with no questions FOR FREE at that !! I hope I helped everyone make a choice .
 I had tried it all !!! This little thing wins hands down . I was convinced after watching a GIANT girl on YouTube wear this . She taped herself with it on at first and you think `` Oh , I can tell she 's chunky , but look at what it does for her waist . Very nice . '' But then she proceeds to unhook the Squeem and reveal what was underneath . OH . MY . GOD . She had stuffed more fat and rolls in there than you can imagine !! I was sold !! I am telling you , this is a woman 's best friend . No one can tell I am wearing it . It flattens my belly , and even after taking it off my waist stays smaller for a while , so I can tell it is training my muscles to come back together after two pregnancies and c-sections . I am often asked if I am pregnant -LRB- I am not -RRB- and I desperately needed something to wear for any fitted clothing of mine . My stomach stretched out really bad with my pregnancies and the muscles in my abdomen ripped apart , so now I look four or five months pregnant with this little tiny ball of a section of my stomach hanging out and loose . It 's awful but I do n't have five grand to fix it . But for forty bucks Squeem did !! I bought two of these in two different sizes . At first I wore the extra large on the first hook , then the second hook . After I lost 15 pounds or so I could wear the large . I love the difference!I can wear it for about six to eight hours . I feel supported and tight . It does n't roll up or down in the back like so many . It stays put -LRB- the inside is soft to the touch , the outside is rubbery and does n't allow for your clothes to shift around -RRB- . It covers a large area , from breast to hip , and certainly does make your breasts perky !! If you are doubting this thing at all - DO N'T !! It 's the answer to your tummy troubles - or at least it was for me .
 I love this item ... I wear it all the time and when I take it off the shape seems to stay for a while ! I go running in it and I burn more calories because it enduces sweat ! I 've had this item for some time and I 've pretty much wore it out so I 'm ordering another one now ! I just have to warn all do n't go too small ! You want to be able to clasp it on the 1st hooks so it does n't show up as well under clothers . also the compression can be uncomfortable at first but when it 's broken in a bit you 'll be super satisfied with your hourglass figure trust me I 've been square forever and now that I have curves I could n't be happier !!!
 I have one of those `` spare tire '' waists , but when I put this on , I had an hourglass shape ... I 've never had results like this with any other shapewear ... But it does come with some side effects ... Wore it to work for 8 hours , took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color -LRB- i 'm black -RRB- and had lines -LRB- which turned to bruises -RRB- on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting ... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline , so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable . That experience did , however , give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I do n't have to depend on anything to `` make '' me look trimmer ...
 Let me start by saying this thing is amazing ! I have used all sorts of shapewear to hide my `` love handles '' Spanx , Miracle Suit , Body Magic and even the ones that Walmart sells . I wasnt to sure about trying this but after all the great reviews I was like what the heck I 'll give it a try . I 'm so happy I did , it works like no other ! I have huge boobs -LRB- G cup -RRB- and I 'm about a size 12/14 at the bottom but my mid section is like a darn mushroom so I 'm always looking for something to hold it all in ... I purchased the Squeem and I 'm so so happy that I did ! I look great in my sun dresses and my fitted tops b/c of Squeem , it works great !!! Give it a try ladies ; trust me it 's worth every penny ! NO Bulge at all ! I 'm Feeling So Sexy Right Now ... LOL
 Ok , so it 's a little hard to put on . But once it 's on , it is very comfortable . I could easily sleep with this thing on . And , unlike other shapewear I 've tried that just smoothes things out , my waist is actually smaller when I wear this . I measured my waist before and after putting this on , and the difference was nearly 2 inches ! I absolutely LOVE it!I do n't really believe all the weight loss enhancement stuff -LRB- although I am working on weight loss -RRB- , but it does make me look better at the weight I am . It makes my plus size figure look like a large hourglass instead of the usual apple shaped figure . Another reason why I LOVE it!This is an essential for any woman who is self conscious about her belly .
 Typically I wear a medium adult women 's sized shirt and a large in juniors - and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :-RRB- . This really works , well too - sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want/need . The one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle -LRB- if you have some curve to you -RRB- and I 'm not sure how to get it stretched out again.However , overall - if it did n't bunch up - I would give it 5 stars : -RRB-
 I bought the squeem in black , size large . This is the first day I 'm wearing it and as soon as I put it on I could see that it was truly accentuating my natural waist . It was very tight while trying to fasten the hooks , so make sure to order your correct size and do n't go too small . It claims to hold up breasts which I find untrue . My least favorite thing about the squeem is that the seams are visible under clothing unless one wears somewhat baggy clothing . I do like the length . Many similar products do not cover the complete area from under breasts to the lowest pouch of the stomach but this one most definitely does . I would fore warn anyone with a very short torso who is of short stature because I would imagine the squeem so long that it may dig into your thighs while seated . For those reviews complaining about the rolling , I see what they mean when I slouch but as long as you sit and stand up straight it shouldnt be a problem and it is forcing me to improove my posture.UPDATE : I 've warn the squeem about 8 times now and on the 4th time I was able to comfortably fasten it on the tighter hooks . A new slight downside is that I 've noticed that my bra bulge kind of `` muffin tops '' on top of the squeem and thier is no real solution . Also it can be a bit uncomfortable after awhile so i make it a point to not wear it for more than 6 hours straight .
 I am 116 lbs . but after 4 kids -LRB- a set of twins -RRB- the tummy was not the same . squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes ... never look better . the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat . . after its off all the bulge comes out . It makes you look great thou ... do n't leave home without it .
 I 'm a first time mother , my baby was about 7 months old , when I discovered Squeem , I thought it was too late in the game to shrink my post-baby belly . But after wearing the Squeem religiously for 3 full weeks , I lost half an inch around my natural waist . And after 2 months , a total loss of an inch and half ! My belly no longer protrudes and I feel 10x better about my body :-RRB- THANK YOU SQUEEM !!!!!
 I am absolutely satisfied with the result this cincher does . Not only it hides my post pregnant belly , but supports back and reduces pain . The only reason I was hesitating with the purchase was unavailable sizing chart . I am now 31 '' at waist and M fits perfectly . Would recommend this item to everyone .
 Made my waist look waaaay smaller!Have used this several times and it makes me look so much skinnier.Highly recommend this !
 I had to exchange the size but the small is still _ really small _ . It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium . I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss . It 's tedious to put on and I 'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked ! There has to be an easier way ! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while . I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind . The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little . Should you buy it ? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs , then go for it . It was inexpensive .
 i liked this product so much i am going to buy one for my mom and another one in black for me
 It 's an awesome shaper . Not showing anything line on top of the garment . I will wear it for any occasion . Highly recommended .
 This is very well made , it came on time and does exactly what it is made to do , I give it 5 stars .
 I 've tried all of them . Comfortable and works ! Had twins via c-section then a singleton , and this is the only binder that has helped minimize my two-three finger diastasis . I ear it every day for 8-10 hours . At 127 lbs and 5 ' 4 &#34; , I got the small and was glad I did n't size up . Got to the inner row of clips pretty quickly . My first one was defective-one of the plastic &#34; bones &#34; was broken , but it was replaced no questions asked and I 'm comfy and loving it .
 I 'm fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me , with no problem . I love that you ca n't see it under clothes . I notice my back feel better with it on , my posture improves , and I look good in my clothes . I love this !
 Does the job and I feel the tightness . Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me . I would recommed others to buy it .
 This product is great for packing it all in . The best part is it corrects my posture and I have not had any lower back ache since wearing the product . At first it is a stretch to fit in and keep it on . But with more use it takes the shape of your body and fits a lot more snug so be patient . I have noticed a flatter stomach even when it 's off , this could be because my posture is better from using this shapewear .
 This waist cincher is pretty good . It 's really hard to get latched , but once it 's on , it 's pretty comfortable . I did n't have any problems with it riding up , or folding over .
 This is a very good cincher . I think it does what it claims to do - cinches the waist by micro-massaging . My waist did become smaller which was what I was skeptical about . I always thought -LRB- actually still do -RRB- that it is up to one 's diet . I do n't know . I guess wearing this / massaging your midriff , deposits some work outs or makes you more active , heh . I wear it every day . Even when I do n't get out of the house .
 I bought it to wear under a dress but had no need too . It fits good and makes you curves that you never knew you had ...
 All and all this is a very nice product . It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing . It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours . The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture , although not totally , away from your skin . Now mind you it is pure rubber , yes I said rubber , so make sure you wash it thoroughly , also it will take two days to air dry.I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon ... much cheaper than a boutique.Cher !
 I recieved my Squeem waist cincher very fast . This is the best product and exactly what I have been looking for . You will have to truely `` suck in '' as you hook the eyes . It fits true to size . But the amazing look of a hour glass shape in my size is pretty amazing . I love it and I wear it to help my body mold itself to the shape and size I should be ; I work out 4 times a week and I completely change the way I eat . NOT a diet but a life change . I have a ways to go but since I purchased my Squeem black cincher , I have seen results to date ; I started out at 287lbs and currently now down to 279.2 lbs . I also purchased the 100 % rubber one -LRB- thats the one I work out in -RRB- , this one , the black cincher I wear to work and to events.Thanks again , Squeem and Amazon for helping me help myself with your product and quick delivery service .
 I ordered this Squeem product on March 2,2010 and received it on March 6,2010 . I needed it for a formal black and white affair . I wore it under a sequined/embellished jumpsuit and it did the trick . I looked at least ten lbs lighter . It was also shockingly comfortable . I have recently had a baby so I needed something to firmly hold my middle in and this did what I anticipated it to do . Great product . I will most likely use it again for a little assistance under garments that require a firmer midriff . It did not roll down or poke me as most undergarments of this kind often do . I am very pleased with my purchase . Also the seller 's transaction was very swift and I would do business with this company again .
 This was a wonderful investment . I need to purchase another one . It 's great and really compliments your clothing .
 Awesome shapewear product . I bought this because of severe low back/hip pain . I was tired of wearing the big bulky brace my doctor ordered and wanted something to go under my clothes that might help . It did help , alot . Another suprise was my waist went down 2 '' just putting it on . If you have trouble getting it on it helps to spread shaper out on bed and lie down with it centered . Start fastening from the bottom . I also have acid reflux and this product did not make that worse like some control top hosiery or other shapers do . This seemed cool and did not feel too hot , since I am very warm natured that was a concern for me .
 This item is the ultimate in comfort it is the cure for poor posture and lower back pain and unsightly love handles I recently recieved my 2nd garment form SupriseHim the service rep. that handled my exchange was very helpful and the utmost professional in handling my situation quickly thanks so much you know who you are Anne C. Chgo . Il
 I was very skeptical about this . When I do wear it , it does work . It takes some getting used to .
 i used this product after i had my baby to get my body back . . it worked great !
 After 3 c sections , I need all the help I can get . I started with the size Large -LRB- when I was a size 12 -RRB- . I have moved on to the medium -LRB- I am between 8-10 now -RRB- . The medium is REALLY tight , but does the job . I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after , and it is a bit more comfortable for that . These things are really great . I ca n't believe I did n't know about them after my first 2 c sections . They should send all women home with them after giving birth !
 can anyone PLEASE tell me where to find a sizing chart for this item ? I can not choose between s , xs or petite ...
 I would recommend this product to anyone looking to cinch there waist and get rid of the bulge in the waist and tummy . It instantly slims your mid section and gives your breasts a lift . I have gotten so many compliments .
 I started using this product 2 weeks postpartum to help with healing and because I heard a rumor that it helped flatten your tummy with continued use after having a baby . Anyway , I started with a medium and moved to a small at 5 weeks postartum . Currently I am almost 7 weeks postpartum and am moving towards having to wear the petite size . My stomach is completely flat and all my friends , neighbors , strangers ca n't believe I was ever pregnant . Other than the healing and flattening , while wearing the product , it creates a very sexy hour-glass silhouette.The only downside is that it starts to bunch up from sitting down , and you ca n't get the wrinkles out . I 've tried stretching the boning out . It helps a little , but there are still wrinkles . Because of these wrinkles , you ca n't wear too tight of shirts , everything has to be a little loose-fitting . However , the pluses outweight the negatives , so I 'm still going to give it 5 stars.All-in-all , this is a great product , and I would recommend it to anyone .
 I am a size 16/2x in clothing , with most of my weight around my mid section . I was worried the 2x would not fit because I have what appears to be a pregnant looking stomach . My stomach sticks out much further in comparison to my chest , hips , and legs.The first time putting this on , I was REALLY worried . I held it up and thought to myself , `` There is no way this is going to fit . '' The first time was a struggle , but to my surprise , this thing is VERY elastic and stretchy and holds you in . Unlike almost every other waist cincher I have tried , this has no rough boning that wears out or falls apart over time . I can sit comfortably in this , all day , even after running around all day after two jobs , school , and public transportation . Every other cincher I have tried was way too stiff . Based on my appearance and posture alone gave away that I was wearing something underneath . Not with this one . I also do n't feel like I am going to pass out after an hour from it being too stiff.Lots of reviews said this is very noticeable underneath clothes , but I have to disagree . Unless you are wearing very delicate , extremely tight clothing , you will not see it.I have been wearing this everyday for about two weeks and I am already noticing my waist getting a nice shape . This by no means will make you shed pounds of weight . It will , however , take the curves -LRB- or lack of -RRB- that you have even shapelier.Definitely recommend this . My holy grail waist cincher .
 I purchased the squeem a few weeks ago . I had a baby last year , and have been really struggling with trying to get my `` figure '' back . I 'd gained weight that wasnt really going anywhere . But the midsection was the absolute worst ; I have flabby skin that sort of hangs . Its not terrible looking but definitley makes my midsection less attractive than I 'd like it to be . I bought three other corsets/shapewear products over the last year , and one was very good but majorly uncomfortable , and it was the full suited item that made restroom visits painful and frustrating . That garment also made my boobs like like a porn star . That garment wasnt something I could wear to work . I needed something to wear to work so that I could look shapely and less `` post pregnant '' looking.Its been only a week since I 've been wearing the squeem , so I will preface my review by saying that ; I can not speak long term since it just hasnt been that much time . As everyone else says , it can be uncomfortable at first , and it can be uncomfortable during the day if its not positioned well or moves aorund or something . It definitely takes some getting used to , but if you 've worn different compression garments before it shouldnt take too long for you to adjust . I bought a size medium , black Squeem . Not sure that was the best size for me . I 'm 53 , 169 . The medium fits BUT I have to FIGHT to get it on the last set of hooks , but it does go on . That was day 1 and 2 . A very big fight to get the hooks to close . Boy was I angry . By day 3 , I realized it was less of a fight to get it on the last set of hooks . I 'm in the gym 3-4 days a week , doing cardio , trying my best to eat wisely . But truly , this Squeem seems to be making a big difference in the waist/midsection area . I used to have a fabulous hour glass shape 5-6 years ago . With the squeem , it sort of seems like my hour glass shape is slowly transforming . I 'm serious . I put this thing on daily at 5 am after my shower , and I remove it around 6 pm when I get home with the children . When I look at myself in the mirror at night , its like shocking . I see my waist sinking in on the sides and the flabby skin is looking tighter , like its flattening a bit . Its a nice feeling . Someone else commented about that on here , and I have to agree with her 100 % . If you are able to wear this thing all day 8 hours plus , 5 or more days a week , I truly think you will see a difference very quickly . Measuring inches is probably the best way to keep up with progress . When I first bought it , I had a 35 inch waist . I plan to measure my waist this weekend to see where I am.Again , it is a bit uncomfortable at times , and perhaps for me that is because I might have been better off with a Large . But I really still feel good about the size medium . Its giving me the extra cinching I want . One thing i notice is that when I make my restroom visits , I find myself repositioning it a bit so that is fitting and laying more comfortably on my torso . Since I have big boobs , I wear a sports bra with the Squeem.I really am pleased with this product . It doesnt cause bathroom issues , no snapping and unsnapping at the crotch area , etc. . Just gives you a nice curvy look , and I can truly see it happening slowly . I hope to see more progress as the months go by.I would have given this 5 stars if I 'd worn this longer and was able to provide a more accurate review based on long term use . Truly , I have no complaints . My size 10 pants and skirts feel either slightly loose now or even more comfortable then before.I highly recommend this product . Its a great price and worth the money for the results .
 I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery . I immediately put it on . It does take some muscle power . . but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on . It sucks , tucks and hold !!!!! My S/O was giving me the side eye . . he didnt get my excitement , this was just another one of my many purchases . BUT !!! But ladies and gentlemen *** for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love ** when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed `` WOW !! it does take off a few inches of the waist '' ... I love it . I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems . Well it does force you to sit upright . Which is great ! . . small waist and fabulous posture ... I ca n't complain . I am loving my squeem !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins . I had gone down to my pre-pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm . Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre-pregnancy size after wearing it 8 times .
 My daughter 's personal trainer told her about the Squeem . So I tried it . I 'm 58 and was skeptical.Wow ! Did it ever deliver ! After two Weeks of wearing it 10 hours a day I 've lost 1 inch . Now I 've been wearing it for 6 Weeks and have lost 2 inches . Best of all I 've lost 6 pounds because the Squeem does n't allow you to eat a lot . My daughter has a flat belly now and curves . I have n't exercised or dieted ! Ladies go for it this product is truly amazing .
 I gained 35 pounds with my second pregnancy -LRB- normally 120 lbs . & 5 ' 4 '' -RRB- . Post-partum day # 1 , I used a hospital velcro binder , but that was quite uncomfortable & required a 2nd person for it to be properly placed . I purchased & wore a size large Squeem 3 days after going home . It was pretty easy to put on after I sucked in a bit and it worked quickly to flatten out the bulge . Two weeks after having the baby , I purchased a medium . My goal is to be able to wear a size small in a month or two . I will most likely keep wearing the small even after I regain my pre-pregnancy body . The Squeem is a bit hot/sweaty , but I , like other reviewers have said , wear a light tank top underneath . After the initial few moments , I hardly know I 'm wearing it . I have also been taking daily naps with the Squeem on so it 's comfortable . It also helps keep my back straight throughout the day . I would highly recommend this product !
 I used this product 19 years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape . I had a slimmer waist within weeks . You tend to sweat and lose inches having this on . It is a bit uncomfortable at first and it takes getting used to , but I would wear it only while working out . Otherwise , I would take it off .19 years later , after having my second child , I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it . I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being pregnant with my workouts . It is well made and sturdy . The metal hooks never pinch nor they unhook while doing exercising . I recommend this product .
 I just recently had a baby and have searched hi and low for a great cincher . It is so difficult to search and compare things like this online . So let me tell you that this cincher is the truth ...
 I have wasted hundreds of dollars on similiar products , But this is by far one of the best purchases I have ever made ... I actually had purchased a cotton waist training corset -LRB- $ 100 on Amazon -RRB- and It firmed my waist exactly how I wanted , but it is very difficult to breath in and not that comfortable . I wear the corset when I 'm at home , or when I need to dress up and need that extra firmness ... I wanted to buy a waist shapewear that firmed the waist just as a corset does , but is flexible and comfortable . So , I recenly purchased the Squeem . I am very happy that I odered the Squeem magical lingerie shapewear and I am very satisfied . This shapewear does exctly what I wanted !!! I needed something that would hold my waist in and was comfortable enough to sit at a desk for long periods of time . I can also breath while wearing this item ... I also wanted a product that I was able to wear under my clothes , and was n't visible . The Squeem tucked in my waist , helped with my posture without any bluches coming out from the top or the bottom ... and it is not noticeable under my clothes , which I love !!! It looks great with anything I wear and makes me look shapely -LRB- hourglass -RRB- skinny and SEXY !!!! my waist is a 29 and I ordered a medium ... It fits perfectly ... Now , my waist is a few inches smaller !!!!! Will highly reccommend ...
 I 've tried all sorts of lingerie to hold my gut in . This is the first one that works . It has held up to many wears . Usually a shapewear like this will give in seams . It 's nice to have a waist again .
 I 'm training my waist to lose inches . I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to . I wear them most of the day and throughout the night . This one is more comfortable -LRB- as something squeezing u can be -RRB- and looks good under certain clothes . I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat . It speeds up the weight loss process . I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank ! I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it . All in all it 's a great product and the most comfortable cincher I 've ever bought .
 I agonized for over a week over postpartum girdles . The ones marketed specifically for new mothers seemed overpriced and gimmicky and the serious medical grade girdles were so expensive . After reading the rave reviews on the Squeem , I ordered one and am wearing it right now . Wow ! It 's got all the attributes of a `` real '' girdle -LRB- heavy duty construction , really holds you in -RRB- but without the hefty price tag . And it 's comfortable , too ! Whether it helps with longterm body contouring is almost besides the point as I feel so much better about myself right now -LRB- I can fit into one of my old skirts ! Jeans , here I come ! -RRB- . A word about sizing
 I 'm a 100 % satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear . It delivers what it promises , everything that describes the product it 's true . It reduces about 2 inches instantly , it hardly shows with thin clothes , it does n't let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day , It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it , the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks , it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows , and it 's the perfect length for my core.I 'm 5 ' 3 , I tried another brand before but it was too long for me , I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down . I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand.Once I get used to this one , I 'm planning to order the &#34; Extra firm compression &#34; . It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more !
 I am now on my second Squeem -LRB- M -RRB- . I bought the Squeem Vest -LRB- L -RRB- first and as I used it I did start to notice very small changes in my mushroom top -LRB- now a muffin top -RRB- . I have had my tummy problem for years after having very large babies and never could get it down , no matter how much I exercised it still was there . Since I 've been using the squeem I 've noticed that it has decreased in size and does n't hang like it use too . So I decided to buy the perfect waist to wear with sleeveless tops . What I noticed about squeem is that if you wear a tank against your skin under the cincher it rolls up from the bottom . I was very discouraged at first but refused to give up . I realized that if I wore it against my skin it would not roll up and would stay in place . Since I 've been doing that I 've noticed that my muffin top is slowly lifting and for the first time in over 20 + years I can actually see wear my incision is without having to lift up my tummy . If you only knew how exciting that is for me . Along with diet and exercise it is really making a change in my waistline and I have yet to sleep in it all night . I plan to continue with the Squeem for the whole year wearing it on a daily basis . I see some complain of the rubber smell , that will go away . While every cincher will not work for every woman , I believe if you get the right size and be patient you will enjoy the Squeem . I ca n't wait to purchase the fashion Squeem in pink .
 This product really does give you the perfect waist , very happy with it . . I even got one for my mom .
 Look a couple inches over ur belly button . Do you have a ` slouch line ' ? If no , then this is for u. Nice expensive material feel . Does wat it was made to do . It just did n't work out for me cuz I slouch all the time and it hurts where my belly fat curls . It 's for those straight sitting people
 Took off a few inches of my waist and kept it there ! A bit tough to get used to so I recommend using a tank top under the squeem .
 I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loved it . She started seeing changed within the first week . She actually wanted me to purchase a second one for her .
 I liked it so much that I bought it twice . Started off with a medium ended up with a small . Also nice for better posture and look nice in clothes .
 There 's is nothing I dislike about the squeem . It it true to size , I ordered the XL because I wear a size 15 . It smooths everything out , holds everything in and lifts my boobs . I love it so much I convinced two of my friends to purchase it !
 If you are over weight and your main concern is belly fat , the squeem will give you an hour glass figure , no lie . I cant live without it . It does bunch up in the back but the front stays intact . That 's only a minor issue . Nothing works like a squeem .
 This is a nice waist cincher . It can also be worn when doing workouts . It gives support an the rubbery material on the one side keeps heat in which can help you loose that middle bulge.It will help maintain that hourglass figure we all want .
 I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores
 This lil baby right here changed my figure into the shape I will never have naturally . I have been an avid exerciser since I was 17 , aerobics , weights , plyometrics , and Im in excellent shape -LRB- now 43 -RRB- , but no matter what , my figure was never ever ever going to be the proportions that I wanted . I am a 35-27 .5 -34 . Dont get me wrong , I feel fortunate , bla bla bla , but dammit , I wanted the hourglass figure that comes naturally to so many . This garment is so STRONG , so resilient , it literally carves your wiastline into a waspy shape . And the superior material is like a second skin , so no bulging through clothes . Mind you , a thin cotton or knit , especially in a light or white color will show through , but most moderately substantial fabrics will completely hide this garment . It takes a nice figure to a head-turning figure as soon as you hook the clasps . You . Will . Love . It !!!
 Just as I imagined it to be Keeps things firm and pulled in . I can only wear it a couple of hours at a time but it does the job .
 This product feels very nice and comfortable on . I first ordered a small because I fell between tbe sm and med . I ended up sending the sm . back and got the med . It feels great and on the back of the package it suggested the next size up if you are between two sizes . This product is very well made and I am very satisfied .
 Desperate , after spending tons of money on department store fajas that gave me a weird noticable panty line , smooshed breasts , and dents in my shoulders due to my long torso , I truned to the internet . I google searched `` Best Body Shaper '' and Squeem came up . I spent the money , hoping all the hype was true and that these reviews are real . I have to say ... I am utterly amazed . My upper is NOTICEABLY smaller , giving me a nice hourglass figure . Usually , I have a bulging belly and my upper is LARGER than my lower.Plese believe that this is worth every penny . It 's been almost a month and it 's just about time for a smaller size . It does reduce the waistline.Pic attached .
 This shape-wear is definitely magical . I purchased it 4 weeks after my 2nd child was born . within a couple of days , I could get back into my pre-pregnant clothes . A month later my stomach looks just like it did before I got pregnant again . I have n't lost much weight , but that will come with time . The first time putting this on was tough , but it does get easier . My husband thinks it was a very good use of $ 40 .
 I have to say this is the best body shaper i have ever worn and so worth the price , ladies you will love this body shaper , it sucks you in an additional 2-4inches and i love the way it made me look in my dress with the hour glass figure .
 I got the XL the first time and felt I could take the pain of a size smaller . So I gave the XL to my mom and bought the L. Now , the sizing is very accurate -- I am 5 ' 7 , 180lb , so I should be in the XL . But if you really do n't mind squeezing -LRB- which I did n't -RRB- I got into the Large and I looked fantastic . However , be aware that being 10 lbs over the weight is OK to buy the size smaller ; but if you are 20lbs over , it will not work !! Also , the squeem does not work under tight tops because you can see the front clips ; however , layered like a tight top with a cami/slip under it -- could work it that way . But it truly cinches those inches so it makes you look fit and curvy !!
 For an instant whittle of your waist , this is perfect ! There is a noticible difference between before and after , even in jeans and a sweater . It also pushes you up for nice support . A little hard to sit for any length of time and breathe comfortably but the added benefit is that I could n't eat much while wearing it . My local mall store was selling it for $ 55 , so this was a bargain too !
 after baby # 2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible . I am so glad that I bought the squeem , it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape . I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just could n't believe that I had just had a baby . Now that I am 7 months postpartum , I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support . It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before !
 I love it !!! It 's made of sturdy rubber on the outside , and soft cotton on the inside . It really makes you sit straight and pushes your breasts upwards !!! I 've only been wearing it for a few hours . And unlike the other customers , it was easy to put on at first , then after two hours , i went to the second hook . It 's comfortable and really gives me the hourglass figure i wanted !!! I think this will give me the shape i want after a few months of use , so I 'll update later !! :-RRB- -- Update -- I really had a hard time with this the first day . It rolls all around my waist and i feel so hot in it ! and when i took it off , it itched like hell !!! i had to put ointment all over my tummy ! But you get used to it eventually , i almost never take it off , i even wear it to bed !! My body does keep the shape afterwards . It held it for five minutes after the first time , ten minutes after the second and so on . It does n't really reduce my appetite , i just feel really uncomfortable in it if i eat a lot . But it 's really worth the price !! I 'll update again a while later ! :-RRB- -- Update -- Okay i had to take out one star . Yeah it does work and everything but it itches so bad !!! i put a light camisole shirt underneath , but it still itches ! my skin burns for hours after i take it off !!! On the plus side , it 's only been 2 weeks and i already lost 2 inches off my waist ! but i have to do something about that itching ! and i wash it every three to four day ... maybe i should wash it every day ? Or maybe I 'm allergic to something in it ! i really do n't know , but it 's very annoying
 Thats ' all I have to say . It holds you in , makes u sweat in your abdomen area and it gives you that coca-cola bottle look . If you already have that body type like I do ... it really enhances it .
 This made my waist look inches smaller in minutes . I left this on overnight when I look bloated and I woke up with a flat stomach and a waist that was an inch smaller .
 I think the title says it all . I 'm a pretty small person anyway and wanted something to smooth out the bulges for when I wear certain outfits . This definitely does the job ! It is super , super tight . In fact , it 's an excellent lower back support for that reason ! It 's not smooth , though , so you ca n't wear it under thin and/or untextured fabrics . If you have a knit or something with a pattern , it 's great . I wear it under dresses a lot when I go to special events . The other note is that the fat you squeeze has to go somewhere -- I pictured it somehow disappearing , but actually it oozes out of the top and bottom . I usually have my husband try to squeeze it down under the top section , though . You ca n't assume your fat is going to magically disappear -LRB- imagine my disappointment !!! -RRB- but for what this is and what it does , I 'm a huge fan .
 I love it ! it does make you smaller in your mid section but it pinches the sides of my back .
 does it bunch ? Yes . Does it feel restricting ? Yes . Does it create a sleek , slim silhouette ? Does it whittle , your middle ? Yes , YES !!! The Squeem bunches and restricts because it is A WAIST CINCHER ! NEWSFLASH
 bought that in Macy 's in March , about $ 75.00 then . Broke after seven months . I like this stuff so I bought this again . So much cheaper in Amazon . Same thing . and the shipping is soooooooo fast . Ordered last night , got it next day lunchtime . Amazing !
 It does an awesome job . It hides those unwanted love handles ! It takes 2 sizes down from your regular size . Make sure to choose a size down from your regular clothing size , the chart wasnt helpful !
 I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher , and loved it so much I thought I 'd give this one a try as well . As far as the smell , it 's very faint . Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly . The fit was nice & comfortable . But it 's not a solid black like you 'd assume . Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior . The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies , so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day . The same thing with the waist cincher , the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall , great product .
 This is exactly what is says - FIRM compression . I got a size small and my waist is a 28-29 inches . It squeezes you in and you will look FABULOUS . You wo n't be able to eat much , or bend over , but you 'll look great ! I wore it under a tight dress for a wedding and after about 6 hours , I had to go and take it off so I could wiggle on the dance floor .
 im a mom of twins and i love this product ! before i was pregnant i was petite 5 ' 4 weighed 113lbs . but boy did i gain weight ! on the night of my c-section at 37 weeks they weighed and measured me , i had gained 50lbs and my waist was 45inches around !! -LRB- at least my twins were healthy 5lbs and 6lbs -RRB- but i couldnt believe it 50lbs ?! . i was so conscious of my body that after they were born i needed no i wanted to get my figure back asap . -LRB- my friend who also had twins the week before said thats impossible to lose all that weight fast she said it would take months even years -RRB- at the hospital they give you a binder which helps with the c/s incision and it helped for a while it got me down to a 32inch wore it around for about 3 weeks and then i decided to purchase the squeem . . i saw it through a website with a mom who also had twins . shipping was quick and when i received this product -LRB- i got a medium -RRB- i put it on right away.it was like the hallelujah chorus was playing . i was on my way to a skinnier me again . i wore this religiously , day and night but i had a ritual too i would put on palmers lotion first then i would put those motherhood maternity bands that cover your belly when you 're pregnant . anyways everyday i did my routine and now 3 months later I 'm down to 120lbs my waist is a size 28 and my tummy which i hated to look in the mirror by the way coz it was bulging out is now flat like before . i actually just ordered the small size in a vest a few days ago but everyone is asking what i did i got so skinny so fast . and remember i told you the other mom with twins that told me its gon na take forever well i saw her and shes like WTH ?! I 'm still fat and youre back to your pre baby shape . lol !! i absolutely recommend this !
 I love love love the squeem !!! The before and after pictures are definitely real !!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture , you eat much less since it squeezes the he 'll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze .
 I just received this product and I love it . I bought it because my core stomach muscles are not strong and I am having back aches . I am 64 yrs old and 5 ' 6 '' and 181 lbs . My muscles are not the same . After reading the other reviews it was very helpful in making up my mind . I bought XL and at first I thought I purchaed the wrong size . I tugged alot to get it on and I remember one person said hook it up and step into it and slide it up . This works best for me . After day 2 its more comfortable and I dont wear anything under it . My back does n't ache and it keeps my posture correct which in turn makes me concsious about holding my stomach in . Of course I look better with it on but my main concern was to get back into correct posture and remind me to hold my stomach muscles in and not be lazy . Ive tried all the other lingerie out there and there is no comparison . It never moves or shifts on you . Even though you have to struggle to get it on it feels amazing after you have it on . Its winter in Indiana and I wear mostly loose fitting tops with jeans so you do n't notice in my clothing . I will buy another just to have so I can alternate them and keep clean . I thank the lady about her review on size who was about my size because this is just right for me . This products makes me look soooo good it makes me want to shed a few pounds ! Ha Ha I know I should .
 This &#34; faja &#34; does what it is supposed to do which is tuck in and hide unsightly and unflattering fat . This is the 3rd one I have owened in 7 years . And they have all luckily been of great quality and deffinetly worth the price . For 35 dollars , I was sucked in about 2 sizes and given an hour glass figure . Is it uncomfortable ? not really but I am no stranger to waist cinchers . Does it smell rubbery when you take it out of the package ? yes it does so I let it sit out overnight and it was ready to wear by morning . Can you tell you have it on , only if you are wearing clingy/tight and light fabrics . Which if I was comfortable wearing things of that sort I probably wouldnt have ordered the cincher . All in ALL I gave it 5 stars for doing what it says . Giving me a gorgeous waist line and perking up the girls .
 I lost 9 inches around my waist wearing this , The longest I wore it may have been about 8 hours . it really works !
 I got mine n I put it on the first day by the second day I was on the second hook . I 'm 5 ' 7 '' n close to 200 pounds . -LRB- all muscle though besides my lil muffin top -RRB- The medium is what I should have been in but after reading the reviews n it saying if u r twenty pounds over weight not to go down a size I decided against the medium . Even one of my co workers said I would need a medium . Next time I will b buying a medium . I still wear it from time to time but I ca n't wait till I can get my medium . So to all u girls that do have an hour glass figure n r mostly muscle u may want to go down a size . I do wear mine with a tank underneath . Maybe since the holidays r here I may need the large . Lol for all the people saying it leaves a nasty smell that most b a figment of their imagination unless maybe their not wearing anything underneath or their pores soak up the smell . It has n't been very bad on me when I take it off . I 'm thinking of using the saran wrap idea . N I 'm sure I will b using it when I exercise to . It is good though I 'm happy with it .
 I echo all of the positive reviews on this product - it is simply fantastic.I purchased this product in October 2012 for 2 reasons
 I 'm so happy I tried the sqeem ! another friend turned me onto this fabulous product ! I 've been using it as a diet aid . . ... it 's a nice reminder that maybe I should n't have that dessert . . or at least not the third or fourth bite ! I originally purchased a medium ... mistake on my part and I could n't even get the clasps together ! but after a couple of weeks of wearing the large , I was able to get the medium on fairly easily ! yay ! I have been wearing this in conjunction with calorie counting on -LSB- ... -RSB- and doing light exercise at Curves . The combination of all three and hopefully I 'll be able to fit my old clothes again ! yay ! total thumbs up on Sqeem !
 I have the squeem in black and nude and they are a small . I ordered a small in the pink one and i think its miss sized . My trainer usually wears a xs and it was small for her . But i love my other squeems .
 This was a good deal and I loved it I did get a couple of bruises with it rubbing on certain areas which the one with straps does not I will definitely get this though it goes perfectly under tube dresses and other outfits whereas the one with straps would look weird overall good buy worth every penny but I have gone a few sizes down so I need a smaller one so I guess they are getting more pennies from me lol
 The product is true to your size . As you continue to wear it you will notice that you will quickly drop to the smaller size . I am thrilled to be saying I will soon be heading to a medium . Awesome product for reshaping !
 I am preparing for iiposuction and compression wear will be a part of my process of recovery for several months . I purchased a couple of these after reading the reviews and wanting a head start in feeling what wearing a girdle would feel like . Well , let me share that I love this item . It is slimming and posture correcting . I look great in my clothing and looking great in my clothing adds confidence in how I move about . There is greater awareness of my posture and it makes me look taller.I host a Friday breakfast group in my home every Friday with all my women friends . This last Friday I wore my cincher under my clothes . Everyone complimented my look that morning and I know it was the cincher . So , what did I do ? Like a good friend , I shared my secret with all the ladies , and since I had ordered more of this item , I put the extras I had on two of the women in our group ! We were all amazed with how they pulled us in and added an inch to our height ! BRAVO , SQUEAM , We all Scream for Cinch SQUEEM ! At the end of our gathering I purchased several more of this item in both the cincher and the Miracle Vest for my friends . The Vest I would only wear for special outings requiring that extra help with shoulders and rolls in the back.There is a great book out , How Not To Look OLD , a must read for women 40 and over . Shapewear is mentioned too ! I am 50 , 57 '' size 8/10 and I am very athletic and active . But I have that Middle and Lower ab flab . This Cincher feels good , I like the idea of wearing it too the gym too !
 I bought this item when I was 5 weeks post partum after trying several other similar products that did n't work for me at all . I am 5 ' 1 '' and weigh about 135 post baby . I love that its plenty long enough to go from right under breast all the way to my problem post c-section lower tummy . I am able to wear pants with no muffin top and I can definitely tell a difference in the tightness of my tummy from when I wear it to when I do n't . I do n't lounge around the house in it , but if I 'm out and about any where and even now back at work I always wear it and I love it !!!! It is definitely helping me return to form .
 just received this today and tried it on immediately . been `` trying '' to lose this 15 lbs of baby weight for a year ; i currently wear a medium/8 -10 in shirts/dresses so i ordered a M squeem . when i first tried to put it on alone i thought CRAP it 's never going to fit . it REALLY looks like it 's not going to fit when you try to put it around yourself at first , at least for me that 's what it was like . but once my husband helped squeeze me into it , it was perfect . it immediately smoothes you out , which is the effect i was most looking for since i am wearing a very tight dress for a wedding in two weeks . i do n't find it uncomfortable at all , though it is SUPER tight . but what else can be expected from a product like this ! it does have an odor when you take it out of the box , but to me it 's not offensive . it actually smells kind of `` lemon-y '' but maybe it depends on the one you get . i highly recommend !
 This thing is a game changer !! My stomach looks like it did in high school / long before 3 csections when I wear it !!! I just wish I had bought it right after childbirth !! I do n't know where it 's pushing my fat to , and I do n't really care !!!
 I lost a total of 25 pounds during the last 4 months . Since I have lost all my fat -LRB- excluding my gut -RRB- I decided to give this baby a try . I read reviews , looked at YouTube videos on different girdles etc. but this specific product had A LOT of reviews , I was determined to give it a shot ! I have been wearing this for a month & without working out I have instantly lost 4 additional pounds ! When I DO N'T wear this , I STILL look slimmer in the abdominal area of my body . I tried it all , sit ups , sit up machines ... ALL THIS HERE ACTUALLY WORKS ! I 'll be wearing a 2 piece bikini this summer DEFINITELY ; -RRB- I am ALWAYS a medium in shirts and sweaters I went with a SMALL due to reviews of people posting to buy one size smaller than what you usually wear . It was PERFECT -LRB- at first did n't seem too perfect -RRB- but after a few days / week ... It stretches and it 's AMAZING ! You look like a curvy beautiful woman EVERY DAY ... I for one , know I walk with more confidence ;-RRB- Now how 's that for a review on the Squeem < 3
 Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i 'm still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :-RRB- really i recomended . Money well spend it
 Absolutely love this thing . I already have it in nude and have the vest so this just completed my squeem collection . It never fails at sucking in my muffin top !!!!
 I had two reasons for the purchase of this product , one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity ! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons ! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful !!! I just can not express in words how great this product is !!!
 Great product ! Stays in place well when exercising because of the way it 's made - Also good because it 's adjustable & surprisingly comfortable .
 Great fitting , and quality as well . No more bumps when I am wearing T shirts , or fitted dress . Now no look like a muffin !!
 It worked for me cause I was using after having a baby in the winter . On warm weather , it would be way too hot .
 My daughter recommmendedMy daughter had tummy tuck surgery , and the doctor recomended it . so she has been using it for about 6month and loving it.she told me to get it , and i love it . i believe i have lost couple of inches . i use it for about 8 hrs or more , specially when i go for my morning walks , about 2hrs , help me to sweat a lot.i am very happy.it
 I really like this product ! It does what it says it will do . Make sure to measure your waist first and then look at the chart and order according to the size you are now and not what you were pre-pregnancy because it wo n't fit and you will have to send it back and then reorder . Otherwise I really like this product and I recommend it to anyone who is trying to get back to pre-pregnancy size . I am 5 weeks postpartum and I look 3 to 4 months pregnant still so we will see what this product does for me over time . I have n't gone down in the stomach since about 3 weeks postpartum so if my tummy does go down it will be from using this . Also I have used other bands and they do n't feel as comfortable as this one does . I do n't feel like I am suffocating in this at all . I really am very comfortable . So ladies check out this product and give it a try .
 I love my squeem . It really does make you look a lot thinner and its actually way more comfortable than I thought it would be . I wish it was a little smoother because if you wear something fitted you can see the seem that goes down the front . And at the top of the squeem , your back fat will bulge so to avoid this you might want to purchase a squeem that has the shoulder straps .
 So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box . Like some have said , takes a few minutes to get used to it . I 've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it . It covers everything that needs to be covered -LRB- and I am long-waisted -RRB- . It stays put , which I love . It 's comfortable . It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach `` pooch '' . It 's comfortable enough to sit in . Best of all , instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support . I 'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future . I wonder if I can wear it on my runs ? Hmmm ... Also
 This shapewear/seller is fabulous ! I recieved the package two days after i ordered it ! and it gives me the cutest little waist . I wear a size 14 and the xl fit perfectly . I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like a nice hourglass figure !
 I was really excited to try this , however it is not for everyone . I have a `` flat '' stomach just flabby and then I have `` love handles '' so I thought this would just hold everything in but that 's not how it worked for me . It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I did n't have before . It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front . I think I would rather have the love handles . I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts . -LRB- Not exactly why I bought it but o well -RRB- . I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me , just not how I thought it would .
 I have been trying to flatten my tummy after a recent c-section . I have been working out consistently , but I still had a significant pooch . This product helped me control my tummy and within two weeks there was a noticeable difference . So , many people asked me if I lost weight . This shapwear helped my stomach to regain its ability to contract its muscles . It is difficult to get use to at first , but it has significant rewards if you wear it 8 hours a day for a few weeks . Also , you ca n't tell that you have anything on underneath your clothes . it just looks like you have a perfect silhouette . But please be warned that you do not need to go down a size with this item . It has enough control that you can buy it in your size unlike some other shappers .
 I first ordered size X-L , but that was too big , so I returned it and bought a L . The first couple of wearings were difficult , but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body . I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it -LRB- sort of like the top part of panty hose -RRB- . I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around . It is not comfortable to wear while sitting . For me , I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter , as I think my torso is shorter than most . I do think it is helping , but I need to wear it for more hours . I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep , rather than in the daytime , but I have not tried that yet . The product is well made .
 This product does what is said in the description , my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back . My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back . I love it ! Is my second buy . The price is also good , the first one I got cost me $ 55 this time I paid $ 36 for it .
 I 'm thin , and never expect much for these items , but what a difference . I just gave birth , and when I put it on , I instantly get my shape back . I have no idea where the extra fat goes , but it disappears . I 'll warn you , it is very very tight . I ca n't bend very well , if at all . Can only wear for a few hours at a time . Great , though .
 Best then ever I bought all year . I went from a Xl to a Medium with in 2months . I now have to get a small . It is a little uncomfortable when you first put it on but after a couple of days wearing it for along period of time you get used to it .
 I love these shapers ! I wear mine -LRB- small -RRB- every day , It started to feel a little on the loose side and was n't doing much for making my figure so I got a smaller one and it did n't fit ! The Shaper stretches so if you have worn it out like I did . . stick with the same size . PS THIS IS HARD TO KEEP CLEAN !!! If you wear it every day like me it is very hard to keep clean , I steam clean mine with my iron and it works okay to get the sweat stains but the smell lingers so I get a new one every so often . I would def recomend this product to anyone tho !
 I have lost 6 pounds and 4 inches off my waist ! After the birth of my second child I lost the weight and with hours at the gym toned back up but my I had no curves ! After my third baby , I thought there was no way to get my figure back , but now 10 months after my fourth baby , I am already down to a 29 1/2 in waist . I am already ordering the next size down with 39in hips and a 40in bust I want to reduce my waist another 2 inches to have a real va va va voom shape . lol It has really help me recover after pregnancy in a way I never thought possible . I would recommend this to my best friend.P.S . I have the vest . To avoid back fat rolls ! Plus , It seems to keep my bra straps in place .
 This is a perfect item if you have a dress to squeeze into . I thought it did the best out of any shapewear I have ever tried on at giving me an actual waist , rather than a barrel shape . However the front clasps do show through light clothing and they would show through a simple silk dress . I wore it with a dress with alot of shirring in the front so it worked perfectly . This is basically a modern corset that gives you a waist but is easier to get into and is more comfortable !
 I wore this about 3 days post partum . It really felt good on my back . At first it was hard to get on ... I had to stuff my `` leftovers '' inside.I have gotten alot of compliments that I look great . I first used it on the first notch setting then about 2 weeks later I went to the first notch setting . I wish it had more settings ! I need to order the next size smaller to make more progress!It helps the bones come back together . . but you will have to have a tummy tuck or do major crunches to get some tone back .
 For every women concerned with her figure this is a awesome product . It helps flush your body of toxins while smoothing and tightening your mid section . I tried to wear it under clothes out in public but the rubber material makes your clothing fit weird . My routine is wearing it at home at least 4 to 5 days a week and it works out great for me . I recommend you buy yours one size larger that way as you loose inches you can adjust the hooks to a perfect fit . A definite must have !
 A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress . I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small . It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance . Once it was on I was still able to contract my core , which meant that I needed a smaller size . I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso . Other then that this is great buy .
 This product gives great back support and an instant slimming effect with a sexy hourglass shape . It also lifts the boobs nicely although I can not figure out how . Maybe because it makes you have better posture . Another plus
 I absolutely love this product . The only problem I have with it is after wearing it during a long day it starts to cut into my back , thats when I know it time to take it off . But I can already start to see my body shaping . The quailty of the Squeem is one of the best also . Love , love , love this item .
 This is good to make ur waist look smaller . The only downfall when u sit down the wire jabs at ur boob
 Bought this for my back to keep it straight which worked really well . Plus side was that it made me look really curvy . Great for clingy sweaters as it did n't show through . Very satisfied
 I tried several things after my Chiropractor told me i needed something to support my back to keep it from popping out.This squeem is just enough support to help with that , yet is flexible enough to be able to work ; and believe me , I do lots of twisting in my job.It make my shape look better too . I 'll soon be needing to go to a size medium , because it has helped my waist get smaller . I also gave the extra large I started with to a friend with back trouble , and she loves it too.This item is not considered a back support per say , but consider it . You wo n't be disappointed . They are also true to size , but , only get one size at a time , as your waist will be getting smaller as you wear them.I refuse to go out without it !
 It does what it suppose to do . Fits great and pulls everything in . And it 's a great price . Would recommend this to a friend .
 This does the job but also makes my back better after standing all day.Use most of the time and got it for a good price .
 Very comfortable after getting used to the tightness . A little difficult to get the hang of fastening , but after two or three times was able to manipulate the hooks easily . Does the job of waist cinching and tummy tucking . Also gave good extra support to my back and helped my posture .
 Got it fast . . Holds you up really good and it wont show thru your clothing . . It wont make you sweat ... I 'm pleased ; -RRB-
 I love this product ! I just received it less than a week ago , but I am already addicted . I thoroughly believe true weight loss comes from eating properly and toning . However , being able to look in the mirror and visualize yourself without any extra bulges and bumps goes a long way ! Obviously you ca n't wear this by itself under thin clothing , but layering properly will always work . For me , the compression helps to stave away cravings and I have found myself eating less during the day . Also , after day 1 my back was completely sore due to the fact that I actually sat up straight all day . The soreness lasted but 1 day . I found this to be helpful because correct posture is so very important . Overall I simply LOVE the way it shapes my mid section and more importantly the way that I feel when I actually like what I see in the mirror . I definitely reccomend trying this for 30 days .
 Definitely a staple for my closet since having my baby ! Holds me in , and looks good underneath my clothing . I 'm happy with it ... and will purchase another one .
 This is a great shapewear product and overall I am happy with money well spent , there are 2 things that keep it from 5 stars . 1 -RRB- it is hand washable but gives no specific washing instructions and 2 -RRB- the back top rolls down if not secured by a bra band or something similar , but it works wonderfully with bras or shapewear tops so its not awful . For the price it is worth it .
 I 've never used a shapewear like this before . However , I tried it and liked it . I use it for the gym since it gives me the support I need without compromising the exercise.I put it on using a cotton tank top to avoid full contact with my skin since it might get itchy -LRB- I have really sensitive skin , oops ! -RRB- .
 The best I could get . I still use it when I need it . After having a baby it is not easy to use some time of clothing . This product helps a lot !
 I tell you this squeem does wonders for you waist size . I workout sleep and live in this thing and when I do n't wear it my body has molded into it . Hour glass in the making
 Help with posture and gives a mommy tummy a nice squeeze . It feels great on my ribs and seems to be bringing them back to pre-baby size . I highly recommend this !
 it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit
 I love this product , I have used it for years and would not leave home without it!I would recomment it to anyone .
 I have been using this product for over 7 years and what can I say I love it . It gives me that hour glass shape when my weight is fluctuating . If I gain a few pounds no one can tell . I will say that it does fit and look better when I am smaller but I love it either way . Everyone is always asking what is my secret to a flat stomach after 5 kids and this is it .
 The fit was so perfect . . could n't ask for a more perfect item ... I am even slimming down ... great fantastic product ... just fabulous ... great ... item to buy and affordable
 I highly recommend this product !!! I bought this in early May and here it is late June and I 'm having to buy the next size down!I am a new mom and wanted to loose the post-tummy look and started wearing this every day , especially during work outs . I saw a difference just after a few weeks.I ca n't wait to see the new me and I have to give props to ` Squeem ' for helping me along this frustrating journey .
 I gave birth to my third naturally 6 days ago . I ordered this Thursday and it arrived Friday via express courier . I know I am a size small usually -LRB- used to be xs -RRB- , so I ordered a small . When I tried to put it on I thought it would be impossible . My husband had trouble hooking it up when I was standing , so he tried hooking it when I was lying down and it worked . It feels really great on , improves my posture and takes away lower back pain . I am sitting in it with no problems but it might be hard to nurse in . I looked 6 months pregnant 1 hour ago and with it on , and the nursing breasts I look like a model now ! I highly recommend this so far .
 I think I have found my soulmate in my new squeem . . I 've never even bothered to write a review about anything before but I had to say my piece about this wonderful invention . . I 'm a 26 yr old mother of 3 kids . -LRB- 2 of them being twins -RRB- . . I 'm also a freelance model and staying inshape is obviously an importance of mine . . I work out constantly but it seems to have no effect on my extra belly fat from the twins . . I even have significant stretch marks acrossed my lower belly . . I 've been using compression therapy for my stomache for almost a year . . I bought a system thats equivilant to a set of 4 ace bandages . . and while they `` worked '' I spent alot of my time adjusting . . and re adjusting the things . . if I had to bend over even once they rolled and then seperated in places that made wearing it useless . . plus there was just no way to hide it under your clothes so I couldnt leave the house with them on . . I purchased this on a whim as I was actually searching for a decoractive cincher for a shoot . . but I thought it would be so much easier then the wraps . . man do I wish I had found this a year ago !! I 've already noticed a difference in the appearance of the belly fat and stretch marks in just the few days I 've had it . . after a year of battling this extra skin the squeem took it on in just a few days !! plus I cant believe how soft it makes my skin feel after I take it off . . Its so comfortable compared to other things I have tried . . I put it on and it makes me feel so good about myself that I 'm usually dancing around the house . . I have a feeling over the next year I will probably acquire quite a few of these things . . they are simply wonderful . .
 I 've had my squeem -LRB- what a horrible name ! -RRB- for a week now and I like it ! Ca n't comment on durability over the long haul but I 've worn it every day since it arrived . What bothers me about my 59-year old body is not the extra pounds I carry but the way they 've settled in my middle , post-menopause . Hence my seeking out a waist cincher . I tried spanx and spanx-like shapewear and really hated it . I also hate pantyhose with ` tummy control ' . I really like to be comfortable and I tend to wear very comfy clothes.But this rather intimidating-looking garment holds in my middle comfortably and helps correct my posture . I feel more pulled-together when I wear it . I feel as though my clothes look better on me and I feel better about myself.I worried that I would only want to go through the trouble of putting this on occasionally but , in fact , I like wearing it to work every day.A little advice
 I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE my squeem . It took about 3 inchess off my waist . It gives you a smaller waist to wear that sexy dress or old jeans that you can no longer fit into . I have a strapless dress that is a pain to wear because it tends to sag and wants to fall down on me . Parts of the squeem is rubber so it actually helps hold up my dress!Again some parts are made of a rubber and fabric so it is very comfortable -LRB- in short time spans . -RRB- It is on tight so you do sweat the longer you wear it . I can only wear it for about 8hours before I 'm like GET IF OFF OF ME !! So it 's funny but how long I 'm going to be at a place depends on whether I will wear it or not . But it always makes me look great ! And beauty is so worth it ! The hook and eye closure is perfect for getting it on . And the material and closure seem to hold really well , even though sometimes I feel like I 'm going to burst out of it !! But I never do , not a single stitch undone or hook & eye even loose !! I own 2 squeems and this one definitely is better than the pink rubber one . The pink all rubber one makes you sweat too much and it does n't breathe at all . Hope this review helps !!
 I was so excited when my waist cincher arrived , that I put it on right away . It took two inches off my waist and gave me a better posture . I was expecting it to be a little tighter . I was just to comfortable in the cincher . So I am going to try the next size down and see if I get a better result . I recommend this this product to anybody trying to get a hour glass figure . Oh yeah one bad thing after awhile the boning bunches and sometimes it pocks me . Which is very uncomfortable .
 This product is great and it does work to slim your waistline . It 's just a little hard to get used to sitting with it on over a period of time , because you really ca n't move around all that good but once u get used to it everything is fine .
 UPDATE
 ... seriously.This definitely is a pretty comfy waist cincher . I was initially skeptical of purchasing , because I am naturally curious about products prior to purchase . I normally end up researching and investigating to death , to the point where I 'll dig up a ton of negative reviews for something and a bunch of positives . By the end , I 'm usually as confused and indecisive as when I started ! So that 's why giving the ` Squeem ' a chance was such a hard decision for me . I had been window shopping shapewear for a while and still had no clue what to go with . I have to say , after owning the Squeem since September it is definitely a worthy piece of lingerie shapewear!In terms of comfort , it is easy to forget you have it on after the first hour . Sometimes I will be wearing mine for eight hours and then finally realize I should take it off next time I get home . I am quite busty for my size -LRB- 5 ' 0 '' and 32D -RRB- , and so I can fully , FULLY relate to ladies who complain of back pain and discomfort posture-wise . I think this Squeem has helped , actually . I 've noticed on days where I wear my Squeem for 3 + hours my back hurts MUCH , MUCH less than on days where I do not . I admittedly have crappy posture , lol , so clearly it is the Squeem forcing me to stand/sit more upright that 's likely making a difference . The only thing discomfort-wise , sometimes depending on the bra you are wearing , there might be some slight awkwardness with the underboob , upper stomach area . At least for me , I have a super short torso , and I have noticed sometimes certain bras feel weird combined with the squeem , some even pinching a little . But I have learned which of my bras go best with the Squeem -LRB- surprisingly , for me , it 's the regular ol' non-padded T-Shirt bras which are the comfiest and seamlessly combined -RRB- . At certain angles it 's a no-go ... i.e. , laying down is uncomfortable or trying to do crazy bending over , etc. is a no-go too , but I 'd think that 's the case with waist cinchers in general ... In terms of quality , I feel like it has not lost any of it 's cinching ability since I 've had it . I 've worn it quite a bit too . Particularly in October , I was wearing it just about everyday , for long stretches of time . It still feels pretty sturdy , the hooks work perfectly , the material is holding up , etc.As far as blending with your everyday wardrobe ? Well , I mostly wear it to work . My work uniform is baggy and unshapely , so I have n't really had to worry about whether or not those around me can tell if I 'm wearing one . However , the times where I have worn tighter clothing , I think it meshed impressively ! I took pictures just to test , and you ca n't really tell I have a waist cincher on . Of course , I personally feel like an imposter in everyday clothes and a waist cincher , lol . I always feel paranoid whenever out and about that somebody 's gaping at my waist , wondering if it 's authentic . But yeah , definitely not very bulky or noticeable . Particularly in darker clothing or patterned tops . It also blends well with dresses ! I wore it on Halloween , lol . ; PThen there 's sizing . I was conflicted before I ordered , because I read various different charts about how these squeems are sized . I was kind of worried I 'd order something too small or too big . I wanted something REALLY TIGHT , but I wanted to not feel like I 'm about to pass out , heh . I was torn between ordering an Extra Small or just a Small . Typically I wear XS in tops in general , however , there are SOME exceptions , like button blouses and certain jackets , where I could never wear an XS , I need a Small . I was worried I 'd choose wrong . After looking at many websites , I decided to go with the general measurements that seemed to more/less stand for XS/Petite/Whatever you want to call it -LRB- I went with my gut , though , and bought the Extra Small -RRB- . Basically what I 'm saying , be realistic about what size you want to order ! If you generally wear medium clothing , go with a medium ! If you wear XL , go with that ! ETC. . Even more , go by your specific MEASUREMENTS . I chose XS because 24/25 inch waist , 32 bust , and the size 2 all described me . At first I was like OH NO , because it seemed impossible to connect the hooks -LRB- you 'll feel like a fatty mcfat fat > . > -RRB- , but take in a deep breath as you do it the first couple times . Before you know it you 'll be able to latch it onto the SECOND hood without even sucking it in ! : -RRB- I also feel fuller when I eat with this thing on . I 'll get halfway through my meal , and feel full . Then there is the increase of bowel movements ! TMI , TMI , I know , I know , but you 'll see what I mean!All - in-all it 's a GREAT buy . It improves your posture , reduces your waist by about 3 inches to give you that crazy desired hourglass thang going on -LRB- really , it does ! -RRB- , blends surprisingly well , and helps when it comes to toilet visits much the same way fiber does ! I keed , I keed . But , seriously , I recommend it , worth the buy , and I 'm a pretty harsh critic , sooo ...
 I started out with a Medium sized Squeem Vest about a week before I used this small sized waist cincher - you can see the product here : Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear , Firm Compression , Cotton & Rubber , Vest , Black , MediumI love the cincher since I can use it with a sleeveless top and do n't have to worry about the straps or strap irritation . There is truth to the claim that it reshapes your waist - I never had curves and I 'm just beginning to have a womanly shape to my waist . The only thing I do n't like is that the cincher can sometimes squeeze the fat up to the top of the cincher and then you have a mini roll there - not always an issue , just sometimes I noticed it . The vest goes up all the way , so you do n't have that problem.Either way , I highly recommend this product and have become a firm believer in what Squeem can do . : -RRB- EDIT
 I have had the squeem waist cincher for 4 months and went from a size 34 waist to a 27 and I am very pleased . 6 of my friends have purchased and are seeing great results aswell . I have and will continue to recommend this product to anyone that wants to loose inches on the waist or even to just look fabulous in a form fitting outfit .
 I just got mine after reading everyone 's review . My existing waist is 34 inches . I ordered a large , and think that I will have to order a medium soon . I ripped it out of the box , and fastened it up . Went on easy . I went from a 34 to a 31 . It is comfortable too . I live in a hot & humid climate , and I wore it tonight outside . Not sweating in it ... but it was night time . But , hey , I 'm mainly indoors.But , the best part ... I did n't realize that my back was so `` unsupported '' before . It feels wonderful with the Squeem . I put it on , and my spine went `` ahhhhh , I needed that ! '' I have to wait another year to get my tummy tuck ... but this is going to do the trick until then.Under lightweight material or certain sweaters/knits ? It 's not a good choice . the hook line -LRB- in the front -RRB- will show . Makes one wonder if you have staples up your midline . That 's hte bad thing.I did have a hard time figuring out what size to order . The size chart on my box says : Xsmall 25-27 inch waist , 0-2 dress sizesmall 28-30 , 4-6Medium 31-33 , 8-10Large 34-36 , 12-14Xlarge 37-39 , 14-162x 40-42 , 16-183x 43-45 , 18-204x 46-48 , 20-225x 49-51 , 22-24
 I can see why this cincher has so many fans ! Like any cincher , it takes a little getting used to . I wore it two or three times for a couple hours each , a couple times for an evening out , and now I can wear it all day if I choose to . It also takes a while for my body to `` settle in '' to it ; the first thirty minutes or so I do a fair amount of adjusting to get things to lay just right.Cons : - There is n't any boning immediately adjacent to the hooks and eyes that make up the front opening , so they pull and buckle slightly . I ca n't wear this under anything too tight or clingy , as the row of bumps down the front makes it obvious I 've got some sort of girdle underneath.-The boning does n't extend the entire length of the channels , so the fabric tends to wrinkle and bunch around the waist . You could fix this yourself with longer boning or bar tacks to shorten the channels , but it 's not really a problem if you are n't wearing it under something clingy or really tight.-The rubberized knit sometimes irritates my skin -LRB- I assume due to the lack of ventilation -RRB- . This ca n't really be avoided . Powdering your skin before putting this on may help.Pluses : + Amazingly sturdy for the price . Even with regular wear , it seems to be holding up wonderfully , and the price is no more than what I would pay for a nice bra . + The two rows of eyes down the front means that you can choose your constriction , and it will probably extend the life of the garment for me . I 've been wearing this on the outer eyes , so when the fabric begins to lose its stretch , I 'll still be able to wear it on the inner eyes while waiting for my new one to arrive . + Once I adjusted to it and it adjusted to me , it has been very comfortable -LRB- provided I sit upright -RRB- . + It really does n't let you slouch , which means that your figure looks that much better .
 I bought this at my local lingerie store . The lady that sold it to me had a 25 inch waist ! -LRB- and she was a grandmother of 13 ! -RRB- She said to put cocoa butter on your stomach first , -LRB- for stretch marks , if any -RRB- then saran/plastic wrap , then put the waist cincher on , wear it every day and you WILL lose that belly ! I am living proof ! Worth every penny !
 Two months ago , I ordered an XLarge Squeem . A month later , I ordered a Large . Now , with no exercise and no change in diet , I 've lost 10 pounds and 6 inches off my natural waist . In the Squeem , my waist is down to 30 inches . My posture has improved . My back pain is much better . WOW ! Today I 'm ordering a Medium.And from here , losing the 10 more pounds I need to loose and exercising again to flatten that belly looks possible . WOW !
 I purchased this girdle and not only am I suprised but the people around me are like how the hell did you lose weight that fast.I should have got a medium instead of small but it still fits . I am a size 7/8 and usually wear a large but now I am wearing a medium hands down . I will order another one but a medium . I am also ordering one for my mom ... Great GirdleALSO move the front towards the side and it will look like you do n't have a girdle on underneath .
 I bought this because i have a bunch of excess from having a baby about 2 months ago , and i wanted something that would suck me in , even if i didnt lose weight , at least to look good in some clothes again.Well it took awhile to get here , but no harm done , i tried it on for size , im a large/xl , and i bought a medium for maximum control , and BOY DOES IT CONTROL . It takes a minute to get on because i had to literally squeeze myself into it -LRB- which was a good sign -RRB- , but its made very sturdy and held me in completely . I immediately had an hourglass figure and a flat stomach . I look great in all my wonderful clothes again!A couple downsides , you cant exactly wear this under very clingy clothes without at least a cami because the hooks are visible , making it a little obvious you have a corset underneath . You are forced to sit completely upright with your shoulders back , or you will be highly uncomfortable , and its a little hard to drive with it on -LRB- because of the way you have to sit -RRB- . Because its made of rubber , it definitely will help you lose weight , after just doing some household chores , it was warm to the touch from my body heat , and even after i took it off , i could still feel my muscles contracting in the shape of the corset . I havent had it long enough to see how well it works as a weigh loss tool , but i 'll be back in a month or so!My advice , definitely go DOWN a size from your natural size in clothes for maximum control and shape , and dont plan on eating much or doing anything that will require you to bend too much or lean over , it doesnt work well in this .
 I wear this religiously ! It 's extremely comfortable , I even sleep it in . I wear it as often as I can - only taking it off when I need to . So far so good . The only problem was it smelled like rubber at first since it was so new . I washed it -LRB- HAND WASHED , never put things like these in the washing machine/dryer as the item can warp ! -RRB- and the rubber smell went away . I 've only been wearing this for about a week so when it 's been a month or so I will post an update . I wear this in conjunction with dieting and light exercise . When I started all of this my waist was 28 1/2 inches . Now it 's down to 26 1/2 '' . I just hope I can actually keep the inches off . My goal is 24 '' but even that may be too much .
 If you are not used to being restricted , you may find this uncomfortable initialy . You do n't notice at first but after a few hours you can really feel the boning . However , it serves it 's purpose . There is a noticeble difference in the way your clothes fit with it on . I think it 's worth moments of being uncomfortable .
 This is icing on the cake ! I 'm 5 ' 4 '' . .124 lbs , and ordered a size small . . it fits perfect and makes me stand up straight , gives me a perfect hourglass shape . It is also VERY comfortable ! Buy it . . u wo n't regret it !
 Love it !! Just had a baby three weeks ago and you ca n't tell . It 's my fourth and I have never recovered this fast . Recommend it for anyone who has just had a baby .
 I had some issues actually GETTING the product , though the fault lies completely with the United States Postal Service , not at all with the seller ... anyway . I am 5 ' 1 , 110 lbs , and wear a size 0 . The problem is , I 'm definitely what you might call `` skinny fat '' and my trouble area has always been my tummy . I 'm short-waisted with large ribs for my small body frame and have this awful rectangular shape to my torso . I bought this item in XS hoping to begin my quest to waist train myself down to around a 20 inch waist . I 'm at 25 inches , and with the compression garment on the first and loosest set of hooks , am a 22 ! This thing is NOT particularly comfortable - I had to REALLY squeeze to even get it hooked , but I suppose that 's the point , right ? It 's like a mini-arm exercise , ha ! But if you have arthritis , joint pain , or issues with strength , you may need assistance getting the Squeem on . I was initially scared that I should 've ordered a Small , but after getting the XS on , I found i could move to the inner set of hooks within about two hours . Be prepared for an odd looking midsection when you sit down , but it does help with posture . The boning is not quite corset-like , very flimsy , but corsets are extremely pricey for a reason ! I wore it for about 11 hours the first day with the cottony side against my skin and with the rubber on the outside -LRB- and yes , the garment DOES smell of rubber , but not overwhelmingly so , and for other reviewers who cited this as a negative - um , it says it 's made of rubber right there in the description , what did you expect ? -RRB- and even went out to dinner in it . I was able to eat and drink without an issue . It will seem like it 's MEANT for the cottony side to be against the skin , because the tag is sewn into a seam on the rubber side , but for better rigidity , wearing it with the rubber against the skin is superior - at least for me . The space in between my bottom rib and top of my hipbone -LRB- a space of about 2 inches for me because of the short-waistedness -RRB- positively ACHED the whole night after finally removing the Squeem , but it was kind of a satisfying ache , if that at all makes sense . For this price , the Squeem is incredibly worth it . It 's summer where I am , and it 's quite hot to wear , but I 'm determined to get the body I want , and it 's impossible through any other means . If you want this to help postpartum , or simply to refine your silhouette under clothing without attempting waist training , you might want to order a size up from the sizing guide for a more comfortable , less extreme compression . Give yourself at least 2-3 hours to get used to the feeling of wearing it . I 'm not getting back-bulge , one of the reasons many have suggested the vest vs. this item , but it 's important to evaluate what you want to use a compression garment for , and keep in mind the trouble spots you have as well as the type of clothing you wear when determining this item vs. the vest . I have a pretty flat stomach from the side and do find that the Squeem gives me a slight lower belly pouch - something I saw another reviewer discuss . This is because the Squeem is slightly curved , with the midsection portion being the smallest - as is with an hour glass figure - and the boning is NOT corset-like . I think I 'll be quickly graduating to a waist training corset for this reason , but the price and construction is wonderful , and also great for beginner waist trainers !
 i tried it on for a few days , to see if it fit good . and i loved it ! ca n't wait to wear it for the recommended time ; this winter . it is awesome for posture and upper back pain . i have recommended this to several of my friends and family , and i 've only used it a couple of days-imagine 3 months !
 20 pounds ago , I slipped this bad boy on the add curves to my boyish figure and MAN O MAN!I was HOT!As I started to gain a little weight , it began to hurt on my side and pinched my thighs when I sat down . My skin would turn grey after prolonged use -LRB- but still within recommended limits -RRB- but it would quickly bounce back after an hour or so.My skin did get really sensitive after the first few wears but I got used to it and just would n't touch my stomach after I took it off . I felt like fine china glass after I took it off and to be honest , I though stuff would fall out of my if I thought too hard.But overall , I LOVED this product and would buy it again in a larger size , but I plan on losing to weight to fit into my medium dang it !
 I have lower back pain from a car accident over 17 years ago ... when wearing this consistently my back pain diminishes greatly .
 like this product . not good to wear for me with tight fitting clothes , my back fat shows above top . working on that though . feels great to wear . DOES NOT ROLL !!! love it . great seller experience . will purchase from seller again .
 I like this product . I suffer from chronic love handles especially when I wear jeans . I am 5 ' 1 '' and 122 pounds . I bought a medium because I tried my friend 's small and it was way too tight for me . The medium fits well . It does get a bit hot . I love the way it hides my love handles .
 it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area . my grandmother even notice it , and she did n't even know i bought it . It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body . I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium .
 Improves your figure by reducing your waistline . I 've been using this product for 2 months & I went from medium to small . After the first 2 weeks of using the size small I went from the 1st row of hooks to the 2nd row . It 's an excellent product that I 'll recommend for assisting with waist reduction . Along with a healthy diet and regular exercise , results are guaranteed .
 I like the thinness . I do n't like the rubber smell . It 's not as steady and strong as I hoped . Good price .
 great love this product it is wonderful def recommend to friends works as described put it on the morning it come and in two days can already see a little difference
 I confess I wore it without washing it first and I broke out around my midsection in horrible itchy bumps but I was excited.I love it . It 's perfect ! Since I bought it , I can now detect every celebrity who wears one.haha !
 I have been wearing my squeem as a post partum girdle and it is amazing . Started with a medium now wearing a small . Very comfortable !
 I have the squeem vest , which I am a big fan of , so I decided to try this cincher for strapless tops and dresses . It does a great job of nipping in your waist and giving you an hourglass figure . I love the result and I love that it hooks up the front because I think it 's easier to put on compared to other styles . The only downside is this tends to give you upper back fat , but that happens with every cincher I 've ever tried . If you are n't wearing strapless tops , go with the vest version because it helps prevent upper back fat .
 i realy love my shape wear , i got one for myself and one for my daughter and she 's notice a big difference ,
 This under garment is made of quality material . It fit great and is easy to wear . I would recommend this purchase to a friend !
 I absolutely love the squeem !!!! Although it does take a couple days to get use to it ... . I wear it all day at work and I already see and feel a difference I absolutely live the squeem !!!!
 I ordered my Squeem and it came earlier than promised . Mine did n't fit but it was my error and not the company 's . I filed for a return and the company replied promptly with instructions to send back and offered to send me a different size . The company is very polite and courteous . It 's one of the better companies selling on Amazon . The product itself from what I was able to do with it was very sturdy . The hook and eye enclosures were easy to use and the Squeem molded to my body shape . It was ridged but had give to allow for movement . The outside that goes away from your body is rubber but what actually touches you is a cotton material . It does smell a little like rubber if you put your nose to it but it 's not strong enough to smell if you 're wearing it . I ca n't wait to get my new sized one and try it out .
 I think I should have ordered a size smaller . I wore this anyway since it is the first time I 've tried to wear something like this . However , I wear this using the second set of hooks . I think I would have gotten more use out of a smaller size , using the first hooks , then the second . That 's okay . I 'll be ordering a smaller size from this seller soon.It 's comfortable and undetectable under clothes.The product arrived on time and was packaged nicely .
 I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small ... my general size is 4-6 , I 'm 5 ' 4 and weigh 120lbs right now ; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which is n't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress -LRB- I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips -RRB- . I wish I 'd ordered a medium -LRB- or even large -RRB- instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6 '' above my hips . I do n't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish ! So , if you 're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead . In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last .
 I have this all ready in a size 2x usually I take a xl but I found this one runs small unless you really want to squeeze into it with help , But it makes your stomached disappear and I found I could wear it around the house it was that comfrey and it really helps if you have back problems plus it makes your clothes look a whole lot better to bad I have to take it offJo from Naples
 I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements , my posture is definitely improved . I have also lost about 6 pounds , which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise , but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5 ' 9 '' 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should , super tight . I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL . It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices , I notice . I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it , but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise , the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time . Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes ...
 i have a 28-29 inch waist normally . should 've started with a size Small . the XS seemed a bit smaller than described . definitely gets the job done in cinching the waist !
 I ordered the Squeem just a few days ago and it only took two days to get delivered on my porch ! Delivery was quick and easy ! As for the product itself , I am 5 ' 4 and about 155lbs , I usually wear a Large in tops but I ordered a Medium because I wanted to be cinched up tight . It took me a few minutes to get it on , but it does exactly what it states ! I am a curvy girl as it is , but this accentuates my body perfectly . I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to create a more dramatic curve or hide that little tummy bulge from losing weight or having babies . The only down side to this particular cincher -LRB- and any cincher really -RRB- is that it is difficult to learn how to sit with it on , and to get up from a sitting position . Other than that this product is amazing ! Helps me with my posture and makes me look fantastic !
 I only just started wearing this today but already I know I 'm going to be wearing it daily , and without discomfort . I 'm 6 weeks postpartum and really needed something to help me shrink back down to my former size and I do believe this WILL do the trick.So far , the hype is true . It does n't roll down on the edges and it really evens out the figure very nicely - even under clothes you ca n't tell you are wearing this . I guess a con would be that I can see how you 'd get sweaty wearing this all day long and especially in hot weather.Overall , I am impressed so far .
 This is a great product to use with exercising . I think it definitely helps with losing inches off ... It provides great back support . Get the size that they recommended . . too small then bulges form on top and then it looks really funky .
 bought this over the other post-baby belly wraps marketed to pregnant women ... and glad i did . the belly wraps are stiff and very visible under clothing , where the squeem is a good ol girdle and forms the mid section into a pretty shape while holding in the jelly belly left over after delivery . you have to wear the waist cincher for 40days/40nights for it to work on getting the belly to shrink ; i 'm on 2.5 weeks and have already gone from looking 6m prego to less than 3m prego when not wearing it . it also helps with initiating a healthy diet and losing weight b/c it makes you want to look better . but it is not comfortable to wear to sleep ; makes me really hot . i have a cheaper wrap from babies r us that is more forgiving , but keeps up with the belly compression .
 With Squeem , I was able to fit in a size 4 from a size 6 . I always have trouble with a big belly but everything else is skinny on my body . This product made me look proportionate . I have other waist cincher I bought at regular stores but nothing holds you up like this one . I also bought -LRB- for the same price -RRB- those Spanx but it did not match up to my Squeem . I bought it here at Amazon and it came right on time for a big event I was trying to loose weight for . Thanks to Squeem , I achieved the look I wanted.Love it ! I recommend it !
 Great product for giving you that snug fit ... it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long . I really do like this item , the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing ... so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt , because everyone will know your secret !
 I love it !! Really holds/sucks you in . It does have the rubbery smell , but soak it and wash it . I could n't smell it when on . It does seriously make you sweat !!!
 As soon as I put this on , my posture improved . I always thought I had good posture but this is awesome . The size chart is pretty true to size . I have a 29in . waist and the small is pretty snug on me , but that just means it 's not going anywhere . It does n't roll up or pinch anywhere.I have a fairly short torso so the cincher goes all the way under my bra to a good 3 inches past my bellybutton , so it does n't push the fat up as much as it does down into the top of my pants , so it 's not so noticeable . So far I 've been wearing it for about 3-5 hours a day which is maximum for me right now . I think it takes some getting used too . Also helps the lower back pain I have from being on my feet all day at work . One thing though . It kinda pulls in and bunches up at the waistline and if I wore tighter or thinner clothes , you would probably see it but I wear mostly tshirts and jeans . Also , wearing it does n't make me lose inches at first , it just flattens out the rolls I had and makes my stomach and back look nicer . I still have a 29 in . waist with it on . Maybe it 'll change after a month or so like the rest of the reviews say , but we 'll see . Still a good product .
 First of all , I am 5 ' 9 , 125 lbs , and I do n't really have a tummy per say , just a little bloat . I ordered the small and it fits perfectly . There are two sets of hooks which is n't really shown in the picture , which I love , because if you feel like you want to get a bit tighter , you can just move it over to the next set of hooks.As for the body shaping , it does it perfectly . Once I put it on , I definitely feel like my curves have more definition and it definitely gets rid of any bloat I have and I have a perfect flat tummy once again . I 've found that it 's seamless under some clothes , but not on others . Once tee shirt I have was form fitting , but it did n't show too much . Another shirt was form fitting , and it really showed . I think it depends on the material of what you wear and how it fits on you.There are a few things I 'd like to mention about this product though . I am naturally curvy , and while this gives my curves more definition , it seems to `` roll up '' around the sides . A lot . It kind of makes it fit awkwardly but this might just be because I wear it over camis . -LRB- I have VERY sensitive skin and I do n't want to get a reaction to the rubber . -RRB- The shirt does not bunch up underneath it , but I do n't know if that could be a factor . If anyone as any ideas how to prevent the rolling around the curves , please comment . It fits perfectly other than that.It really helps with posture . It makes you stand up straight and you can feel it right away if you start to slouch . This can cause some problems when you sit though , especially when driving . It 's just very uncomfortable but that feeling passes as soon as I stand up straight again . If you were sitting for a long length of time , I would recommend that you keep this on the looser of the two hooks , as I find that helps somewhat.PROS : Seems to fit true to size , at least for meDoes what it says , flattens your tummy and gives you more definitionGreat posture supportCan wear it under anythingTwo sets of hooks for convenienceCONS : Uncomfortable when sittingDoes not seem to be made for people with natural curvesCan roll around the curves somewhat , but that may just be meCan show under certain clothesI would recommend this item to anyone looking for a good corset , because that 's really what this is , and I would order from this company again . Very pleased with my purchase .
 I am loving this thing ! I 've used other shapewear but this is more than a pair of spanx ! from the moment I put it on , I felt more lady like . My posture is wonderful-you really could n't slouch in this thing if you tried-and my muffin top is GONE ! I do n't find it uncomfortable , it 's like a second skin . It took 2 inches off my waist immediately , how great is that?also , I am not hungry all the time anymore . it makes you feel full . I intend on getting the vest next and using this daily , it 's awesome !!
 am very pleased , it does control the un-necessary rolls :-RRB- . i would highly recommend this item to both men and women . Very good product
 the only problem was that it kind of folds and it does n't make clothes look smooth . other than that it tightens really well
 I 've been shopping for this shapewear for so long and finally was able to get something over my expectations . It 's great , good quality .
 I bought this product after having birth to twins . I had/have major abdominal weakness and this product helped to alleviate the core weakness discomfort . It helps to smooth everything out and provides supportive compression . It does n't magically help you lose weight , but it definately helps to hold everything in the right place .
 SO I have been wearing the Squeem for only 1 and 1/2 days and my waist has already been reduced by 1.5 '' !! which happens to put me back to my pre-pregnant waist size 28 '' ! I 'm so amazed by this product - worth every penny . I bought it for the purpose of helping my waist recover from my pregnancy -LRB- I delivered a Big Baby Boy 9lbs 11oz -RRB- not to make me look skinnier when its on but to actually be skinnier when I take it off -LRB- i.e. I do n't plan to wear forever -RRB- . At 10 weeks postpartum I had my weight back down to 138 -LRB- which is less than I weighed right before I got pregnant -RRB- but ! My waist was still a good 1.5 '' larger -LRB- frustrating ! -RRB- so this product has already done exactly what I hoped for and will probably do more ! I find it rather comfortable for a modern corset which is how I would categorize it . It 's virtually unnoticeable under clothing -LRB- maybe unless you were truly wearing skin tight tops - which if I were you I 'd just save those till you 're ready to stop wearing the squeem -RRB- If your having the same issues as me - especially postpartum I highly recommend this product ! Also I was measuring about 29.5 '' and ordered a small - I feel like this was the right decision for me - it was hard to put on the first time and it does fold some where my waist goes out to the hips because I have bigger sized hips for my size -LRB- 34 '' hips , not bum -RRB- but still looks fine under clothes and this size gives my the right amount of compression on my stomach .
 I LOVE my Squeem but it runs VERY small so make sure you order up at least one size , especially of you 're measurements are on the upper of a size .
 I love this garment . It takes a little getting used to but it is durable and comfortable . Made from a high tech material of cotton and rubber , the garment applies a firm compression to the body with a flexibility that seems to breathe with you . It has light stays , strategically placed within the material and these aid the compression effect of the garment in giving firm shape control for the body and and also in providing good support for the back . Sweating could be a problem but generally the cotton-lining makes for a comfortable fitting against the skin . The makers say it can be worn comfortably for up to ten hours at a time and I find this to be true . Overall , the garment feels good , it 's useful at times and is practical and effective . To my mind , slight rubber odour and possible sweating are outweighed by a high performance . The hooks and eyelets are strong , neatly fixed and stay in place .
 I 've had this on for 6 hours and it is still going . It has n't been hot at all . I 've always been bigger up top than bottom but this thing really gave me a waist . I went from looking like a pencil , to curvy . I went out tonight with it on an received ALOT more attention than i normally do . As far as the rubber smell , i did n't even notice it with my clothes on . I wore a t-shirt between my skin and the Squeem because I have sensitive skin . Uhrm , if you are a big person , i could see how this would n't give you the results you want . I am small . My pants size is a size 3 junoirs , not women . It got rid of my extra pudge . I honestly have no idea where it went . This has made me feel so beautiful . I 've always had self-esteem and this helped . I hugged tons of people today and nobody new i even had it on . a few people thought i had been working out and it was new muscle . I LOVE IT ! & & no , i 'm not being paid by the company to say this stuff . I 'm 17 , in highschool & & super insecure . GET THIS ! you wo n't regret it . :-RRB- -RRB-
 Followed the measurements and ordered a small . I had to suck in of course and stretch it on . The first day I could only wear it for an hour . Each day I wore it a little longer . Within a week I was wearing it 8 hours a day at work . It definitely gives you that hourglass shape you want while it 's on . Once you take it off the shape stays for about half an hour . Not sure how permanent the results are over time . Way more comfortable than a corset . Only con I would say is that I have a short torso so it bunches up some .
 PLEASE GET YOUR SIZE . Great product but if you get it too small the wire sticks you . It definitely pulls you in and makes you look inches smaller.Amazon delivered in 2 days very fast .
 This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have . The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new . It must be washed before wearing . The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat . But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening . The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it 's good for the back as well as the front .
 recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly.hope i could buy it in beige color . could be little cheaper
 Effective . ; -RRB- Just what I need after giving birth.Keeps my body straight and gives me good posture.I will recommend to friends .
 I just had baby and ordered the squeem for post-partum abdominal binding . Its very comfortable and fit perfectly . Its doing a great job getting my stomach down in size . My only issue is that it broke after less than two weeks of wear . I will have to contact the company and get a new one .
 I love , love loved it . As a matter of fact I 'm about to order another size . Really pulls the abodomen inSqueem Magical Lingerie Shapewear , Firm Compression Waist Cincher
 I just got this in the mail Yesterday and I LOVE IT !!!!! I did listen to the previous comment about this item to get the same size as you would your t-shirt -LRB- im a medium -RRB- ann it fits perfectly I wore it that same day i got it and it was comfortable i honestly forgot I was wearing it after the first half hour , Iam 5 ' 0 and I love that the length wasnt too small or super long either , I normally dont write review but I had to for this item it is really good , I have had a waist cincher before and it was my favorite but it tore a little -LRB- like a wire bra would -RRB- so I threw it away and I was iffy on buying a new one since online is hard to tell how the fabric is going to be but this was even better then my original cincher . again I LOVE IT !!!
 I really liked this product , it seems to really help with the slimming down process . At first , I thought I would not be able to fit it but once I sucked it in , I was able to clamp it together and work it out .
 Love this product . I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss . It is true to size .
 I recently put on a few extra pounds after my wedding -LRB- married life must be treating me well -RRB- but still maintained a pretty average build -LRB- 5 ' 7 '' , 135lbs . -RRB- So , I started looking into shapewear just to lose the extra inches off my waist and achieve a more classic hourglass figure . I have purchased other corselette/faja products and have had little success because even in size Small -LRB- and that 's usually the smallest size there is -RRB- they did n't suck in my tummy enough , would bulge or roll in weird places , had an extremely unnatural cinch at the waist only or were plain uncomfortable ... However , this Squeem product is by FAR the best waist cincher I have come across!There is very little pucker or bulges -LRB- only at the small of my back which can not be prevented since I have a very deep curve between my waist and bum , -RRB- the tightness is just right , it 's smooth enough to not show under most of my clothes -LRB- of course , it wo n't hide that well under very thin and fitted clothes -RRB- and my physique - well , that 's the best part - it 's so feminine and sexy . I really love what this waist cincher does for me . I will probably discard of the ones I had before . I bought a size Small which is true to size and accurate according the manufacturer 's sizing chart since I am a dress size 4 . If what the other reviewers say is true , I think within a short time I will size down to an X-Small . I ca n't wait !
 This is GREAT ! No `` overflow '' , `` underflow '' or slipage ! Stays put , very comfortable . It 's like a constant non-threatening hug ! I 'm in love .
 It tucks everything away very nicely . It also makes you sweat a lot in warmer weather . It does show through my dresses and shirts though !
 I really like this ab binder . It does not move and it 's pretty comfy and sucks that loose skin back in after baby . The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that I felt like it was slightly detectable under my clothes bc when I bend my shirt catches in the back . And it may be because I need a smaller size . And I am buying a smaller size but in the vest . I feel like the vest will give me total confidence to wear this until I train my abs to lie flat again . I love Squeem , definitely great products and I have tries others that do n't compare .
 Not bad , I tried it for 10 days and lost about an inch of my waistline . Need to try it longer to see how it goes .
 I just picked up my squeem waist cincher . The quality is great and I love the rubber integration ... I 'm sure there will be minimal slipping or folding when wearing . Here 's the problem I mistakenly listened to the reviews instead of listening to my gut . The reviews said the cincher was true to size ... if u typically wear medium sized tops then buy the medium size cincher . I 'm 5 ' 9 , 165 lbs -LRB- give or take 5lbs -RRB- . So i figured realistically a large would be perfect . Not so ... I could step into this and pull it up to my waist with ease ... ON THE SECOND HOOKS . There was no cinching going on in my waist area or any area for that matter . Now , this is n't a review on the product itself ... I just recommend getting a size smaller than what u usually wear if u want to see any effect whatsoever . If you 're a large then buy medium . With the right size , this waist cincher would be fabulous , so I give it 4 stars until then . Sucks that I live so far -LRB- Jamaica -RRB- cause its going to cost too much to return it .
 I love my squeem ! A little tight at first but I got used to it . I lost 2 inches off my waist in 3 weeks . I love my squeem !!
 I was pleased with my order for this item , however it ran long and large on me and pinched when I sat . Therefore I removed the metal bones out in the front . A good solution for me , I 'm a true size 10 . Maybe I 'll try ordering a medium size at a later date .
 I 've only had the squeem for 2 days but I think it is surprisingly comfortable for what it does . Just thought I would put some points out there that I have found.So I got the XS which I found out is called the Petite . I have a 27 inch waist and all my problem area is in my lower abdomen from having 2 children . I had to pull it on the first time since I could ' t figure how to get the hooks fastened over my loose flab . When I got it on , I thought this is nice and comfortable but my lower tummy still sticks out . So today -LRB- no problem getting it hooked , I guess it stretched out some -RRB- I tried it upside down and it worked much better for my lower area and the top felt much more comfortable to me . But I have strange proportions , I ' v a 33 inch hip and a 36 inch bust . So if you have small hips and all your problem area is in your lower you should try it upside down . Only thing is I wish it was a little longer . Also you ca n't wear it under tight fitting clothes , It really shows .
 This item fits perfectly ; not too big not too small . Presently I am size 10-12 and just under 5 ft. I purchase two sizes -LRB- based on previous experience with other brands -RRB- as some small will fit and some meduims are too big . But I ended up sending the small back because the medium fits perfectly . The only problem I have is because my torso is short it doesnt stay smooth around my back esp , but puckers up , even tho I pull it way down over my hip , so I can not wear it with very close fitting . But this is the best affordable shapewear I have found so far . i wear it 8 - 12 hours a day . Yes , as others have noted the rubber smell is quite obvious .
 I 've only worn this for a day so far , but I love it ! I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago . This really holds you in , its comfortable and I do n't think it shows through your clothes ! I highly recommend !!
 I bought this item because I have a postpartum big belly -LRB- I was 8 in pants and because of my belly I 'm 10 right now -RRB- . I 've used a lot of shapewear and this is the my second favorite -LRB- my first one is Fajate , it squeezes all the fat in -RRB- . This is one of my favorites because it really shapes your body , you feel in control of your tummy -LRB- even though it does n't flatten as desired , maybe because of the flexible rubber -RRB- . I feel this waist cincher is perfect -LRB- it really slims your waist ! -RRB- because I feel this is slimming my figure in a great way ! My tummy is so much better ! I wear it everyday to work and when I take it off I feel a huge difference ! What I do n't like is that I bought a medium size and I wish I 'd buy it small , since I 'm using it at the tightest ... But in a few weeks I 'll buy the small , because I just love it ! Another thing is that while you 're wearing it you remember that you have a waist cincher because of the latex and that makes you put your belly in , amazing exercise to enhance your figure !
 I love it I 'm going to purchase the vest soon . But this thing is awesome fast shipping love it great to wear all day good back support also . I do every thing in it good product .
 I bought this with the hope I would look slimmer . It did that , and more ! I bought a large , and after a week of wear , I am purchasing a medium . I have gotten complements on how much weight I have lost , and I have actually lost weight too . It gives me a shapely figure . I could not be more pleased .
 I love how this product makes me look in my clothes !!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass ! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long . my only complaints are that it is a little too short , so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me , but overall , it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased . i love it and would recommend it to anyone .
 I purchased it to wear after delivery . Just after delivery I put it on , though I could n't button every button . But several days ago I was able to button all buttons , a week later to button second line -LRB- which squeezes you more -RRB- . All in all I wore it for a month day and night . It worked perfect , I have no tummy now . The only thing is I 'm not on tall side , I 'm short , so it was pretty uncomfortable because it was always climbing up and sticking to breasts . Once again if you are on the tall side it will be perfect .
 I bought the waist cincher because i do n't have a waist . My shape is somewhat boxy . While wearing the waist cincher I immediately have a waist and the shape stays for a short time after removing it.Like other reviews said its a little difficult to sit wearing the waist cincher but you get used to it after a couple uses and it does help with your posture . Make sure you choose your top carefully so no lines from the waist cincher show through your top . Be sure to wash your waist cincher upon receiving it because the rubber smell is quite pungent.Overall I am pleased with my purchase and will purchase another one when I am too small for my current one .
 I thought it might work and I was extremely happy after wearing it for one day . I am overweight and have a bad back and do conventions with my business , meaning I have to stand all day on cement . It is a lifesaver and I definitely suggest it to anyone in my condition ... it also makes your figure look MUCH better ! The only time it folds up is when I 'm driving for a while .
 I purchased this item to assist with my postpartum recovery . So far , I have liked wearing it , but it is hard to say whether it has helped with my midsection . I am only 8 weeks post delivery so I 'll have to wait and see . The item does feel comfortable on , as far as shapewear is concerned and I really like how the manufacturer has sewn in what looks like some flexible boning so that the garment bends with you . I would purchase this item again in a smaller size .
 I bought this squeem to help me get my post-pregnancy stomach and waist back . I did n't count on the excellent back support this gives . i am very pleased with this product ! The only thing I do n't like about it is the rubber smell !
 Just got my new `` Squeem '' today ! All I can say is WOW ! I thought I had to wait until I lost weight to fit into a lot of my clothing , but with this `` Squeem '' , they now fit perfectly and gives me that -LRB- so wanted -RRB- hourglass figure . Thought I needed a large , since I have a huge waist -LRB- 33 inches for a 5 foot girl -RRB- , but I got the medium , which fits just right using the 2nd row of hooks . I may soon need a small if what they say is true about the weight loss . It is VERY comfortable and it gives me great posture . I wear corsets sometimes , so it may take a bit for some of you to get used to it . The boning areas do get wrinkled after each use , so my suggestion is to lay it flat and gently pull on each boning section . It will take the wrinkles out . I think overall it 's going to look a bit wrinkled because it 's being stretched out , but when you 're wearing it , it should look smooth . I wear mine out in regular clothing -LRB- not too thin or tight since you can see the hooks -RRB- and it makes me feel like an old time pin up girl since it cinches your waist and lifts your boobies . -LRB- hehe ! -RRB- You 'll also find out that it restricts you from eating a lot during meals -LRB- good thing for me -RRB- . This shapewear is very similar to tight lacing , so you may want to change your diet , like eat 5-6 small meals a day ... of course if you are serious about wearing the `` Squeem '' all day / night . I 'm so overjoyed with this product . It is a HUGE MIRACLE with a little price tag ! BUY IT !!! : -RRB-
 Ladies this is a must have if you need to loose 2-4in instantlythis is my second squeem an i love them to death.i look abosolutly marvelious in my dresses and tops.ladies GET ONE OF THESE ITS WORTH YOUR MONEY
 First I must say , I was shocked at how fast the item came !!! Had it within a few days !! Will for sure save this dealer for future !! Now as for the product ... I LOVE it , this is my 2nd one ! The first one I ordered an XL -LRB- I wear 14-16 size jeans -RRB- within a week ... I noticed my pants were looser , I have had back problems ... it helps my back a lot !!! So , I had to order it in a size L. I will say , when you first get any one these and go to put it on , you WILL THINK `` OMG , this is not going to fit !! '' But , once you learn the trick to put it on ... you will be SO HAPPY THAT YOU DID !!! Just snapping it up is the trick , it says to start at bottom and snap up.My advice , I snap about 2 at the top then move to snapping at the bottom . You normally would think that you need to snap it , in the area it is going to lay ... -LRB- THIS IS THE RICK !! -RRB- You do not ... I pull the bottom up some -LRB- because I have a big chest , seeing the bottom where it 's going to be would be hard !! -RRB- pull it up , snap some and move it down your waist as you snap a few at a time !! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT !!! Another issue ... I 'm looking into now is the phone number that comes in the box to call for caring instructions , is not the right number ! You have to wash it correctly as to save the material for the best weight lose !! So , I 'm in search for number now !!
 Have 2-3 of these in different colors and sizes and wear them for two reasons ... to minimize my waist & for back support without bulges under clothing . Works great for both purposes and very comfortable without binding . Helps with my posture as well !
 It 's an amazing product ! I 'm 5 ' 3 so it digs just a little in my thighs but if you adjust the the rods up towards your back it wo n't hurt at all . It makes you instantly slim . It is a little hard to eat in or drive in but it 's worth it . BEST slimming product on the planet . The seller was AWESOME it came 4 days before the estimated delivery date . It was the exact product that was listed online . Overall I would recommend this to anyone and everyone !
 I 've been using squeem waist clincher for years . This product never rolls up and holds you in very nicely . Also this product aid in weightloss .
 I discovered these whilst on a trip to South America , after having some lipo procedures . They were highly recommended by the post-treatment spa at my surgeon 's clinic.After having worn them during the 6 week recovery time , I was hooked ! I can not say enough about the whole line of Squeem - these things are nothing short of BRILLIANT!I especially love the vest . Much more va-va-voom than spanx !!
 I actually enjoy wearing this ! It is comfortable , and I love the feeling of support it gives . Worth every penny .
 I have tried a lot of different shapers , but nothing has worked like this Squeem waist cincher . It really stays in place , keeps its shape -LRB- even when sitting -RRB- , great back support , and really sucks you in throughout your abdomen . I 've been wearing it for a few months and is in just as great shape as the day I bought it . The rubber smell dissipates and is not offensive , even at the beginning , and the cincher itself is worth every penny . It 's a great buy !
 I have various articles of shapewear clothing -LRB- Spanx -RRB- and just have n't gotten the support/shape that I want . I started wondering if there were modern-day girdles or corsets and came across the Squeem Waist Cincher . After reading all the great reviews I decided to try it and am glad I did . It REALLY smooths the lumps and bumps around your middle ; I 'm a classic `` apple '' shape and this is where I carry all my weight . I 'm on day 3 of wearing it and it is quite comfortable ; the only place of discomfort is under my breasts , because I am short-waisted . I 'm very happy with this purchase and am looking forward to spring/summer to wear it under dresses .
 I bought this product to slim my waist and I really did n't have big expectations for it at all . I figured I 'd wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape . I 've been wearing it for a month already and I 've seen my waist go down 2 inches ! I wear it all day at work from 7:00 till about 3:00 . It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small . I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore -LRB- hence the 4 star rating -RRB- . I 'm very happy with this product for the price . It works better than Spanx .
 My wife purchased this after she had a tummy tuck done . She says it has been very helpful and she has no complaints . The doctor has told her her healing has been great with no complications or negatives . Its helpful in reducing swelling and also keeps her posture straight .
 This is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses . It also offers great support for your back . It is perfect for everyday wear .
 The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it 's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it would n't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I 'll get two of them
 Overall a good product . It will give your body shape . It will get rid of muffin top and smooth out those love handles to make you look flawless ! However , you ca n't wear it under anything that is clingy or the seams will show . Causes the WORST back pain when worn morn than a short period of time or with lots of movement . Great product , just needs some tweeking to reduce the back pain issue .
 Fantastic product , especially if you have a long torso . I 'm 5 `` 2 and the boning does rub on the tops of my legs.They need a petite option .
 I 'm extremely impressed with this waist cincher . I had a bridesmaid dress that I had to fit into that was about 2.5 inches too small ... I was just about ready to pay over $ 50 for alterations which would have made the dress different than the other bridesmaids ... and then this came in the mail ! What a lifesaver ! I contacted the tailor quickly and tried on the dress again using the squeem and it fit perfectly . I probably wo n't use this long term , and I ca n't imagine using it over diet and exercise for weight loss , but in a pinch , it works great .
 I love the squeem !!! This is my second one moving down from a med to a small . It helps trim off your waist but I am exercising as well .
 I really liked the Squeem . I 'm a petite person , but have some love handles that I need to hide when I 'm wearing tight clothes . The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when it 's tight .
 This works really well . I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months post-partum . It 's still a bit separated but this definitely helped . I wish I knew about it sooner . It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it . Great to wear during exercise , again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward . Also , it looks hot ! And sometimes I wear it out . I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time . Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur . 27 '' waist before pregnancy , 30 '' waist when I bought a size medium , 28 '' now , and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted ...
 I loved this product . It does exactly what it says it should , and best of all it doesnt ride up or down like many other versions of this same product .
 I absolutley love the squeem . It really does provide the firmest hold of practically all waist cinchers I have ever tried . I my friends have dubbed me the `` girdle queen '' . I wear a size 10 so a medium was perfect .
 This review is based on a month of use where I lost enough inches to need the next size down . I 'm basing my feedback on this item for its role in helping to me to gain that hourglass look both when I 'm wearing it and when I 'm not.I 'm short , only 5 ' 3 '' so I am withholding a star due to the fact that it does n't fit quite right at the bottom . Other than that I 'm thrilled with the product . I 've been in a two year struggle with weight loss after an illness that had me immobile or nearly so for long periods of time , on a medication that increased my appetite . After losing over 100 pounds , I 'm now closing in my college weight.Up until this point , I 'd mostly been increasing my general activity and changing my eating style . Right now I 'm on a cross between Atkins and the 3 hour diet . It was working well as far as weight loss but I was n't quite the shape I wanted . I 'm still not strong enough for the level of exercise I 'd like to get to , so I got the Squeem waist cincher , after wanting it for two years.The day I first put it on was a struggle , it was a little tight . But the difference under my clothes was dramatic , and two ladies noticed the change immediately , thinking I 'd lost weight . I started wearing it every day for 8 hours . The next week , I put it on then pulled out my `` skinny '' jeans just for fun , as they were a size too small the day I bought the girdle . I slid them on easily , without laying down - ladies you know what I mean . I put a summer shirt on over it and you could n't tell I had the cincher on.It 's now just about a month later , and I 'm buying the next size down . I 'm thinking it might be better for those of us who are short to get either the vest or the body-suit version : Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear , Firm Compression , Cotton & Rubber , Short-Vest , Nude , 2 XLLadies , if you need a little extra help AND want to shape your body , try this . I have my hourglass figure back for the first time since Before I was sick . I 'm more confident and happier because of this product.PS - The illness I 'm recovering from affected my spine and this thing gives great support there too .
 this shape wear is great , does not roll down and does make u look better plus gave me support , and ur tummy area looks great in jeans or in any clothes , i also bought 4 my daughter 2 wear it under her prom dress it really made her look more straighter and didnt show her love handles , she felt tight when she bought dress and when she put it on , it took couple of inches of her , im please with this product , also buy the next size up if u are a lg go for x-large , they r tight so dont get smaller or u have a very hard time to get in , also use it for every day to lose inches of body , but needs to be wash and let it air dry , causes a rubbery odor as if u sweat alot , i give it a 5 star , its better than try 2 lose pounds fast , i liked it !
 I read the reviews for this product and purchased . I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake . I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably . For me if I do n't feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I do n't feel it 's working . The thing I like the most about it is that 's it 's strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top . Body hugging tops excluded , of course . I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town .
 This product was reccomended by my 29yr old grandaughter , my middle section is completely out of control ever since I started taking insulin , and I have tried many foundations , this one is more than that and believe it or not it is more comforable , and that was really a surprise , your back feel better , you look better in your clothes , the first day I wore mine to work my co-worker asked `` are you loosing weight '' I simply said `` no I 'm not '' . My goal is to lose 40lbs , but until I get there Squeem will be my best friend , and as soon as my budget allows , I will be ordering the cream and the other Squeem that fit over the arms.GREAT PRODUCT !!

 I bought this product because it promised to help improve bad posture and it does . Even when I am not wearing it I find myself sitting more erect than I used to . I love it !
 which is what I need . make sure you do n't have it too far down though because when you sit down it will poke your thighs .
 I was told about Squeem by a friend of mine and I had to have it . This works better than i could have imagined ! It takes a little while to get used to the feeling of it , but it smoothes and slims in all the right places & also improves your posture -LRB- added bonus ! -RRB- I have been wearing Spanx for a long time , but now that I 've tried Squeem , it will be the only shapewear I wear ! i love it !!
 This cincher really works ... but it can be uncomfortable when worn on the plain skinfor too long ... I put it on with a tshirt under and it feels much better !
 This is by far the best cincher I have ever owned ! I had a baby a few months ago and I still have the donut like excess skin around my waist and hips . Despite being back to my pre-pregnancy weight , I still could n't fit in my regular clothes . The first time I put it on I could barely clasp it close , but after a few uses , it became very comfortable . It gives me a nice waistline and it helps me to eat less because of the pressure . The only problem is that if you have back fat , it pushes it up and it spills where your bra hits . That 's happens to me so I wear it with loose tops .
 I have 19 month old twins and have suffered from severe diastis recti since they were born at 38 weeks and 3 days . I am 5 ' 1 and weigh 112 pounds but I still look 4 months pregnant in the stomach . I have always worn shapewear , specifically assets by Spanks sold at Target . But every month or so I have to purchase another one because they do n't hold my stomach in as tight as when I bought it . When I got the squeem it smelt a bit like a rubber tire and it took a bit of work to get it on but let me tell you I had the flatest stomach ever ! Even better than what the spanks do for me . It is very comfortable to wear , and I wore it for an entire day the first time I got but that 's because I wear shapewear everyday-all day . But the package says to slowly increase the time which I could understand if you do n't wear shapewear . The only negative I saw from it was by the end of the day when you take it off I could see curves throughout it from when I was sitting at my desk - so it did n't keep its total smooth silioutte it had when I got it . I have only woren it once so far but I will keep this one for special occassions - and would absolutely buy another one . I wore it under a thinner tighter top and you could n't see it through the top . A great buy !
 This is a great item for anyone wanting an hourglass waist . I purchased this item after having lipo of my midsection . I needed a garment that would come down far enough to compress my lower belly and this item is perfect . I will wear this item after I heal from my surgery . I love the fact that the item ran true to size on the size chart , it is comfortable to wear and the black looks sexy enough that if anyone should see your squeem it looks like a corset ! I am going to purchase the squeem vest next and have recommended this garment to several friends .
 Just what I needed to get me headed back toward my pre-pregnancy waist . Bought an XL and probably could have fit into the large . Looking to down size soon !
 Great fit . Does exactly what it is suppose to . Plan to buy more in different colors . Sent in good order .
 After having my baby I need sometime tighten up my abdomen . This work great when I want to wear a tight dress to a party , it hides my fatty love handle and big fat abs from just giving birth to a baby . I believe it also tighten up my abs.The thing I do n't like about it is that it can be very uncomfortable when you sit . It tend to squeeze the life out of you so you ca n't really wear it for a long period of time .
 It 's a catch 22 , I think . In order for it to work well , it has to be tight . Because it 's so tight , it can get uncomfortable . I got it as a compression garment after having abdominal separation after giving birth . The lump in my abdomen was not visible at all and my clothes looked good on me . It gives great support to my back and works day after day . That said , it will get uncomfortable after several hours . I still would recommend it over other products that are less tight but stretch out easily and stop working as well .
 Really Helps shape makes your sit up straight i I do n't like the smell when you first get it . My Friend noticed right away that something was different
 About 1 month ago I bought the XL squeem -LRB- because that is the size I was -RRB- and received rave reviews !! After wearing for only one month , I am now purchasing the L squeem
 I ordered this to wear after my pregnancy to help with diastasis -LRB- the separation of stomach muscles post baby -RRB- . My diastasis was 4 fingers -LRB- very big -RRB- . After wearing the Squeem for 2 weeks it was 2 fingers ! This product is comfortable and provides wonderful support for after baby . It also helped me to look slimmer almost right away . It does not show underneath clothing , so that is also a bonus . The only thing that I would emphasize is that you need to get the right size and always estimate larger . I ordered two of these and the smaller one was not nearly as comfortable . All around this is a wonderful product !!
 It was everything it was advertised to be . I 'm going to get another one !!! Got so many compliments at the party that I wore it to . Made my outfit look really great !!
 This works wonders ! So pleased w/my selection ! It came in 24hrs no lie ! I have never ordered something & received it over night ! May buy another one to workout in . Love love love this item . : -RRB-
 this product is awesome . it hide all your secrets . I would recommend this product to all women and men . I will buy product again .
 I really like this squeem . It is comfortable and effective ! I also like that it is lined with cotton so it is soft to the skin .
 Thought this was not going to fit because I am a 44 &#34; currently and I only ordered XL . . Like it very much
 This actually does what it says it will . I like how it provides compression so bulges do n't show but also contributes to weight loss by making me feel full faster . I eat so much less while wearing this product . I highly recommend this product .
 I love it , and it really smooths the lines - only thing is if you have back fat , it is accentuated ; -RRB-
 Other than 10 inches be too long for me according with the measurements everything else is fineThanksMarvely C
 I have tried many body girdles and none of them truly worked . I would always get the bulge in the center of my tummy . I am now 4 weeks postpartum and when i wear the squeem you ca n't tell that i just had a baby . there is no bulge . and my back feels great . I love the material that it is made of . It gives enough slack so that you can snap it and keep it tight . I would and have recommended this product . I am hooked !!!
 I had a baby 3 months ago . I bought it because I had a couple of Shapewear Torsette Body Briefer in different sizes , but I wanted something only for my belly and this one works very well . I bought it in medium and I think I 'll buy another one but in small very soon : -RRB-
 After reading all the other reviews and not really satisfied with much else I saw online , I decided to go with Squeem 's product.Day 1 was a little uncomfortable to wear but only for a few hours.After the 1st day , I wore it every other day to work and I tell you it really started showing . My waist gradually dropped by an inch and everyone could tell the difference . I noticed a difference in the 2nd week of use.Ofcourse , I need to add here that I 'd work out at least 3 times a week in addition to this , so dont just buy this and not work out.Definitely a good buy !
 After having my second child via C-Section I needed something to help &#34; squeeze &#34; me back into shape . This little wonder did everything it could have for me and I will always love it =-RRB- I am actually getting ready to buy another one in a smaller size because the one I am using currently is starting to get big on me =-RRB- With a committed exercise schedule and wearing this little buddy I was able to jump start my body back into its healthy beautiful self ! I recommend to all women out there to just give it a chance ! It is sooo worth money and best thing about it is that is a very strong and durable material as well ; so it will last you some time = -RRB-
 Best product of its kind ! It trains your muscles & provides excellent support & after getting used to wearing it , it can easily be worn under clothing all day or night without discomfort . It supported me even during a rigorous workout in the gym lasting 2-3hrs through aerobic activities as well as weight training . Under evening dresses it gives the curves women look for to attain that beautiful hourglass shape . Choose the sizes according to your measurements & as you reshape your waistline , you may try ordering the next size down for an even lovelier shape !
 This was the one I wanted for quite sometime . The rubber is on the outside and cotton inside . It has two hook and eye settings for adjusting the fit . I wear it to bed and wake up smaller in the waist . It is definitely tight so I ca n't wear it all day like some of my other shapewear . But this one is well made and will last quite a while I am sure . Well worth the price for the quality and design .
 So I bought this because I work at home and I sit and write on my computer all day . I have terrible posture and end up with horrible knots in my shoulders and myofascial pain . At the end of the day , I often have to massage my trigger points to get to sleep.I decided to buy this when it went on sale because it got such good reviews . I think it might be really helping me when I wear it . I ca n't slump the way I normally would because I end up not being able to breathe comfortably if I do n't sit up straight . However , I 'm training myself to wear it for longer and longer periods of time . I 'm up to about 3 hours.The only drawback of this cincher is that it seems not to be made for petite women ? I am 5 foot 2 inches and wear a size small . Is my torso a little too short ? Because the cincher bunches and wrinkles at the waist and no amount of pulling will straighten it out . It 's not so bunched that you can see it under my clothes , but it 's definitely not a perfectly smooth fit like my other waist cincher that I use under certain dresses . Nonetheless , it 's still a good buy and I hope long term use will help me train my posture and avoid all that neck pain I have .
 First , let me say I am reviewing this item based on what I was expecting it to do ; which was 1 . -RRB- take in my after birth belly , 2 -RRB- give me the `` hourglass '' look , and 3 -RRB- take away `` back roles '' . This item did all the above !!! If you have never wore a shaper , getting to being `` squeezed '' in , will come with time . It can appear uncomfortable , but with time you will get use to it and learn to appreciate the work it is doing for you behind the scenes . I also love how this has the two different sizes on it , meaning , you can use the first or second row of latches ! I will do a follow up along with my size after a month of wearing this , but am in love and will buy more from this line . P.S. I own probably every brand and can say this one far surpasses them with quality , etc. . Oh yeah , about the sizing order true to what you wear . I right now am a size 12 , 174 pounds , 5 ' 6 height and I ordered a large . As I go down , I will use the second row , then go to medium . Do not order a smaller size , it will take you in . Hope this helps
 I had my twins 8 days ago , and bought a size large squeem to accommodate my bigger mid-section -LRB- I am normally a size small in regular clothes -RRB- . After I put on the squeem , I could fit into my pre-pregnancy shirts !! No one can believe I had two babies less than 2 weeks ago !
 Believe it or not , this product is rather comfortable and has felt nice on my sciatica . When I reviewed their sizing , their chart put me into a medium . But , since most of my weight issue is in my belly , I opted to go a size larger . This proved to be a very good idea , and I am quite comfortable in the larger size . I would have never gotten into the size the chart put me in .
 I 've been wearing this cincher to reshape my waist . I did a series of detoxing/skin toning/reshaping body wraps and afterwards I would wear the cincher home and all night . It became a habit for me to wear it to bed every night . I have to tell you over the last 5 months it has changed my shape -- not drastically , but i just look better -LRB- I 've been finished with the wraps for about 7 weeks -RRB- . I eat well and exercise 3-4 times a week but have n't lost any weight -LRB- I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh 157 lbs -RRB- , yet people constantly ask me if I have -- it 's the cincher -LRB- and the ab/oblique work and clean diet -RRB- . It 's given me more of an hour glass than I 've had in a long time -LRB- I 'm 52 -RRB- . I started with the medium and bought a small too , thinking I could quickly go a size down . I was wrong and it took me awhile , but the point is I got there . I could n't even get the small fastened the first time I tried so I put it in the corner and just wore the medium until one day I decided to try the small again . Well , it 's tight but it 's on ! The thing is , I only wear this at night for reshaping ; during the day I go without because I wear it tight and it would be obvious to everyone I had something on . For me it 's about getting to a better natural look so that when I wear my clothes during the day , I feel and look better in them without having to wear a support garment . This cincher has been worth every penny I paid for it and I 'm curious to see what happens to my waist after 5 more months of wear -- i wonder if i 'll get to the second hook on the small ?!
 I was doubtful about what size to order , but fortunately I ordered the correct size . I thought the following size chart would be helpful , since I did n't find it myself anywhere in the description
 Hi all , I just got my squeem in the mail today and I 'm super excited ! Im wearing it now ! I 'm 5 ' 6 and overweight -LRB- not obese -RRB- , gained a lot of weight from a medical condition so I thought this product would be perfect for me.I 'm really impressed by how long it is . It goes from under your boobs -LRB- and thus , over your back-fat -RRB- right down to your crouch . It makes me feel taller because you have to maintain good posture while you wear it . I 'm really excited about that . I 've been wearing it for a few hours now , normally my back would be hurting by now - BUT IT IS N'T ! The heat is amazing . I think it will also be great for menstrual cramps.I wear a 32 inche in jeans , but I ordered the large instead of the medium . With the large , I had a hard time putting it on . I had to have someone else hold it together so I could hook it in.I wore it while eating lunch today and it was great ! It did n't make my appetite leave , but when I was full - that was it ! No more eating!I have n't taken it off as yet and I 'm excited to see how what my results will be . It 's really comfortable , I feel like I 'll have no problem wearing it to work and school and maybe even while sleeping . At first , it was hard to breathe for a few minutes , but it was much better after I adjusted . It has given my mid-section a beautiful hour-shape look to it.I 'm so excited to see results !!!! The only downfall to this product so far is the price . I paid $ 68 with shipping and handling -LRB- Canada -RRB- . If you ca n't afford it , ask people who care about you pitch in to help you pay for it , because its worth it . Not just for the aesthetic value -LRB- makes your tummy smaller -RRB- but the heat and posture aspect of it . I have lower back pain , from a car accident and normally I can not sit for very long . But I have been with this thing on.If the money is too much - try to buy a used one . I saw a used one on this website for $ 29 . I think I 'll do that when it comes down to get a smaller size.Good luck ladies !!
 I bought 5 different brands since I had my second baby 4 months ago , and I am finally happy ! Great product . Does what it needs to do ! Will buy more .
 I bought my squeem about a 1 1/2 years ago . It is THEE best cincher that I have ever had . It actually holds me in ; whereas , most cincher would hold but would n't reshape my body like this one . First time wear was uncomfortable like most said and it did have a smell as another user wrote . but that all wears away quickly.Anyway , I purchased three so that I could alternate and wear everyday of the weeek . I 've worn all three out . . So here 's the news on long term everyday usage . The metal rods ripped through the slots . . Kind of like a cheap bra does when the wiring comes out of the bra . From your body rubbing against the fabric daily , the fabric slots where the wiring is ... wore thin.After about 6 months the first slot was no longer tight . I moved on the the second row of hooks to keep it tight . After about a year the second slot were no longer tight ... so since its rubber I started putting it in the dryer after washing to shrink it . This still works ... but then I noticed after about a year , shortly after the rods came out , that the bottom began to curl under ... weird . . causing a bulge around my lower waist and making it difficult to wear low rise pants or semi-short tops -LRB- tops that stops rite at the top of the pants when you sit down -RRB- Because the cincher would roll and pull up my shirt , it will then pull out of the top of my pants and over to the top of my pants pushing my shirt up even more and exposing itself to the world . embarrassing . . This is when you know that you 've worn our your cincher and it 's time for another.Which brings me to the current . I 've purchased a new one but I still grab my old ones because they are extremely comfortable . So whenever I can wear an outfit that will conceal the cincher I reach for my old worn out ones . . They are just so comfortable and the new one ... I 'd have to break in alllll over again . Did I get my moneys worth . . Heck Yes and yours too . . LOL !! It 's a great buy . . but the hooks does show through thin clothing like t-shirts and sleek dresses.Hope this helps you .
 Got this so I could start performing again -LRB- drag queen -RRB- and have put on a few pounds around the mid area , I did n't want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy . Had to have a friend help me put it on at first but wore it all day then half way through the day we went to the second latch and gave me the form I needed to fit back into my outfits , Works great and like they say pain is beauty , and this is so worth it .
 This is a fantastic piece of shapewear . I am a size 14 and the large fits me very well . The clasps are very durable and the whole thing stays put on your torso and will really get rid of your belly . After a few hours of being on you will be sweating as it is made out of rubber . This may sound like a bad thing but its not because that is the point ! Sweating is good for weightloss ! I must point out that with some tops or dresses you may see the cincher peaking out under your armpit . I solved that problem by pulling the cincher lower on my body.The cincher works well and really helps me have a girlish figure . You will not be dissapointed .
 I waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing , trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone !
 It really works ! I am in love . I was trying to get my pre-pregnancy 21 in waist back for 10 months now . I got to 23in and kind of got stuck there . With Squeem I went from 23 in waist to 21in in just 2 minutes ! Start hooking it from the top , much easier . Buy it ! You wo n't regret !
 I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that was n't elastic based . Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased . The hooks do take a while , but once they are all done , the waist cincher does what it says it will do . The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about . It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms . So I ca n't wear this with a top that is clingy . Can only wear with looser fitting shirts . Oh well , nothing is perfect .
 Using this shapewear as a binder postpartum . I researched many binders and Squeem came up several times and with exceptionally better reviews than the Belly Bandit . Is as comfortable as it can get for a binding device and helps support my back as well as compress `` after baby belly '' . It stays put and provides comfortable compression without bunching , rolling or creasing -LRB- which was a common problem among reviews of other binder-type products -RRB- . I am happy to see that there are two rows of hook and eye latches so will not have to buy another one right away . Would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a postpartum body restorer :-RRB- Will definitely utilize their other products in the future when looking for comfortable shapewear .
 This product was just what I was hoping for , and I had no problem with shipping . I highly recommend this product .
 `` Package arrived before the estimated date , and actually was delivered the same day as another item ordered from another seller which was sent 2nd-day air on the same day ! Way to go Bealls ! The pants fit fine , right colors , right size , so that 's what counts . ''
 Good communication and super-fast shipping ! Item arrived exactly as described -LRB- I am actually wearing them right now ... -RRB- . I have never had a better online purchasing experience . Thanks a million !
 These are great pants . They are really comfortable and easy to care for . I 'm saving money too because I do n't have to take these to the dry cleaners . I love the `` Individual Fit '' waste band . Who would n't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size .
 These pants are really great . They fit well and rarely wrinkle . I like that they are really classic - I can wear them at the office and then I can wear them if I go out later in the evening as well . I have owned a lot of Docker 's pants and they all last extremely well .
 This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size -LRB- inseam -RRB- ranges than other Dockers products . And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs .
 We had a hard time finding Dockers in 29x30 . This place had them , and they fit great . Shipping was quick . We would buy from again.Recommended !!
 The Dockers `` individual fit '' system works well , in that one can get by without `` odd '' waist sizes like 33 , 35 , etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to . These pants are very durable , and still look presentable after washing and machine drying . An ironing every so often would probably be useful for `` business casual '' . A good value .
 I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants . The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores . I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length . The delivery was quick -LRB- especially during Christmas -RRB- and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose .
 The pants were just what I was looking for and the seller , Beals Florida was prompt and courteous .
 Ok so these are great pants . Come on guys . They are pleated . Even though the stores sell pleated pants does n't mean you should be wearing them.The only thing the pleats do is add bulk to the waist line area and make you look fat or fatter.Just get the flat front Dockers and do all of us a favor .
 I bought these for my father who is 6 ' 5 '' for father 's day , in black -LCB- 36x36 -RCB- . They are excellent quality , have a great fit , and look perfect on him . Great range of sizes !
 I really like these pants . They fit and are a little stretchy in the waist . It is just enough to make up for some of the mid-life expansion my body is going through . I bet it will work for you too !
 I bought these pants for my husband for work and he loves them . They wash well and still look good !
 I did not pay extra for shipping and thought I might regret it . I received my son 's pants within 3 days !!! Awesome !!
 It 's tough to beat Dockers for casual pants - good looks and a good fit .
 very happy with the look and fit . the fabric feel is great , do n't even think of them as `` khakis '' .
 The pants are very soft and comfortable . The color holds up fairly well , but I do wish the darker colors held better . I do recommend them .
 To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers , but not here . These are real Dockers slacks with real quality . These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price . I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section . Pleats seem to disguise that nicely . I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well , and these are true Dockers.CA Luster
 Product arrive well ahead of schedule , met expectations , and price was better than local retail .
 received the pants when you said . they fit . i am pleased with the purchase and the delivery
 I absolutely love these -LRB- white -RRB- Dockers pants ! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton . For summer wear , you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen , DKNY , Pierre Cardin , Geoffrey Beene , Stafford or other such brand . The `` individual-fit '' waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort .
 I hate shopping anywhere but online . Pant sizes , however , tend to be so irregular that I 've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl 's -LRB- or Walmart , if it 's closer -RRB- . Finally , a solution
 Pants fit real nice . They have the individual fit waistband that is real nice . No complaints so far .
 This is the second time I have bought this jacket . I wore the first one out ! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman . I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size . This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old .

 Such a cool check book cover ! Seems very durable and will last a long time . Very roomy , yet slim enough to fit in my little purse ! Excellent price and very prompt shipping . A definate converstion piece .
 I earlier wrote that I did not receive these as ordered , but the seller immediately contacted me and sent this item quickly . Great service ! The look is fun and sexy -- these are cut REALLY low . They will probably reveal a bit of butt cleavage , but my girlfriend and I really like the different look and feel of these quality panties . I knocked off one star because they run a bit small ; order a size up if in doubt .

 I must tell anyone who wears these stockings ... I wear them everyday ... thigh highs ... you need to get the Jobst `` It Stays '' roll on body fixative and just put a couple of dots around your legs at the top of where the stockings will be ... they WILL NOT ROLL DOWN ... They stay put ALL day for me . I would n't even put them on with out it .

 More visually interesting than plain white , and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton . But please do n't wear them with sandals , they are n't that visually interesting!The bottom black part is thicker , but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use ... you know what I mean ... thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear.The uppers , the white and colored part are thin , stretchy and breathable , flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no-shows if you choose .

 I received the size I ordered and they fit perfectly . Normally , I am unsure when it comes to children clothes , but I am pleased with these pants .
 I ordered these for my five year old in size 6 . They are pretty decent pants but just one addition would make these pants a five , if they added the adjustable waist band feature that most of the pants her size have -LRB- the one with stretch and a button inside the waist band -RRB- . Other than this one suggestion they wash and wear well .

 The material and workmanship is excellent , the `` plastic '' zipper pulls are n't good.They broke the first time used and I replaced them with metal ones . Could use a better quality for these , otherwise very useful product .
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 very happy with the look and fit . the fabric feel is great , do n't even think of them as `` khakis '' .

 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a
 excellent protection for aching legs . i wear them under my scrubs or with dress clothes for work . i am a medical student and by the end of the day my legs are normally hurting in a million & one places . these really help .

 They are definitely a man 's pair of jeans . Could n't imagine they would be more stiff and plain then when I tried them on . Good working jeans now .
 I love the fit and feel of these jeans . Very comfortable and consistent sizing . Never any problems with shrinking when washed .
 I have worn nothing but Levi 's slim fit for many , many years and the decided to discontinue manufacturing them . I looked at several other brands but the Wranglers seemed to have both the fit and color I wanted . I am very pleased with the fit , the look and price . Good bye Levi .
 This style and the size my husband needs has not been available in our local stores . I was able to find what I needed quickly online and the shipping was very prompt . I would have given it five stars but he has n't had time to try them on yet so I ca n't give a perfect score .
 For price , quality and appearence ... Ya ' ca n't beat Wranglers . I need the 33 '' waist and ca n't find it in local stores but here ... no problems . Good product !!!
 What else can I say ? They fit the skinny guy so much better than regular fit and forget relaxed fit ! My husband loves them too . They last . They 're jeans .
 my wife loves them the fit and the feel of them , I love them too .
 These are very sexy sheer stockings . Berkshire is a favorite brand of mine and will be buying more of these in the future .
 She LOVES them and so do I . The proof is in the pudding as they say and they mean it too . Thanks , Robert .
 You need a garter belt for these , and the lace at the top is well reinforced for the purpose . I have worn these a few times without any snags , runs or tears , even on the lace . They have stood up to my vintage metal garters , as well as the weaker modern plastic fasteners.These are great , wash easily and feel so silky .
 They fit nice . They do not cling to the top of your thigh causing that ugly roll like some other thigh highs do . You need to wear garters , but that is why I bought them . Very nice !
 Loved these . I ordered black ones and theyre very sexy looking . No big elastic bands at top so these are perfect for a garter belt . They have beautiful lace at the top . I wanted them longer so 1 size larger fitted me perfectedly . . liked them so well I bought 2 more pair .
 Was looking for thigh highs to wear with a garter belt , and these work perfectly . I wish they were slightly more sheer , but they still look nice . They seem to be good quality , but I have only tried them on so far .
 The lace at the top is plenty sturdy for use with a garter belt . Nice quality stockings with a silky feel .

 I am 5 ' 5 '' and about 160 lbs . I got the size Queen 1 because of the reviews saying to get a size up since they cut into your thigh . I am wearing these with a garter belt under a dress so I needed them to fit comfortably . I got nude , and I am very pale and the color works . They are n't too shiny either . This size is supposed to fit up to 225 lbs and 5 ' 6 '' and they fit pretty well on my thigh but the lace band sits pretty low . It starts just a few inches above my knee , so keep that in mind . You will need adjustable garter straps and a knee length dress . I ca n't wait to try these on with my garter and dress !
 Berkshire stockings are the best ! Very well made and durable - they do n't run the minute you put them on like a lot of brands do . And , my legs look very sexy in them according to my significant other - they are silky smooth . `` City Beige '' is a good , all-around color . I 've worn them to work with my high heels and received numerous comments from the guys . Recommend them highly - I 'll buy more !
 I bought these to go with my undergarments for my wedding day , I received these the day before the event and loved them , they were super comfy and looked amazing on . The only downside to any stockings I suppose is when I took my shoes off for 12 minutes for our first dance when I went to put them back on the bottom of the sole on the right foot was tore - was n't prior to . For the price it 's a great deal and works great with a garter-belt .
 They were really soft and great quality . No defects -LRB- which is always nice lol -RRB- . The fiance and I both loved them .
 These are simply gorgeous and they feel like a high end product , very high quality ! Beautiful lace ! I love these thigh highs hosiery !
 I bought my wife these stockings and she loves them , as she always wears stockings and garterbelts , and her job requires her to wear nylons with a skirt or a dress , in all of her other stockings she really likes these the best , as they do come up somewhat high on her legs and she can wear wear her short skirts with them and does not have to worry about flashing her stocking tops.she has added a few more pair to her collection , as she has over 100 pair from around the world , and she always say , s a real woman always wear stockings no matter how hot the weather is , and I have to say I enjoy her love of stockings
 I hate the modern day thigh highs with the silicone bands that hold them up on your thigh . These stockings do not have them in the lace trim . A garter belt is required or garter straps on your favorite bustier . Gives you that sexy garter style without the unsightly bulging and uncomfortable pinching .
 Hi . I ordered a whole selection of stockings from diverse makers , just in case , and these were the classiest as well as the most sheer . They do n't cut into your upper thighs , they only have a hint of stick-um at the top , and so you really CAN clip them into garter belts -- the whole point!The other stockings were thick , more sweaterish than silkish , and generally unsexy as well as hampered with that big fat band of stay-up rubber at the top . Ick . I plan to go back to this company and get a whole cross-section of colors.Oh , I also ordered one size up from what the size chart recommended for my wieght/size , that way they go higher on the leg than halfway , it 's way sexier up nearer the top of your thigh .
 Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I can not stand to wear panty hose . I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt . I really like the stockings . They are darker black than the picture depicts them . I prefer off-black . The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch , so if you have large thighs you might not like them . The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs . My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy . I will buy more .
 I agree with most of the other reviewers here ; these are wonderful . A garter-belt or bustier is a must with these , because there is no `` stay-up '' band in these stocking-tops , and if you ask me , imho , it 's much better that way.I just adore the darling lace applique of the stocking-tops , and the sheer stockings are very elegant and sexy . The lace design is simple enough that it pairs well with many different garters , be they solid or lacy.I got these in `` city beige '' -LRB- a bit darker than nude -RRB- and black -LRB- although not TOO black , but rather a lovely shade that is n't really `` smoky '' but adds a wonderful black shimmer to your legs -RRB- and loved both colors . I will definately be ordering more of these.Very sexy and elegant ! I strongly recommend these .
 I absolutely love these ! They are so smooth and the lace on top is very comfortable too . What I really love about them is that they do n't pinch me or squeeze my thigh ! I wear them with a garter and am so comfortable . I feel quite sexy too : - -RRB-
 To date these are my favorite stockings - absolutely beautiful lace top and a lovely hand to the leg . The lace is quite substantial though and with many of the tiny buttons on garter belts this can be a problem . If your thighs not thin , go up a size - I always have.However this is a fabulous stocking that fits , wears well , and feels very nice . THe black is a bit darker than I would prefer .
 Wore these for my wedding . Very comfy and looked lovely with my eggshell tea length dress . Enough stretch to not run or snag when I put them on .
 I just love these stockings , my only problem is that on me they are knee high length . I am 5 ' 1 so I ordered the A/B size and the lace stops at my knees . I would recommend ordering a size up or maybe some type of stretching method when wet .
 Nothing comes close to the feel of Berkshire Sexyhose . # 1 -RRB- they 're beautiful , the lace is very pretty . # 2 -RRB- they are sheer with the perfect hint of shimmer . # 3 -RRB- the most important factor in my decision to buy Berkshires over and over again , is the way they feel . They are silky , soft , smooth and begging to be touched . My Boyfriend loves them , even I can hardly keep my hands off of my own legs ! At 5 ' 7 '' , 135 lbs , I usually purchase the larger size , as I hate to have the tops cut into my thigh , and a lot of companies do not offer a range of sizes in a gorgeous stocking like Berkshire does -LRB- * ahem Legavenue * -RRB- I never wear stay-up Thigh highs , Stockings only ! And SexyHose are my Favorite !
 This is the second time I have bought this jacket . I wore the first one out ! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman . I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size . This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old .
 very happy with the look and fit . the fabric feel is great , do n't even think of them as `` khakis '' .
 The pants are very soft and comfortable . The color holds up fairly well , but I do wish the darker colors held better . I do recommend them .
 To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers , but not here . These are real Dockers slacks with real quality . These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price . I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section . Pleats seem to disguise that nicely . I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well , and these are true Dockers.CA Luster
 Product arrive well ahead of schedule , met expectations , and price was better than local retail .
 received the pants when you said . they fit . i am pleased with the purchase and the delivery
 I absolutely love these -LRB- white -RRB- Dockers pants ! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton . For summer wear , you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen , DKNY , Pierre Cardin , Geoffrey Beene , Stafford or other such brand . The `` individual-fit '' waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort .
 I hate shopping anywhere but online . Pant sizes , however , tend to be so irregular that I 've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl 's -LRB- or Walmart , if it 's closer -RRB- . Finally , a solution
 Pants fit real nice . They have the individual fit waistband that is real nice . No complaints so far .
 I bought these for my father who is 6 ' 5 '' for father 's day , in black -LCB- 36x36 -RCB- . They are excellent quality , have a great fit , and look perfect on him . Great range of sizes !
 I really like these pants . They fit and are a little stretchy in the waist . It is just enough to make up for some of the mid-life expansion my body is going through . I bet it will work for you too !
 I bought these pants for my husband for work and he loves them . They wash well and still look good !
 I did not pay extra for shipping and thought I might regret it . I received my son 's pants within 3 days !!! Awesome !!
 It 's tough to beat Dockers for casual pants - good looks and a good fit .
 These are great pants . They are really comfortable and easy to care for . I 'm saving money too because I do n't have to take these to the dry cleaners . I love the `` Individual Fit '' waste band . Who would n't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size .
 These pants are really great . They fit well and rarely wrinkle . I like that they are really classic - I can wear them at the office and then I can wear them if I go out later in the evening as well . I have owned a lot of Docker 's pants and they all last extremely well .
 This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size -LRB- inseam -RRB- ranges than other Dockers products . And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs .
 We had a hard time finding Dockers in 29x30 . This place had them , and they fit great . Shipping was quick . We would buy from again.Recommended !!
 The Dockers `` individual fit '' system works well , in that one can get by without `` odd '' waist sizes like 33 , 35 , etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to . These pants are very durable , and still look presentable after washing and machine drying . An ironing every so often would probably be useful for `` business casual '' . A good value .
 I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants . The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores . I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length . The delivery was quick -LRB- especially during Christmas -RRB- and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose .
 The pants were just what I was looking for and the seller , Beals Florida was prompt and courteous .
 Ok so these are great pants . Come on guys . They are pleated . Even though the stores sell pleated pants does n't mean you should be wearing them.The only thing the pleats do is add bulk to the waist line area and make you look fat or fatter.Just get the flat front Dockers and do all of us a favor .
 This product was just what I was hoping for , and I had no problem with shipping . I highly recommend this product .
 `` Package arrived before the estimated date , and actually was delivered the same day as another item ordered from another seller which was sent 2nd-day air on the same day ! Way to go Bealls ! The pants fit fine , right colors , right size , so that 's what counts . ''
 Good communication and super-fast shipping ! Item arrived exactly as described -LRB- I am actually wearing them right now ... -RRB- . I have never had a better online purchasing experience . Thanks a million !
 My husband wanted these and has tried many different types of compression shorts . He says these are THE BEST ! They hold up great too . I wash them in the machine , but hang them to air dry . This is the ONLY brand he wants to wear . He wears them for enduro and dual-sport motorcycling .
 Great bag , holds a suprising amount of items . Very cushy exterior/interior construction - protected ceramics -LRB- and the much-appreciated duty-free booze -RRB- ! Used as a carry-on three times , but had to check once on a return home . CAUTION if you check this bag - handles are a little awkward and could not be removed -LRB- at least easily -RRB- . Travel between Toronto and Detroit RIPPED the handle from the bag . Not sure if Swiss Gear or a less-than-stellar airport baggage handler . If you DO purchase and intend to check through , maybe consider a luggage wrap to bind the handles down . I do think that a cobbler can repair . Hopefully

 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a

 Your product was top notch . I am sure my son will not only look great in it , but wear it for many years .
 I 've been looking for a vest like this for awhile . Simple , not too puffy , fits well at the shoulders , not flared at the bottom , deep pockets , sturdy zipper . Warm ! There 's even a rain hood hidden in the collar . Reversible side is n't that attractive but I 'm happy with one side . I highly recommend if you want a basic , good-looking vest jacket .

 this costume was cute . . ran a little big but you can tie the belt snug around the waist -- of course an almost 4 year old does n't want all the `` stuff '' on for more than a few minutes . the headpiece was ` VERY ' tight . . i cut out a piece of felt to the size and shape of the piece , then took sewed on new elastic w/velcro so as to fit my granddaughter 's head . . otherwise , a nice halloween costume .
 Got this through Amazon for my daughter 's superhero party . She could hardly wait to put it on . The quality is OK - some parts -LRB- like the skirt -RRB- have gotten stuck together and the color has come off a bit . For a costume though , it 'll serve a good purpose , and provide hours of fun . The boots a really high . My daughter is tall for her age , but the boots go all the way up -LRB- and even under -RRB- the skirt . Just FYI .
 When I finally gave the costumes to the kids I noticed that the one custome of Batgirl was not complete . The belt was missing .
 Nicely made , fit perfectly , great hot pink color . Ordered an extra small for a tall 4 year old and fit perfectly .
 fast and quick . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . speedy and quick and fast and will order again
 It 's cute . Durable enough for more wears than a lot of halloween costumes but of course not long term . I have no problems with it .
 The costume was perfect for my daughter and the best part is the costume came with every thing you need to be a very adorable batgirl . The quality was good as well .
 She wore it the very next day , and the next , and by Halloween , had almost worn it out . She enjoyed it thoroughly !
 While I am not a big fan of this costume , my four year old liked it and that 's all that matters . She wore it almost every day before Halloween and she felt so proud to say to others she was going to be a super hero for Halloween . She definitely has enjoyed it , the price was great so I am happy with this purchase .
 My daughter absolutely loved this costume . It was made of a kind of cheap material and was very thin so I had to buy her some tights a hoodie to wear with it . It was well made otherwise . She 'll be able to keep it in her dress up box after Halloween and wear it over and over again .
 Perfect fit for my small framed 5 yr old ! Great Halloween costume , she wore it to school and Halloween night
 This Costume was just as it says . Was a great buy . The material was stretchy so it moved easily with my active child . No complaints .
 My daughter is 3 years old and wears a size 4 . We bought the small size and it fit perfectly ! The boot covers were perfect as well . She loved this costume so much and still wears it to play on a daily basis . It was good material and is still holding up to daily use .
 Got this for my girl to wear to her friend 's superhero costume birthday party . My daughter loves pink and the party was on a mid-July day in the Texas heat . My daughter LOVED the costume . She is 3 1/2 . She even wore the mask , but she did n't want to wear the silver belt . It was perfect for such a hot summer day . She could just un-velcro the cape and remove the accessories , then it was like a thin , comfortable dress . All the other kids had to take their costumes off because they were thick Batman costumes and such . -LRB- She was the only girl there -RRB- . If you 're looking for Halloween , I 'd take the weather into consideration . But a great play costume .
 My 4-year old girl loved the costume but unfortunately it did not include the mask . I inquired the seller and they confirmed there was a confusion
 My 3 year-old niece loves to dress up , so we got her this costume for Christmas . She loved it and spent the rest of Christmas vacation wearing it .
 we purchased this costume for our 4 year old daughter and she absoulutly loved it ! It was perfect since her favorite color is pink . She recieved lots of compliments while trick or treating . I totally recommend this costume . The material is not the cheap kind your used to seeing with other childrends costumes . It 's durable and has a lot of detail . Loved it !
 My daughter knew early that she wanted to be pink bat girl . She loves it and ca n't wait to wear it for Halloween and any accompaning parties .
 Hello , This pink batgirl costume is the best and so perfect for this halloween ! It 's made well and the topic in kindergarten this past week has been all about bats !!! Daughter can not wait to wear it and decided to become batgirl since she 's already been a princess and ballerina before.Sandra M.
 Great product ... exactly as the item description depicted . Quick shipping ... just in time for Halloween . You made a very happy 3 1/2 year old 's day !!!!
 Cute . I like how the cape is attached to the dress . Easy to put on . Not scratchy . Belt is tie on and easy to put on or take off plus comfortable . Would get for the outfit , gauntlets , and mask . The boot covers are huge and odd fitting , we do n't use , costume just fine without . The mask is a little hard to work with for smaller children but our daughter is getting used to it . Initially she kept moving it off her head but now she can adjust it and will wear it . Happy with purchase .
 This costume ran slightly small in the fit , but is really cute . It is a dress . The cape attaches at the shoulders with Velcro . The belt ties ib the back . The arm pieces go on like gloves . The boots go over your own shoes . The girls had a lot of fun with this costume .
 My daughter loved the styling , loves being a &#34; super hero . &#34; We got this on discount on the offseason , so it was an extremely good buy .
 This one i bought for my daughter and i got all items as described and she really liked it ... All accessories are complete and worth to pay .
 The costume is cute , kind of cheap but it looks good on , the boot covers were ruined first time she wore them , but she looked very cute .
 The costume came fast and fit awesome . My only complaint was with the shoe coverings . They broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them .
 The costume was great . My daughter loved it . The only thing I did n't like was the accessories did n't last long after Halloween . Not great for dress up .
 This was super cute on my daughter and she absolutely loved it . Everything fit nicely . The only thing I did not like about the costume was that the second time my daughter wore it the fabric had already started to stretch and tear . It would be nice if they would make the material more durable for the kids costumes .
 I got this for my 5 1/2 year old girl . SHe loved the costume and the quality was more or less descent . The boots and hand gloves are a little weird but try explaining this to your child . Was small and not properly sized and she is an average 5 year old . Order a size larger !
 This is a fabulous costume ! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week . She even slept in it a couple of nights . The other reviews are correct in saying that it needs some mending . We had to reinforce the velcro on the mask and the elastic on the bottom of the boots . After a little stitching it is fine . We also sewed on a small piece of material to the back of the face mask so that it would n't stretch any further and tear . This was a fabulous idea . Do it ! I only deducted one star for this because the rest of it is great . The material is a durable shiny pink . My daughter is a size 4 and wears a size 9 shoe and the small fits perfectly . If she were a 5 or older I would get the medium . Totally worth the money .
 My neice wanted this so bad for her birthday , so I bought it for her , she is a tiny four year old so the small was very big on her , but it did n't matter to her , she just rolled the boots down , my sister sewed the gauntlets tighter , and began fighting crime in her household . The only issue was that the belt broke right away , leading to lots of tears , some fabric glue fixed it right up though . This product is great for the price you spend , it was only 17.00 , and she will definently get more than enough use from it .
 My neice is four and wanted a superhero costume for Christmas and this is what I got for her . . This costume is not the most durable or made to withstand prolonged wear or washing , however it is great for what it actually is . . The material is pink and kind of shimmery and sparkle . My neice loved it so much she slept in it Christmas eve and wore it all day on Christmas ! She loved this costume so very much and I feel as though it was money well spent .
 This costume was very cute on , I know some people say it runs small but we did not have this problem at all . My daughter is 5 and wears a size 5/6 and wore the small , it was not short at all and the boots and gauntlets were actually big on her and I had to fold the boots down . My daughter loved it and I love the fact it is pink !
 This is a great costume . All the extra pieces make it really great . This is one of our favorite costumes .
 cute costume but make sure you get all the pieces im missing the belt and i already threw the packaging away and i didnt even notice the belt was missing : -LRB-
 My 3 yr old daughter said she wanted to be a `` super hero '' for Halloween so I went online & she picked this one . The quality is pretty good and the costume looked so cute on her . The boots got scuffed but it 's still in good enough condition to keep for her to wear again , play dress up or for my younger twin daughters -LRB- or give it to someone else -RRB- .
 True this is n't as durable as some costumes . What it lacks in durability , it makes up in adorability ! My 5 year old daughter loved it . It probably does run small . We bought the medium and it fit my average sized kindergartener well . Not a princess , but very girlie ! We were really happy with our `` Pink '' batgirl .
 I ordered the medium for my 5 year old . It fits her perfect and it 's pretty . The only thing i did n't like was the mask is a little small .
 Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house . She loves to dress up . Costume is a little flimsy but will last through the Halloween season and maybe some dress-up after . Skimpy and thin so plan on wearing something under it . -LRB- I wish we had bought a size larger -RRB- Do n't be fooled by the cape it does not go over the shoulders , only behind the back . It is very cute and my 7 year old daughter loves it .
 This is the second time I have bought this jacket . I wore the first one out ! I am an attorney and it is becoming difficult to find tailored clothes to fit a mature woman . I plan to buy this jacket in some other colors now that I have the proper size . This is a great easy wearing piece for any professional woman young or old .
 very happy with the look and fit . the fabric feel is great , do n't even think of them as `` khakis '' .
 The pants are very soft and comfortable . The color holds up fairly well , but I do wish the darker colors held better . I do recommend them .
 To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers , but not here . These are real Dockers slacks with real quality . These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price . I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section . Pleats seem to disguise that nicely . I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well , and these are true Dockers.CA Luster
 Product arrive well ahead of schedule , met expectations , and price was better than local retail .
 received the pants when you said . they fit . i am pleased with the purchase and the delivery
 I absolutely love these -LRB- white -RRB- Dockers pants ! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton . For summer wear , you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen , DKNY , Pierre Cardin , Geoffrey Beene , Stafford or other such brand . The `` individual-fit '' waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort .
 I hate shopping anywhere but online . Pant sizes , however , tend to be so irregular that I 've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl 's -LRB- or Walmart , if it 's closer -RRB- . Finally , a solution
 Pants fit real nice . They have the individual fit waistband that is real nice . No complaints so far .
 I bought these for my father who is 6 ' 5 '' for father 's day , in black -LCB- 36x36 -RCB- . They are excellent quality , have a great fit , and look perfect on him . Great range of sizes !
 I really like these pants . They fit and are a little stretchy in the waist . It is just enough to make up for some of the mid-life expansion my body is going through . I bet it will work for you too !
 I bought these pants for my husband for work and he loves them . They wash well and still look good !
 I did not pay extra for shipping and thought I might regret it . I received my son 's pants within 3 days !!! Awesome !!
 It 's tough to beat Dockers for casual pants - good looks and a good fit .
 These are great pants . They are really comfortable and easy to care for . I 'm saving money too because I do n't have to take these to the dry cleaners . I love the `` Individual Fit '' waste band . Who would n't like pants that fit a larger waste size without making you admit the weight gain by buying the larger size .
 These pants are really great . They fit well and rarely wrinkle . I like that they are really classic - I can wear them at the office and then I can wear them if I go out later in the evening as well . I have owned a lot of Docker 's pants and they all last extremely well .
 This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size -LRB- inseam -RRB- ranges than other Dockers products . And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs .
 We had a hard time finding Dockers in 29x30 . This place had them , and they fit great . Shipping was quick . We would buy from again.Recommended !!
 The Dockers `` individual fit '' system works well , in that one can get by without `` odd '' waist sizes like 33 , 35 , etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to . These pants are very durable , and still look presentable after washing and machine drying . An ironing every so often would probably be useful for `` business casual '' . A good value .
 I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants . The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores . I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length . The delivery was quick -LRB- especially during Christmas -RRB- and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose .
 The pants were just what I was looking for and the seller , Beals Florida was prompt and courteous .
 Ok so these are great pants . Come on guys . They are pleated . Even though the stores sell pleated pants does n't mean you should be wearing them.The only thing the pleats do is add bulk to the waist line area and make you look fat or fatter.Just get the flat front Dockers and do all of us a favor .
 This product was just what I was hoping for , and I had no problem with shipping . I highly recommend this product .
 `` Package arrived before the estimated date , and actually was delivered the same day as another item ordered from another seller which was sent 2nd-day air on the same day ! Way to go Bealls ! The pants fit fine , right colors , right size , so that 's what counts . ''
 Good communication and super-fast shipping ! Item arrived exactly as described -LRB- I am actually wearing them right now ... -RRB- . I have never had a better online purchasing experience . Thanks a million !
 My daughter loves this backpack . The seller was prompt and the price was very reasonable . It came earlier than expected too ! We were so happy with the quality of this item that we purchased a second one .

 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a

 This the best since heavy coats were invented this keeps you warm in the coldest weather and in is well worth 50 bucks .

 These pants are really great . They fit well and rarely wrinkle . I like that they are really classic - I can wear them at the office and then I can wear them if I go out later in the evening as well . I have owned a lot of Docker 's pants and they all last extremely well .
 This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size -LRB- inseam -RRB- ranges than other Dockers products . And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs .
 We had a hard time finding Dockers in 29x30 . This place had them , and they fit great . Shipping was quick . We would buy from again.Recommended !!
 The Dockers `` individual fit '' system works well , in that one can get by without `` odd '' waist sizes like 33 , 35 , etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to . These pants are very durable , and still look presentable after washing and machine drying . An ironing every so often would probably be useful for `` business casual '' . A good value .
 I went online for information about Dockers Khaki pants . The size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores . I was very impressed with the selection I had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length . The delivery was quick -LRB- especially during Christmas -RRB- and I really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose .
 The pants were just what I was looking for and the seller , Beals Florida was prompt and courteous .
 Ok so these are great pants . Come on guys . They are pleated . Even though the stores sell pleated pants does n't mean you should be wearing them.The only thing the pleats do is add bulk to the waist line area and make you look fat or fatter.Just get the flat front Dockers and do all of us a favor .
 I bought these for my father who is 6 ' 5 '' for father 's day , in black -LCB- 36x36 -RCB- . They are excellent quality , have a great fit , and look perfect on him . Great range of sizes !
 I really like these pants . They fit and are a little stretchy in the waist . It is just enough to make up for some of the mid-life expansion my body is going through . I bet it will work for you too !
 I bought these pants for my husband for work and he loves them . They wash well and still look good !
 I did not pay extra for shipping and thought I might regret it . I received my son 's pants within 3 days !!! Awesome !!
 It 's tough to beat Dockers for casual pants - good looks and a good fit .
 very happy with the look and fit . the fabric feel is great , do n't even think of them as `` khakis '' .
 The pants are very soft and comfortable . The color holds up fairly well , but I do wish the darker colors held better . I do recommend them .
 To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers , but not here . These are real Dockers slacks with real quality . These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price . I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section . Pleats seem to disguise that nicely . I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well , and these are true Dockers.CA Luster
 Product arrive well ahead of schedule , met expectations , and price was better than local retail .
 received the pants when you said . they fit . i am pleased with the purchase and the delivery
 I absolutely love these -LRB- white -RRB- Dockers pants ! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton . For summer wear , you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen , DKNY , Pierre Cardin , Geoffrey Beene , Stafford or other such brand . The `` individual-fit '' waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort .
 I hate shopping anywhere but online . Pant sizes , however , tend to be so irregular that I 've had no choice but to head for a Sears or Kohl 's -LRB- or Walmart , if it 's closer -RRB- . Finally , a solution
 Pants fit real nice . They have the individual fit waistband that is real nice . No complaints so far .
 First time ordering a Paul Fredrick shirt . The quality of the fabric and the excellent fit make this a go to item from now on .
 I just got this shirt so I am not sure how the cololr and material will hold with time.At this time I am in a state of WoW!okay I must admit I do n't buy $ 300 shirts to compare this to but compared to my John Nordstrom 's variety this shirt is equally as good.So if you wear a size say 16 you can go to Nordstrom Rack and buy a nice shirt that originally retailed at $ 100 + down to about $ 50 . If you wear a size 18 or 18.5 Norstrom Rack will not have a great selection of those sizes so you '' be better off to order one of these puppies and have tit delivered to your door !
 My husband loved his shirts and I will certainly buy more from this company and of this brand name . Good quality .
 My husband wanted these and has tried many different types of compression shorts . He says these are THE BEST ! They hold up great too . I wash them in the machine , but hang them to air dry . This is the ONLY brand he wants to wear . He wears them for enduro and dual-sport motorcycling .

 My dermatologist tried to sell me these exact pantyhose for a cosmetic procedure I had done . I had some spider veins removed and was told to wear these compression hose after . They wanted to charge me $ 40 more than Amazon . So I bought mine here and they did exactly what I needed them to . I wore them 48 hours straight . . then daily for seven additional days . I actually found I liked having them on b/c they kept me super warm . Definitely would n't want to wear these suing the summer ! I never got a snag or run in my hose and I was n't gentle on them . I have small children and am constantly on the ground playing with them . I washed them in my sink with a little soap and hung them to dry . I 'm sure you could wash them in the washing machine on a low cycle but it only took me two mins to wash them by hand in the sink . So no complaints here ... good buy !
 muy buen producto . rapido facil y a tiempo la entrega . sin contratiempos en todo el proceso . lo recomiendo a a
 excellent protection for aching legs . i wear them under my scrubs or with dress clothes for work . i am a medical student and by the end of the day my legs are normally hurting in a million & one places . these really help .

 I see a lot of the other reviews complain about it fitting oddly or being a size bigger than it was supposed to be . I got a medium and it is big in the waist , but it fit my large breasts perfectly ! It 's got a corset-type design in the front , so you can tighten it there , and with the ribbon that you tie around your back.Also , I saw another complain about it being too long for them
 The product is great and is as pictured , wish the hand decorations were included too though . Will be wearing a petticoat with it too . Had to purchase the accessories separately .
 Super sexy while not too slutty . Fit my wife perfectly although she had to wear push-up bra to fill out the top . Combine it with some sexy thigh highs , garter and gloves and you 've got yourself one sexy costume !
 he enjoyed it . will recommend it to friends to order form this site . It is cost friendly and you save
 I paid a good price for it . I loved the costume . It was super cute ! It came before it was suppose to which was nice
 I recieved this very quickly . I got this for my boyfriend and me . He absolutely loved it . It fit perfectly . It had a connected tie sash in the back that I didnt expect , but it was a perfect touch . The head band was small though . It was n't as big as I would 've liked . It was like a small ribbon . Otherwise this was perfect .
 it is exactly as the picture showing . The material was good . I really like it a lot . and it fit so perfectly.Thanks
 This is a super costume that is very good quality ! The costume has a bit of stretch in it and is really easy to put on and wear . Great value for a good quality item .
 Great costume , I bought it for my girlfriend and it is very sexy , its fits very good to the curves of the body

 Maui Jim 's can not be beat , hands down . I got the chestnut frames with the bronze lenses . Any pair of Maui Jim sunglasses you really ca n't beat as far as polarization and look . No matter how much sun there is , I can not see any glare with these things , it 's amazing . Worth every penny .

 They are definitely a man 's pair of jeans . Could n't imagine they would be more stiff and plain then when I tried them on . Good working jeans now .
 I love the fit and feel of these jeans . Very comfortable and consistent sizing . Never any problems with shrinking when washed .
 I have worn nothing but Levi 's slim fit for many , many years and the decided to discontinue manufacturing them . I looked at several other brands but the Wranglers seemed to have both the fit and color I wanted . I am very pleased with the fit , the look and price . Good bye Levi .
 This style and the size my husband needs has not been available in our local stores . I was able to find what I needed quickly online and the shipping was very prompt . I would have given it five stars but he has n't had time to try them on yet so I ca n't give a perfect score .
 For price , quality and appearence ... Ya ' ca n't beat Wranglers . I need the 33 '' waist and ca n't find it in local stores but here ... no problems . Good product !!!
 What else can I say ? They fit the skinny guy so much better than regular fit and forget relaxed fit ! My husband loves them too . They last . They 're jeans .

 I wore this shirt to work one Friday -LRB- casual day -RRB- and one the my co-workers told me `` I 've worked here 7 years and that is the coolest shirt I 've ever seen . '' Need I say more .
 this is the picture from the us lp , which is one of the best albums ever made , and always will be . wear it proud .

 I 'm glad i got these shirts , i need them for work and they are working very well theyre long enough so that when you bend over or crouch down you do n't have to keep pulling them down , the material feels nice , and they dont shrink very much in the wash so they still fit fine after 5 washes . They are n't very thick or very thin so theres no problem there.I 'd recommend them to anyone who needs a good shirt at a fair price .
 They have a little bit bigger size . I ordered a medium shirt for my kid and its a little bit big . I have n't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him .
 This is a great shirt ! My husband has a very long back and this shirt was long enough even for him . Fits very well and fabric is nice too .
 I know that Amazon.com does not sell everything you need in life but they come darn close!I bought 2 polo style shirts for me & my Husband . I Coordinate a C.E.R.T. -LRB- Community Emergency Response Team -RRB- being a leader , I need to look as nice as I can when I am meeting new members , local elected officials , and other related `` CERT '' business . The shirts are a great quality , very reasonably priced and I am never disapointed in Amazon . From Gifts to Gadgets , Amazon is the place I go ! Thanks for all you do !
 The price was great ... delivery was on time and quality was terrific . I would definitely buy from this seller again . No disappointment .
 great lightweight loved the color when i got it ! The color on screen didnt do the shirt justice ! I am going to order a few more for my husband .
 The product was exactly as I had expected , and came quickly . I had to buy two for an expo , not knowing of they would of satisfactory quality , but fortunately , they were professional looking enough and did the trick.Overall , I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 You definitely feel that it is not 100 % cotton but for the price it is still a great shirt . They are lite enough that I just wear a cotton tank underneath so do n't feel the poly so much . They do shrink a bit , but not too much , I typically get shirts in XL so when the shrink they fit right . These almost did n't shrink enough . Probably after a few washes they will . I wear a 42-44 jacket as a reference .
 I like those shirts , comfortable good size , all the info correct so recommend for any body , I going o buy some more
 I took a chance on ordering these shirts -LRB- I do n't usually order clothing from the ` net -RRB- , and am very glad I did . They fit well , are light weight , and the collars hold up under washing . Great shirt , at a fantastic price !
 The size is accurate , the fit is just right , and the spot shield is an added plus . Overall , very happy with the purchase .
 what can I say other than it was exactly what I expected and fit well . I like the idea of &#34; SpotShield &#34; since I apparently get stuff on my front quite often .
 love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable , material is soft great price would definely recommend product
 I like the feel of the material and that it is by Jerzees.I recommend it to family and friends .
 Looks and fits great ! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform . He loves them ...
 I got anadidas Men 's Tricot Tracksuitfor a very nice price . There is tricot and tricot . The quality of this suit was not top notch . The material seems stiffer and less able to breathe . I have another Adidas tricot tracksuit and the material is much more flexible and `` airy . `` However , for the price and the free shipping deal , why not?I am happy with what I got .
 This blouse wrinkles easily , you iron it in one place , then shift to another spot , only to find it wrinkled where you had already ironed .
 This shirt has a nice , smooth look to it . Looks great with trousers . The light blue is a very flattering color . Washes nicely , needs very little ironing .
 I love this blouse ! It 's nicely cut and quality material . Unfortunately for me I ordered the wrong size and mine is n't available so I have to return it . I 'm usually very disappointed in quality when I order clothing online , but risked it and took another chance . I was happily pleased ! Plus this is made in the USA , which is very hard to find . I received a little National catalog with the blouse , that I plan to use . Just sad I ca n't keep this beautiful red blouse ...
 A good fitting bra for full figured women at a reasonable price . I would recommend this product to others as well .

 this jacket is sweet it looks good on me and all my buds think it looks good to . so this jackets tight .
 I 've worn these socks for over a year now and have never been more pleased . I wish they would still make the grey and more colors .
 I 'm frequently on my feet 10-12 hours/day and these socks provide great support and comfort even for my beat up feet . Worth the regular price but when bought on sale are an incredible value as well .
 I wear these socks on a daily basis and I am very happy with them . They are about the only pair I 've found that will actually stay up on/above my calves for any period of time .
 Love these socks from Gold Toe . They last and they are well made . Most of my socks are Gold Toe .
 These socks are my husband 's new favorites . And he has tried LOTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS of socks . He used to wear the Gold Toe Windsor Wool OTC for many years , which were beautifully made and stayed up and came in 4 colors . Gold Toe changed them more and more so they became so tight that they 'd leave marks/indentations on his legs . My husband bought numerous different Gold Toe styles and finally loves these . They only come in black and navy , so he is wearing only the black for now and uses old brown , navy , or gray ones when he needs those colors.These are very soft and stretchy but durable feeling . They stay up and do not make your feet sweat like many fabrics do . For the time being this is the new favorite at our house . -LRB- Gold Toe , PLEASE make more colors !!! -RRB- Two thumbs and 10 toes up !
 This fishnet body stocking is generously sized and easy to put on . It looks great , even if you are wearing it over a bra and panties . I have wore it under a dress for fishnet hose too . It washes well , and I get several wears out of one of these . At the price , it 's a great night of romance .
 I bought this to wear for some dom/sub with my husband and it worked great for the purpose . I thought it did n't fit me at all until I realized that there is a front and a back . Once I switched it around it worked . Also , I 'm 5 ' 3 250 and it fit me ok . If I was taller I 'm not sure it would have fit . Also , the crotch is kind-of weird but hubby just ripped it to make it not be so weird but now it 's just big and gaping and un-sexy . One thing that I totally did n't think of is if you use velcro handcuffs , the velcro sticks to it really bad and makes it fray . The material is flimsy sure but I mean come on , plus size lingerie that 's less than $ 6 and free shipping you can expect that . I will be buying more than one because it 's a nice spicy addition to your boudoir chest that you do n't have to feel guilty about if it gets ripped up .
 Love this , amazingly sexy . bought it in white for our wedding night so my future husband has something to rip through ; -RRB-
 This body stocking is a near perfect fit on even my voluptuous frame , and feels comfortable and sexy to wear , but it 's not of very high quality . I 've worn it twice , very gingerly , and I can already see signs of wear and tear in some places that it would n't be if it was a slightly higher grade of material . So I will need to buy replacements frequently , but it fits well and shows everything off just right , if you get my drift . Good buy for a short term outfit , just do n't expect it to last very long .
 I purchased this jacket for a six and a half month training program for my job , and it held up very well . Despite being out in inclement weather almost every day , I remained warm when I wore this jacket . It also held up well in the rain . Really the only complaint that i have about the jacket is the liner . It comes out too easy . I fixed that by adding a little thread to the button slots ... problem solved . After the training program , the jacket is still in good shape , and I have a feeling I am going to have it a long time .
 The real deal . Wore one when riding my motorcycle in Europe during the winter . Field jacket , liner , and undersweater . 28 degrees and still comfortable . Great investment .

 This is my second Rawlings briefcase . The first one I got was a `` Scout Bag '' several years ago , and although it is still a beautiful case , it was n't big enough got my needs . The Rawlings bags are superior quality and get softer with age . Just like a new baseball glove , the Rawlings briefcase needs to be used to get that soft , broken-in feel . Made from the ` Heart of the Hide ' , this is a briefcase will last for years while being used daily . I love this bag !
 The only reason this is n't a 5-star review is the hefty price . This briefcase is terrific and just the ticket for a baseball loving guy who traded in his glove -LRB- but not his love for the game -RRB- for a desk . It 's heirloom quality and I may well come back in 20 years to give it a full five stars if it ages as well as I expect .
 I bought these because I got tired of the cheapie khaki socks I got at the local megamart wearing out after just a few uses . These GoldToe socks have held up well , and are quite comfortable . If you 're looking for a good quality men 's dress sock , give these a try !
 For the price , this is a great product . Its a little more `` sylish '' than a white clear poncho and did do exactly as it said it would do .
 This is the best bra I have ever had . Comfortable , firm enough to give good support , cups are close enough together - I love this bra .
 I have to say I love my Le Mystere Dream Tisha Bra and its perfect fit . Sorry I ca n't say the same about the Carina bra.I agree with a previous reviewer , the cup size is off , not true to size and that results in `` spillage '' . I bought the 40G , the straps are pretty and the lower back fits just perfect . The only con is the cup size , recommend ordering `` up '' one cup size when purchasing this particular bra .
 It 's just an okay bra . I find my Victoria secret bra fitting and lifting much better .
 I bought this bra a month ago and using it for daily wear and so far I 'm very happy with the fit and comfort . It gives great shape and lift for my petite bust -LRB- 32C -RRB- without the `` push up '' effect . This is my first le mystere bra , so I can not compare it to other models of this brand but compared to other brands I 've used so far I believe this brand is worth the popularity . In terms of sizing
 I am a 42 G and this is the most flattering and comfortable bra that i have ever owned
 I love the shaping this bra gives , but the straps sometimes pop out when I 'm putting it on -- so annoying . It 's also cut a little smaller than other Le Mystere bras in the band and the cup -LRB- think spillage -RRB- . Otherwise , it 's great and much better than any other convertible bra I 've EVER tried !
 I wear a 44F and it 's not easy to find a bra with a good lift , with comfort and beauty . This bra has all of this . It 's the only one that I can find that is not only pretty , but is comfortable too ! All of the colors are lovely .
 My favorite bra ! My size is difficult to find , but this bra is well worth the money .
 This bra is comfortable and creates a smooth silhouette under all kinds of clothes . It runs slightly small in the band , as usual in this brand , but the cup fits true to size .
 I bought my first Le Mystere bra on sale and now have 6 of them in various colors and wear one every day . The moulded microfiber cups provide good support and full coverage without being hot or uncomfortable even in summer weather .
 During my search for the perfect bra , this is the best I have found so far . It only gets 4 stars because despite the high cost of this line of bras , the underwires do eventually break even if you care for them appropriately . The entire Le Mystere line offers unparalleled support for large busted women . Note that the cups are n't true to size . I normally wear a 40F , but wear a 40G in this line of bras . I highly recommend getting a professional bra fitting before buying this or any other bra .
 Great quality bra , it took a couple of wears to get the perfect fit , but once it adjusts to your body it fits like a glove . Highly recommend .

 this item was fantastic and neat . it arrived on time.it was worth the money . I will buy more items like this again .
 It is what they describe . A matte finish thin black tie . European style .
 My hubs-to-be wanted a skinny tie that did n't have the look of a shiny , polyester tie . We went with this one -LRB- as well as in chocolate brown and grey ; for him and the groomsmen -RRB- . He loves it and wants to wear it every day to work -LRB- and he will , after the wedding ! -RRB- . We originally went with the silk-knit skinny tie and it just was n't `` solid '' enough for him -LRB- although a great trendy , skinny tie , like the ones you see in GQ -RRB- The Tie Bar also has excellent customer service and an easy exchange policy and the prices are fantastic .
 This tie was purchased for a family member 's wedding . It is exactly what the bride requested and is exactly as described . The seller also included cleaning instructions and was packaged very nicely .
 This hat was a great deal , not only because of its general quality , but also because , due to the overall lack of good hatmanship available on amazon , it was a great suprise . Simply put , the man -LRB- and or woman -RRB- that created this splendid combination of football and head-wear is a genius , a master of the hats if you will . But i digress , as their are more important factors at hand here . First of all , is this hat attractive ? the answer is yes , it has to be because it is the only reason i can think of that fertile women clamor to be impregnated by my seed when they see me shaking my money maker -LRB- hat -RRB- as i walk down the street . And secondly , is it durable ? Why yes , yes it is . it has been grabbed multiple times by women wanting nothing more than to have the feeling of a kicking , fatherless , bastard infant to be wriggling like a recently concussed fish inside them . so yes , it is very very durable .
 I got this shirt when it was on sale for $ 10 so I snatched it up quickly . I like the shirt a lot . It is very pretty on . Order the size that you normally wear . I made the mistake of ordering a large instead of a Medium . The shirt is way to big . So maybe even order a size smaller because it is just a bigger shirt .
 It is a great suit , great buy , great service all around ! I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a Frosty suit to buy one of these .
 It 's hard to find a decent backpack with laptop pouch . Not too bulky , flimsy , or expensive , something comfortable , roomy , with sensible pockets . The Columbia Sportswear Umatilla Cyberpack fits the bill . Avoid snow/grey color , gets dirty fast . A little on the small side and does n't sit well , flops over . Overall good .
 I was skeptical about my purchase of Columbia Umatilla Cyberpack , but as soon as the product reached and I opened the box all my doubts were cleared . It is really a `` cool back pack '' as it has lots of space for all the things which a college/anybody who is always on the move likes to carry.Only disadvantage is that it can not stand on it 's own when you put it on the floor . On the whole I am happy with the product and using it to the fullest.Will recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a back pack for less price and with all those pockets .
 I use this backpack for everything . It is so sturdy that I can carry my laptop & cord , 2 full size text books , and a 1.5 '' binder with very little discomfort . The straps are very wide with sufficient padding to make it easier to carry . I love the place to store an mp3 or Ipod while walking to class and it has enough pockets and places to carry everything for school , camping , hiking , etc. .
 This backpack is very roomy for books , laptop , and school supplies . The big wide straps make it easy to tote around without stress to the back and shoulders . Seems to be very durable quality .
 This hat that simply looks like a stocking cap is a protective hat , originally made for snowboarders . My daughter is a figure skater who has had several mild concussions . The only other option , before finding this ribhat , was a bike helmet . Try to get a figure skater of any age to wear a bike helmet on the ice ... laughable . My daughter was willing to wear this and has gotten many compliments on how cute it is ... then when they find out , -LRB- coaches , parents , skaters -RRB- , that it is more than a fashion statement , many have been very interested in it and think it 's a great idea . My daughter , instead of tying the strings under her neck , rubberbands them into her pigtails and the hat stays on very nicely and still looks ... cute . The only thing that this does n't work for , where the hat does n't stay on her head , is when doing laybacks . My daughter is 16 and performs triples with the hat on and it stays on !!! This hat has been a godsent , because before it came along , with my daughters concussions , she had finally built up a fear and was psychologically frozen from performing her jumps . Now she is back to doing triples again ! We call it the magic hat . At $ 100 , it may seem expensive for something that looks like a stocking cap , but that is nothing when protecting a head . I only wish we had discovered it before her concussions .
 First time ordering a Paul Fredrick shirt . The quality of the fabric and the excellent fit make this a go to item from now on .
 I just got this shirt so I am not sure how the cololr and material will hold with time.At this time I am in a state of WoW!okay I must admit I do n't buy $ 300 shirts to compare this to but compared to my John Nordstrom 's variety this shirt is equally as good.So if you wear a size say 16 you can go to Nordstrom Rack and buy a nice shirt that originally retailed at $ 100 + down to about $ 50 . If you wear a size 18 or 18.5 Norstrom Rack will not have a great selection of those sizes so you '' be better off to order one of these puppies and have tit delivered to your door !
 My husband loved his shirts and I will certainly buy more from this company and of this brand name . Good quality .
 Looks and fits great ! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform . He loves them ...
 I 'm glad i got these shirts , i need them for work and they are working very well theyre long enough so that when you bend over or crouch down you do n't have to keep pulling them down , the material feels nice , and they dont shrink very much in the wash so they still fit fine after 5 washes . They are n't very thick or very thin so theres no problem there.I 'd recommend them to anyone who needs a good shirt at a fair price .
 They have a little bit bigger size . I ordered a medium shirt for my kid and its a little bit big . I have n't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him .
 This is a great shirt ! My husband has a very long back and this shirt was long enough even for him . Fits very well and fabric is nice too .
 I know that Amazon.com does not sell everything you need in life but they come darn close!I bought 2 polo style shirts for me & my Husband . I Coordinate a C.E.R.T. -LRB- Community Emergency Response Team -RRB- being a leader , I need to look as nice as I can when I am meeting new members , local elected officials , and other related `` CERT '' business . The shirts are a great quality , very reasonably priced and I am never disapointed in Amazon . From Gifts to Gadgets , Amazon is the place I go ! Thanks for all you do !
 The price was great ... delivery was on time and quality was terrific . I would definitely buy from this seller again . No disappointment .
 great lightweight loved the color when i got it ! The color on screen didnt do the shirt justice ! I am going to order a few more for my husband .
 The product was exactly as I had expected , and came quickly . I had to buy two for an expo , not knowing of they would of satisfactory quality , but fortunately , they were professional looking enough and did the trick.Overall , I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 You definitely feel that it is not 100 % cotton but for the price it is still a great shirt . They are lite enough that I just wear a cotton tank underneath so do n't feel the poly so much . They do shrink a bit , but not too much , I typically get shirts in XL so when the shrink they fit right . These almost did n't shrink enough . Probably after a few washes they will . I wear a 42-44 jacket as a reference .
 I like those shirts , comfortable good size , all the info correct so recommend for any body , I going o buy some more
 I took a chance on ordering these shirts -LRB- I do n't usually order clothing from the ` net -RRB- , and am very glad I did . They fit well , are light weight , and the collars hold up under washing . Great shirt , at a fantastic price !
 The quality was more than I expected for the price . Bought this for work and it 's perfect for the food biz .
 The size is accurate , the fit is just right , and the spot shield is an added plus . Overall , very happy with the purchase .
 what can I say other than it was exactly what I expected and fit well . I like the idea of &#34; SpotShield &#34; since I apparently get stuff on my front quite often .
 love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable , material is soft great price would definely recommend product
 I like the feel of the material and that it is by Jerzees.I recommend it to family and friends .
 A good fitting bra for full figured women at a reasonable price . I would recommend this product to others as well .
 this item was fantastic and neat . it arrived on time.it was worth the money . I will buy more items like this again .
 Love this bra ! Fits perfectly , looks great , wish it was sold in stores still ! Amazon is the only place I can find it , and in my size !
 it 's a nice bra for support . i like it because it 's full coverage . it 's pretty much the same as my other victoria secret bras . but i paid less . : -RRB-
 This eyeglass repair case came just like advrtzd much better than what you can find at local wal-g or wal-m . I needed a nose pad not found in most kits . It came in the mail 10 min later new nose pad problem solved . Plenty hardware to fix most missing screw problems , worth the money .
 The sunglass repair kit actually works with prescription glasses too . My 7 year old 's glasses needed a new silicone nose pad , but I did n't want to go to the optometrist to have it replaced because of the hassle it would be . This kit had the nose pads , plus bunches of screws and the tiny screwdrivers -LRB- both phillips head and flat head -RRB- . I wish though that it came with a description of the different pieces in the kit .
 This kit has all the tools you 'll need for a simple repair . The biggest issue is that the screws will get jumbled and are easy to lose -LRB- including under the plastic -RRB- . Other than a little digging through for matches this kit has everything you need including hard to find matching screws !
 Love the this , have a wide varitey of screws for any kind of glasses . Would reommend to everyone who needs screws for glasses .
 When my Gucci sunglasses lost a screw , I looked everywhere for a gold screw that would fit . Without success , I opted for this case due to the various sizes . The price is right and it has all different sizes as well as the tools needed to fix your sunglasses or glasses yourself . My sunglasses are still doing good with the replacement screw and I 'm glad I have this kit in handy in case I need to do another repair . Be warned , when you get the kit , the screws are all over the place , which is inevitable . You are going to have to sort through the screws and put them in the right compartment .
 i didnt get chance to use it cause my kid threw everthing on the floor couldnt find most picesbut looked like it was a good item . . : -RRB-
 I 'd like to see this on stage , this performance certainly enhanced my interest in this work .
 Worked great . I found the screw I needed , and in fact multiple copies of it , including an even better fit than the original -LRB- slightly longer , making it harder to come out again -RRB- . I did n't need the mini screwdriver but it was a nice touch . The seller delivered the kit in time and in good condition .
 Although handy the box could have a better way to hold in place all the useful screws . Overall it is great purchase .
 Kit has a lot if parts . Some are great for certain glasses , others are too small . Would be great if half the kit was full of larger screws .
 Everything you need to fix your glasses . Nice kit . Do n't buy the cheap-o 2 dollar kits , you 'll still be left with broken shades . Indulge -LRB- haha -RRB- in the 6 dollar kit and you 'll be right as rain .
 This repair kit has an excellent selection of lots of various screw sizes and had just what I wanted for my glasses . The cost was not expensive and delivery was fast . I have to use a walker or scooter so going to the store to fix my glasses would have been a big chore . This kit enabled me to do everything at home quickly .
 This kit has everything you would ever need to repair a pair of glasses from screws to nose padsI received the kit real fast in about 3 days I was surprised at how many screws there were the screwdriver is easy to use and the nose pads so many this was better then described on amazon store page
 This is an excellent product for my needs I could n't find anything like this anywhere else in New York City
 Comprehensive Sunglass repair Kit . It includes 5-6 types of screws and Nuts of different sizes which helps to get best fit to your sunglasses . I did n't get any `` buyers remorse '' after purchasing this item ! :-RRB- Very Good Product .
 Every household should own one of these kits . This is the most complete eyeglass repair kit I 've ever come across . BUY THIS ONE !
 After my Gucci sunglasses lost the part that holds the screw I could not find a tool kit that coantain the part and I did n't want to throw my glasses away . I am so glad I found this kit in Amazon . Not only did it have the part I need it , it also has a small screw that attaches to your keychain so you can have with you at all times just in case your sunglasses get loose .
 I have some really nice reading glasses around that still have glass lenses in them . I plan on keeping them as long as my eyes do n't deteriorate more , -LRB- which they have n't in over 20 years -RRB- . That means nursing them for as long as possible with repairs and replacement parts . This kit looks to be as good as it gets here on Amazon , -LRB- and definitely superior to what I can find locally in stores -RRB- . The screw driver is of a nice furled design that opens up and has both a slotted and phillips head on either end , and a fitting that holds the little nuts as well . It holds and turns the screws as easily as possible in dealing with ones so small . In fact I have never used such a small screwdriver that had a phillips head that fit so tightly into the screws on my glasses . It 's been a perfect fit on all the ones I have used it on so far . As far as this kits variety trust me when I tell you that no matter what kind of hardware combo you have , there is a replacement one in this set . Most of the screws are slotted , but others have a solid head that utilizes a pressure system for those repairs that are either hard to fit , or where the screw slots have just been worn over time . I really do n't know how well they work for I have not as of yet had any need for them . But I know that they will be a good last resort repair if all else fails , and also know that the slotted screws can easily be stripped at times no matter how careful we are . Also , for what it 's worth I did not have the problem with all the little pieces being strewn about upon arrival like so many other reviewers here have complained about . Perhaps by this date they have read enough of the reviews themselves and learned to just seal the case for shipping like mine was . Or maybe I just got lucky . In any event , all parts arrived intact and where they were supposed to be.In conclusion , these kits are pretty scarce in stores , and usually one has little choice in the matter as to the brand and size , etc. . Even on Amazon there is not a large selection of them to write home about . Trust me when I tell you this is the most complete , and as good as it gets for repairs without dropping your glasses off at a shop . Great set , good price , and highly recommended ...
 This kit contains the special washer to repair my Gucci sunglasses -LRB- GG 2681 -RRB- . I have been trying to fix them for a few years with no luck until now . This kit is worth 10 times more than what I paid , it would have cost me a fortune to have Gucci repair them . Almost like buying the sunglasses twice ! In addition to the washer I needed this kit contains several screws of multiple sizes , washers , nuts , nose pieces , and the mini screwdriver tool to make it all work . This kit is a must have , Gucci sunglasses or not , it has it ALL.Thank you , Seanaroo
 Just what you need at home to replace those lost little screws from your different eyeglasses . It has some nose pieces and some nuts and plastic washers that may come handy too . A delicate arrangemente of parts that include ` friction tightening screws ' too , though I prefer to match the slot . One little piece of advice
 I recently uncovered my 5-6 year old pair of Oakley ` Why 8 ' wire-framed sunglasses that I had not seen since I lost a screw holding the earpiece to the lens . I bought another pair of glasses and sent these to the scrap pile thinking that would be the last that I would see of them . I misplaced my newer glasses one day and did not have a backup , only finding my broken pair . I took my old pair of glasses to the Oakley store and they were no help . They told me they could not fix it in store and would have to send it away ... sounds like a way to make some more money to me . The guy at the store did advise me that I could probably go to a regular eyeglass store and get them fixed . When he told me this , I realized I should have just fixed them myself from the beginning and looked to Amazon for an eyeglass repair kit with an assortment of screws . I was able to narrow down a few candidates for a replacement screw and simply replaced the missing screw and fixed my $ 200 + pair of sunglasses . The head of the screw I chose is a bit smaller than the original , but as far as I am concerned it makes no difference.One minor issue
 I lost a tiny nut from my eyeglasses and it seems the optical stores I went to did n't have a replacement . I saw this online and decided to try it and was very happy to find that in the assortment of screws and nuts , I found just the right size to fit . Not only that , the supplied tool that came with the tiny nuts and screws also was a bit help in the installation . Very happy with this purchase !
 I 'm rough on my glasses . Both nose rests came off . All parts and screws are here . The repair kit at the grocery store is useless . NB
 This product was far superior to other brands costing much more . Fast service as well ! Would buy from them again .
 The kit arrived and it does indeed have pretty much every little piece you might need . There was some jumbling of the contents and the little screws had escaped from their separate boxes , so things were mixed up . The tiny screwdriver tool worked , I was able to repair a pair of reading glasses and so 4 stars . The price is OK too .
 I bought this kit for the same reason a few others have mentioned
 I ordered this kit but received an incomplete set . Needless to say , I was very disappointed and let the seller know my displeasure . The seller promptly apologized and immediately shipped out a replacement kit . The product is what I needed , and the customer service was exemplary . I docked one star for the inconvenience of having to wait for the replacement kit , but otherwise , I am a happy camper .
 This is a good little kit that can be carried without too muct trouble . It cotains a nice veriety of parts to repair most any problem . There are n't a lot of unecessary parts to choose from but there is a good variety of parts normaly used .
 At this price order two & keep one in your travel kit . Everything you need for emergency repairs and even upgrades .
 What a great kit . It has everything you need for repairing glasses including those little-bitty nuts and wrench . This kit has really extended the life of both my reading and sunglasses .
 If you have designer glasses like Gucci or others this is the repair kit that has hardware to repair them . Great kit at a great price .
 I have a few very expensive pairs of sunglasses -LRB- wo n't buy expensive ones ever again -RRB- and this kit was exactly what I needed to tighten the screws that are constantly coming loose or falling out . Everytime I needed a repair it was $ 5 - $ 10 but with this kit , I do it myself and that was worth the money !
 One of my screw-on nose pads broke off of my glasses & I couldnt find a kit in any store that had the screw-on nose pads included so I took to Amazon -- and found this great kit.It an awesome little kit that has 4 screw-on nose pads , a screw driver w/both straight & phillips heads on either end , plastic washers , metal nuts , several different types & sizes of screws -LRB- with at least 4 of each type/size -RRB- , & some plastic end caps.Mine is different from the pic as I did not get a carrying cloth with mine & my case is clear with a black tray instead of white.The only things that would make this better would be a case where the cover is flush against the body so the screws , etc dont move around inside & a screw driver with a magnetic tip for dealing w/teeny-tiny screws -- but those 2 things didnt take away from the kit , imo , they just would have * added * to it.I 'll post pics of mine .
 The kit had what I needed to repair my glasses , including tools . The only thing missing that I could see would be longer screws used to retain the nose pads -LRB- I was able to reuse the existing screws -RRB- . Other than that , the kit was quite acceptable .
 Was very pleased with this purchase.The eye glass repair kit was just what I needed and as advertised . Fast response and delivery .
 Nice product , it had lots of pieces for all type of repair . I found it helpful in trying to repair some old glasses that I needed to fix instead of getting new ones .
 Received my initial kit and one of the nose pieces was missing . Today I received additional parts for this kit ! I 'm very pleased with my purchase and would do business with this seller again and again ! It is very hard to find great customer service these days , but you will find it here !
 It arrived at a decent time and the package was small . Comes with all the parts to repair a glass . I had two missing screws and the screws fits really well . The only complains I have is that the nose pad with the hole is a little long but still fits well and when the package arrived the screws were out of the holes and all over the place , it was hard to tell which was paired with which .
 I Have yet to see a better sunglass/eyeglass repair kit than this one . I wish it had more of the little nuts because I ca n't find them anywhere and I need more ! I will just buy another kit . You can not beat this kit if you buy one of those cheapo ones from the drug store you are wasting your time !!!
 My 1.5 year old son 's favourite toy is eye-wear prespcription glasses and sunglasses -LRB- both mine and my wife 's -RRB- and as a result , we had a lot of lost nose pads and loose legs on our glasses . Also recently bought some Banana Plugs for my home theatre system speakers from Lowe 's and to my surprise they were the ones with the tiny screws in them , not the screw on type that I had bought from Amazon earlier ,24 k Gold Connector Banana Plugs , Open Screw Type 24 Pack -LRB- 12 Red , 12 Black -RRB- . I did not have a screwdriver that would fit the small screws on those , so I needed a small screw driver -LRB- was using a pen knife earlier to tighten and loose those screwes and it is pretty much a very frustrating job -RRB- . So I started my search on amazon for a small screw driver and then thought about why not buy a glass repair kit and kill two birds with one stone , and stumbled upon this kit . Also read reviews and checked many other kits , while reviewing this and decided on this one maninly because of the price and it looked like it had a lot of pieces in it . Got it last week and overall I 'm extremely happy with the kit , except for the fact that it is the worst packaging I have ever seen for small products like these . Everything was everywhere when i got the case and could n't figure out which one went where and the fact that these pieces all require a magnifying glass to see them better was n't helpful.But anyways apart from that it was a great buy and did the job wonderfully , both with our glasses and the banana jacks , the nose pads fit very well and i could find screws the right size for our glasses and the banana jacks -LRB- I had lost one of them on the carpet earlier when i was meddling with my pen knife -RRB- . Overall we are happy , but if you expect a neatly packaged product , they have a warnign on the picture or product description about the pieces shifting , so you should n't expect it , I did not but was shocked even with low expectations . My question to the manufacturer or seller is why , how difficult is it to have a box with a lid which has place holding indendations or some kind of pegs whic when closed would cover the small holes on the basde box and thereby prevent the tiny screws and nuts from scattering all over . I would imagine if you can get all these small stuff made wellm , then it should ` nt be too hard for you to figure out a way to package them better . Please do that and you would have had a 5 star review !
 A good fitting bra for full figured women at a reasonable price . I would recommend this product to others as well .

 Item came on time and as described and shown on the web site . Material is good and it does fit well .
 This dress is what I expected ; good enough but not great . It fits true to size and the color is exactly as it looks in the picture . Mine came with straps that can be sewn on and a matching shawl . It arrived 2 days after I ordered it ! For the price , this is a good deal .
 These dresses are beautiful . Great quality for a wedding or prom . Dress comes w a shawl & spaghetti straps to match . Great price for a great dress . Sizes run big . I ordered a medium but could have done a small .
 The dresses -LRB- 4 for my bridesmaids -RRB- came quickly , within a week and I was surprised by the quality ! Material was nice and sturdy , the boning is nice and it REALLY is good for almost all body types ! Nice and fitted from the waist up and the flares out at the bottom . They fit a little small though so I did need to exchange 2 but other than that I 'm impressed !! Even the exchange was fast ! Great buy for bridesmaid dresses ... . I think I might get one for myself to but in a different color !
 I got this dress in black . I love it ! It looks so pretty . Every time I show it to someone , they were shocked when I told them the price . It is beautiful . The wrap just tops it off . It is a little long though . And the dress length also . I needed to get it a little altered . So you might have to do that too .
 This dress is a super cute style & shipped pretty quickly ; but I had to exchange it for a smaller size . I went by my 53 '' bust , so got the 5x , based on the size/measurement chart . Thought that seemed big , even for a Junior 's dress ; and sure enough , i just stepped into it without unzipping it , and it was HUGE , falling off of me . The top runs about 3 '' bigger than the sizing/measurement chart indicates . Just wanted people to have a better idea of what size to order .
 I purchased 4 of these dresses in black . One extra small for my 12 yr old daughter -LRB- 12/14 in girls -RRB- , a small for my 14 yr old daughter -LRB- 1/2 in ladies -RRB- and 2 larges for other bridal party members -LRB- 8-10 in ladies -RRB- . The dresses pretty much fit everyone perfectly . I am having all hemmed , but my 14yr old who is 5 ' 5 '' and the dress falls right below the knee on her , the other ladies are shorter and the dress fell mid-calf . We were very pleased with the dresses . Quality was consistent throughout all the dresses , material a little thin , but for the cost of the dress it was acceptable . I was very pleased and everyone looks great !! Getting married October 2nd , 2010 - ca n't wait . I was a little nervous with all the reviews being all over the place regarding sizing , quality , etc. . I recommend these dresses . Also , they came very fast !
 I recently purchased this dress for my Best Friend 's wedding , I had seen one very similar at a popular bridal store for over $ 200 , so I figured no way would this dress come and actually be decent quality . NO JOKE - it is the same or better than you would purchase at a bridal boutique . You can not beat the price ! I absolutely loved the shape , especially the boned bodice , very flattering!I do have to say that I find it interesting that some people said they run large . I am a size 10 , so I ordered a Medium , and it was just a little bit too snug . I could have kept it and just been slightly uncomfortable , but I had time so I sent it back for a Large -LRB- which fit like a glove -RRB- . I recommend if you do have to send it back that you just return it for a refund , and re-order the size you need right away . I tried to do mine as an exchange , and after 10 days my replacement still had n't shipped , it barely made it in time for the wedding.But otherwise , 100 % FANTASTIC . Seriously . Buy this dress !
 We really loved the dresses . They were so affordable and they arrived right away . We did have to return two of them for smaller sizes because i think they run a little big but even the exchange process was painless and we had the new sizes within a week and a half . I would definitely buy from them again .
 I loved the dress ! Ive orderd the dress on two seperate times . The first time I orderd it was to see about the sizes , because I read in the reviews that some people felt it was too big/small . I found that the dress really runs true-to-size . Then I orderd the rest of the dresses for my bridesmaids . The dress is made really well , and will hold up . You dont have to worry about it loosing its shape on the bust area because it has parallel stays . Also it is fitted thru the natural natural waist , so again we didnt worry about the other measurments . Honestly I have seen the dress in bridal stores for twice the price , and im glad that I didnt pay the extra price !! The shipping from PacifiPlex was awesome as well . It tells you to expect it in a week or so , and both times it has shown up in under three days !
 I ordered this dress to wear for my friend 's wedding - I was Matron of Ceremony/Disc Jockey so I wanted to look great . I had previously bought two dresses and I must say third time was the charm . I followed the sizing guideline , got the black one and crossed my fingers - I received the dress 6 DAYS before the event . I put it on and MAGIC ! I was complimented all night and felt beautiful . The 50 's style really flattered my curves and the material felt nice against my skin . I had bought spanks to wear underneath but did not need them - yes , the dress was snug up top , but needs to be to stay in place , btw , it did.I would suggest this dress to anyone with curves that wants to feel great !
 My niece was a jr bridesmaid and rocked this dress . It has stury material Nd well worth every penny . Was a great price and very happy
 Dresses are very nicely made and for the most part fit good . Read reviews about them running big . This is helpful . I actually had to return and reorder twice but it was very easy and they are very fast ! I will submit picture after our event ! Thanks ! Amazon is great !
 Great dress . Fit was great and it looked great ! Very fast delivery . Definitely a dress I 'll be able to wear again and again .
 This is the dress I chose for my bridesmaids to wear . They are a range of sizes , skin colors , and ages , and the dress looked fabulous on every single one of them . I wore a royal blue crinoline skirt underneath my tea-length wedding dress , and I chose black dresses for the bridesmaids , but gave them a choice of their color of crinolines , which we had peeking out a couple inches below the hem of the dress.One of my bridesmaids is about a size 18 , one is a size 6 , and one is a size 2 . Two are in their mid-30 's , and one is 13 . This dress was amazing on all of them , and on the 13 year old it was modest enough -LRB- bare shoulders , but no cleavage showing -RRB- . It 's simple and it 's classy , and one of the best parts is IT DOES N'T LOOK LIKE A BRIDESMAID DRESS !! They are actually able to wear the dress again , and have done so ! I had one friend who had been on deck to be one of the bridesmaids but had to pull out a couple of months before the wedding ; she ended up buying a dress and a crinoline anyway , because she liked the look so much.The reason I 'm on Amazon today is that I 'm about to buy one for myself , in black , to be my go-to LBD for the upcoming holiday season . They 're so reasonable , I might get one or two in another color , or another of Pacific Plex 's fabulous dresses .
 I ordered this dress for my Maid of honor . My Bridesmaid also ordered this dress . I had to re-order the dress for the MOH though . My advice to you if you 're going to buy this dress is to order it one size larger than the sizing chart is telling you . Especially if you 're a curvier woman . Now about the dress . It 's very very nice quality Satin , not something I expected when ordering this from Amazon . I 'm a new Amazon.com Customer and did n't really know what to expect at all . Very soft material , I tried the dress on my self before I sent back the first one , it fit me , but did n't fit her . And I loved the way if felt , and did n't want to send it back but could n't afford to buy 2 of them lol . If you 're wondering about the Sash that is fitted to the waistline of the dress , it 's not completely sewn down to the dress so if you decide that you want a smoother look without that then it would be very easy to take it off . This dress has Stays in it at the bust , sides and back , however they 're not at all uncomfortable and you do n't feel them when you sit down , they seem to just be there to add an A-line feel to the dress . Would make for a very simple yet elegant evening dress . : - D
 I bought this dress in white for my informal shotgun wedding ceremony at City Hall . I am typically a 16/18W and I bought a 2X in this dress . -LRB- I have more of an hourglass figure with wider hips and a smaller waist -RRB- . The dress fits true to size and looks very flattering . Also , I am 5 ' 9 and the dress hits just below my knee . I love the satin finish and matching shawl that comes with it . I do have to get the top tailored slightly because it 's too big for my 38C size . Other than that it 's perfect for my event !
 Bridesmaid dress for my youngest daughters wedding it fits my older daughter and the other bridesmaids very well . Your size chart is right on thank you . Mother of the bride ... BonnyJean
 I bought the purple for my daughter to wear for her sisters wedding . She looked gorgeous and the small fit perfectly ! She 's 5 ' 5 '' , 107 lbs .
 We used this dress for our bride ` smaids in my daughter 's wedding.They were very elegant with pearls !
 My friend had her bridal party order these dresses . I ordered 2 sizes . The size that the chart said I should get was way too big . So I ended up needing the smaller one without any alterations . Anyhow , it 's a REALLY cute dress , and the price was VERY affordable . I do n't remember it saying so , but it comes with a matching wrap , and unfinished spaghetti straps that you could have sewn in if you preferred .
 I ordered this dress for a 50 's costume for my teenaged daughter . We fused green polka dots on it and sewed green netting to the bottom slip . It is adorable . The quality of the fabric , the underslip , the straps that can be attatched and the shawl were amazing for the price . Top was pretty large for an extra small , but a little stitching fixed that problem . It arrived to my door in 4 days !
 I bought the chocolate brown dress for my BMs . The dresses came really quick and were ready to wear right out of the box . I am very satisfied with the quality of the dresses and would recommend this dress to any bride on a budget . After my wedding , the girls can absolutely wear this dress over and over again .
 My matron of honor found this website and i was excited because i did n't want the girls to spend a fortune on a dress . The are everything i expected and they a good quality dresses .
 I am thankful to amazon for making the bridesmaid process easy and affordable . The dress is simple , elegant , and worth the price . The sizing chart was very helpful . People who want to order it should understand it 's the type of fabric that will get a few wears out of it . It 's not something I 'd wear if I were not a bridesmaids . I 'm sure it 's great for proms too.My other bridesmaids indicated that returns were a bit troublesome . Ask the vendor in advance if you can return it for credit back to your card rather than credit for another dress IMPORTANT !
 This is a great seller . I loved the dress and the FAST delivery ! Plan to buy 2 more dresses since my sisters loved it too and asked me to get them each their own .
 I fell in love with the 50 's concept for my bridesmaid , so I ordered it for my daughter on a chance that it would be just ok . You see my wedding is in September so I ordered early to give time for returns and changes , behold the dress arrived in just a few days , and it was PERFECT !! The dress is true to size , and it looks great on !! The perfect bridesmaid dress , inexpensive and appropriate for the occasion . Thank God for this dress I no longer have high levels of stress ! Thank you Amazon ! Buy this dress you wont regret it !
 I ordered the dress for my graduation ceremony . After reading the reviews , I ordered a size smaller than usual , and the dress is still too large - particularly in the bust . I am a C cup , but I would need DDDD 's to fill the top , lol . Definitely order at least one size smaller than the size chart states.I was expecting the optional straps to be easily attached with hooks , as has been the case with all of my other strapless dresses . However , they come with nothing to attach them , and you need to sew them on if you want to use them . I wish the bowing -LRB- to maintain the shape -RRB- ran down the entire dress and not just the top . The dress also seems thinner than other satin dresses I have owned , but you get what you pay for.In all , after a little alteration , I think it will be fine for the occassion . I ordered the black , and aside from the fitting , the dress is beautiful .
 These dresses are simple and beautiful . They are easy to alter . They do run big though . The measurments that they provide for the dresses seem to be way off . Buy a smaller size than you think you need so you can avoid exchanges . The price per dress is reasonable . These dresses work for all body types .
 I needed this dress for a January wedding in which I was a bridesmaid . The color of the dress was consistent with pictures I saw , online , and the quality was great for the price . I ordered a medium , but the sizing may run big because I had to have it altered to make it a tad smaller . Perhaps order a size down ? Depending on your measurements that may be the way to go . Otherwise , great buy !
 I got this dress in red just three weeks ago to wear it at a christmas party and I got so many compliments on it . The dress is just gorgeous and the price is incredibly low . Very good quality and it fits perfectly . I ordered a size medium and it was just perfect . I took it out of the package , tried it on and fell in love with it . The red color is just stunning . I ordered it on a sunday night and it came in the mail on wednesday . Very fast delivery . I definitely recommend this dress .
 The fabric is great and the item is exactly as pictured and described . Sizing does run smaller than you think , so order larger !
 I ordered these dresses in chocolate brown for my bridesmaids and they were AMAZING ! Great material and craftsmanship and the shaws the come with make the dresses even classier and classic !
 My husband and I were having a summer wedding on a budget , but I had 6 bridesmaids I had to buy dresses for . I knew it was going to cost a fortune if I went to a place like David 's Bridal . So I typed `` cheap black bridesmaids dresses '' into the google search and this dress popped up on Amazon as the first link . I was hesitant at first , afraid the color would be off , or the material would be bad , but I bought one dress anyway to have one of my bridesmaids try on . When it arrived -LRB- fast delivery may I add -RRB- and I felt the material I was amazed that it only cost $ 50 . My bridesmaid tried it on and it fit like a glove and looked gorgeous on her . So I ordered the rest -LRB- I ordered a size bigger for those I was n't too sure of , I always go a size up because they can always take it in -RRB- and spent only $ 300 for 6 dresses where I would have easily spent $ 1000 on 6 bridesmaids dresses if I went anywhere else . They looked great on the girls -LRB- see my photo I submitted -RRB- . I was pleased with everything about the dress .
 Bought this to wear as a guy in a dress on Halloween ... . I was Barbie . It fit well and I received numerous compliments and questions as to wear I purchased it .
 I just opened my package and was surprisingly pleased - before I even tried the dress on ! Very soft satin , almost silky . I was afraid it was going to be made out of that gross , stiff bridesmaids ' material ... It 's about half a size too big in the bust area -LRB- I took measurements and ordered accordingly -RRB- , but nothing a quick alteration ca n't fix !! I ordered it in black and plan to overlay it with white lace for my wedding - not exactly a conventional bride . I 'm so excited that I called my mother right away and told her I could finally stop looking for a gown!I 'm a curvy girl -LRB- 5 ' 9 '' , size 16/18 - got the 2X -RRB- , and this dress makes me feel beautiful . It hits right under the knee , which is PERFECT . Enough room underneath for crinoline , easy enough to add halter straps to if I want to . Looks amazing great with a little cardigan , even better with adorable fishnets and some kitten heels!Could NOT be happier with the service , quality and overall experience with this dress and this company .
 i ordered this dress in size x-large based on multiple customer comments that the dresses run a size larger than the size chart indicates . the dress was too small . i reordered it based on the size chart given and it fit perfectly.i received both dresses within 4 days of placing my order . the return process was simple and quick - i received my refund quickly and without any hassle.i will be wearing this dress soon for my wedding.could not be happier with the dress-very good quality for the price-and very good customer service.will post pics after the wedding.hope this is helpful to someone .
 The dress is absolutely adorable . I ordered this dress along with a back-up , -LRB- strapless satin tulle prom dress with black lace trim -RRB- from this company , as a destination wedding dress . I placed my order late Thursday night and received both in the mail the following Monday ... proof that in-stock items are shipped out ASAP . The quality of work/material is very nice on both styles . -LRB- thick satin , fully lined , no flaws -RRB- I did n't notice if they stated in the description , but the dresses are made in USA . Also , I am very pleased with the fit . If you are unsure or uneasy about ordering a size , go by the size chart measurements . They are completely accurate . It is hard to tell about the length in the pics , I am 5 ' 4 '' and the dress falls mid-calf , tea-length . I am very pleased with both dress ' styles , prices , and the company . I definitely recommend ordering items from Pacifiplex .
 I ordered this dress in white for a reception dress for my wedding . I wanted something more casual with room to move , and thought that this dress was very pretty and affordable . Let me start with the good
 This company was amazing !! I ordered the Blue dress , and it 's gorgeous and I love it !!!! Yes , I originally was sent the wrong size , but their policies on dealing with the mistake were excellent . They have amazing customer service , and I would DEFINETLY buy from them again . Shipping time very expedient , and I was just really impressed . Great quality for such a low price !! I would recommend them to everyone !
 I recently purchased the Fuchsia dress for my daughter 's surprise 13th birthday party . I purchased 4 others colors from Go Jane . The girl 's thought they were bridesmaid 's in a rainbow wedding but SURPRISE , lol.The Fuchsia color was bright with a gorgeous shine . The sizing is fairly accurate , remember I bought for younger girls so they had to be sized . The dress comes with strap 's that can be sewn in & with the matching wrap . Really quick shipping !!! The best part is ... . the dress is not just for weddings or prom 's . The dress is n't Plain-Jane but it 's not to fancy either and there 's no age limit , anyone would look nice in one . Just look at the pictures I posted.Great deal for the price !!!! I highly recommend
 I bought this dress for my parents 25th anniversary vow renewal ceremony . It arrived very quickly . It was a little longer than I expected , but that was no big deal . I also had to have it taken in some , but I was preparing to have that done anyway since I do n't have perfect proportions . It was really cute though , and I got a lot of comments on how great I look . Plus you ca n't be the price & quick delivery !
 I bought this dress for my daughter 's 6th grade graduation and it fit wonderfully . The dress was constructed well - better than some of the dresses that she tried on in famous department stores . The dresses -LRB- I ordered a different style from same seller -RRB- arrived in a matter of days - literally !!! She was too excited when I zip her into her dress - I knew from the look in her eyes that this was the one that she was going to wear . I did sew the straps onto her dress so that it did n't come off risque ' . The problem with girls - tweens - is that they 're tired of looking like little girls but do n't want to look like older girls -LRB- there is a balance that you have to find -RRB- and this dress fit the mold . Coupled with some flat ballerina like shoes - she looked like a walking doll . I would recommend this dress most definitely.PS I almost forgot to talk about the sizing of this dress - true to size . The zipper on this dress is sturdy not the delicate zipper . I was n't afraid that this one would break . My daughter is tall for her age at 11 she weighs 105 pounds and is about 5 feet 2 inches . And I ordered a size 3 and was happy with the results .
 My daughter wore this dress as a bridesmaid . It was really cute for the price considering she may never wear it again . The quality was n't bad at all . The shawl that came with it made it an even better value .
 The fit was incrediable ! The dresses were for my bride 's maids at my wedding ! So eligant ! I was every pleased by the product . It was so much cheaper than buying from a store or dress shop !
 The color was perfect . The fit was a little snug but overall the dress was very pretty . I liked the idea that it had a wrap included .
 This dress was ordered for a friends wedding that I was in . The item arrived very quick and the measurements measured up to exactly the size I ordered . For the price all of us in the wedding party were very satisfied with the quality of this dress .
 So it should be noted that this is a JUNIOR dress , so the sizing is junior sizing . If you are not a junior , you may need to size up . I ordered a Large and it was too small , so I ordered an XL and it is too big . SO sad because this really is a beautiful dress !! It is well made , and the style is lovely ! It comes with a satin shawl . There is some boning in the bodice which helps it to keep its shape .
 nice dress came way to big but over all love it . I was able to get it altered . They color was perfect as well
 This dress got to me very quickly , was very nicely made , and I got lots of compliments . It was also very comfortable unlike most dresses these days . Thank you very much !
 i want 5 of these dresses with a white sash but in liliac i really love the dress pl.us i will be getting married in 5 months !!! this dress took my eyes away it wiuld mean soo much to me if you had more than 1 dress.if you did i would be the HAPPIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD . THIS DRESS IS THE COLOR I WANT AND THE STYLE AND ITS `` FREAKY FABLOUS '' I LOVE IT TO DEATH !!! SIGNED , ALEXANDRA WILLIAMS
 This dress may be simple looking , but it is elegant . Just note that the sizes run a bit bigger than what is stated in the sizing chart . This dress would be perfect for any special occasion . I purchased this dress for my bridesmaid . It looks stunning on her !
 thanks for the super fast shipping , this dress really is super comfortable !! thanks to the other that wrote their reviews , it really helped when deciding weather or not to purchase this dress !
 I spent less on 3 of these dresses -LRB- purchased for 3 bridesmaids -RRB- than I spent on 1 dress I wore in a different wedding that I will NEVER be able to wear again ! This dress is gorgeous and I can wear it again for a night out with my DH.The dresses were shipped VERY quickly , arriving in less than a week . 1 was on backorder and that arrived just 1 week after the initial order was placed.Sizing is generous , so the dresses fit a bit looser than regular dress sizes and can easily be altered down . If you do n't want to bother with alterations , the PacificPlex return policy is fabulous and their customer service is outstanding .
 This Satin Formal is just beautiful ! It 's got great substance and form . It comes with a satin sash which is great ! I just chose not to wear a strapless dress and returned the item .
 I received the dress in 3 business days . For me , the dress is true to size and a VERY flattering cut . The only thing I have to do is get the sides taken in a notch at the bust line . The fabric quality is great . I 'm 5 ' 4 and the dress comes down to mid-shin for me . I love that it comes with detachable spaghetti straps and a shoulder wrap . I 'll be wearing this to a company party ... but I know that I will wear it again ! I 'm glad I got this .
 I had to quickly find a dress to go to a wedding , and I was distressed by how little I could find in my size readily available on the web or in stores . Amazon was the last place I looked and this is the first thing that popped up , and it 's perfect . It fits , it 's appropriate , and it 's cheap and fast . If you 're plus size and tearing your hair out over how slim the pickings are -LSB- especially if you have an ounce of taste and do n't like the traditional plus size color palette/prints -RSB- , this is your solution . Also , the only alternatives I found were all `` special order at least two months ahead '' gowns . Hello , who does anything two months ahead any more ? If time is not a luxury you can afford , this is your solution as well .
 I recently purchased this item and it was a really cute dress , looked good on , but I chose to go with something else for personal reasons . But just to give a heads up -- people mentioned that it ran super small and it really did n't for me . I bought a M and a L and I am almost always a size 6 , and the M perfectly fit me in this dress . Definitely worth the money . And it shipped really quickly , and I also returned them with no problems as well .
 This was the bridesmaid dress for my sisters wedding . It fit well based in the sizing chart provided and is of quality construction . Very comfortable . The dress also comes with a sash to cover the shoulders and spaghetti straps in case you 're uncomfortable with a strapless dress .
 I decided this was the dress to wear in the wedding of my cousin . It was very beautiful , dressy enough for the wedding and I wore it again on a cruise . It was long enough and fell where i thought it should which suprised me considering I am much taller than most . .
 I ordered one for my bridesmaids to try on and they all love it ... will be ordering 4 more soon !
 Dress was exactly as described . The fit was true to size . Perfect color . The dress is just what we needed for a perfect bridesmaid dress .
 I ordered this dress in black for my three bridesmaids . They are lightweight and very flattering . It fits nicely on all three even though they are various shapes and sizes . I would definitely order by the bust size first , then waist , but the size chart is pretty accurate . I would definitely recommend buying this dress , especially for the price . It 's much nicer than many of the $ 100 + dresses I found in stores .
 The dress was very well made I can not complain about that at all . I knew it was not going to fit when I purchased it based on previous reviews so I expected alterations . But with the money you save the 30 dollars to adjust is nothing .
 I purchased this dress for my daughter , who was a Jr. . Bridesmaid in her sister 's wedding . It was perfect in every way , and the price was unbelieveable . Also the shawl came in very handy . The fit was almost perfect - I just had to pull it in very little on the top , side seam , and that was a very easy fix . Highly recommended .
 I bought this dress for my daughter , who is my Maid of Honor at my upcoming wedding . The dress is gorgeous ! The perfect shade of red . The style is beautiful . The dress shipped and arrived faster than expected . . which is always great ! A great buy !
 MY SISTER LOOKED BEAUTIFUL IN THIS GOWN . IT WAS FOR MY WEDDING & SHE BLENDED RIGHT IN WITH THE LADIES WEARING MORE EXPENSIVE GOWNS . IT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY , AND WAS EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED . THE FABRIC WAS A BIT THIN , BUT IT WAS PRACTICALLY PERFECT !!
 I bought this dress because I was playing a 50 's housewife in the school play . The dress worked perfectly . I got many compliments on the dress an will probably where it to lots of weddings this summer .
 I was in need for a dress for my civil ceremony and ordered this one in white . The dress was great , but unfortunately it was WAY too big on top . I bought it according to the sizing chart , but should have ordered it a size down as well . Unfortunately I did n't have time to re-order , but I totally would have .
 Its a very beautiful little brown dress . My only problem is I 'm a busty gal , and it does n't zip all the way in the back , but it fits everywhere else . That 's a `` my body '' problem more than a manufacturer problem . Bigger chested women keep that in mind !
 My aunt bought this dress for my graduation coming in June , and it fits very nicely ! She bought both sizes Extra Small and Small , since my measurements stated I 'd be a small -- but with the reviews I 've read , we were unsure of what size to actually get . The extra small fit very snug , and that 's good since I did n't want to have to fashion straps to keep it up under my graduation gown . But I wo n't have to worry about that . It fits perfectly , and the colour is exact to what it shows on the website , though it is a BIT darker -- nothing drastic of course . The dress is nice and simple , what I like since I do n't often wear dresses , and it feels nice , too , because it 's made of Satin , which is smooth . Just go by the size chart , it 's accurate .
 This was a very nice looking dress ; however , I ended up returning this item because it was too big for me .
 I received my dress yesterday in Aqua . I am a size 12 , ordered a XL -LRB- 11-13 -RRB- It fits perfect . It even came w / matching shawl . I am wearing in August as a Mother of the Groom dress . I am extremely satisfied w / the quality and color.The price is great too . This dress is a Fabulous value . Order today !!
 My kickball/football league had a prom , and the theme was Enchantment Under The Sea -LRB- you know , like from Back to the Future . -RRB- I wanted a dress that looked 50s but did n't cost me and arm and a leg.This dress came and it was perfect ! The sizing was great , it fit right out of the package , I did n't have to do anything to it . I got compliments on how cute it was all night ! Because I got such a bright color , I have n't had another occasion to wear it yet , but I am eagerly waiting for one !
 I bought two of these dresses for my bridesmaids . They arrived very quickly , for starters . They both say that their dresses fit very nicely , with only minor alterations needed . They also tell me that the dresses flatter them in all the right places and are incredibly comfy.I picked these dresses because I wanted them to have something that did n't scream bridesmaid dress !!!! Something that they could wear for more than just one occasion . And they could n't be happier.On a note about the seller , one of the girls recieved the wrong item at first . The seller was very prompted in this concern . They sent a lable to sent back the wrong item free of charge and refunded my card asap so I could order the dress again . They even offered to waive one day delivery charge if I needed , which I did n't . I completely recommend this product and this company. : D
 I love these dresses on my bridesmaids ! They really like them too . If you want the straps on them you have to sew them in . Not a huge deal but I thought they would have hooks to attach them to .
 I bought this dress as a bridesmaid for my best friend 's wedding . It arrived quickly and with minimal amount of wrinkles which is great considering it was shipped . I 'm a 8 up top and this dress fit snugly enough so I did n't have to pull it up all night and was big enough on the bottom for my size 10 hips and butt . I did wear `` spanx '' under it just to hide my ginormous belly button . I 'm 5 ' 7 '' and this dress hit me just bellow my knees which was perfect !
 I ordered the size suggested by my measurements on the size chart , and it worked out perfectly . I wrestled a bit with the black straps to hang the dress with , they kept wanting to come out , but I plan to take it to a seamstress to remove them . For the lower price I was very satisfied with the quality .
 Big thank you to the seller for a very beautiful bridesmaids dresses ! The price was reasonable , delivery very quick and customer service was excellent . My bridesmaids will look absolutely beautiful in those dresses next spring at my wedding !
 This is the dress that my bridesmaids and I settled on after trying the rusched dress and bubble dress by PacificPlex . Though the others were racey and youthful , they turned out to be inappropriate for the wedding . This dress however is the classic/traditional formal dress we were looking for . The satin is nice , light weight , and a little stretchy , which means you wo n't have to worry about pulling the dress up all night . It fits true to the size chart . It is a nice legnth , couple inches above the knee . It came with spaghetti straps if you need them -LRB- must attach yourself -RRB- . Still , for the price we were easily able to afford minor alterations as needed . We are very happy with this dress .
 I along with 3 other bridesmaids purchased this dress last summer for my best friends wedding . It looked great on different body types and you ca n't beat the price . We ALL went a SIZE UP in the dresses . Which is different than some reviewers said . I thought the measurements were accurate but their related size was too big ie . a small should really be called an extra small etc. . Even still , I love these dresses so much I think I am going to use them -LRB- in different colors of course -RRB- for my own wedding !
 I recently ordered this dress for a wedding I will soon be attending . Everything went very smoothly , it was shipped quickly , and the dress is real pretty in person . The only problem I had was the size . I went by the size chart , and the size I ordered was WAY too small . I ended up reordering the dress 2 sizes bigger than I would normally wear , and now it fits . I had no problem returning it , and receiving the new dress promptly .
 This was a pretty dress and a great deal ! I ordered it for my Christmas party last year . Shipping was super fast -LRB- to Alaska even ! -RRB- and the item was received as expected ... except I could have fit a half an extra person in the dress ! I had gone off the dress measurements specifications and still got a super big surprise.Returning was NO problem , I was a little bummed I could n't get a size Medium back in time for my party . All 's well that ended well though . I found another dress and looked smashing!I give 4 stars because of the super fast shipping and returns !
 Gorgeous dress , great quality the size chart it 's correct . I recommend this dress to anyone .
 I bought this dress for a wedding as I am a bridesmaid . It arrived extremely quick and the dress is beautiful ! The fit is perfect and the quality is exceptional especially for the price . I would definitely purchase from this company again .
 These dresses are awesome , if you are looking for something plain but elegant these are the perfect dresses , I ordered the red for my bridesmaids , and they love them , I ordered the sizes according to their size and not one had to have anything altered . The best part is that I saved them a tonne of money , there is nothing worse then having to pay for a 300.00 dress when you can order this dress for a 1/4 of the price . I am so happy I found this dress .
 I bought this dress in white to use as my informal dress for our evening reception . It is perfect the sizing was right on and it was made so well . Over the next few weeks I will be buying five more for my bridesmaids . The product is great and the price is a bargain .
 I ordered this for my bridesmaids for my wedding.The delivery time was great . It looked exactly as in the picture . it was by far the best deal after looking for several weeks . And since my girls very in size so much this dress was a great choice .
 I was very pleased with the dress when it arrived . The color was not `` too '' red and the fit is good . The length is just right for my body , not too short , not too long . I received compliments from my family when I tried the dress on . Overall , I am very pleased with the dress . Initially , I was a little concerned about not liking the dress . Sometimes ordering clothing on the internet leaves you dissatisfied with your purchase , this was not the case .
 Since I 've been a bridesmaid in a few weddings before , I vowed to my friends that I would never make them spend too much on their own dresses when the time came for my wedding.Well , it just so happened that I was married this past summer and after doing a lot of research I came across this dress . I was a little scared at first because all of my bridesmaids were located in different states but low and behold when the big day did come they all looked spectacular in their dresses . They were especially thankful for being able to afford it and not letting it make a cramp in their budget.The only thing to be said about this dress is that it gets a little long and may need some hemming up on the girls . Still , you can not beat the price and these certainly were made with quality and care.I am very pleased once again with the purchase and promised myself that after the wedding I would share our experience with others ! A + for everything !! * JRose *
 I ordered this dress on Tuesday and it was here on Friday . I could n't believe it .
 I bought this at the last minute so my daughter could participate in a friend 's wedding.Although , I do not like their shipping method , USPS , I LOVED the dress -- so much I bought one too . The guests at the wedding could not believe we only paid $ 50.00 for the dresses . They are well made , they run ONE size larger in the bust area.The dress I was originally supposed to wear in the wedding , was by Calvin Klein and it cost $ 200 . This dress was lined and had a better quality that my $ 200 dress !
 The dress is very beautiful . The color -LRB- skyblue -RRB- is a wonderful reminder of blue skies on a cloudless day . The size 14 fits exact ! With that said , you must measure your body . My reason why I gave it a 5-star -LRB- regardless to the stain found on the scarf -LRB- mantoncillo -RRB- -RRB- is because of the quality of the dress & the rapid shipping service -LRB- with tracking -RRB- . Addendum -LRB- 5.20.09 -RRB-
 very good . . very pretty dress will be perfect as a bridesmaid very fast return because i ordered the wrong size
 I had a super small wedding and ordered this dress , and it was just what I wanted ! It fit perfectly and I looked beautiful ! I am 100 % satisfied with it . My only caution to you about it is to be sure that you have a steamer handy to get the wrinkles out from shipping .
 Every bit as nice as the picture looks . Fabric is nice and sturdy . Very good value for the price .
 I bought this dress in royal blue at a little shop in the mall for $ 90 . I had a TON of compliments on it during the wedding and felt like I looked great . Because of the boning in the top and flare out bottom , I did n't feel like I needed any kind of girdle or nylons to control my tummy or rear . I just found this dress an Amazon for $ 40 cheaper and I since I already know how great it is , I am going to buy it again in black for another wedding I am in later this year ! TIP
 This is a great buy for several reasons . The fabric is of a quality grade satin and it 's got a strong zipper , its an all around flattering line for different body shapes , and PacificPlex sends out your delivery in a wink ! I ordered my red version on a Wednesday morning and recieved it that Saturday afternoon . I have one issue with this dress
 I purchased this dress to be the maid of honor in my best friends wedding . It arrived quickly , looked great , and was an awesome price . It would be hard to beat this great deal !
 After reading the reviews about all the sizing problems , I was pretty confused about what size to order . My measurements are generally 32 '' or 33 '' bust , 26 '' or 27 '' waist , depending on the day . I hesitantly ordered the SMALL , even though the chart says it measures at 31 '' -32 '' bust and 25.5 '' waist . When it arrived and I tried it on , however , it fell right off me . Even with a padded bra on , it was way too big . So I got out my tape measure and checked out the measurements myself . I got 33 '' bust and 27.5 '' waist.So , even though the actual measurements of the garment are closer to my real size , it 's still too big . I 'm pretty sure it 's because of the nature and design of this particular dress . Being strapless , it needs to fit a lot snugger than a dress you would wear that 's held up by straps . Also , unlike a lot of strapless dress styles , this one does n't have any elastic or sticky trim to keep it up . It DOES have boning throughout , however , which is a nice feature that helps it stay in place -LRB- once you have the right size -RRB- and keeps its shape.I returned the garment and ordered the X-SMALL , which arrived quickly . It fits nice and snug and measures at 31 '' bust and 25 '' waist -LRB- which is NOT what the chart tells you ! -RRB- Overall a wonderful dress ; nice fabric , classic style that is flattering on most figures , understated and elegant , well-manufactured . Very clean , very sweet ! ... And I lived happily ever after in my pretty satin dress . I hope this helped !
 I love this dress . I ordered this dress at the last minute and it was delievered in due time . I even had a few days to spare before my big event and had the dress altered . Since I am a big girl , I ordered a 3X and it fit very well . I received ALOT of compliments . The material is strong . I personally think it 's worth the time and money . The color I ordered was black .
 I got this dress as a bride 's maid dress for my brother 's wedding . Even though my natural waist measurement is 32 inches -LRB- exactly -RRB- , I followed the advice from one of my fellow maids and ordered a size down . It just arrived and it fits like a glove -- a smokin ' hot , sexy glove . I might just have a new go-to dress : -RRB-
 Honestly , I do n't see how this dress could get anything other than 5 stars . For starters , it 's at least half the price of ANY boutique bridesmaid dress -LRB- it 's almost the spitting image of a David 's Bridal dress I saw in the exact same color and style for $ 135 -RRB- . Second , they DO run big , but my bm 's got alterations for 25 dollars or less and that 's STILL cheaper than boutiques . Third , they 're very high quality , boning for support , and just so darn pretty ! -LRB- My bms wore the aqua dress in the customer photos -RRB- . Thanks Pacific Plex !!!
 The dress is for my bridesmaids and the style is perfect for a back yard wedding . The satin look does n't make it look cheap . And the price fits in the budget of all bridesmaids ; some in college , just bought a house or have multiple people in my bridal party . I had been looking at some Alfred Angelo dresses in the 148-190 price range.There is only one minor set back . For my wedding design I wanted to replace the bow and ribbon with one of another color and there is no easy wash of removing just that ribbon , it 's sewn in through all layers around the zipper . But we found a solution without taking the whole dress apart . We are going to attach the new ribbon to the one already there in the back . -LRB- Just in case someone else has the same idea -RRB- . Overall very worth it !!!!!
 Love this dress ! Using it as my wedding dress ! I 'm so excited for fiance to see me in it soon !
 I ordered this dress as a trial to use for a bridesmaid dress . The dress is very nice looking and the quality is great but the color -LRB- slate -RRB- is not really a grey , it is more a shiny silver . The color is very pretty but if you are looking for a flat grey this is n't really close . I also had two other small problems with the dress . It is longer than it looks . I am short , 5 ' 2 &#34; so that is part of the problem but it is still more shin length than knee length . The other issue is I am very busty , -LRB- DD -RRB- and the dress held the girls in but it did n't cover as high as it would with a normal size chest -LRB- I think -RRB- . It has small &#34; ribs &#34; ? in the torso seams , so it probably would n't work very well for a small cup size either . I guess that means that they did a good job of shaping this dress for the average woman . Also , and this is not good or bad but the belt is sewn on . It does n't tie at the bow , it is sewn into the dress on either side of the zipper at the back and would not be easy to remove . It also comes with a shawl in the same material as the dress . I ended up having to send it back because the bride was looking for a much darker grey and a little more embelleshment , but I would recommend this dress as a either a nice party dress or as a bridesmaid dress because it is good quality for the money .
 It is a very lovely dress . I just thought it was going to be a little bit longer . I 'm glad it was n't because i do n't need to get it shorten .
 The dress looks exactly how it does in the picture . it 's a nice dress I got it for my friends wedding . The dress fit nearly perfect just the top was a little big . Overall I would recommend this dress to others .
 I wore this dress for my wedding and it was absolutely wonderful . There was very little altering I had to do for the fit , and the length was exactly what I wanted ! The wedding was outside , and even though it was a little warm the dress was still comfortable to wear all day . For a semi-formal wedding , this was perfect ! My bridesmaids also had this same style in red and they were just a beautiful ! And each of their dresses fit just about perfectly .
 I ordered this dress and recieved it the next day . It 's a gorgeous dress made from a good quality material . The only problem for me was the sizing . it was way too big ! When I ordered , I ordered a large based on my hip measurement needing to be that big . I should have went with the medium -LRB- which was the right size for my chest/waist measurements -RRB- . Luckily , the dress fit one of the other bridesmaids perfectly so i didnt have to send it back . I reordered a medium and it 's perfect !! Thanks to pacificplex for making it possible to get beautiful bridesmaid dresses that are inexpensive , and arrive quickly -LRB- the wedding is in 2 weeks !!! -RRB-
 I got it for my wedding the girls loved them . perfec fit . I was also suprise with the good quality of material . My bridesmaids looked just beautiful thanks .
 I am very pleased with this dress . I bought it for a reception dress for my wedding in October . I was so happy when it arrived . I tried it on and the only alterations that it needs is taken-in in the bust . I have a very small chest so that was what I expected.It does have a very small snag that is on the stomach region that goes all the way around it . But I do n't think its too noticeable . And for the price I ca n't justify complaining .
 I wore this dress to my senior prom and got nothing but compliments . It fit well and was VERY comfortable , it was MUCH cheaper than everyone else 's dress , and -- unlike many styles these days -- was n't too revealinig . I would absolutely reccomend it .
 I actually ordered a 2x for my maid of honor though the size chart put her as a small 3x , and it 's still a bit big . I think if she had larger breasts it would be fine though . I ordered it knowing it might be too large so I 'm not really worried that I have to have it altered . The material is decent . It 's certainly not as nice as what you would get for a $ 200 dress , but it 's not anything like pleather as some people have said and it feels just fine . It 's pretty much the same quality that you would expect for a $ 50 dress . I ordered the dress about a week ago so the delivery was pretty fast . It came the exact day that I was told to expect it . We ordered ice blue which looks almost exactly the same as the silver in the photos but it is actually blue which is what I was hoping . I found it really confusing reading so many posts about how the dress ran large and then a few saying it ran small . In my opinion is does run a bit large .
 We ordered these and removed the thin ribbon bow . Black velvet and gold shimmer wide ribbon trim was added back around waist . With very simple modification these made very elegant bridesmaid dresses for a 102 degree , outdoor June wedding , when worn with black satin sandals.We did light alterations where needed , and the dress is easy to alter . -LRB- I 'm mother of bride , definately not a pro ... but took in 2 out 5 dresses by myself -RRB- We had another enlarged by a pro by using an additional dress ordered to get a desired size that was otherwise unavailable for purchase.With the shawls , these are dresses that are a wardrobe staple unlike so many bridesmaid dresses ... these are the simple , little black dress that everyone needs . All 5 of our bridesmaids loved them and kept the original ribbon bow for post wedding re-attachment , regaining the simplicity . They can easily be dressed up with any color trim , bow , belting etc. ... highly recommend , particularly if budget coscious , save here on the dress to splurge elsewhere !!!
 We bought these for the bridesmaids for our daughter 's wedding . We got the Aqua and it is a beautiful color , and a very nice thick satin . We were happy to see that the dress is also lined . They come with spaghetti straps that you choose to use or not . We have decided to use one of the straps , and I am making silk flowers to put up one shoulder - kind of the new thing in bridesmaid dresses that we have seen at some of the bridal shops . We are also removing the attached belt , and replacing with a ribbon that will go with my daughter 's chosen colors.We are very happy with the dress , the price and the color!Pay attention to the sizing chart . It seems to be about right , so measure correctly and you should n't have any problem getting the right size .
 I planned a simple ceremony so I needed a simple dress . I bought this dress in white and had my seamstress add straps and lace to the bodice . Overall I was very happy with the quality of the dress and since it comes with a useless sash there was plenty of fabric for the alterations I wanted . I went by the size chart and after reading all the comments already posted I ordered one size smaller than the chart . Well , it fit but was a bit snug . I had to have the dress let out , had I ordered the next size bigger I would have had to make it smaller . The price was terrific , in fact since I used Amazon points I paid nothing for it and only $ 35 for alterations and I had a custom dress .
 I bought this dress for my sister in my July wedding . She does have a tall frame and it hit right below the knees . It looked very beautiful and I am pleased of how it turned out . Including it came with a shawl , which I didn not know about . :-RRB- Very good price .
 I ordered this dress in chocolate and i love it :0 -RRB- it is not a cheap material and looks very nice ... It came in very fast I ordered late monday night and it came in on firday ... I had first ordered a 3x and it was way to big I went by the chart and my bust and waist measured to the 3x but when it arrived it slipped right off lol I was gon na get it altered but I decided to send it back for a refund because the other reviews i read said it took a long time for an exchange but I really dont think it would have been a long time so I got a refund and then ordered the 2x and it fits perfect -LRB- a little bit big in the bust area like half inch to an inch -RRB- ... So If u order this dress in da chocolate i would order a size smaller than ur measurements ... Im excited to wear it for the wedding I will b standing in on July 15th ... I bought the multi glitter hills to go with the dress and it looks so cute ... Also the dress comes with a sash but I wont use it and it has straps that u have to sew on and I am gon na sew them on because I think it will hold my girls in a lil better lol ... when i tried on the dress i put my hands up -LRB- I was dancing -RRB- and it felt like my girls were about to pop out lol ... I dont wear strapless tops so i Think the straps will help ... but dont think twice just order it and if it dosnt fit send it back and reorder it !!! The 2nd time I ordered it I went to the website and got a 10 % discount ... Happy shopping ladies and good luck and hope u all have a great experience like i did
 its was sucj = h a good price that when it did n't fit me i just gave it to a friend prices are always wonderful on amazon.com : -RRB-
 1st time customer of PacificPlex , and will certainly not hesitate to order from them again . Ordered early last Friday morning , and had it in my hands -LRB- halfway across the country -RRB- late Monday morning via regular shipping - WOWZA ! The dress fits like a glove -LRB- ordered Small , I 'm 36-26-34 -RRB- . Was surprised at the high quality of material and how well it was made . Purchased specifically as a `` Personal Attendant '' dress - did n't want to be too formal or infringe upon the actual bridesmaids , so the tea-length style of this dress will be perfect . Now if only PacificPlex sold shoes ... those I still have to find and purchase to complete this ensemble !
 This dress is a steal ! Amazing shipping time !! I ordered 7 for my bridesmaids on a Friday and got them on Monday . They were all a size too big , so I had to exchange a few but , again , the shipping time was amazing . Shipped them out Tuesday , got them back Friday ! The girls are all different body shapes and sizes but it looks perfect on all of them . And the price ! The girls all appreciated not having to pay out the nose for a dress they get to wear once . 50 $ ! It does n't get any cheaper than that . I would recommend this dress to anyone on a budget , just make sure to order it a size smaller than what the sizing chart says !
 This is the second time in just over one year that we choose to go with this product . We bought them as bridesmaids dresses for my sister 's wedding a year ago here in the US and for my cousin 's wedding later this year in the Caribbean . We LOVE the price , the fast shipping and the easy return and refund if this item does not work . We all love the fact that you can still personalize each dress by using different straps or even making it more fitted at the bottom for a more mature look . The sizing is the only problem - I would suggest buying one that corresponds to the size chart and then a size below because the sizes tend to run too large - but overall this is a great product !!
 We needed a cheap priced dress for the maids to wear for my friend 's wedding . The dresses looked great and everyone could afford the dress .
 This dress is a great deal and great quality . I plan on using them as bridesmaid dresses and the fact that they come in so many colors and sizes is exactly what I needed .
 I ordered this for a Christmas Party I will be attending this year . I ordered red , but became worried it would be more of a fire engine red ... it actually turned out to be a deeper color and is GORGEOUS ! I am absolutely happy with it . It was delivered quickly . I put it on this morning when I received it and it fits perfectly . The only issue I have is wanting a little shape to the bottom , so I 'm having a bit of tulle put on the slip so that it will bell out a bit . However , I would recommend it ... I 'm a pretty big girl and it fits me well and looks great ! Thanks !
 I ordered this dress in black as a bridesmaids dress . B/c of some of the confusion over size I ordered 2 -LRB- L & XL -RRB- . My measurements are 38-30-38 and I 'm curvy . I wear a 10ish usually -LRB- hope all this helps some of you -RRB- . I love this dress , it is great quality and comparable to one I tried on a a bridal store for $ 110 . I 'm keeping the L , it is a little snug in my mid-tummy , but I was able to zip it by myself . I plan on losing an inch and a few pounds anyhow , so that problem will be fixed . I recommend this dress to anyone for any type occasion . The shipping was super speedy , got my dress in 3 bus . days . Sending the other one back for a refund -LRB- hope there is no problem there .
 Was hesitant to purchase because of the price . I was not expecting such quality for the price . I am very very pleased with the fit . It came with a matching shawl and satin straps that I can attach to the dress myself , which I thought was nice because I do n't really feel comfortable wearing strapless dresses . I actually ordered two other styles of dresses from this company when I purchased this one to make sure I had a dress suitable to wear for my occasion . I was pleasantly pleased with all of them . They all fit well . I purchased Mediums -LRB- my measurements are 34-29-41 , pear-shaped -RRB- and this dress flatters my figure . I will be purchasing others . I found that the dresses fit according to the sizing chart that is one of the pictures shown .
 Some others had reviewed that they are sized large . I do not agree at all . I 'm ordering them as my bridesmaids ' dresses . None of them fit ; I had to go a size larger . My wedding dress is a size 8 , and a large fit me perfectly . They are good quality , a nice length , and are flattering to most shapes and sizes . I recommend them , but do not buy smaller sizes as usual as others recommended .
 I purchased this dress in white for my civil ceremony wedding in December - it arrived quickly , within a week of purchase . I ordered according to my measurements and it only needed a small adjustment for the bust , which was expected and and inexpensive . It is very well constructed and now that I am having a formal and religious ceremony I will have my bridesmaids order this same dress from PacificPlex .
 I looked high and low for a burnt orange bridesmaid dress with very little success unless I wanted to spend a small fortune . I stumbled upon this lovely dress in pumpkin and both I and the bride found it to be the perfect color and a great simple style . It arrived quickly and painlessly . I took the advice of the other reviewers and completely ignored their size chart . I 'm normally a size small top , so that 's what I ordered , though my actual measurements are a bit larger than the size small on the chart . The dress fits great and stays up because of the boning . I 've seen many of the designer dresses in person and most really are n't made any better or of better materials than this one . It 's an amazing value for your money . The only thing that would improve this dress is a lining , though that would drive up the cost . I would highly recommend this dress for bridesmaids . So cute and easy on the wallet , plus it comes in a ton of great colors .
 Very pleased with my dress ! Wore it as my wedding dress in Las Vegas on 11/07 ! Awesome material and lightening fast delivery ! Thank you !
 I bought this product for my wedding for my bridesmaids . I read all the reviews and they all pretty much said that it ran big , like to the fact , everyone said it fell off of them . So I bought one mediums and two large . Even though all of them are really skinny , I got the large because it would only let me get one medium and my own friend has a very large top to her . I was so paranoid that it was going to be huge on them , so to my surprise when they went to try the dress , all of them were very very tight.I would have to say this dress runs actually small . So if I were you I would get just a size bigger than you normally get.Then you are probably thinking why I rated this product a five then . Well because I think this company was excellent to work with . I sent them an e-mail saying I want to exchange the dress but I wanted the dress to come in speed shipping . They sent me an email back within the next day to advise me to just order a new dress and send in the old dress for a full refund.I did n't want to pay extra for the speed shipping so I just got the standard shipping but it was still here within 5 days . I got the full refund . The only thing I lost was the money to send back the dress , but this company was very understanding and very easy to work with . I was very happy with the income .
 I love this dress it complimented me and was a reasonable price , great as a bridesmaid dress
 I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who was in her Aunt 's wedding . I was very hesitant about getting a strapless dress for her at her agebut I was pleasantly surprised how sweet it was on her . She wore little satin ballet slippers and she was absolutely gorgeous . She received so many compliments on her dress . She is a size 5-6 and the medium fit her perfectly ! I would recommend this dress to everyone !!!!
 Looks and fits great ! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform . He loves them ...
 I 'm glad i got these shirts , i need them for work and they are working very well theyre long enough so that when you bend over or crouch down you do n't have to keep pulling them down , the material feels nice , and they dont shrink very much in the wash so they still fit fine after 5 washes . They are n't very thick or very thin so theres no problem there.I 'd recommend them to anyone who needs a good shirt at a fair price .
 They have a little bit bigger size . I ordered a medium shirt for my kid and its a little bit big . I have n't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him .
 This is a great shirt ! My husband has a very long back and this shirt was long enough even for him . Fits very well and fabric is nice too .
 I know that Amazon.com does not sell everything you need in life but they come darn close!I bought 2 polo style shirts for me & my Husband . I Coordinate a C.E.R.T. -LRB- Community Emergency Response Team -RRB- being a leader , I need to look as nice as I can when I am meeting new members , local elected officials , and other related `` CERT '' business . The shirts are a great quality , very reasonably priced and I am never disapointed in Amazon . From Gifts to Gadgets , Amazon is the place I go ! Thanks for all you do !
 The price was great ... delivery was on time and quality was terrific . I would definitely buy from this seller again . No disappointment .
 great lightweight loved the color when i got it ! The color on screen didnt do the shirt justice ! I am going to order a few more for my husband .
 The product was exactly as I had expected , and came quickly . I had to buy two for an expo , not knowing of they would of satisfactory quality , but fortunately , they were professional looking enough and did the trick.Overall , I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 You definitely feel that it is not 100 % cotton but for the price it is still a great shirt . They are lite enough that I just wear a cotton tank underneath so do n't feel the poly so much . They do shrink a bit , but not too much , I typically get shirts in XL so when the shrink they fit right . These almost did n't shrink enough . Probably after a few washes they will . I wear a 42-44 jacket as a reference .
 I like those shirts , comfortable good size , all the info correct so recommend for any body , I going o buy some more
 I took a chance on ordering these shirts -LRB- I do n't usually order clothing from the ` net -RRB- , and am very glad I did . They fit well , are light weight , and the collars hold up under washing . Great shirt , at a fantastic price !
 The quality was more than I expected for the price . Bought this for work and it 's perfect for the food biz .
 The size is accurate , the fit is just right , and the spot shield is an added plus . Overall , very happy with the purchase .
 what can I say other than it was exactly what I expected and fit well . I like the idea of &#34; SpotShield &#34; since I apparently get stuff on my front quite often .
 love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable , material is soft great price would definely recommend product
 I like the feel of the material and that it is by Jerzees.I recommend it to family and friends .
 My 8 year old boy just loves his sword -LRB- the black color and the design -RRB- . The toy is plastic and very light and SAFE . My son has it for 3 weeks and it 's still in good condition so far . Very pleased about the purchase .
 We got this for a Halloween costume accessory . It 's still intact and the kids play with it quite a bit , but it is a little flimsy . My kids are n't overly rough , but I imagine that this probably would n't last a very long time if you were rough with it .
 For $ 2.99 , ca n't be beat . I gave this to my 41/2 year old grandson , to go with his Ninja costume he wanted for Christmas . He said he did n't want an `` old floppy sword '' so this was good without being dangerous !
 I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants . Although both were fine , the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price .
 these pajama bottom pants are true-to-size and well constructed . they fit comfortably and wear well . being machine washable is a real benefit as well .
 My husband really likes the Intimo Men 's Classic Silk Pants . They are very comfortable , and the color is really nice . He wears them almost every day!The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length .
 This , too , was one of several pair of sleep pants for my son 's Christmas stuff . He 's NUTS about them . They make him want to make a running start to jump & slide on the bed ! MORE PLEASE !! Possible to get them in a plaid ?
 Bought a pair for my husband and he loved them . Not only do they feel good but they laundry well and stay looking good.To be honest if you have trouble with arthritis or replacement surgeries these are great . They let you move and turn over more easily.Forgot to say I purchased another pair also.Thanks Intimo .
 Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large , they are a little short on him -LRB- Looks like he 's waiting for a flood -RRB- . I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich.Very Nice . They wash nice also .
 My husband says they are very comfortable . Very happy with the purchase . It arrived quickly .
 My husband was recovering from bypass surgery and could not slide forward to get out of chair , bed etc. . With the silk Pajamas he could get to the edge of the the seat and then stand with the aid of the walker . Amazon was the only place I could find this product . That was 6 weeks ago . He likes them so well he wo n't wear anything else , They have been laundered many times and still look like new
 This `` Classic Silk '' pant has a classic-style design and quality of a bygone era . Combine this dense and durable authentic silk pant with a sport-knit top , smoking jacket and a pair of crocodile slippers ... and you 'll give even Hugh Hefner a run for his money . Honey-bunnies just ca n't resist a man in classic , luxurious silk ! Live long and lounge well ...
 I just received the red silk pants today and absolutely love the look and feel of them . I ca n't wait for my husband to wear them . They were bought for Christmas , but I may have to give them to him early .
 I have purchased silk pjs before but these are the best quality I have seen !
 I love them . They are real silk and not that really thin stretchy weave like some of the Intimo stuff . I got black and the colour is nice and has n't faded after a few washings . I either hand wash or wash alone in the washer on the gentle cycle but hand washing will make them last much longer . I 'm not a big fan of elastic waistbands but I guess that keeps the light material from falling down .
 These pants are nice quality and nice/flowy through leg , but they tapered at the ankle more than I wanted .
 I must say I was very impressed with this item . I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship . They were very comfortable ; they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price . Another hit ! I do n't know how these folks do it ; but Intimo 's prices are amazing ! I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants .
 What you expect is what you get with these silk pajamas . For the premium price over cotton or flannel , you get slippery , well fitting -LRB- provide you order a size larger than you think you need -RRB- , black silk pajamas . The drawstring provides solid support as does the front fly -LRB- so far no inadvertent flashing -RRB- . Will they wear well particularly after several washings ? Time will tell but so far so good.In short , recommended for those who like to slide unencumbered beneath the sheets .
 Pants size that I wear is 40W x 30L & I ordered an XXL . This is the correct size for comfort . You will be able to sit without the fear of stretching the seams out of this fine product . The pant leg does n't drag all over the floor & there is plenty of seating area for what I was looking for .
 These silk pants are great , but listen to the other reviewers when they say to buy a size larger . I 'm 6 ' 2 and I normally would have bought large , but when I read the reviews , I went with extra large . They fit perfect and feel great , I would definitely recommend these for the price!Also , you feel extremely manly when your wearing these and the Intimo silk robe , which I would also rate 5 stars .
 I have ordered this same pajama pant before , and they wear well . The size is also accurate . Color is true to photo .
 I was very pleased with this . I ordered the XXL , as I have a 44 '' waist now -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- ... but the fit around my waist is superb
 These sleep pants are really comfy , fit perfectly , and look pretty good , too ! They are definately real silk , and while I could do without the pockets , I love sleeping in them .
 These are nice ! Much , much more comfortable than regular boxers . Its like they 're not there . Like freeballin ' -LRB- so to speak -RRB- < grin > without the discomfort . Yeah , they 're a bit pricy but I got ta tell ya , I think they 're worth it . Now , if only they 'd come out with a Tshirt ...
 While the silk is beautiful quality , as others have mentioned they are too short ! I usually get a 32 or 33 length for pants and these must be 28 or shorter -LRB- I bought size small -RRB- . I still like them though because I just wear them as lounge pants ...
 Ordered the large for a man who wears size 36 jeans/pants . He found them less roomy that he would like . Will return for XL if not too expensive to exchange . Quality seems comaparable to other brands he has had before .
 I had to fake a cut face from a car accident and this does have good consistency and color . Add some black goop to make it more realistic , otherwise it 'd just be a singular bright red . I believe adding browns and blacks to it will make it more convincing .
 If you have experience with doing FX 's make up , you know some of the gel blood out there looks pink ... this gel blood has perfect color and consistancy . All of the products by Cinema Secrets are great !!! Highly recommended !!!
 I bought this for a Halloween project a while back , and decided that gel was better than the cheap dollar store stuff . It 's awesome ! Apply with a q-tip , and it stays pretty well . There 's minimum sliding -LRB- I applied it to my leg -RRB- if you do n't lay it on too thick . I will warn you though , the top layer never dries completely ! Try to apply it to areas that wo n't be coming into contact with couches , chairs , or anything else you do n't want to leave `` bloody '' . If you have a thin enough layer it WILL dry ; I had mine on a few layers thick so I had to be careful about placement due to it being on my legs . Over all though , this was a fantastic purchase . I 've used it for full zombie makeup twice and still have almost a full bottle as a little goes a long way !
 i thought this product did just perfect for what i needed it for . i was doing a zombie look and this worked just great ! if allowed attached it what i did -LSB- ... -RSB-
 great looking real like blood that coagulates and stays in place really well . Looks great for Halloween for a zombie
 This is some of the best makeup I have ever used.Its totally FX quality.If you get too hot and sweat the blood starts to drip , talk about real!Deep red die , hard to get off .
 I love this product . It was perfect . I got it in a great amount of time too . I would recomment it to anyone looking for realistic looking blood .
 I bought this cover-up to use over my suit while swimming . It works great to cover up less cute areas and dries quickly . I did n't love that it has pockets because they tend to stick out when in the water , but they are useful when not in the water . The only thing that I found odd was that this `` cover-up '' has a built in panty which was uncomfortable while over a suit and so I am going to cut it out . Other than that , this is a really darling piece to add to any beach wear collection .
 Does n't matter that you drive a gas-guzzlin ' SUV or live in a nice house that 's paid for - paying for serious bandwidth can be painful . Share your pain with other geeks , and confuse the riff-raff .
 No problems whatsoever ... it came in fast , with no defects and held up really well in the wash !
 I bought this pair of silk sleep pants and another pair of satin sleep pants . Although both were fine , the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price .
 these pajama bottom pants are true-to-size and well constructed . they fit comfortably and wear well . being machine washable is a real benefit as well .
 My husband really likes the Intimo Men 's Classic Silk Pants . They are very comfortable , and the color is really nice . He wears them almost every day!The only complaint that we had is that the pants are a little bit short in length .
 This , too , was one of several pair of sleep pants for my son 's Christmas stuff . He 's NUTS about them . They make him want to make a running start to jump & slide on the bed ! MORE PLEASE !! Possible to get them in a plaid ?
 Bought a pair for my husband and he loved them . Not only do they feel good but they laundry well and stay looking good.To be honest if you have trouble with arthritis or replacement surgeries these are great . They let you move and turn over more easily.Forgot to say I purchased another pair also.Thanks Intimo .
 Great Silk Pants Except My Husband wears a Size Large Pants in everything and with these pants I wish i would of ordered an Extra Large , they are a little short on him -LRB- Looks like he 's waiting for a flood -RRB- . I ordered the Burgandy and Blue and the colors are so Deep and Rich.Very Nice . They wash nice also .
 What you expect is what you get with these silk pajamas . For the premium price over cotton or flannel , you get slippery , well fitting -LRB- provide you order a size larger than you think you need -RRB- , black silk pajamas . The drawstring provides solid support as does the front fly -LRB- so far no inadvertent flashing -RRB- . Will they wear well particularly after several washings ? Time will tell but so far so good.In short , recommended for those who like to slide unencumbered beneath the sheets .
 Pants size that I wear is 40W x 30L & I ordered an XXL . This is the correct size for comfort . You will be able to sit without the fear of stretching the seams out of this fine product . The pant leg does n't drag all over the floor & there is plenty of seating area for what I was looking for .
 These silk pants are great , but listen to the other reviewers when they say to buy a size larger . I 'm 6 ' 2 and I normally would have bought large , but when I read the reviews , I went with extra large . They fit perfect and feel great , I would definitely recommend these for the price!Also , you feel extremely manly when your wearing these and the Intimo silk robe , which I would also rate 5 stars .
 I have ordered this same pajama pant before , and they wear well . The size is also accurate . Color is true to photo .
 I was very pleased with this . I ordered the XXL , as I have a 44 '' waist now -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- ... but the fit around my waist is superb
 These sleep pants are really comfy , fit perfectly , and look pretty good , too ! They are definately real silk , and while I could do without the pockets , I love sleeping in them .
 These are nice ! Much , much more comfortable than regular boxers . Its like they 're not there . Like freeballin ' -LRB- so to speak -RRB- < grin > without the discomfort . Yeah , they 're a bit pricy but I got ta tell ya , I think they 're worth it . Now , if only they 'd come out with a Tshirt ...
 While the silk is beautiful quality , as others have mentioned they are too short ! I usually get a 32 or 33 length for pants and these must be 28 or shorter -LRB- I bought size small -RRB- . I still like them though because I just wear them as lounge pants ...
 Ordered the large for a man who wears size 36 jeans/pants . He found them less roomy that he would like . Will return for XL if not too expensive to exchange . Quality seems comaparable to other brands he has had before .
 My husband says they are very comfortable . Very happy with the purchase . It arrived quickly .
 My husband was recovering from bypass surgery and could not slide forward to get out of chair , bed etc. . With the silk Pajamas he could get to the edge of the the seat and then stand with the aid of the walker . Amazon was the only place I could find this product . That was 6 weeks ago . He likes them so well he wo n't wear anything else , They have been laundered many times and still look like new
 This `` Classic Silk '' pant has a classic-style design and quality of a bygone era . Combine this dense and durable authentic silk pant with a sport-knit top , smoking jacket and a pair of crocodile slippers ... and you 'll give even Hugh Hefner a run for his money . Honey-bunnies just ca n't resist a man in classic , luxurious silk ! Live long and lounge well ...
 I just received the red silk pants today and absolutely love the look and feel of them . I ca n't wait for my husband to wear them . They were bought for Christmas , but I may have to give them to him early .
 I have purchased silk pjs before but these are the best quality I have seen !
 I love them . They are real silk and not that really thin stretchy weave like some of the Intimo stuff . I got black and the colour is nice and has n't faded after a few washings . I either hand wash or wash alone in the washer on the gentle cycle but hand washing will make them last much longer . I 'm not a big fan of elastic waistbands but I guess that keeps the light material from falling down .
 These pants are nice quality and nice/flowy through leg , but they tapered at the ankle more than I wanted .
 I must say I was very impressed with this item . I recently wore these silk pants with a smoking jacket on a cruise ship . They were very comfortable ; they look and feel wonderful and are worth far more than the price . Another hit ! I do n't know how these folks do it ; but Intimo 's prices are amazing ! I would highly recommend these silk lounge pants .
 A good fitting bra for full figured women at a reasonable price . I would recommend this product to others as well .
 this item was fantastic and neat . it arrived on time.it was worth the money . I will buy more items like this again .
 I ordered this even though I 'm not tall and statuesque like the model in the picture is . I 'm short , size 12 and very curvy . When I put this outfit on , my husband declared me to be `` verrry sexy '' ! The outfit is comfortable , easy to put on , and one size does indeed fit all . I am very pleased !
 Let 's be honest here . You buy this product for one reason only ; to see your baby in it for 5 minutes before you strip it from her and have some fun.This product worked , it looks fabulous on her body , it really frames her buns perfectly and her DDs look fantastic in it as well . She managed to keep it on her body for 30 minutes ... I was tied up!You will love this body stocking .
 The product is what you expect it to be , and better than I expected for such a low price . I am tiny , but it is stretchy enough that I think it would fit most body frames .
 This was my wife 's present for Valentine 's Day , and both of us loved it ! She 's a size 12-14 , and it was a bit of a tight fit . We got the RED color product .
 I use this item for carrying medical equipment and it works very well.I highly recommend it .
 What can you say about a sweatshirt ? It great , I 've been wearing it for years now . I love it .

 I had tried this bra before in my normal size of 42DD and found that it did not fit well and the narrow shoulder straps dug into my shoulders . So I was very surprised that by going to the next larger cup size both the fit and shoulder strap issue were corrected . This is now one of my favorite bras and is the most supportive soft cup bra I have ever worn .
 I measured myself correctly according to Lady Grace 's site . I 'm sure it 's just one of those things where everyone 's body is different , but I had to have a seamstress friend reduce the cup size for me . The straps wo n't stay up to save my life , so that 's the big problem . Otherwise , the sides hold up well with the stays and are very wide . It 's only mildly uncomfortable in terms of the fabric not being soft enough . They discontinued this bra . Grab one if you can find one online somewhere !
 they are awesome !! they have a great feel and nice texture-very rich looking . great for dress-up an down . Got 3 differnt styles for my husband
 I knew I should have bought more the first time . Now they are out of stock . I wish Amazon would get more great dress shirt brands like Gittman , Bill Blass , Brooks Bros.Any way I bought 5 a few weeks ago and this is a great shirt.Everyone in my office bought a few and loves them.Thanks Amazon ... you are THE BEST .
 I bought the silk pajama for my husband and he loves them the way the feel so soft and silky the color was just as I saw it on the web site .
 Pajamas were what I expected . They were very soft and silky . They fit well and the care was machine washable .
 Well fitting , nice fabric , classic styling , fast service , good product that I like to buy as a gift for that special man
 These jammies were silky and very high quality ... everything was great from delivery to delight on my sig other 's face . Have n't washed yet , so ca n't comment there , but we are very satisfied !
 These pajamas are very comfortable . I wash them in the machine with cold setting and have no problems with how they come out.Good buy !
 I gave these silk Pajamas to my dad for his birthday . He told me '' He never felt anything so wonderful in his life '' . They are without a question the best pajamas in the world !
 I got these for my husband for christmas he liked them very much ! The size is just perfect as he is not tall and they fit just right .
 My friend was very happy with them . They are very good quality , and they fit him for the most part . The only issue we had was the length of the arms . They were a little too long . Other than that , we were pleased . They got here in time for Christmas , and they were just what he wanted .
 This `` Classic Silk '' pajama set is constructed with the classic-style and quality of bygone era . The silk is dense , durable and ladened with luxury ! This item will satisfy the most discerning of tastes and definately worth every cent ... quality worth paying for .
 Of all men 's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best . The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well . After reading other customers ' reviews , I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L . It turned out too small . I would recommend going one size up .
 I normally can not sleep in pajamas . They twist , grab hold , and drive me crazy when I sleep . I usually wake up in the middle of the night and take them off.Normally , I get a flannel fabric . As a last resort , I tried ordering silk pajamas . The fabric is a lot nicer and I sleep very well . I love these PJs .
 Great PJ . Really glad i got it.It 's pretty well built . I was afraid it would be a bit fragile , but so far so good.As a reference , I 'm 6 ' 0 '' with roughly 200lb ... I got the Large , and it 's a bit tight for my taste ... I 'll be trading it for the XL
 I was concerned that these silk PJ 's would be really thin and on the cheap side . But to my surprise , they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them . I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them . Plus the fit was perfect . I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size ... and another person said the opposite . -LRB- That confused me when I went to buy . -RRB- So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect ! :-RRB- My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ 's ever.The size is perfect , color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings . Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past . I ca n't find anything I do n't like about these.I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out . lol Anyone thinking of buying these I ca n't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least.Jan
 These are great . Well made , did ok in the wash . They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x . They are still cool enough for summer , but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT !!!!!! By a pair for your wife , yourself They are heaven .
 What a great pair of pajamas these are . So soft , non-binding , roomy , and great for lounging . I 've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays . Very good quality silk , well sewn and tailored . I 'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine .
 This is one manufacturer that gives ample measurements.I normally get XXL , but I drown in this one . I reordered in XL.The quality of the product seemed fine .
 I recently purchased this item and I ca n't say how relaxing it feels wearing it . It 's made with a high quality silk and does not stick to the body . Best part of this pajama set is that if you take turns in your sleep it really does not hold to your body as it slips through giving you that ease of turning over on your back or belly . Loved it ... would like to order more ...
 The pajamas are an excellent quality of silk although I have to admit I have not washed them yet . They ironed easily and look great on my husband . I was impressed with the workmanship and detailed sewing . The 2X I ordered was ample considering at 6 ' 3 ' and 225 pounds they fit . He is not broad in the shoulders so that problem was solved by having the cuffs shortened . My husband is comfortable in them and that is what counts .
 The cut on these is a little odd -LRB- European styling or something -RRB- but they feel great and seem built to last . I do n't like where the pockets are and have just left them sewn shut for now.I ca n't say that I have any other complaints about them and only time will tell how they hold up . I do wish they were a little less pricey but good quality stitching and silk costs . Let 's just hope the massive overspending the US is doing does n't devalue our dollar any more .
 I had searched high and low in my local stores for high quality mens silk pajamas , but was not satisfied with what I found . The Intimo brand carried by Amazon fit all of my requirements to a `` T '' . They fit very well , are extremely comfortable , and launder well . I just purchased my third pair . All I can add is
 These are really nice looking and very comfortable , but they washed out very quickly . After a few times in the laundry , they looked old and tattered .
 The selection of nice &#34; lingerie &#34; for men is pretty limited . The items we 've had from Intimo have held up well over time and the fit is just right . They look and feel good !
 Size Small fit my husband perfectly . He 's 5 ' 9 &#34; and weighs about 130 lbs . These PJ 's are super soft and after washing they are a velvety feeling silk . We are immensely pleased with the quality of these PJ 's .
 did n't belive i would enjoy the cool comfort . usually i tend to sweat when wearing cotten but the silk was cooler
 This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount . Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though .
 This item is of fine quality and I am very pleased with the product . I was disappointed that after my purchase I discovered that the same item was available from the manufacturer 's email site at about 25 % less than I paid . It pays to shop around .
 The quality here is great . It 's very comfortable and worth the money . However , I tried to judge my sizing based on reviews and hoping the sizing chart was accurate . I was off . I got an XL , but should have only gotten a L. I 'm 5 ' 10 '' 230 lbs with a 38-40 waist . The XL I got was too long . The waist fit well , but I need to grow a couple inches to make it fit perfectly . Just keep this in mind when picking your size .
 I bought these silk pajamas for my husband for our anniversary , and he LOVED them . They 're exactly as described - cool when it 's warm out , and warm when it 's cool out . He wears them all the time and says they 're very comfortable .
 rock solid cut . Great fit , wear well , pants work great and I bought more pairs
 Great slacks , cool , comfortable , and perfect for that hot summer day . These slacks fit great , resist wrinkling and stains . Excellent slacks for work or play .
 These are very nice slacks . I would have preferred pants without cuffs but did not see this in the description of the pants .
 I did not expect much when purchasing pants online ; however , Jos A Bank really delivered . The pants arrived very quickly and it was packaged very professionally . They really give care and attention to each product . The pants fit my son perfectly , and they are well worth the cost -LRB- very reasonable for the product -RRB- . Jos A Bank has exceeded my expectations three-fold .
 The service was great ! I received the pants in 2 days much to my surprise .
 This is a one of a kind hat . If you 're a true Giants fan you know them as the GMen . Have n't seen this hat anywhere else . . It is a must have for the Giant Fan .
 the sizing was accurate . they are a good product and true to the description given . i would buy them again .
 hey , they are boxers . good price , correct fit , and did i mention about 5 bucks cheaper than the local discount store for extended sizes . a good purchase but if you are looking for dark shades and patterns i can only say that the 3-pack i received included a white with blue , a light blue with dark blue , and a med blue with gray patterns . who cares , not going to be seen unless my belt fails .
 Just received my first pack and am so pleased am ordering another . Very good quality , sized correctly , quite comfortable . Hopefully they hold up for many months if not years of use .
 I 'm a cotton man through and through . The elastic waist-ban has cotton woven into it and so far is proving to be very comfortable . We will see how well this cotton in the ban holds up through the months of wear and washing -LRB- I really do n't like nylon touching my skin -RRB- . Its been about 4-5 weeks and so-far so-good .
 my husband loves these boxers . it said that they are nice and cool in the hot weather . they have some nice prints on them . they are comfty roomy and over all nice looking . they say up even when his jeans or shorts slide down . he looks nice in them . you ca n't go wrong with these boxers at this price . they look good under his jeans and shorts you ca n't tell that he is wearing boxers under his jeans . he says that they feel just like underwear but so much more room . he used to wear nutting but tighty whiteys now i ca n't even get him to wear them all he wears now is the boxers .
 thats what i 've been loking for , exellet product , and exellent quallity , they sent to me 3 differents colors , red shadow , light red and white with flowers .
 This is a good pair of field gloves , for players on the field . You will see it may say on the packet `` goalie gloves '' but these are certainly not anywhere near as padded as true goalie gloves , but certainly better than no gloves at all . Also , the packet I got said `` Men 's '' but , in reality , can be used by either men or women , in my opinion.For field players , these are great to use , especially in colder weather , with extra friction material on the fingertips and a stripe of extra-friction material across the palm for better ball control . They 're not heavily padded , and are actually more just like a regular pair of slightly thicker plain cotton gloves . I ordered the wrong size and now waiting for the right one to come in , but from what I saw of the original pair , they did n't seem too bad at all for what I paid .
 These are good inexpensive lightweight field player gloves . Obviously they are not keeper gloves , and should n't be used as keeper gloves . They are relatively lightweight , and will keep your hands comfortable . My daughter uses them for games when the temp is in the 40 's . The gloves have some grip on the finger tips and a little on the palm , enough for throw-ins . Do n't know about how they will work in the rain , but these gloves are definitely better than knit gloves or no gloves at all . You can get better gloves for 3 times the price , but these work perfectly for us . My daughter with regular sized hands fit well in a size 4 with room for another year . She 's 8 1/2 years old . So I would say they run a little large . As a reference , she wears a size 5 keeper glove .
 This is a qood quality vest , and it will work for a festival . I would say that it 's more costume quality than I expected , and the gold grommets are pretty noticable . The vest does n't look as much like suede in person . But my husband really likes it , and he will be wearing it .
 this arrived fast and in excellent shape NEW !!! This is better quality than the black one I ordered through a different site hubby is very impressed even though this is for my brother-in-laws birthday
 Thank you , This was delivered quickly , the Kind of service I love ! The vest was made well . they only problem was the little shelves on each side just were too large and stiff , but with a needle and thread I was able to tack it down ! . . Thank you
 A good fitting bra for full figured women at a reasonable price . I would recommend this product to others as well .
 this item was fantastic and neat . it arrived on time.it was worth the money . I will buy more items like this again .
 they are awesome !! they have a great feel and nice texture-very rich looking . great for dress-up an down . Got 3 differnt styles for my husband
 I knew I should have bought more the first time . Now they are out of stock . I wish Amazon would get more great dress shirt brands like Gittman , Bill Blass , Brooks Bros.Any way I bought 5 a few weeks ago and this is a great shirt.Everyone in my office bought a few and loves them.Thanks Amazon ... you are THE BEST .
 rock solid cut . Great fit , wear well , pants work great and I bought more pairs

 I spent a lot of time trying to find supportive athletic underwear that does n't bunch up or get sweaty . These are the ones ! I use them for Crossfit , running , hiking , etc. . They 're pretty snug , but keep everything under control and cool . However , I would not want to use these as every-day underwear ; they are much too tight for that . The longest I 've worn them is about 4 hours on a hike.I 'm not certain but it appears these are no longer made by Under Armour , at least under the same name . Luckily I purchased 10 pairs -- I 've had these for about 9 months and they are holding up perfectly when washed -LRB- cold water -RRB- and air dried . I 'm a size 29 waist , 5 ' 10 &#34; , 145 lbs , and the smalls are perfect . Absolutely zero leg ride-up even when squatting , running , etc. .
 I 've tried several pairs of compression shorts and these are the best I 've found . They fit nice and snugly , but stretch and breathe enough to be able to move around in . They 're a little pricey compared to others , but for the additional comfort and better quality , its worth it . So far they 've held up perfectly with no noticeable wear .
 After reading reviews , I ordered large UA shorts , a size larger than my normal . Way too small and ended getting XXL that fits right . Amazon/Vendor was excellent with exchange . I have 33in waist but with muscular `` cyclist '' build below the waist . Worn for just a couple of weeks and liking the fit and performance . Price comparable to local stores - bought before tax on online orders .
 I am a novice runner -LRB- ~ 9 miles a week -RRB- and i got these to help with running on treadmills . These pants are confortable and they keep everything in place . I am 5 ' 10 '' 230 # - I got the XL and they are about 1 '' above the knee . My only nit is that the compression on the legs could be a little tighter but that is probably the fact that I went a size up . Bought a second pair with longer legs and I like them just as much .
 I got these shorts in order to get gear for my first mud run . These are awesome . They kept the mud and sweat out of all the right places . I would def recommend .
 Underarmour has the thickest compression shorts , very durable , comfortable and fairly inexpensive . I am a Nike fan , but I have to go with under armour with these .
 Five-star rating for the quality of the product , but they run small . I ordered a large and it was just too small for me . I wear 36 '' pants comfortably , although I measure 38 '' around my waist at its thickest point . My thigh is 25 '' at its thickest point , and I measure 41 '' around my butt .
 Great product especially for the price . Only know I have is the stitching between the legs can cause slight chaffing if you 're running for longer periods of time . If not for that it would get 5 stars for sure .
 these compression shorts are quite good . the fabric is good , very good I would say . on the outside it 's almost frictionless between the thighs for instance , when I 'm running . it deals with moisture very nicely as well and stretches very well . only con is that I 've had other compression shorts that have a small pouch/pocket on the backside with a zipper , that you can put your keys in for example . that 's something very useful . if these would 've had that , I would 've awarded 5 stars .
 I received the Under Armour Heatgear Compression Short in the time of the offer , no delays , , the quality best than expected , 100 % recommended .
 Good buy and the colour is what I really want . Ca n't be any better . The compression , stretchability and feel is fantastic . Pricing is also reasonable .
 Bought these for my husband . His legs have always rubbed together and he gets a rash and complains of the pain . Mind you ... he weighs 190 lbs just has bigger legs . Anyhow , he has noticed a huge difference . He will not swim without these under his swim trunks now and if we have to walk a long ways or exercise ... he will not leave home without them . A huge lifesaver , we bought a couple more pair plus some of the underwear ones . Thanks Under Armour !
 These shorts work just fine and dont stretch at all throughout my workouts . I primarily bought them to help with chaffing while running , and so far i have not chaffed at all .
 This product works as advertised but is starting to wear and breakdown very easily . Durability is the only concern I have with it
 I use this compression short regularly for longer hikes and bicycle rides . Wo n't go back to using cotton undergarments for sports - No Chaffing , mostly dry even after long hikes/rides , dries overnight .
 Fit well , breathes easy . He wears these under his softball gear , and even under suits for formal events . He loves them .
 I bought these for exercising and put them to the real test when I went on a ten mile day hike . I was in waste deep water for nearly an hour and did n't wait to dry before starting my departure . I walked for two and a half hours solid and had absolutely no chaffing . What more do I need to say ? I am a believer in Under Armour . Add the waterproof Newport sandals and you are an ATV on the trails .
 This is an excellent product for many high intensity sports applications . Good support , excellent wicking , and snag free design make these shorts cool and comfortable .
 I purchased these for the man in my life . Compared to other similar items , these rate the best quality and just overall fit/likeablility . They are holding up well with frequent use and frequent washing . I would recommend these to anyone !
 It is a great product . Good for aerobic and weight work outsTakes a lot to wear it out . That is why I bought is for my brother in law . A workoutaholic
 Excelente Envio rapido tal cual lo queria en el momento de la compra , recomendado para todos los que quieran esto
 Bought two of these compression shorts , it is a great buy ! It may cost a bit , but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what !
 Men 's HeatGear Compression 7 &#34; Shorts Bottoms by Under Armour 3XL . Great draws , fit like a glove ! need a few more
 Bought these for my husband to run in - he 's very happy with them . They are snug enough to prevent any chaffing but still comfortable .
 I wear compression shorts nearly all the time . I have very big legs and have problems with chafing since I do a lot of walking . I always wear these when playing softball or golf and they provide a very secure feel.My only complaint about these is that I find they tend to wear out faster than I would like . I 've purchased 10 or so pairs over the past 4 years , and I 've found that the inner thighs wear out on me after 8-10 months of daily wear . -LRB- which I must say is a lot longer than boxer briefs tend to last -RRB- Compared to other brands I 've used -LRB- champion , BCG , Nike -RRB- , I think that these are far superior in feel/support , and about average in durability.Overall I love these shorts , and will continue to purchase them .
 I love it . It is thick and tight . I would buy more but it is a little too expensive . YES
 Great quality , thick material with great support . Recommend it for running , not cycling as there are too many seams in the crotch area .
 This is a great undergarment to keep my fat thighs rubbing together on long walks . I found these more comfy if I wore them without underwear .
 love these ! I wear them every time I run.They keep my hamstrings nice and warm .
 This is my first experience with compression shorts , so my review is based on this experience alone.I am normally a size Large in underwear . I utilized other reviews for my purchase , which generally advised to buy the same size as your underwear . I am glad I did . My thighs and butt are a bit more muscled than some people because I weight train regularly , so when I first put these on they felt tight . Unfortunately the first feel was uncomfortable from a tightness standpoint , but after wearing them for a run on the treadmill and wearing them for a couple hours , I can barely notice they are on.The compression short did not distract me from my run in any way . Again , I did n't notice they were even there . If anything , it helped . The band may feel a bit tight , but I understand that it is designed this way for a reason . I believe I bought the correct size for me and I will be using these shorts on my runs and for leg training days.Only reason I am not giving 5-stars is because I have nothing else to compare them to . Amazon 's 4-star rating says &#34; I like it &#34; . I think that accurately describes how I feel about this item . Hope this helps you in some way .
 These are amazing ! My workouts are some much better with these ! Support galore yet pliant for easy movement ! The fabric formula is an Uner Armour exclusive ! Yes ! It matters . Athletes rejoice in total support ! Way recommended !
 its under armour you can not go wrong if you do not own a pair then you need to trust me get some
 I 'm a very active `` BIG '' guy , 375 + lbs . and was going to a water park with my family so I ordered the 3X to wear under my bathing suit . Because I 'm big my thighs get chafed from long walks and from being wet all the time so I thought this would work great due to the compression and smooth fabric and it did !! My only small complaint is the waist band is a little too stiff and would irritate my belly some times . I think it 's not an issue for most people because most people do n't have a belly as big as I have and I think the stiffness helps keep it from rolling down . This was a minor issue for me and after a full day at the park I came home with no chafing so I was so happy with them and I will order a few more !!
 Be sure that you check on Under Armour 's website to find sizing . I 'm about a size 30 waist and thought I needed a small , turns out that I actually needed a medium size . They feel so cool and they 're so flexible . Sometimes I just want to wear them as regular underwear ! Great quality product , way to go Under Armour : -RRB-
 These shorts fit just as I expected so the sizing was fine for me -LRB- 5 ' 9 , 160 lbs - Medium -RRB- . I have used other compression shorts in the past , but these have the best quality material - hands down . I feel like I got my money 's worth which is all I ask for .
 My husband loves theses . They fit great and get the job done.The blue that I ordered for him is a really nice solid color .
 Very happy with the entire purchase of these compression shorts . They shipped fast and fit great . Will buy more in the future .
 These are great . I just got two pairs - One from Scheels and one from Amazon . Amazon 's are much better . They are comfortable and have made working out slightly less ackward on declined and ab workouts . They wick away a lot of the seat from your body . I would recomend these to anyone .
 Nice . These were tight and snug . These were a good length and exactly what I wanted . Buy it .
 These are great , but since I am in between a small and medium , I had to order the mediums from Under Armour .
 if your going for more of just an under layer and not a layer of protection from sliding , id go with teh performance breifs .
 it arrived extremely late , to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed . Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate .
 These shorts are exactly what I expected . They compress my legs very well , and do n't slide around . The waistband is quite comfortable , and does n't sit too high . These shorts are obviously intended to be work under your gym shorts , so if you 're looking for running shorts to wear by themselves , these are n't them . That said , they work exceptionally well , and I have had no issues with chafing since I started using these . Definitely worth the price !
 These work so well . I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts . They help so much in recovery and I could n't recommend them more .
 Excellent buy for a quality product . The fit is wonderful and does the job very well . Tops on my list of Under Armour products .
 For the price these were a good pair of compression shorts . I am about 5 ' 4 &#34; and the medium pair were perfect for me . The shipping was free and very fast which was a bonus .
 excelente el producto lo recomiendo , llego en buenas condiciones . el empaque es muy bueno , no estaba abierto y a tiempo !!
 Great for running and staying cool . I have a pair of Starter brand compression shorts that are awful in comparison to these .
 Just starting to work out . They feel right perfect . Hope we have to buy a smaller size soon . Thank you !
 U do n't even feel bothered by them , helps you work out without worrying about how lose ur shirts are or if u r sweating too much , u wo n't even notice u wearing them . .
 I 'd like if they rode a little lower , especially since they have no fly , but overall they are quite comfortable . And sexy , I 'm told : - -RRB-
 These are Nice Under Armour black heat gear compression shorts that are great for working out in and for other purposes .
 Would recommend over any other brand not because its Under Armour but the fact that it is really great and stays tight to hold everything in place during exercise when using the treadmill or doing some Insanity Workout DVDs . Great Product if your considering this its worth the extra buck because of how durable it is .
 I got these compression shorts after starting to play indoor soccer again with some people from work and tweaking my quad . I have used these about 10 times sofar , each time it has remained snug , keeping my muscles warm . Washing them has not lessened their quality.Pros : - Remain snug the entire time wearing them keeping the muscles warm - Does not stretch out , high quality - Holds up fine in the washCons : - Only thing really is there a bit pricier than other options but they are worth itI would definitely get these again , and have actually been looking around to get another .
 The Under Armor Compression shorts were my first pair I ever had . I found them to be very comfortable and of good quality . I would buy this brand again , as well as suggest this brand for my friends .
 GREAT PRODUCT AND FIT WAS PERFECT . I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN ! IT CAME QUICKLY AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT ASAP !
 Bought a few of these in different colors and I absolutely love them for working out , laying out in the sun , or underneath my board shorts . I wear shorts over them when I workout so now when your shorts fall down your legs while doing sit-ups -LRB- or anything else -RRB- you do n't have to try to hold em up wearing a pair of these compressions underneath . I was surprised by how fast they shipped them too since I was expecting them the week after when I bought em . They came a couple days later ! I would recommend you to go to a nearby mc sports or Dicks sporting goods and try on a pair to get a feel of what size you 'd be comfortable in . I normally get a size medium underwear . The mediums felt too tight on me and was pressed against my `` package '' making it uncomfortable . I have pairs in Large and X-Large and they fit best for me .
 These are nice , although I wish they 'd be a little longer and the waist not so high . When I go running I have to fold the waist down . They seem to bee good quality , although they are pretty expensive .
 This review is for
 No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention . Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your `` area '' may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear . Once you remember to do that , you 're set !
 These do exactly as they are advertised . They wick sweat very well and almost make the area feel chilly as you move about . It may take some getting used to ; since the slippery nylon has less friction than traditional boxers , the shorts you are wearing over them -LRB- I hope you are wearing shorts - I 've seen one dude wear it alone -RRB- may slip unexpectedly in undesirable directions .
 Under Armour Compression shorts are just fabulous to wear under your normal gym work out shorts . They feel comfortable and give you added supports when performing your gym workout routines . I have several pairs of these shorts , and I highly recommend them for any active person .
 These are super comfortable and work really well . I wear them underneath my gym shorts and they stay in place the way they are supposed to .
 Got them from Road Runner via Amazon.The shorts fit well , hold up under heavy use -LRB- I already had a pair -RRB- . I was familiar with Road Runner having purchased from them directly in the past so I was comfortable with the arrangement . Suffice it to say I was not disappointed .
 love them , wwear them all the time , great for working out , if u have any doubts , dont hesitate , and buy
 as stated above , best compression shorts on the market . these compression shorts do not lack quality and they will definitely last
 I bought the compression shorts for running and general workouts . The fit comfortably , and are exactly what I wanted . Under Armour makes great stuff , even though it can be costly .
 These do exactly what you need from undergarments for vigorous exercise - provide protection from chafing , wick away moisture , and provide comfortable wear . Strongly recommended .
 These are wonderful for running . I have Nike also , but these are the best , bar none . I now have three of these , and they keep me running !
 This is an excellent compression short that provides support and also breaths . This is excellent especially for summer wear .
 I like turning heads when i wear these jogging around town . They fit great , but still make me shafe just a bit . You uncircumsized guys are lukcy you dont have to deal with that .
 I purchased this for my partner . It is exactly what he wanted . He really loves them ! Very comfortable , excellent fit , perfect for workouts .
 These compression shorts are very comfortable and very durable . True to size and after repeated washings they do not shrink or loose their elasticity . I would highly recommend .
 The shorts are well made and wisk away the sweat from heavy work outs . Highly reccomend them if you are tired of soaking thru your shorts while working out .
 I have been using this product for a while now and I absolutely love it . It feels very comfortable . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone .
 Great Product !! very useful , good quality , i love it , the price it is ok , and the size two . I will buy it again !!
 These are very comfortable and fit and work great . I wear them under my 10 '' UA shorts so they do n't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical . I 'm ordering more .
 Good quality , style , and sizingToo bad this style has been replaced with one where the UA logo is silver
 I have ordered 3 different compression shorts from Amazon - Shock Doctor , Under Armour & Nike Pro . Of the 3 , Nike Pro was the WORST & Under Armour was the best.The thickness , feel and texture of the material is the main criteria I use to judge a compression short . Nike Pro felt like paper and I could almost see thru it . The Under Armour was the sturdiest and thickest of the three . It also fitted well and I felt no stitching like I do with the Shock Doctor . The Shock Doc stitching is a little uncomfortable thought the fabric is strong.The only dislike is the availability of colours of the Under Armour through Amazon . All I am seeing for the past month or more is black . Where is the red or royal blue?My mother also bought the men 's for herself as she wears it with no shorts over it like I do and found that the elastic waist could have been tighter on the Large Under Armour . I had no problem with the XL . The Shock Doc elastic is also a little uncomfortable but can be folded . The NIke Pro elastic waist was fine.So of the three I will be ordering more Under Armour and neither of the other 2 brands .
 Great fit . They last a long time . I used these when I was deployed to the middle east , they held up very well and kept me cool .
 FITI am approximately 6 ' 2 '' - 185 lb - 32 '' waist and a medium fits very well with a good amount of compression . Only complaint is that even at my height , I feel this is still about 1 '' too much material on top -LRB- lower rise needed -RRB- , which I typically remedy by folding the waistband once . People who like their underwear to show above their shorts probably wo n't mind , but when I do n't wear a shirt , I do n't want a funny tan line.COMPARISON TO NIKE PROI own 4 of these and 2 Nike Pro . These are as good or better than the Nike Pro in every way . The Nike Pro are even higher rise , and I need to fold the waist 2 or three times . The UA and Nike Pro are made of different materials , and UA is thicker . The UA has a little more of the `` compression fit '' quality compared to Nike Pro . I find both brands are excellent.USE AND DURABILITYI use these for exclusively for running , biking , beach volleyball . I would recommend these for any sports activity as they have eliminated all leg chafing for me . If you normally wear cotton boxer briefs , these are WAY better . These hold their shape even after 8 hours of beach volleyball . My first two pairs have been worn and washed at least once a week for 6 months with no noticeable degradation .
 Excellent Product for Outdoor Military Duty in heat exceding 110 Degrees . Best choice of all Under Armour products for use as underwear in extreme high and cold tempearture environments .
 I signed up for track recently and some other guy sugested that I get some compresssion shorts , so i did . they gave me a lot of support for practice and meets . There are no locker room problems with these . They are really comfortable and snug and give that male support needed.i 've noticed that it sort of shows you 're pubes through the fabric sometimes , but other than that they are wonderful ; i wear them still even after track season .
 These things rock . I have very muscular legs but love to run for my cardio . When running more than 3 miles with regular running shorts , I would always get chaffing even when using Body Glide . It was recommended to me to get these shorts to wear under my running shorts and now I do not run without them . I LOVE them . I highly suggest getting the shorts that FIT you . I they are too small , they pinch . If they are too big , they gather and rub . If they are correct , you will love them as well .
 I 've workout for years and finally came to the conclusion that boxer shorts are not made for working out . My boxer shorts will always rise in between my thighs causing scratching which can be painful , especially during cardio that I constantly had to pull them from in between my thighs which was annoying and distracting . I did some looking and found these shorts from Under Armour right away it was a noticeable difference . The shorts felt very comfortable and stayed on my legs and thighs with out rising which I felt more flexibility and free during my workouts . Forget the boxers and buy a pair of these you will be glad that you did . Great product .
 I 'm currently 6 ' 2 '' , 175lbs , and have a 33 '' waist -LRB- I can fluctuate between a 32 '' and a 34 '' waist depending on my workout , and the time of year -RRB- . With that said , Under Armour 's sizing chart said that a Medium was 30-32 '' and a Large was 34-36 '' so I obviously decided to go with a size Large . I should 've actually went with an XL probably . The waist seems a little too tight for me . I realize they 're compression shorts , but the waist still seems too tight -LRB- not TOO uncomfortable , but still a bit worrisome -RRB- . I actually have a similar pair to these that I bought like 8 years ago -LRB- that I still wear -RRB- , and those were an XL too . I just figured they might 've tweaked their sizes since then . But yea , I would definitely order a size -LRB- or two -RRB- BIGGER than what Under Armour says , if you 're worried about the waist feeling too tight . Instead of returning my two pair for a new size -LRB- since I 've already worn them for a workout -RRB- , I might just try stretching them by leaving them on some sort of 36 '' sphere for a day or so . Hopefully after a while , they 'll actually stretch to fit a 33 '' waist comfortably.Other than the sizing , these are great . Definitely a slick pair of well-compressed underwear . Nice colors for the waist band help too as they will surely show if you decide to go topless . I 've always found the quality and materials to be superb for Under Armour products , and these are right on par with my expectations for that . There is also a ventilated version of these that I recommend too .
 I bought one pair of these and one pair of Road Runner Sports Velocity compression shorts to compare for running . I thought the UA pair was going to feel very hot , as the material is thick compared to other brands -LRB- Nike , RRS , etc -RRB- . These must do a great job wicking away moisture , because they felt very comfortable on a 20 mile run , and not hot like others in comparison . There is a reason you see UA products everywhere , they are really quality goods . I 'll be wearing these next weekend for a marathon , if that tells you the level of confidence and comfort -LRB- no chafing with these ! -RRB- I have in this product . Would give 5 stars , but I 've got to own them a bit longer before I go all in .
 These are great for controlling heat during workouts or working in hot environments . They maintain their fit well even after several washes . Definitely help keep you more comfortable .
 Surprised how comfortable these are while working-out at the gym ! Will be looking to get a few more !
 I run about 4 miles 3 or 4 times a week . I was having problems with chaffing in-between my thighs so I read up on compression shorts and thought I 'd give it a try . It eliminated chaffing in those areas and I even think it sort of improved my performance due to there being no friction . I feel good when I run with these on . I have no clue about the durability . They 've lasted me a few months now and still look like new . I would recommend these for pretty much any sport . Worth the money in my opinion .
 Bought one pair , they 're great when I go the gym and do sit ups on the mats I do n't have to worry about my balls showing ; not that I care but could get arrested . I 'll be buying another pair soon .
 I USED TO WORK OUT WITH BOXERS UNDER MY SHORTS ... NOW THAT I OWN ONE OF THESE , I CA N'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTABLE MY WORKOUT IS . I USE THEM FOR JOGGING AND SOCCER . IT 'S GREAT FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF EXERCISE . WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN !
 I bought these because I play Ultimate Frisbee , I bought one initially and loved it so I bought another one . I wish they were a little longer but they work fine nevertheless .
 When I purchased these , I was thought they had a pad in the crotch area . I wanted to use them for cycling . Well , they do n't have a pad and even worse there is a seam running right through the center . This is usually a bad thing for me because it can cause chaffing in a place that can be very uncomfortable . However , I decided to use these shorts anyways to see what would happen . Fortunately , they did n't chafe me . I do find them to be a bit tighter than I expected as well , but again it ultimately does n't cause any issues . Therefore , I have to say that it was a good deal considering the price difference between these and the ones that cost significantly more but have a pad .
 This was my first purchase from UnderArmour , and I 'm sure it wo n't be the last if the rest of their products are as good as this one . The fit is perfect as well as the support . I 'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about the technical features so all I can say is that I 'll buy a few more as I ca n't imagine wearing anything else . It feels that good .
 Just got mine today and I am lovin it !!! Nice fit & nice color as well . Under armour never disappoints me love there gear ! Overall I would def . recommend buying from this seller
 The product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted . In the past , these shorts have been great quality and have lasted much longer than other brands I have tried .
 Fits me as if it were custom tailored . I highly reccomend this item . I have paid twice as much for shirts nowhere near as good as this one .

That said , they work exceptionally well , and I have had no issues with chafing since I started using these . Definitely worth the price !
 These work so well . I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts . They help so much in recovery and I could n't recommend them more .
 Excellent buy for a quality product . The fit is wonderful and does the job very well . Tops on my list of Under Armour products .
 Perfect for long hikes and any other activity outdoors . Comfortable and cool . Bought them sight unseen and they 're a perfect fit . Very happy .
 For the price these were a good pair of compression shorts . I am about 5 ' 4 &#34; and the medium pair were perfect for me . The shipping was free and very fast which was a bonus .
 excelente el producto lo recomiendo , llego en buenas condiciones . el empaque es muy bueno , no estaba abierto y a tiempo !!
 Great for running and staying cool . I have a pair of Starter brand compression shorts that are awful in comparison to these .
 Just starting to work out . They feel right perfect . Hope we have to buy a smaller size soon . Thank you !
 U do n't even feel bothered by them , helps you work out without worrying about how lose ur shirts are or if u r sweating too much , u wo n't even notice u wearing them . .
 these compression shorts are quite good . the fabric is good , very good I would say . on the outside it 's almost frictionless between the thighs for instance , when I 'm running . it deals with moisture very nicely as well and stretches very well . only con is that I 've had other compression shorts that have a small pouch/pocket on the backside with a zipper , that you can put your keys in for example . that 's something very useful . if these would 've had that , I would 've awarded 5 stars .
 Would recommend over any other brand not because its Under Armour but the fact that it is really great and stays tight to hold everything in place during exercise when using the treadmill or doing some Insanity Workout DVDs . Great Product if your considering this its worth the extra buck because of how durable it is .
 I got these compression shorts after starting to play indoor soccer again with some people from work and tweaking my quad . I have used these about 10 times sofar , each time it has remained snug , keeping my muscles warm . Washing them has not lessened their quality.Pros : - Remain snug the entire time wearing them keeping the muscles warm - Does not stretch out , high quality - Holds up fine in the washCons : - Only thing really is there a bit pricier than other options but they are worth itI would definitely get these again , and have actually been looking around to get another .
 The Under Armor Compression shorts were my first pair I ever had . I found them to be very comfortable and of good quality . I would buy this brand again , as well as suggest this brand for my friends .
 GREAT PRODUCT AND FIT WAS PERFECT . I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN ! IT CAME QUICKLY AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT ASAP !
 Bought a few of these in different colors and I absolutely love them for working out , laying out in the sun , or underneath my board shorts . I wear shorts over them when I workout so now when your shorts fall down your legs while doing sit-ups -LRB- or anything else -RRB- you do n't have to try to hold em up wearing a pair of these compressions underneath . I was surprised by how fast they shipped them too since I was expecting them the week after when I bought em . They came a couple days later ! I would recommend you to go to a nearby mc sports or Dicks sporting goods and try on a pair to get a feel of what size you 'd be comfortable in . I normally get a size medium underwear . The mediums felt too tight on me and was pressed against my `` package '' making it uncomfortable . I have pairs in Large and X-Large and they fit best for me .
 These are nice , although I wish they 'd be a little longer and the waist not so high . When I go running I have to fold the waist down . They seem to bee good quality , although they are pretty expensive .
 This review is for
 These are very comfortable and fit and work great . I wear them under my 10 '' UA shorts so they do n't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical . I 'm ordering more .
 Good quality , style , and sizingToo bad this style has been replaced with one where the UA logo is silver
 It is a great product . Good for aerobic and weight work outsTakes a lot to wear it out . That is why I bought is for my brother in law . A workoutaholic
 Excelente Envio rapido tal cual lo queria en el momento de la compra , recomendado para todos los que quieran esto
 Bought two of these compression shorts , it is a great buy ! It may cost a bit , but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what !
 Men 's HeatGear Compression 7 &#34; Shorts Bottoms by Under Armour 3XL . Great draws , fit like a glove ! need a few more
 Bought these for my husband to run in - he 's very happy with them . They are snug enough to prevent any chaffing but still comfortable .
 I wear compression shorts nearly all the time . I have very big legs and have problems with chafing since I do a lot of walking . I always wear these when playing softball or golf and they provide a very secure feel.My only complaint about these is that I find they tend to wear out faster than I would like . I 've purchased 10 or so pairs over the past 4 years , and I 've found that the inner thighs wear out on me after 8-10 months of daily wear . -LRB- which I must say is a lot longer than boxer briefs tend to last -RRB- Compared to other brands I 've used -LRB- champion , BCG , Nike -RRB- , I think that these are far superior in feel/support , and about average in durability.Overall I love these shorts , and will continue to purchase them .
 I love it . It is thick and tight . I would buy more but it is a little too expensive . YES
 Great quality , thick material with great support . Recommend it for running , not cycling as there are too many seams in the crotch area .
 love these ! I wear them every time I run.They keep my hamstrings nice and warm .
 This is my first experience with compression shorts , so my review is based on this experience alone.I am normally a size Large in underwear . I utilized other reviews for my purchase , which generally advised to buy the same size as your underwear . I am glad I did . My thighs and butt are a bit more muscled than some people because I weight train regularly , so when I first put these on they felt tight . Unfortunately the first feel was uncomfortable from a tightness standpoint , but after wearing them for a run on the treadmill and wearing them for a couple hours , I can barely notice they are on.The compression short did not distract me from my run in any way . Again , I did n't notice they were even there . If anything , it helped . The band may feel a bit tight , but I understand that it is designed this way for a reason . I believe I bought the correct size for me and I will be using these shorts on my runs and for leg training days.Only reason I am not giving 5-stars is because I have nothing else to compare them to . Amazon 's 4-star rating says &#34; I like it &#34; . I think that accurately describes how I feel about this item . Hope this helps you in some way .
 These are amazing ! My workouts are some much better with these ! Support galore yet pliant for easy movement ! The fabric formula is an Uner Armour exclusive ! Yes ! It matters . Athletes rejoice in total support ! Way recommended !
 its under armour you can not go wrong if you do not own a pair then you need to trust me get some
 I 'm a very active `` BIG '' guy , 375 + lbs . and was going to a water park with my family so I ordered the 3X to wear under my bathing suit . Because I 'm big my thighs get chafed from long walks and from being wet all the time so I thought this would work great due to the compression and smooth fabric and it did !! My only small complaint is the waist band is a little too stiff and would irritate my belly some times . I think it 's not an issue for most people because most people do n't have a belly as big as I have and I think the stiffness helps keep it from rolling down . This was a minor issue for me and after a full day at the park I came home with no chafing so I was so happy with them and I will order a few more !!
 Be sure that you check on Under Armour 's website to find sizing . I 'm about a size 30 waist and thought I needed a small , turns out that I actually needed a medium size . They feel so cool and they 're so flexible . Sometimes I just want to wear them as regular underwear ! Great quality product , way to go Under Armour : -RRB-
 These shorts fit just as I expected so the sizing was fine for me -LRB- 5 ' 9 , 160 lbs - Medium -RRB- . I have used other compression shorts in the past , but these have the best quality material - hands down . I feel like I got my money 's worth which is all I ask for .
 My husband loves theses . They fit great and get the job done.The blue that I ordered for him is a really nice solid color .
 Very happy with the entire purchase of these compression shorts . They shipped fast and fit great . Will buy more in the future .
 Just got mine today and I am lovin it !!! Nice fit & nice color as well . Under armour never disappoints me love there gear ! Overall I would def . recommend buying from this seller
 The product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted . In the past , these shorts have been great quality and have lasted much longer than other brands I have tried .
 These are great . I just got two pairs - One from Scheels and one from Amazon . Amazon 's are much better . They are comfortable and have made working out slightly less ackward on declined and ab workouts . They wick away a lot of the seat from your body . I would recomend these to anyone .
 Nice . These were tight and snug . These were a good length and exactly what I wanted . Buy it .
 These are great , but since I am in between a small and medium , I had to order the mediums from Under Armour .
 if your going for more of just an under layer and not a layer of protection from sliding , id go with teh performance breifs .
 it arrived extremely late , to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed . Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate .
 This is a great undergarment to keep my fat thighs rubbing together on long walks . I found these more comfy if I wore them without underwear .
 I spent a lot of time trying to find supportive athletic underwear that does n't bunch up or get sweaty . These are the ones ! I use them for Crossfit , running , hiking , etc. . They 're pretty snug , but keep everything under control and cool . However , I would not want to use these as every-day underwear ; they are much too tight for that . The longest I 've worn them is about 4 hours on a hike.I 'm not certain but it appears these are no longer made by Under Armour , at least under the same name . Luckily I purchased 10 pairs -- I 've had these for about 9 months and they are holding up perfectly when washed -LRB- cold water -RRB- and air dried . I 'm a size 29 waist , 5 ' 10 &#34; , 145 lbs , and the smalls are perfect . Absolutely zero leg ride-up even when squatting , running , etc. .
 I 've tried several pairs of compression shorts and these are the best I 've found . They fit nice and snugly , but stretch and breathe enough to be able to move around in . They 're a little pricey compared to others , but for the additional comfort and better quality , its worth it . So far they 've held up perfectly with no noticeable wear .
 After reading reviews , I ordered large UA shorts , a size larger than my normal . Way too small and ended getting XXL that fits right . Amazon/Vendor was excellent with exchange . I have 33in waist but with muscular `` cyclist '' build below the waist . Worn for just a couple of weeks and liking the fit and performance . Price comparable to local stores - bought before tax on online orders .
 I am a novice runner -LRB- ~ 9 miles a week -RRB- and i got these to help with running on treadmills . These pants are confortable and they keep everything in place . I am 5 ' 10 '' 230 # - I got the XL and they are about 1 '' above the knee . My only nit is that the compression on the legs could be a little tighter but that is probably the fact that I went a size up . Bought a second pair with longer legs and I like them just as much .
 I got these shorts in order to get gear for my first mud run . These are awesome . They kept the mud and sweat out of all the right places . I would def recommend .
 Underarmour has the thickest compression shorts , very durable , comfortable and fairly inexpensive . I am a Nike fan , but I have to go with under armour with these .
 Five-star rating for the quality of the product , but they run small . I ordered a large and it was just too small for me . I wear 36 '' pants comfortably , although I measure 38 '' around my waist at its thickest point . My thigh is 25 '' at its thickest point , and I measure 41 '' around my butt .
 Great product especially for the price . Only know I have is the stitching between the legs can cause slight chaffing if you 're running for longer periods of time . If not for that it would get 5 stars for sure .
 I received the Under Armour Heatgear Compression Short in the time of the offer , no delays , , the quality best than expected , 100 % recommended .
 Good buy and the colour is what I really want . Ca n't be any better . The compression , stretchability and feel is fantastic . Pricing is also reasonable .
 Bought these for my husband . His legs have always rubbed together and he gets a rash and complains of the pain . Mind you ... he weighs 190 lbs just has bigger legs . Anyhow , he has noticed a huge difference . He will not swim without these under his swim trunks now and if we have to walk a long ways or exercise ... he will not leave home without them . A huge lifesaver , we bought a couple more pair plus some of the underwear ones . Thanks Under Armour !
 These shorts work just fine and dont stretch at all throughout my workouts . I primarily bought them to help with chaffing while running , and so far i have not chaffed at all .
 This product works as advertised but is starting to wear and breakdown very easily . Durability is the only concern I have with it
 I use this compression short regularly for longer hikes and bicycle rides . Wo n't go back to using cotton undergarments for sports - No Chaffing , mostly dry even after long hikes/rides , dries overnight .
 Fit well , breathes easy . He wears these under his softball gear , and even under suits for formal events . He loves them .
 I bought these for exercising and put them to the real test when I went on a ten mile day hike . I was in waste deep water for nearly an hour and did n't wait to dry before starting my departure . I walked for two and a half hours solid and had absolutely no chaffing . What more do I need to say ? I am a believer in Under Armour . Add the waterproof Newport sandals and you are an ATV on the trails .
 This is an excellent product for many high intensity sports applications . Good support , excellent wicking , and snag free design make these shorts cool and comfortable .
 I purchased these for the man in my life . Compared to other similar items , these rate the best quality and just overall fit/likeablility . They are holding up well with frequent use and frequent washing . I would recommend these to anyone !
 These are wonderful for running . I have Nike also , but these are the best , bar none . I now have three of these , and they keep me running !
 This is an excellent compression short that provides support and also breaths . This is excellent especially for summer wear .
 These are great for controlling heat during workouts or working in hot environments . They maintain their fit well even after several washes . Definitely help keep you more comfortable .
 Surprised how comfortable these are while working-out at the gym ! Will be looking to get a few more !
 I run about 4 miles 3 or 4 times a week . I was having problems with chaffing in-between my thighs so I read up on compression shorts and thought I 'd give it a try . It eliminated chaffing in those areas and I even think it sort of improved my performance due to there being no friction . I feel good when I run with these on . I have no clue about the durability . They 've lasted me a few months now and still look like new . I would recommend these for pretty much any sport . Worth the money in my opinion .
 Bought one pair , they 're great when I go the gym and do sit ups on the mats I do n't have to worry about my balls showing ; not that I care but could get arrested . I 'll be buying another pair soon .
 I USED TO WORK OUT WITH BOXERS UNDER MY SHORTS ... NOW THAT I OWN ONE OF THESE , I CA N'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTABLE MY WORKOUT IS . I USE THEM FOR JOGGING AND SOCCER . IT 'S GREAT FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF EXERCISE . WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN !
 I bought these because I play Ultimate Frisbee , I bought one initially and loved it so I bought another one . I wish they were a little longer but they work fine nevertheless .
 When I purchased these , I was thought they had a pad in the crotch area . I wanted to use them for cycling . Well , they do n't have a pad and even worse there is a seam running right through the center . This is usually a bad thing for me because it can cause chaffing in a place that can be very uncomfortable . However , I decided to use these shorts anyways to see what would happen . Fortunately , they did n't chafe me . I do find them to be a bit tighter than I expected as well , but again it ultimately does n't cause any issues . Therefore , I have to say that it was a good deal considering the price difference between these and the ones that cost significantly more but have a pad .
 This was my first purchase from UnderArmour , and I 'm sure it wo n't be the last if the rest of their products are as good as this one . The fit is perfect as well as the support . I 'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about the technical features so all I can say is that I 'll buy a few more as I ca n't imagine wearing anything else . It feels that good .
 There are so many choices out there for running apparel . I chose these because the cost was lower than some of the others . I am very happy with my purchase . I ran in 35 degree weather and they kept my legs warm and dry . The fit was great not snug to the leg - gave room . I loved the inside pocket that held my cell phone securely .
 I liked running in these . I am 5 ' 7 and ordered a medium and I did n't have the bagging at the ankles that an other reviewer had . The only complaint I have is that the elastic at the bottom dug into one of my ankles and tore up my skin , but wearing longer socks underneath them or just rolling up the elastic once solved that problem .

 These are super comfortable and work really well . I wear them underneath my gym shorts and they stay in place the way they are supposed to .
 Got them from Road Runner via Amazon.The shorts fit well , hold up under heavy use -LRB- I already had a pair -RRB- . I was familiar with Road Runner having purchased from them directly in the past so I was comfortable with the arrangement . Suffice it to say I was not disappointed .
 love them , wwear them all the time , great for working out , if u have any doubts , dont hesitate , and buy
 as stated above , best compression shorts on the market . these compression shorts do not lack quality and they will definitely last
 I bought the compression shorts for running and general workouts . The fit comfortably , and are exactly what I wanted . Under Armour makes great stuff , even though it can be costly .
 These do exactly what you need from undergarments for vigorous exercise - provide protection from chafing , wick away moisture , and provide comfortable wear . Strongly recommended .
 These are wonderful for running . I have Nike also , but these are the best , bar none . I now have three of these , and they keep me running !

 These compression shorts are very comfortable and very durable . True to size and after repeated washings they do not shrink or loose their elasticity . I would highly recommend .
 The shorts are well made and wisk away the sweat from heavy work outs . Highly reccomend them if you are tired of soaking thru your shorts while working out .
 I have been using this product for a while now and I absolutely love it . It feels very comfortable . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone .
 Great Product !! very useful , good quality , i love it , the price it is ok , and the size two . I will buy it again !!
 These are very comfortable and fit and work great . I wear them under my 10 '' UA shorts so they do n't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical . I 'm ordering more .
 Good quality , style , and sizingToo bad this style has been replaced with one where the UA logo is silver
 It is a great product . Good for aerobic and weight work outsTakes a lot to wear it out . That is why I bought is for my brother in law . A workoutaholic
 I have ordered 3 different compression shorts from Amazon - Shock Doctor , Under Armour & Nike Pro . Of the 3 , Nike Pro was the WORST & Under Armour was the best.The thickness , feel and texture of the material is the main criteria I use to judge a compression short . Nike Pro felt like paper and I could almost see thru it . The Under Armour was the sturdiest and thickest of the three . It also fitted well and I felt no stitching like I do with the Shock Doctor . The Shock Doc stitching is a little uncomfortable thought the fabric is strong.The only dislike is the availability of colours of the Under Armour through Amazon . All I am seeing for the past month or more is black . Where is the red or royal blue?My mother also bought the men 's for herself as she wears it with no shorts over it like I do and found that the elastic waist could have been tighter on the Large Under Armour . I had no problem with the XL . The Shock Doc elastic is also a little uncomfortable but can be folded . The NIke Pro elastic waist was fine.So of the three I will be ordering more Under Armour and neither of the other 2 brands .
 Great fit . They last a long time . I used these when I was deployed to the middle east , they held up very well and kept me cool .
 FITI am approximately 6 ' 2 '' - 185 lb - 32 '' waist and a medium fits very well with a good amount of compression . Only complaint is that even at my height , I feel this is still about 1 '' too much material on top -LRB- lower rise needed -RRB- , which I typically remedy by folding the waistband once . People who like their underwear to show above their shorts probably wo n't mind , but when I do n't wear a shirt , I do n't want a funny tan line.COMPARISON TO NIKE PROI own 4 of these and 2 Nike Pro . These are as good or better than the Nike Pro in every way . The Nike Pro are even higher rise , and I need to fold the waist 2 or three times . The UA and Nike Pro are made of different materials , and UA is thicker . The UA has a little more of the `` compression fit '' quality compared to Nike Pro . I find both brands are excellent.USE AND DURABILITYI use these for exclusively for running , biking , beach volleyball . I would recommend these for any sports activity as they have eliminated all leg chafing for me . If you normally wear cotton boxer briefs , these are WAY better . These hold their shape even after 8 hours of beach volleyball . My first two pairs have been worn and washed at least once a week for 6 months with no noticeable degradation .
 Excellent Product for Outdoor Military Duty in heat exceding 110 Degrees . Best choice of all Under Armour products for use as underwear in extreme high and cold tempearture environments .
 I signed up for track recently and some other guy sugested that I get some compresssion shorts , so i did . they gave me a lot of support for practice and meets . There are no locker room problems with these . They are really comfortable and snug and give that male support needed.i 've noticed that it sort of shows you 're pubes through the fabric sometimes , but other than that they are wonderful ; i wear them still even after track season .
 These things rock . I have very muscular legs but love to run for my cardio . When running more than 3 miles with regular running shorts , I would always get chaffing even when using Body Glide . It was recommended to me to get these shorts to wear under my running shorts and now I do not run without them . I LOVE them . I highly suggest getting the shorts that FIT you . I they are too small , they pinch . If they are too big , they gather and rub . If they are correct , you will love them as well .
 I 've workout for years and finally came to the conclusion that boxer shorts are not made for working out . My boxer shorts will always rise in between my thighs causing scratching which can be painful , especially during cardio that I constantly had to pull them from in between my thighs which was annoying and distracting . I did some looking and found these shorts from Under Armour right away it was a noticeable difference . The shorts felt very comfortable and stayed on my legs and thighs with out rising which I felt more flexibility and free during my workouts . Forget the boxers and buy a pair of these you will be glad that you did . Great product .
 I 'm currently 6 ' 2 '' , 175lbs , and have a 33 '' waist -LRB- I can fluctuate between a 32 '' and a 34 '' waist depending on my workout , and the time of year -RRB- . With that said , Under Armour 's sizing chart said that a Medium was 30-32 '' and a Large was 34-36 '' so I obviously decided to go with a size Large . I should 've actually went with an XL probably . The waist seems a little too tight for me . I realize they 're compression shorts , but the waist still seems too tight -LRB- not TOO uncomfortable , but still a bit worrisome -RRB- . I actually have a similar pair to these that I bought like 8 years ago -LRB- that I still wear -RRB- , and those were an XL too . I just figured they might 've tweaked their sizes since then . But yea , I would definitely order a size -LRB- or two -RRB- BIGGER than what Under Armour says , if you 're worried about the waist feeling too tight . Instead of returning my two pair for a new size -LRB- since I 've already worn them for a workout -RRB- , I might just try stretching them by leaving them on some sort of 36 '' sphere for a day or so . Hopefully after a while , they 'll actually stretch to fit a 33 '' waist comfortably.Other than the sizing , these are great . Definitely a slick pair of well-compressed underwear . Nice colors for the waist band help too as they will surely show if you decide to go topless . I 've always found the quality and materials to be superb for Under Armour products , and these are right on par with my expectations for that . There is also a ventilated version of these that I recommend too .
 I bought one pair of these and one pair of Road Runner Sports Velocity compression shorts to compare for running . I thought the UA pair was going to feel very hot , as the material is thick compared to other brands -LRB- Nike , RRS , etc -RRB- . These must do a great job wicking away moisture , because they felt very comfortable on a 20 mile run , and not hot like others in comparison . There is a reason you see UA products everywhere , they are really quality goods . I 'll be wearing these next weekend for a marathon , if that tells you the level of confidence and comfort -LRB- no chafing with these ! -RRB- I have in this product . Would give 5 stars , but I 've got to own them a bit longer before I go all in .
 Nice . These were tight and snug . These were a good length and exactly what I wanted . Buy it .
 These are great , but since I am in between a small and medium , I had to order the mediums from Under Armour .
 if your going for more of just an under layer and not a layer of protection from sliding , id go with teh performance breifs .
 it arrived extremely late , to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed . Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate .
 These shorts are exactly what I expected . They compress my legs very well , and do n't slide around . The waistband is quite comfortable , and does n't sit too high . These shorts are obviously intended to be work under your gym shorts , so if you 're looking for running shorts to wear by themselves , these are n't them . That said , they work exceptionally well , and I have had no issues with chafing since I started using these . Definitely worth the price !
 These work so well . I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts . They help so much in recovery and I could n't recommend them more .
 Excellent buy for a quality product . The fit is wonderful and does the job very well . Tops on my list of Under Armour products .
 excelente el producto lo recomiendo , llego en buenas condiciones . el empaque es muy bueno , no estaba abierto y a tiempo !!
 Great for running and staying cool . I have a pair of Starter brand compression shorts that are awful in comparison to these .
 Just starting to work out . They feel right perfect . Hope we have to buy a smaller size soon . Thank you !
 U do n't even feel bothered by them , helps you work out without worrying about how lose ur shirts are or if u r sweating too much , u wo n't even notice u wearing them . .
 I 'd like if they rode a little lower , especially since they have no fly , but overall they are quite comfortable . And sexy , I 'm told : - -RRB-
 These are Nice Under Armour black heat gear compression shorts that are great for working out in and for other purposes .
 I like turning heads when i wear these jogging around town . They fit great , but still make me shafe just a bit . You uncircumsized guys are lukcy you dont have to deal with that .
 I got these compression shorts after starting to play indoor soccer again with some people from work and tweaking my quad . I have used these about 10 times sofar , each time it has remained snug , keeping my muscles warm . Washing them has not lessened their quality.Pros : - Remain snug the entire time wearing them keeping the muscles warm - Does not stretch out , high quality - Holds up fine in the washCons : - Only thing really is there a bit pricier than other options but they are worth itI would definitely get these again , and have actually been looking around to get another .
 The Under Armor Compression shorts were my first pair I ever had . I found them to be very comfortable and of good quality . I would buy this brand again , as well as suggest this brand for my friends .
 GREAT PRODUCT AND FIT WAS PERFECT . I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN ! IT CAME QUICKLY AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT ASAP !
 Bought a few of these in different colors and I absolutely love them for working out , laying out in the sun , or underneath my board shorts . I wear shorts over them when I workout so now when your shorts fall down your legs while doing sit-ups -LRB- or anything else -RRB- you do n't have to try to hold em up wearing a pair of these compressions underneath . I was surprised by how fast they shipped them too since I was expecting them the week after when I bought em . They came a couple days later ! I would recommend you to go to a nearby mc sports or Dicks sporting goods and try on a pair to get a feel of what size you 'd be comfortable in . I normally get a size medium underwear . The mediums felt too tight on me and was pressed against my `` package '' making it uncomfortable . I have pairs in Large and X-Large and they fit best for me .
 These are nice , although I wish they 'd be a little longer and the waist not so high . When I go running I have to fold the waist down . They seem to bee good quality , although they are pretty expensive .
 This review is for
 No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention . Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your `` area '' may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear . Once you remember to do that , you 're set !
 These do exactly as they are advertised . They wick sweat very well and almost make the area feel chilly as you move about . It may take some getting used to ; since the slippery nylon has less friction than traditional boxers , the shorts you are wearing over them -LRB- I hope you are wearing shorts - I 've seen one dude wear it alone -RRB- may slip unexpectedly in undesirable directions .
 Under Armour Compression shorts are just fabulous to wear under your normal gym work out shorts . They feel comfortable and give you added supports when performing your gym workout routines . I have several pairs of these shorts , and I highly recommend them for any active person .
 Surprised how comfortable these are while working-out at the gym ! Will be looking to get a few more !
 I run about 4 miles 3 or 4 times a week . I was having problems with chaffing in-between my thighs so I read up on compression shorts and thought I 'd give it a try . It eliminated chaffing in those areas and I even think it sort of improved my performance due to there being no friction . I feel good when I run with these on . I have no clue about the durability . They 've lasted me a few months now and still look like new . I would recommend these for pretty much any sport . Worth the money in my opinion .
 Bought one pair , they 're great when I go the gym and do sit ups on the mats I do n't have to worry about my balls showing ; not that I care but could get arrested . I 'll be buying another pair soon .
 I USED TO WORK OUT WITH BOXERS UNDER MY SHORTS ... NOW THAT I OWN ONE OF THESE , I CA N'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTABLE MY WORKOUT IS . I USE THEM FOR JOGGING AND SOCCER . IT 'S GREAT FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF EXERCISE . WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN !
 I bought these because I play Ultimate Frisbee , I bought one initially and loved it so I bought another one . I wish they were a little longer but they work fine nevertheless .
 When I purchased these , I was thought they had a pad in the crotch area . I wanted to use them for cycling . Well , they do n't have a pad and even worse there is a seam running right through the center . This is usually a bad thing for me because it can cause chaffing in a place that can be very uncomfortable . However , I decided to use these shorts anyways to see what would happen . Fortunately , they did n't chafe me . I do find them to be a bit tighter than I expected as well , but again it ultimately does n't cause any issues . Therefore , I have to say that it was a good deal considering the price difference between these and the ones that cost significantly more but have a pad .
 This was my first purchase from UnderArmour , and I 'm sure it wo n't be the last if the rest of their products are as good as this one . The fit is perfect as well as the support . I 'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about the technical features so all I can say is that I 'll buy a few more as I ca n't imagine wearing anything else . It feels that good .
 Just got mine today and I am lovin it !!! Nice fit & nice color as well . Under armour never disappoints me love there gear ! Overall I would def . recommend buying from this seller
 The product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted . In the past , these shorts have been great quality and have lasted much longer than other brands I have tried .
 These are great . I just got two pairs - One from Scheels and one from Amazon . Amazon 's are much better . They are comfortable and have made working out slightly less ackward on declined and ab workouts . They wick away a lot of the seat from your body . I would recomend these to anyone .
 I received the Under Armour Heatgear Compression Short in the time of the offer , no delays , , the quality best than expected , 100 % recommended .
 Good buy and the colour is what I really want . Ca n't be any better . The compression , stretchability and feel is fantastic . Pricing is also reasonable .
 Bought these for my husband . His legs have always rubbed together and he gets a rash and complains of the pain . Mind you ... he weighs 190 lbs just has bigger legs . Anyhow , he has noticed a huge difference . He will not swim without these under his swim trunks now and if we have to walk a long ways or exercise ... he will not leave home without them . A huge lifesaver , we bought a couple more pair plus some of the underwear ones . Thanks Under Armour !
 These shorts work just fine and dont stretch at all throughout my workouts . I primarily bought them to help with chaffing while running , and so far i have not chaffed at all .
 This product works as advertised but is starting to wear and breakdown very easily . Durability is the only concern I have with it
 I use this compression short regularly for longer hikes and bicycle rides . Wo n't go back to using cotton undergarments for sports - No Chaffing , mostly dry even after long hikes/rides , dries overnight .
 Fit well , breathes easy . He wears these under his softball gear , and even under suits for formal events . He loves them .
 I bought these for exercising and put them to the real test when I went on a ten mile day hike . I was in waste deep water for nearly an hour and did n't wait to dry before starting my departure . I walked for two and a half hours solid and had absolutely no chaffing . What more do I need to say ? I am a believer in Under Armour . Add the waterproof Newport sandals and you are an ATV on the trails .
 This is an excellent product for many high intensity sports applications . Good support , excellent wicking , and snag free design make these shorts cool and comfortable .
 I purchased these for the man in my life . Compared to other similar items , these rate the best quality and just overall fit/likeablility . They are holding up well with frequent use and frequent washing . I would recommend these to anyone !
 This is a great undergarment to keep my fat thighs rubbing together on long walks . I found these more comfy if I wore them without underwear .
 I spent a lot of time trying to find supportive athletic underwear that does n't bunch up or get sweaty . These are the ones ! I use them for Crossfit , running , hiking , etc. . They 're pretty snug , but keep everything under control and cool . However , I would not want to use these as every-day underwear ; they are much too tight for that . The longest I 've worn them is about 4 hours on a hike.I 'm not certain but it appears these are no longer made by Under Armour , at least under the same name . Luckily I purchased 10 pairs -- I 've had these for about 9 months and they are holding up perfectly when washed -LRB- cold water -RRB- and air dried . I 'm a size 29 waist , 5 ' 10 &#34; , 145 lbs , and the smalls are perfect . Absolutely zero leg ride-up even when squatting , running , etc. .
 I 've tried several pairs of compression shorts and these are the best I 've found . They fit nice and snugly , but stretch and breathe enough to be able to move around in . They 're a little pricey compared to others , but for the additional comfort and better quality , its worth it . So far they 've held up perfectly with no noticeable wear .
 After reading reviews , I ordered large UA shorts , a size larger than my normal . Way too small and ended getting XXL that fits right . Amazon/Vendor was excellent with exchange . I have 33in waist but with muscular `` cyclist '' build below the waist . Worn for just a couple of weeks and liking the fit and performance . Price comparable to local stores - bought before tax on online orders .
 I am a novice runner -LRB- ~ 9 miles a week -RRB- and i got these to help with running on treadmills . These pants are confortable and they keep everything in place . I am 5 ' 10 '' 230 # - I got the XL and they are about 1 '' above the knee . My only nit is that the compression on the legs could be a little tighter but that is probably the fact that I went a size up . Bought a second pair with longer legs and I like them just as much .
 I got these shorts in order to get gear for my first mud run . These are awesome . They kept the mud and sweat out of all the right places . I would def recommend .
 Underarmour has the thickest compression shorts , very durable , comfortable and fairly inexpensive . I am a Nike fan , but I have to go with under armour with these .
 Five-star rating for the quality of the product , but they run small . I ordered a large and it was just too small for me . I wear 36 '' pants comfortably , although I measure 38 '' around my waist at its thickest point . My thigh is 25 '' at its thickest point , and I measure 41 '' around my butt .
 Great product especially for the price . Only know I have is the stitching between the legs can cause slight chaffing if you 're running for longer periods of time . If not for that it would get 5 stars for sure .
 love these ! I wear them every time I run.They keep my hamstrings nice and warm .
 This is my first experience with compression shorts , so my review is based on this experience alone.I am normally a size Large in underwear . I utilized other reviews for my purchase , which generally advised to buy the same size as your underwear . I am glad I did . My thighs and butt are a bit more muscled than some people because I weight train regularly , so when I first put these on they felt tight . Unfortunately the first feel was uncomfortable from a tightness standpoint , but after wearing them for a run on the treadmill and wearing them for a couple hours , I can barely notice they are on.The compression short did not distract me from my run in any way . Again , I did n't notice they were even there . If anything , it helped . The band may feel a bit tight , but I understand that it is designed this way for a reason . I believe I bought the correct size for me and I will be using these shorts on my runs and for leg training days.Only reason I am not giving 5-stars is because I have nothing else to compare them to . Amazon 's 4-star rating says &#34; I like it &#34; . I think that accurately describes how I feel about this item . Hope this helps you in some way .
 These are amazing ! My workouts are some much better with these ! Support galore yet pliant for easy movement ! The fabric formula is an Uner Armour exclusive ! Yes ! It matters . Athletes rejoice in total support ! Way recommended !
 its under armour you can not go wrong if you do not own a pair then you need to trust me get some
 I 'm a very active `` BIG '' guy , 375 + lbs . and was going to a water park with my family so I ordered the 3X to wear under my bathing suit . Because I 'm big my thighs get chafed from long walks and from being wet all the time so I thought this would work great due to the compression and smooth fabric and it did !! My only small complaint is the waist band is a little too stiff and would irritate my belly some times . I think it 's not an issue for most people because most people do n't have a belly as big as I have and I think the stiffness helps keep it from rolling down . This was a minor issue for me and after a full day at the park I came home with no chafing so I was so happy with them and I will order a few more !!
 Be sure that you check on Under Armour 's website to find sizing . I 'm about a size 30 waist and thought I needed a small , turns out that I actually needed a medium size . They feel so cool and they 're so flexible . Sometimes I just want to wear them as regular underwear ! Great quality product , way to go Under Armour : -RRB-
 These shorts fit just as I expected so the sizing was fine for me -LRB- 5 ' 9 , 160 lbs - Medium -RRB- . I have used other compression shorts in the past , but these have the best quality material - hands down . I feel like I got my money 's worth which is all I ask for .
 My husband loves theses . They fit great and get the job done.The blue that I ordered for him is a really nice solid color .
 Very happy with the entire purchase of these compression shorts . They shipped fast and fit great . Will buy more in the future .
 These are very comfortable and fit and work great . I wear them under my 10 '' UA shorts so they do n't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical . I 'm ordering more .
 Good quality , style , and sizingToo bad this style has been replaced with one where the UA logo is silver
 It is a great product . Good for aerobic and weight work outsTakes a lot to wear it out . That is why I bought is for my brother in law . A workoutaholic
 Excelente Envio rapido tal cual lo queria en el momento de la compra , recomendado para todos los que quieran esto
 Bought two of these compression shorts , it is a great buy ! It may cost a bit , but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what !
 Men 's HeatGear Compression 7 &#34; Shorts Bottoms by Under Armour 3XL . Great draws , fit like a glove ! need a few more
 Bought these for my husband to run in - he 's very happy with them . They are snug enough to prevent any chaffing but still comfortable .
 I wear compression shorts nearly all the time . I have very big legs and have problems with chafing since I do a lot of walking . I always wear these when playing softball or golf and they provide a very secure feel.My only complaint about these is that I find they tend to wear out faster than I would like . I 've purchased 10 or so pairs over the past 4 years , and I 've found that the inner thighs wear out on me after 8-10 months of daily wear . -LRB- which I must say is a lot longer than boxer briefs tend to last -RRB- Compared to other brands I 've used -LRB- champion , BCG , Nike -RRB- , I think that these are far superior in feel/support , and about average in durability.Overall I love these shorts , and will continue to purchase them .
 I love it . It is thick and tight . I would buy more but it is a little too expensive . YES
 Great quality , thick material with great support . Recommend it for running , not cycling as there are too many seams in the crotch area .
 These are wonderful for running . I have Nike also , but these are the best , bar none . I now have three of these , and they keep me running !
 This is an excellent compression short that provides support and also breaths . This is excellent especially for summer wear .
 These are great for controlling heat during workouts or working in hot environments . They maintain their fit well even after several washes . Definitely help keep you more comfortable .
 Surprised how comfortable these are while working-out at the gym ! Will be looking to get a few more !

 these compression shorts are quite good . the fabric is good , very good I would say . on the outside it 's almost frictionless between the thighs for instance , when I 'm running . it deals with moisture very nicely as well and stretches very well . only con is that I 've had other compression shorts that have a small pouch/pocket on the backside with a zipper , that you can put your keys in for example . that 's something very useful . if these would 've had that , I would 've awarded 5 stars .
 Would recommend over any other brand not because its Under Armour but the fact that it is really great and stays tight to hold everything in place during exercise when using the treadmill or doing some Insanity Workout DVDs . Great Product if your considering this its worth the extra buck because of how durable it is .

 Perfect for long hikes and any other activity outdoors . Comfortable and cool . Bought them sight unseen and they 're a perfect fit . Very happy .
 For the price these were a good pair of compression shorts . I am about 5 ' 4 &#34; and the medium pair were perfect for me . The shipping was free and very fast which was a bonus .
 excelente el producto lo recomiendo , llego en buenas condiciones . el empaque es muy bueno , no estaba abierto y a tiempo !!
 Great for running and staying cool . I have a pair of Starter brand compression shorts that are awful in comparison to these .
 Just starting to work out . They feel right perfect . Hope we have to buy a smaller size soon . Thank you !

 These are great . I just got two pairs - One from Scheels and one from Amazon . Amazon 's are much better . They are comfortable and have made working out slightly less ackward on declined and ab workouts . They wick away a lot of the seat from your body . I would recomend these to anyone .
 Nice . These were tight and snug . These were a good length and exactly what I wanted . Buy it .

 I have ordered 3 different compression shorts from Amazon - Shock Doctor , Under Armour & Nike Pro . Of the 3 , Nike Pro was the WORST & Under Armour was the best.The thickness , feel and texture of the material is the main criteria I use to judge a compression short . Nike Pro felt like paper and I could almost see thru it . The Under Armour was the sturdiest and thickest of the three . It also fitted well and I felt no stitching like I do with the Shock Doctor . The Shock Doc stitching is a little uncomfortable thought the fabric is strong.The only dislike is the availability of colours of the Under Armour through Amazon . All I am seeing for the past month or more is black . Where is the red or royal blue?My mother also bought the men 's for herself as she wears it with no shorts over it like I do and found that the elastic waist could have been tighter on the Large Under Armour . I had no problem with the XL . The Shock Doc elastic is also a little uncomfortable but can be folded . The NIke Pro elastic waist was fine.So of the three I will be ordering more Under Armour and neither of the other 2 brands .
 Great fit . They last a long time . I used these when I was deployed to the middle east , they held up very well and kept me cool .
 FITI am approximately 6 ' 2 '' - 185 lb - 32 '' waist and a medium fits very well with a good amount of compression . Only complaint is that even at my height , I feel this is still about 1 '' too much material on top -LRB- lower rise needed -RRB- , which I typically remedy by folding the waistband once . People who like their underwear to show above their shorts probably wo n't mind , but when I do n't wear a shirt , I do n't want a funny tan line.COMPARISON TO NIKE PROI own 4 of these and 2 Nike Pro . These are as good or better than the Nike Pro in every way . The Nike Pro are even higher rise , and I need to fold the waist 2 or three times . The UA and Nike Pro are made of different materials , and UA is thicker . The UA has a little more of the `` compression fit '' quality compared to Nike Pro . I find both brands are excellent.USE AND DURABILITYI use these for exclusively for running , biking , beach volleyball . I would recommend these for any sports activity as they have eliminated all leg chafing for me . If you normally wear cotton boxer briefs , these are WAY better . These hold their shape even after 8 hours of beach volleyball . My first two pairs have been worn and washed at least once a week for 6 months with no noticeable degradation .
 Excellent Product for Outdoor Military Duty in heat exceding 110 Degrees . Best choice of all Under Armour products for use as underwear in extreme high and cold tempearture environments .
 I signed up for track recently and some other guy sugested that I get some compresssion shorts , so i did . they gave me a lot of support for practice and meets . There are no locker room problems with these . They are really comfortable and snug and give that male support needed.i 've noticed that it sort of shows you 're pubes through the fabric sometimes , but other than that they are wonderful ; i wear them still even after track season .
 These things rock . I have very muscular legs but love to run for my cardio . When running more than 3 miles with regular running shorts , I would always get chaffing even when using Body Glide . It was recommended to me to get these shorts to wear under my running shorts and now I do not run without them . I LOVE them . I highly suggest getting the shorts that FIT you . I they are too small , they pinch . If they are too big , they gather and rub . If they are correct , you will love them as well .
 I 've workout for years and finally came to the conclusion that boxer shorts are not made for working out . My boxer shorts will always rise in between my thighs causing scratching which can be painful , especially during cardio that I constantly had to pull them from in between my thighs which was annoying and distracting . I did some looking and found these shorts from Under Armour right away it was a noticeable difference . The shorts felt very comfortable and stayed on my legs and thighs with out rising which I felt more flexibility and free during my workouts . Forget the boxers and buy a pair of these you will be glad that you did . Great product .
 I 'm currently 6 ' 2 '' , 175lbs , and have a 33 '' waist -LRB- I can fluctuate between a 32 '' and a 34 '' waist depending on my workout , and the time of year -RRB- . With that said , Under Armour 's sizing chart said that a Medium was 30-32 '' and a Large was 34-36 '' so I obviously decided to go with a size Large . I should 've actually went with an XL probably . The waist seems a little too tight for me . I realize they 're compression shorts , but the waist still seems too tight -LRB- not TOO uncomfortable , but still a bit worrisome -RRB- . I actually have a similar pair to these that I bought like 8 years ago -LRB- that I still wear -RRB- , and those were an XL too . I just figured they might 've tweaked their sizes since then . But yea , I would definitely order a size -LRB- or two -RRB- BIGGER than what Under Armour says , if you 're worried about the waist feeling too tight . Instead of returning my two pair for a new size -LRB- since I 've already worn them for a workout -RRB- , I might just try stretching them by leaving them on some sort of 36 '' sphere for a day or so . Hopefully after a while , they 'll actually stretch to fit a 33 '' waist comfortably.Other than the sizing , these are great . Definitely a slick pair of well-compressed underwear . Nice colors for the waist band help too as they will surely show if you decide to go topless . I 've always found the quality and materials to be superb for Under Armour products , and these are right on par with my expectations for that . There is also a ventilated version of these that I recommend too .
 I bought one pair of these and one pair of Road Runner Sports Velocity compression shorts to compare for running . I thought the UA pair was going to feel very hot , as the material is thick compared to other brands -LRB- Nike , RRS , etc -RRB- . These must do a great job wicking away moisture , because they felt very comfortable on a 20 mile run , and not hot like others in comparison . There is a reason you see UA products everywhere , they are really quality goods . I 'll be wearing these next weekend for a marathon , if that tells you the level of confidence and comfort -LRB- no chafing with these ! -RRB- I have in this product . Would give 5 stars , but I 've got to own them a bit longer before I go all in .
 I 'd like if they rode a little lower , especially since they have no fly , but overall they are quite comfortable . And sexy , I 'm told : - -RRB-
 These are Nice Under Armour black heat gear compression shorts that are great for working out in and for other purposes .
 I like turning heads when i wear these jogging around town . They fit great , but still make me shafe just a bit . You uncircumsized guys are lukcy you dont have to deal with that .
 I purchased this for my partner . It is exactly what he wanted . He really loves them ! Very comfortable , excellent fit , perfect for workouts .
 These compression shorts are very comfortable and very durable . True to size and after repeated washings they do not shrink or loose their elasticity . I would highly recommend .
 The shorts are well made and wisk away the sweat from heavy work outs . Highly reccomend them if you are tired of soaking thru your shorts while working out .
 I have been using this product for a while now and I absolutely love it . It feels very comfortable . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone .
 Great Product !! very useful , good quality , i love it , the price it is ok , and the size two . I will buy it again !!
 No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention . Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your `` area '' may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear . Once you remember to do that , you 're set !
 These do exactly as they are advertised . They wick sweat very well and almost make the area feel chilly as you move about . It may take some getting used to ; since the slippery nylon has less friction than traditional boxers , the shorts you are wearing over them -LRB- I hope you are wearing shorts - I 've seen one dude wear it alone -RRB- may slip unexpectedly in undesirable directions .
 Under Armour Compression shorts are just fabulous to wear under your normal gym work out shorts . They feel comfortable and give you added supports when performing your gym workout routines . I have several pairs of these shorts , and I highly recommend them for any active person .
 These are super comfortable and work really well . I wear them underneath my gym shorts and they stay in place the way they are supposed to .
 Got them from Road Runner via Amazon.The shorts fit well , hold up under heavy use -LRB- I already had a pair -RRB- . I was familiar with Road Runner having purchased from them directly in the past so I was comfortable with the arrangement . Suffice it to say I was not disappointed .
 love them , wwear them all the time , great for working out , if u have any doubts , dont hesitate , and buy
 as stated above , best compression shorts on the market . these compression shorts do not lack quality and they will definitely last
 I bought the compression shorts for running and general workouts . The fit comfortably , and are exactly what I wanted . Under Armour makes great stuff , even though it can be costly .
 These do exactly what you need from undergarments for vigorous exercise - provide protection from chafing , wick away moisture , and provide comfortable wear . Strongly recommended .
 they are awesome !! they have a great feel and nice texture-very rich looking . great for dress-up an down . Got 3 differnt styles for my husband
 I knew I should have bought more the first time . Now they are out of stock . I wish Amazon would get more great dress shirt brands like Gittman , Bill Blass , Brooks Bros.Any way I bought 5 a few weeks ago and this is a great shirt.Everyone in my office bought a few and loves them.Thanks Amazon ... you are THE BEST .
 Tote bags are everywhere and many are cheaper than this bag . But my 30 bucks were well spent . This bag is as sturdy as it is beautiful , made of top quality materials . Highly recommended .
 If you 're a Naruto fan and even the slightest bit interested in the Akatsuki or missing nin 's in general , this is definitely a product worth having.I also purchased the normal Leaf Village Logo -LRB- Konoha -RRB- Headband along with this one and the normal one is basically the same , just the fabric is a different color -LRB- much lighter blue -RRB- , but I love wearing my Anti-Leaf headband even more . The Anti-Leaf headband is not black , but very dark navy blue.I 've bent it out of shape many times , to fit around my neck , my forehead , my upper arm and my thigh and each time it bends right back into it 's normal shape with no sign that I ever bent it in the first place . The fabric is long enough so that I can actually tie it around my waist , through the belt loops on my jeans -LRB- Ino/Lee/Gai-Sensei style -RRB- . It 's hard to tie since there 's nothing but maybe 3 inches to actually tie into a knot . It would have been nice to know how long the ties are , but that 's ok.Roughly , the length of the metal piece is around 6 inches , while its 2 inches wide . There 's extra fabric about a 1/2 inch on the top and bottom of the piece . The long fabric used to tie it is 16 inches long on both sides -LRB- I would hope so -RRB- . There fabric behind the metal piece is just slightly passed and there 's also a really nice extra piece -LRB- attatched on one end and velcroed in the middle and other end -RRB- that 's also slightly padded . It 's not enough padding to make it pop out of your forehead , but just enough to make it comfortable . -LRB- The velcro piece also fits around my upper arm pretty well . -RRB- Overall , it 's a really great piece and I 'm glad I purchased it . I 've received tons of comments on it from `` What is that ?! '' to `` Omigosh , you watch Naruto !? '' and it 's really fun . Sometimes I earn an eyeroll or dirty look from people learning it 's from a manga/anime but most of the time people just laugh and ask where I got it , and if they could get one too , despite not knowing what the heck it is .
 I recieved this item today , and am absolutely astounded by it 's quality ! It 's very clean , and absolutely professionally packaged . I recieved it in a short amount of time , and was very happy with the ability to track it . Amazing quality , and good shipping ! Love you guys !
 I purchased this headband as part of a cosplay I was doing this year . The headband is probably as perfect as it can get , considering it 's pulled from manga/anime . The metal is bendable as a previous poster stated and once double knotted it stays in place quite well . There is some shifting that can occur , but that would occur even with a regular headband . The cloth is dark , navy blue , but it 's perfect for cosplaying.Personally , I have worn it on my head and on my waist . I threaded the ends through my jean loops and tied it in place . Looked pretty nifty there ! : -RRB-
 When I purchased this item , it arrived very fast . It actually arrived 3 days before its expected date . When I first opened it , I was like '' Oh my ga , this is so small ! '' Do not worry though , because it is the perfect size . It covers up exactly how much it should cover and can be worn anywhere . I wear it around my neck , the side of my head , and on my backpack . It is a great buy . The only complaint I have is that I did n't buy two . I love this thing and can not find a single thing wrong with it
 I got this in the mail today and I was in shock ! This is the best headband that i have ever had . It 's the same product in the picture . The only difference is that the cloth is not black but very dark blue . Bending is great because when you are done bending it and want to bend it back there are no bent marks . The only down side is that it smudges easily . Other than that this is a must have product but i want to know what the Velcro part is because i have no idea what it is for .
 I love it . I would DEFIANTLY Suggest it to anyone ! I like Itatchi , Although he killed my Clan alot , and I Follow Akatsuki as well so this Anti-Konoha Headband is Perfect . ^ ^ Trust me , It 's worth the money . I wear it around my neck or on my forehead . ^ . ^ Hope I helped ya !!! ~ Kiumi Uchiha ~ P.S
 So I got my forehead band earlier than I thought , which is always good . I removed the item and saw under my Itachi forehead band on the package was a photo of Sasuke , I thought that was pretty funny . Tried it on it fits perfectly , metal was easy to bend . I 'm actually wearing it Sakura style right now . I 'm a big fan of Naruto , especially the Akatsuki so this is a neat item . -LRB- Heh rambling . -RRB-
 WEll what can i say other than its awesome ? not that much other than its a sweet headband .
 The cloth is thick and the metal is resistant to bending and dents . It maintains its shape well and feels good while wearing .
 This is a great product , really durable material , nice metal plate thats like 6-7 inches wide , its is incredibly cool , the logo is nicely drawn . I recommend it for any naruto fan .
 Okay it came in the mail today , It is not what it advertises it is a very cheap blue cloth.It had a very noticable bend on the left side of metal.metal bends easily ships very fast but came bet and dirty.it s good for price.would not recommend it.you can get other meal ones that are better quality and more shiny .
 i had this thing for three years now . my dad bought it for me in japan . iam personally not a naruto fan , but if ur a fan or not , this head band is worth every cent . its metal of course and it doesnt feel fake . it fits on most heads , and arms , and legs . i have a really big head , so im shocked it even fits me until this day , but it is a very good item , and worth all the money
 When I was looking for this here on Amazon.com , I found this one with eight reveiws . The longest one was absolutly helpful . I ordered it and in five days , it finaly came . I loved it . I wore it for the rest of the day . and that is why I decided to write a reveiw about it.The fabric is a navy blue and the piece with the symbol on it is real metal but with no sharp edges , so it is conpletly safe . The problem is my brother tried it on and it would n't fit . No worries ! It can fit through your belt loops as well.If you have any intrest in Naruto or the Akatsuki team , I really do recomend this product .
 I must say , out of all Ive owned this is by far the best one to get !
 this product is awesome and my son loves it , he never takes it off , he has gotten headbands before but none with this durabilty and quality .
 Since my niece has gotten into japanimation , her current fascination is Naruto . For months she has been looking for one of these headbands . After much searching , I found several on Amazon . I ordered one for my niece 's birthday and she loved it . Everytime she comes to my house to spend the weekend , she has her Naruto headband . Of course , now her younger brother wants one . Whatever will I do ????
 I 'm what you call a narutard , this version of sasukes anti leaf headband is awesome . I sort of expected to receive a cruddy metal with cloth flimsily attatched , but it was bolted to the cloth , the cloth was durable and tough , the metal was the real steel , and it bent wherever I wanted it to ... definately buy from this seller
 My daughter uses the headband as a toy and as a hair piece , a must for any Naruto fan to add to their collection !
 fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit
 It looks just as it does in the picture , and for the price , you get more than what you payed for !
 I got this for fun and wear it every so often with friends and it looks legit because the plate is metallic . Stiff at first but it is malleable so that it can bent to the shape of your forehead . Good buy , I would have liked the cloth to have been of better material but for the price you ca n't go wrong .
 I saw people using the product and I liked it so I decided to buy one which is very good
 My little bro love Naruto . I saw this and knew he would love to have one . It arrived with in the schedualed day and in great condition .
 A Christmas present for my step daughter . She is going to love it ! Looks just like the picture , and arrived really early !
 This headband is exactly what any Naruto fan needs . The metal on it is very durable and not that flexible plastic you find on other headbands . Only flaw is I wish the cloth was longer but other than that its perfect . This is THE headband to buy .
 Love this band & ALWAY 'S WILL , Seen him a dozen times & will continue to do so along with my teenage Son , rather take him to see an old school metal band than a rapper any old night !
 this jacket is so nice . it doesnt look new which makes it so nice . a great buy . cant wait for a cool breeze .
 Good quality , and oh so cute ! Ca n't go wrong with this one . The stretch material makes it more flexible to wear over sweaters .
 they are awesome !! they have a great feel and nice texture-very rich looking . great for dress-up an down . Got 3 differnt styles for my husband
 I knew I should have bought more the first time . Now they are out of stock . I wish Amazon would get more great dress shirt brands like Gittman , Bill Blass , Brooks Bros.Any way I bought 5 a few weeks ago and this is a great shirt.Everyone in my office bought a few and loves them.Thanks Amazon ... you are THE BEST .

 I have ordered 3 different compression shorts from Amazon - Shock Doctor , Under Armour & Nike Pro . Of the 3 , Nike Pro was the WORST & Under Armour was the best.The thickness , feel and texture of the material is the main criteria I use to judge a compression short . Nike Pro felt like paper and I could almost see thru it . The Under Armour was the sturdiest and thickest of the three . It also fitted well and I felt no stitching like I do with the Shock Doctor . The Shock Doc stitching is a little uncomfortable thought the fabric is strong.The only dislike is the availability of colours of the Under Armour through Amazon . All I am seeing for the past month or more is black . Where is the red or royal blue?My mother also bought the men 's for herself as she wears it with no shorts over it like I do and found that the elastic waist could have been tighter on the Large Under Armour . I had no problem with the XL . The Shock Doc elastic is also a little uncomfortable but can be folded . The NIke Pro elastic waist was fine.So of the three I will be ordering more Under Armour and neither of the other 2 brands .
 Great fit . They last a long time . I used these when I was deployed to the middle east , they held up very well and kept me cool .
 FITI am approximately 6 ' 2 '' - 185 lb - 32 '' waist and a medium fits very well with a good amount of compression . Only complaint is that even at my height , I feel this is still about 1 '' too much material on top -LRB- lower rise needed -RRB- , which I typically remedy by folding the waistband once . People who like their underwear to show above their shorts probably wo n't mind , but when I do n't wear a shirt , I do n't want a funny tan line.COMPARISON TO NIKE PROI own 4 of these and 2 Nike Pro . These are as good or better than the Nike Pro in every way . The Nike Pro are even higher rise , and I need to fold the waist 2 or three times . The UA and Nike Pro are made of different materials , and UA is thicker . The UA has a little more of the `` compression fit '' quality compared to Nike Pro . I find both brands are excellent.USE AND DURABILITYI use these for exclusively for running , biking , beach volleyball . I would recommend these for any sports activity as they have eliminated all leg chafing for me . If you normally wear cotton boxer briefs , these are WAY better . These hold their shape even after 8 hours of beach volleyball . My first two pairs have been worn and washed at least once a week for 6 months with no noticeable degradation .

 Just got mine today and I am lovin it !!! Nice fit & nice color as well . Under armour never disappoints me love there gear ! Overall I would def . recommend buying from this seller
 The product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted . In the past , these shorts have been great quality and have lasted much longer than other brands I have tried .
 These are great . I just got two pairs - One from Scheels and one from Amazon . Amazon 's are much better . They are comfortable and have made working out slightly less ackward on declined and ab workouts . They wick away a lot of the seat from your body . I would recomend these to anyone .
 Nice . These were tight and snug . These were a good length and exactly what I wanted . Buy it .
 These are great , but since I am in between a small and medium , I had to order the mediums from Under Armour .
 if your going for more of just an under layer and not a layer of protection from sliding , id go with teh performance breifs .
 it arrived extremely late , to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed . Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate .
 these compression shorts are quite good . the fabric is good , very good I would say . on the outside it 's almost frictionless between the thighs for instance , when I 'm running . it deals with moisture very nicely as well and stretches very well . only con is that I 've had other compression shorts that have a small pouch/pocket on the backside with a zipper , that you can put your keys in for example . that 's something very useful . if these would 've had that , I would 've awarded 5 stars .
 Would recommend over any other brand not because its Under Armour but the fact that it is really great and stays tight to hold everything in place during exercise when using the treadmill or doing some Insanity Workout DVDs . Great Product if your considering this its worth the extra buck because of how durable it is .
 I got these compression shorts after starting to play indoor soccer again with some people from work and tweaking my quad . I have used these about 10 times sofar , each time it has remained snug , keeping my muscles warm . Washing them has not lessened their quality.Pros : - Remain snug the entire time wearing them keeping the muscles warm - Does not stretch out , high quality - Holds up fine in the washCons : - Only thing really is there a bit pricier than other options but they are worth itI would definitely get these again , and have actually been looking around to get another .
 The Under Armor Compression shorts were my first pair I ever had . I found them to be very comfortable and of good quality . I would buy this brand again , as well as suggest this brand for my friends .
 GREAT PRODUCT AND FIT WAS PERFECT . I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN ! IT CAME QUICKLY AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT ASAP !
 Bought a few of these in different colors and I absolutely love them for working out , laying out in the sun , or underneath my board shorts . I wear shorts over them when I workout so now when your shorts fall down your legs while doing sit-ups -LRB- or anything else -RRB- you do n't have to try to hold em up wearing a pair of these compressions underneath . I was surprised by how fast they shipped them too since I was expecting them the week after when I bought em . They came a couple days later ! I would recommend you to go to a nearby mc sports or Dicks sporting goods and try on a pair to get a feel of what size you 'd be comfortable in . I normally get a size medium underwear . The mediums felt too tight on me and was pressed against my `` package '' making it uncomfortable . I have pairs in Large and X-Large and they fit best for me .
 These are nice , although I wish they 'd be a little longer and the waist not so high . When I go running I have to fold the waist down . They seem to bee good quality , although they are pretty expensive .
 This review is for
 These shorts are exactly what I expected . They compress my legs very well , and do n't slide around . The waistband is quite comfortable , and does n't sit too high . These shorts are obviously intended to be work under your gym shorts , so if you 're looking for running shorts to wear by themselves , these are n't them . That said , they work exceptionally well , and I have had no issues with chafing since I started using these . Definitely worth the price !
 These work so well . I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts . They help so much in recovery and I could n't recommend them more .
 Excellent buy for a quality product . The fit is wonderful and does the job very well . Tops on my list of Under Armour products .
 Perfect for long hikes and any other activity outdoors . Comfortable and cool . Bought them sight unseen and they 're a perfect fit . Very happy .
 For the price these were a good pair of compression shorts . I am about 5 ' 4 &#34; and the medium pair were perfect for me . The shipping was free and very fast which was a bonus .
 excelente el producto lo recomiendo , llego en buenas condiciones . el empaque es muy bueno , no estaba abierto y a tiempo !!
 Great for running and staying cool . I have a pair of Starter brand compression shorts that are awful in comparison to these .
 Just starting to work out . They feel right perfect . Hope we have to buy a smaller size soon . Thank you !
 U do n't even feel bothered by them , helps you work out without worrying about how lose ur shirts are or if u r sweating too much , u wo n't even notice u wearing them . .
 These are wonderful for running . I have Nike also , but these are the best , bar none . I now have three of these , and they keep me running !
 This is an excellent compression short that provides support and also breaths . This is excellent especially for summer wear .
 These are great for controlling heat during workouts or working in hot environments . They maintain their fit well even after several washes . Definitely help keep you more comfortable .
 Surprised how comfortable these are while working-out at the gym ! Will be looking to get a few more !
 I run about 4 miles 3 or 4 times a week . I was having problems with chaffing in-between my thighs so I read up on compression shorts and thought I 'd give it a try . It eliminated chaffing in those areas and I even think it sort of improved my performance due to there being no friction . I feel good when I run with these on . I have no clue about the durability . They 've lasted me a few months now and still look like new . I would recommend these for pretty much any sport . Worth the money in my opinion .
 Bought one pair , they 're great when I go the gym and do sit ups on the mats I do n't have to worry about my balls showing ; not that I care but could get arrested . I 'll be buying another pair soon .
 I USED TO WORK OUT WITH BOXERS UNDER MY SHORTS ... NOW THAT I OWN ONE OF THESE , I CA N'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTABLE MY WORKOUT IS . I USE THEM FOR JOGGING AND SOCCER . IT 'S GREAT FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF EXERCISE . WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN !
 I bought these because I play Ultimate Frisbee , I bought one initially and loved it so I bought another one . I wish they were a little longer but they work fine nevertheless .
 When I purchased these , I was thought they had a pad in the crotch area . I wanted to use them for cycling . Well , they do n't have a pad and even worse there is a seam running right through the center . This is usually a bad thing for me because it can cause chaffing in a place that can be very uncomfortable . However , I decided to use these shorts anyways to see what would happen . Fortunately , they did n't chafe me . I do find them to be a bit tighter than I expected as well , but again it ultimately does n't cause any issues . Therefore , I have to say that it was a good deal considering the price difference between these and the ones that cost significantly more but have a pad .
 This was my first purchase from UnderArmour , and I 'm sure it wo n't be the last if the rest of their products are as good as this one . The fit is perfect as well as the support . I 'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about the technical features so all I can say is that I 'll buy a few more as I ca n't imagine wearing anything else . It feels that good .
 These are very comfortable and fit and work great . I wear them under my 10 '' UA shorts so they do n't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical . I 'm ordering more .
 Good quality , style , and sizingToo bad this style has been replaced with one where the UA logo is silver
 It is a great product . Good for aerobic and weight work outsTakes a lot to wear it out . That is why I bought is for my brother in law . A workoutaholic
 Excelente Envio rapido tal cual lo queria en el momento de la compra , recomendado para todos los que quieran esto
 Bought two of these compression shorts , it is a great buy ! It may cost a bit , but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what !
 Men 's HeatGear Compression 7 &#34; Shorts Bottoms by Under Armour 3XL . Great draws , fit like a glove ! need a few more
 Bought these for my husband to run in - he 's very happy with them . They are snug enough to prevent any chaffing but still comfortable .
 I wear compression shorts nearly all the time . I have very big legs and have problems with chafing since I do a lot of walking . I always wear these when playing softball or golf and they provide a very secure feel.My only complaint about these is that I find they tend to wear out faster than I would like . I 've purchased 10 or so pairs over the past 4 years , and I 've found that the inner thighs wear out on me after 8-10 months of daily wear . -LRB- which I must say is a lot longer than boxer briefs tend to last -RRB- Compared to other brands I 've used -LRB- champion , BCG , Nike -RRB- , I think that these are far superior in feel/support , and about average in durability.Overall I love these shorts , and will continue to purchase them .
 I love it . It is thick and tight . I would buy more but it is a little too expensive . YES
 Great quality , thick material with great support . Recommend it for running , not cycling as there are too many seams in the crotch area .
 love these ! I wear them every time I run.They keep my hamstrings nice and warm .
 This is my first experience with compression shorts , so my review is based on this experience alone.I am normally a size Large in underwear . I utilized other reviews for my purchase , which generally advised to buy the same size as your underwear . I am glad I did . My thighs and butt are a bit more muscled than some people because I weight train regularly , so when I first put these on they felt tight . Unfortunately the first feel was uncomfortable from a tightness standpoint , but after wearing them for a run on the treadmill and wearing them for a couple hours , I can barely notice they are on.The compression short did not distract me from my run in any way . Again , I did n't notice they were even there . If anything , it helped . The band may feel a bit tight , but I understand that it is designed this way for a reason . I believe I bought the correct size for me and I will be using these shorts on my runs and for leg training days.Only reason I am not giving 5-stars is because I have nothing else to compare them to . Amazon 's 4-star rating says &#34; I like it &#34; . I think that accurately describes how I feel about this item . Hope this helps you in some way .
 These are amazing ! My workouts are some much better with these ! Support galore yet pliant for easy movement ! The fabric formula is an Uner Armour exclusive ! Yes ! It matters . Athletes rejoice in total support ! Way recommended !
 its under armour you can not go wrong if you do not own a pair then you need to trust me get some
 I 'm a very active `` BIG '' guy , 375 + lbs . and was going to a water park with my family so I ordered the 3X to wear under my bathing suit . Because I 'm big my thighs get chafed from long walks and from being wet all the time so I thought this would work great due to the compression and smooth fabric and it did !! My only small complaint is the waist band is a little too stiff and would irritate my belly some times . I think it 's not an issue for most people because most people do n't have a belly as big as I have and I think the stiffness helps keep it from rolling down . This was a minor issue for me and after a full day at the park I came home with no chafing so I was so happy with them and I will order a few more !!
 Be sure that you check on Under Armour 's website to find sizing . I 'm about a size 30 waist and thought I needed a small , turns out that I actually needed a medium size . They feel so cool and they 're so flexible . Sometimes I just want to wear them as regular underwear ! Great quality product , way to go Under Armour : -RRB-
 These shorts fit just as I expected so the sizing was fine for me -LRB- 5 ' 9 , 160 lbs - Medium -RRB- . I have used other compression shorts in the past , but these have the best quality material - hands down . I feel like I got my money 's worth which is all I ask for .
 My husband loves theses . They fit great and get the job done.The blue that I ordered for him is a really nice solid color .
 Very happy with the entire purchase of these compression shorts . They shipped fast and fit great . Will buy more in the future .
 This is a great undergarment to keep my fat thighs rubbing together on long walks . I found these more comfy if I wore them without underwear .
 I spent a lot of time trying to find supportive athletic underwear that does n't bunch up or get sweaty . These are the ones ! I use them for Crossfit , running , hiking , etc. . They 're pretty snug , but keep everything under control and cool . However , I would not want to use these as every-day underwear ; they are much too tight for that . The longest I 've worn them is about 4 hours on a hike.I 'm not certain but it appears these are no longer made by Under Armour , at least under the same name . Luckily I purchased 10 pairs -- I 've had these for about 9 months and they are holding up perfectly when washed -LRB- cold water -RRB- and air dried . I 'm a size 29 waist , 5 ' 10 &#34; , 145 lbs , and the smalls are perfect . Absolutely zero leg ride-up even when squatting , running , etc. .
 I 've tried several pairs of compression shorts and these are the best I 've found . They fit nice and snugly , but stretch and breathe enough to be able to move around in . They 're a little pricey compared to others , but for the additional comfort and better quality , its worth it . So far they 've held up perfectly with no noticeable wear .
 After reading reviews , I ordered large UA shorts , a size larger than my normal . Way too small and ended getting XXL that fits right . Amazon/Vendor was excellent with exchange . I have 33in waist but with muscular `` cyclist '' build below the waist . Worn for just a couple of weeks and liking the fit and performance . Price comparable to local stores - bought before tax on online orders .
 I am a novice runner -LRB- ~ 9 miles a week -RRB- and i got these to help with running on treadmills . These pants are confortable and they keep everything in place . I am 5 ' 10 '' 230 # - I got the XL and they are about 1 '' above the knee . My only nit is that the compression on the legs could be a little tighter but that is probably the fact that I went a size up . Bought a second pair with longer legs and I like them just as much .
 I got these shorts in order to get gear for my first mud run . These are awesome . They kept the mud and sweat out of all the right places . I would def recommend .
 Underarmour has the thickest compression shorts , very durable , comfortable and fairly inexpensive . I am a Nike fan , but I have to go with under armour with these .
 Five-star rating for the quality of the product , but they run small . I ordered a large and it was just too small for me . I wear 36 '' pants comfortably , although I measure 38 '' around my waist at its thickest point . My thigh is 25 '' at its thickest point , and I measure 41 '' around my butt .
 Great product especially for the price . Only know I have is the stitching between the legs can cause slight chaffing if you 're running for longer periods of time . If not for that it would get 5 stars for sure .
 I received the Under Armour Heatgear Compression Short in the time of the offer , no delays , , the quality best than expected , 100 % recommended .
 Good buy and the colour is what I really want . Ca n't be any better . The compression , stretchability and feel is fantastic . Pricing is also reasonable .
 Bought these for my husband . His legs have always rubbed together and he gets a rash and complains of the pain . Mind you ... he weighs 190 lbs just has bigger legs . Anyhow , he has noticed a huge difference . He will not swim without these under his swim trunks now and if we have to walk a long ways or exercise ... he will not leave home without them . A huge lifesaver , we bought a couple more pair plus some of the underwear ones . Thanks Under Armour !
 These shorts work just fine and dont stretch at all throughout my workouts . I primarily bought them to help with chaffing while running , and so far i have not chaffed at all .
 This product works as advertised but is starting to wear and breakdown very easily . Durability is the only concern I have with it
 I use this compression short regularly for longer hikes and bicycle rides . Wo n't go back to using cotton undergarments for sports - No Chaffing , mostly dry even after long hikes/rides , dries overnight .
 Fit well , breathes easy . He wears these under his softball gear , and even under suits for formal events . He loves them .
 I bought these for exercising and put them to the real test when I went on a ten mile day hike . I was in waste deep water for nearly an hour and did n't wait to dry before starting my departure . I walked for two and a half hours solid and had absolutely no chaffing . What more do I need to say ? I am a believer in Under Armour . Add the waterproof Newport sandals and you are an ATV on the trails .
 This is an excellent product for many high intensity sports applications . Good support , excellent wicking , and snag free design make these shorts cool and comfortable .
 I purchased these for the man in my life . Compared to other similar items , these rate the best quality and just overall fit/likeablility . They are holding up well with frequent use and frequent washing . I would recommend these to anyone !
 I have ordered 3 different compression shorts from Amazon - Shock Doctor , Under Armour & Nike Pro . Of the 3 , Nike Pro was the WORST & Under Armour was the best.The thickness , feel and texture of the material is the main criteria I use to judge a compression short . Nike Pro felt like paper and I could almost see thru it . The Under Armour was the sturdiest and thickest of the three . It also fitted well and I felt no stitching like I do with the Shock Doctor . The Shock Doc stitching is a little uncomfortable thought the fabric is strong.The only dislike is the availability of colours of the Under Armour through Amazon . All I am seeing for the past month or more is black . Where is the red or royal blue?My mother also bought the men 's for herself as she wears it with no shorts over it like I do and found that the elastic waist could have been tighter on the Large Under Armour . I had no problem with the XL . The Shock Doc elastic is also a little uncomfortable but can be folded . The NIke Pro elastic waist was fine.So of the three I will be ordering more Under Armour and neither of the other 2 brands .
 Great fit . They last a long time . I used these when I was deployed to the middle east , they held up very well and kept me cool .
 FITI am approximately 6 ' 2 '' - 185 lb - 32 '' waist and a medium fits very well with a good amount of compression . Only complaint is that even at my height , I feel this is still about 1 '' too much material on top -LRB- lower rise needed -RRB- , which I typically remedy by folding the waistband once . People who like their underwear to show above their shorts probably wo n't mind , but when I do n't wear a shirt , I do n't want a funny tan line.COMPARISON TO NIKE PROI own 4 of these and 2 Nike Pro . These are as good or better than the Nike Pro in every way . The Nike Pro are even higher rise , and I need to fold the waist 2 or three times . The UA and Nike Pro are made of different materials , and UA is thicker . The UA has a little more of the `` compression fit '' quality compared to Nike Pro . I find both brands are excellent.USE AND DURABILITYI use these for exclusively for running , biking , beach volleyball . I would recommend these for any sports activity as they have eliminated all leg chafing for me . If you normally wear cotton boxer briefs , these are WAY better . These hold their shape even after 8 hours of beach volleyball . My first two pairs have been worn and washed at least once a week for 6 months with no noticeable degradation .
 Excellent Product for Outdoor Military Duty in heat exceding 110 Degrees . Best choice of all Under Armour products for use as underwear in extreme high and cold tempearture environments .
 I signed up for track recently and some other guy sugested that I get some compresssion shorts , so i did . they gave me a lot of support for practice and meets . There are no locker room problems with these . They are really comfortable and snug and give that male support needed.i 've noticed that it sort of shows you 're pubes through the fabric sometimes , but other than that they are wonderful ; i wear them still even after track season .
 These things rock . I have very muscular legs but love to run for my cardio . When running more than 3 miles with regular running shorts , I would always get chaffing even when using Body Glide . It was recommended to me to get these shorts to wear under my running shorts and now I do not run without them . I LOVE them . I highly suggest getting the shorts that FIT you . I they are too small , they pinch . If they are too big , they gather and rub . If they are correct , you will love them as well .
 I 've workout for years and finally came to the conclusion that boxer shorts are not made for working out . My boxer shorts will always rise in between my thighs causing scratching which can be painful , especially during cardio that I constantly had to pull them from in between my thighs which was annoying and distracting . I did some looking and found these shorts from Under Armour right away it was a noticeable difference . The shorts felt very comfortable and stayed on my legs and thighs with out rising which I felt more flexibility and free during my workouts . Forget the boxers and buy a pair of these you will be glad that you did . Great product .
 I 'm currently 6 ' 2 '' , 175lbs , and have a 33 '' waist -LRB- I can fluctuate between a 32 '' and a 34 '' waist depending on my workout , and the time of year -RRB- . With that said , Under Armour 's sizing chart said that a Medium was 30-32 '' and a Large was 34-36 '' so I obviously decided to go with a size Large . I should 've actually went with an XL probably . The waist seems a little too tight for me . I realize they 're compression shorts , but the waist still seems too tight -LRB- not TOO uncomfortable , but still a bit worrisome -RRB- . I actually have a similar pair to these that I bought like 8 years ago -LRB- that I still wear -RRB- , and those were an XL too . I just figured they might 've tweaked their sizes since then . But yea , I would definitely order a size -LRB- or two -RRB- BIGGER than what Under Armour says , if you 're worried about the waist feeling too tight . Instead of returning my two pair for a new size -LRB- since I 've already worn them for a workout -RRB- , I might just try stretching them by leaving them on some sort of 36 '' sphere for a day or so . Hopefully after a while , they 'll actually stretch to fit a 33 '' waist comfortably.Other than the sizing , these are great . Definitely a slick pair of well-compressed underwear . Nice colors for the waist band help too as they will surely show if you decide to go topless . I 've always found the quality and materials to be superb for Under Armour products , and these are right on par with my expectations for that . There is also a ventilated version of these that I recommend too .
 I bought one pair of these and one pair of Road Runner Sports Velocity compression shorts to compare for running . I thought the UA pair was going to feel very hot , as the material is thick compared to other brands -LRB- Nike , RRS , etc -RRB- . These must do a great job wicking away moisture , because they felt very comfortable on a 20 mile run , and not hot like others in comparison . There is a reason you see UA products everywhere , they are really quality goods . I 'll be wearing these next weekend for a marathon , if that tells you the level of confidence and comfort -LRB- no chafing with these ! -RRB- I have in this product . Would give 5 stars , but I 've got to own them a bit longer before I go all in .
 The shorts are well made and wisk away the sweat from heavy work outs . Highly reccomend them if you are tired of soaking thru your shorts while working out .
 I have been using this product for a while now and I absolutely love it . It feels very comfortable . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone .
 Great Product !! very useful , good quality , i love it , the price it is ok , and the size two . I will buy it again !!
 These are very comfortable and fit and work great . I wear them under my 10 '' UA shorts so they do n't peek out the bottom like some of the other compression shorts.The compression shorts really help avoid the leg rubbing of shorts or creeping when on the treadmill or elliptical .

 Bought two of these compression shorts , it is a great buy ! It may cost a bit , but it is worth the price cause it will get the job done no matter what !
 love them , wwear them all the time , great for working out , if u have any doubts , dont hesitate , and buy
 as stated above , best compression shorts on the market . these compression shorts do not lack quality and they will definitely last
 I bought the compression shorts for running and general workouts . The fit comfortably , and are exactly what I wanted . Under Armour makes great stuff , even though it can be costly .
 These do exactly what you need from undergarments for vigorous exercise - provide protection from chafing , wick away moisture , and provide comfortable wear . Strongly recommended .
 These are wonderful for running . I have Nike also , but these are the best , bar none . I now have three of these , and they keep me running !
 This is an excellent compression short that provides support and also breaths . This is excellent especially for summer wear .
 These are great for controlling heat during workouts or working in hot environments . They maintain their fit well even after several washes . Definitely help keep you more comfortable .
 Surprised how comfortable these are while working-out at the gym ! Will be looking to get a few more !
 I run about 4 miles 3 or 4 times a week . I was having problems with chaffing in-between my thighs so I read up on compression shorts and thought I 'd give it a try . It eliminated chaffing in those areas and I even think it sort of improved my performance due to there being no friction . I feel good when I run with these on . I have no clue about the durability . They 've lasted me a few months now and still look like new . I would recommend these for pretty much any sport . Worth the money in my opinion .
 GREAT PRODUCT AND FIT WAS PERFECT . I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN ! IT CAME QUICKLY AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT ASAP !
 Bought a few of these in different colors and I absolutely love them for working out , laying out in the sun , or underneath my board shorts . I wear shorts over them when I workout so now when your shorts fall down your legs while doing sit-ups -LRB- or anything else -RRB- you do n't have to try to hold em up wearing a pair of these compressions underneath . I was surprised by how fast they shipped them too since I was expecting them the week after when I bought em . They came a couple days later ! I would recommend you to go to a nearby mc sports or Dicks sporting goods and try on a pair to get a feel of what size you 'd be comfortable in . I normally get a size medium underwear . The mediums felt too tight on me and was pressed against my `` package '' making it uncomfortable . I have pairs in Large and X-Large and they fit best for me .
 These are nice , although I wish they 'd be a little longer and the waist not so high . When I go running I have to fold the waist down . They seem to bee good quality , although they are pretty expensive .
 This review is for
 No complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention . Just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your `` area '' may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear . Once you remember to do that , you 're set !
 These do exactly as they are advertised . They wick sweat very well and almost make the area feel chilly as you move about . It may take some getting used to ; since the slippery nylon has less friction than traditional boxers , the shorts you are wearing over them -LRB- I hope you are wearing shorts - I 've seen one dude wear it alone -RRB- may slip unexpectedly in undesirable directions .
 Under Armour Compression shorts are just fabulous to wear under your normal gym work out shorts . They feel comfortable and give you added supports when performing your gym workout routines . I have several pairs of these shorts , and I highly recommend them for any active person .
 These are super comfortable and work really well . I wear them underneath my gym shorts and they stay in place the way they are supposed to .
 Got them from Road Runner via Amazon.The shorts fit well , hold up under heavy use -LRB- I already had a pair -RRB- . I was familiar with Road Runner having purchased from them directly in the past so I was comfortable with the arrangement . Suffice it to say I was not disappointed .
 These shorts are exactly what I expected . They compress my legs very well , and do n't slide around . The waistband is quite comfortable , and does n't sit too high . These shorts are obviously intended to be work under your gym shorts , so if you 're looking for running shorts to wear by themselves , these are n't them . That said , they work exceptionally well , and I have had no issues with chafing since I started using these . Definitely worth the price !
 These work so well . I got a black pair for Christmas and needed a pair of white ones for my white soccer shorts . They help so much in recovery and I could n't recommend them more .
 Excellent buy for a quality product . The fit is wonderful and does the job very well . Tops on my list of Under Armour products .
 Just starting to work out . They feel right perfect . Hope we have to buy a smaller size soon . Thank you !
 U do n't even feel bothered by them , helps you work out without worrying about how lose ur shirts are or if u r sweating too much , u wo n't even notice u wearing them . .
 I 'd like if they rode a little lower , especially since they have no fly , but overall they are quite comfortable . And sexy , I 'm told : - -RRB-
 These are Nice Under Armour black heat gear compression shorts that are great for working out in and for other purposes .
 I like turning heads when i wear these jogging around town . They fit great , but still make me shafe just a bit . You uncircumsized guys are lukcy you dont have to deal with that .
 I purchased this for my partner . It is exactly what he wanted . He really loves them ! Very comfortable , excellent fit , perfect for workouts .
 These compression shorts are very comfortable and very durable . True to size and after repeated washings they do not shrink or loose their elasticity . I would highly recommend .
 Bought one pair , they 're great when I go the gym and do sit ups on the mats I do n't have to worry about my balls showing ; not that I care but could get arrested . I 'll be buying another pair soon .
 I USED TO WORK OUT WITH BOXERS UNDER MY SHORTS ... NOW THAT I OWN ONE OF THESE , I CA N'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTABLE MY WORKOUT IS . I USE THEM FOR JOGGING AND SOCCER . IT 'S GREAT FOR PRETTY MUCH ANY KIND OF EXERCISE . WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN !

 Just got mine today and I am lovin it !!! Nice fit & nice color as well . Under armour never disappoints me love there gear ! Overall I would def . recommend buying from this seller
 The product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted . In the past , these shorts have been great quality and have lasted much longer than other brands I have tried .
 These are great . I just got two pairs - One from Scheels and one from Amazon . Amazon 's are much better . They are comfortable and have made working out slightly less ackward on declined and ab workouts . They wick away a lot of the seat from your body . I would recomend these to anyone .
 Nice . These were tight and snug . These were a good length and exactly what I wanted . Buy it .
 love these ! I wear them every time I run.They keep my hamstrings nice and warm .

 Men 's HeatGear Compression 7 &#34; Shorts Bottoms by Under Armour 3XL . Great draws , fit like a glove ! need a few more
 Bought these for my husband to run in - he 's very happy with them . They are snug enough to prevent any chaffing but still comfortable .
 I wear compression shorts nearly all the time . I have very big legs and have problems with chafing since I do a lot of walking . I always wear these when playing softball or golf and they provide a very secure feel.My only complaint about these is that I find they tend to wear out faster than I would like . I 've purchased 10 or so pairs over the past 4 years , and I 've found that the inner thighs wear out on me after 8-10 months of daily wear . -LRB- which I must say is a lot longer than boxer briefs tend to last -RRB- Compared to other brands I 've used -LRB- champion , BCG , Nike -RRB- , I think that these are far superior in feel/support , and about average in durability.Overall I love these shorts , and will continue to purchase them .
 I love it . It is thick and tight . I would buy more but it is a little too expensive . YES
 Great quality , thick material with great support . Recommend it for running , not cycling as there are too many seams in the crotch area .

They 're a little pricey compared to others , but for the additional comfort and better quality , its worth it . So far they 've held up perfectly with no noticeable wear .
 After reading reviews , I ordered large UA shorts , a size larger than my normal . Way too small and ended getting XXL that fits right . Amazon/Vendor was excellent with exchange . I have 33in waist but with muscular `` cyclist '' build below the waist . Worn for just a couple of weeks and liking the fit and performance . Price comparable to local stores - bought before tax on online orders .
 I received the Under Armour Heatgear Compression Short in the time of the offer , no delays , , the quality best than expected , 100 % recommended .
 Good buy and the colour is what I really want . Ca n't be any better . The compression , stretchability and feel is fantastic . Pricing is also reasonable .
 Bought these for my husband . His legs have always rubbed together and he gets a rash and complains of the pain . Mind you ... he weighs 190 lbs just has bigger legs . Anyhow , he has noticed a huge difference . He will not swim without these under his swim trunks now and if we have to walk a long ways or exercise ... he will not leave home without them . A huge lifesaver , we bought a couple more pair plus some of the underwear ones . Thanks Under Armour !
 These shorts work just fine and dont stretch at all throughout my workouts . I primarily bought them to help with chaffing while running , and so far i have not chaffed at all .
 This product works as advertised but is starting to wear and breakdown very easily . Durability is the only concern I have with it
 I use this compression short regularly for longer hikes and bicycle rides . Wo n't go back to using cotton undergarments for sports - No Chaffing , mostly dry even after long hikes/rides , dries overnight .
 Fit well , breathes easy . He wears these under his softball gear , and even under suits for formal events . He loves them .
 I bought these for exercising and put them to the real test when I went on a ten mile day hike . I was in waste deep water for nearly an hour and did n't wait to dry before starting my departure . I walked for two and a half hours solid and had absolutely no chaffing . What more do I need to say ? I am a believer in Under Armour . Add the waterproof Newport sandals and you are an ATV on the trails .
 This is an excellent product for many high intensity sports applications . Good support , excellent wicking , and snag free design make these shorts cool and comfortable .
 I purchased these for the man in my life . Compared to other similar items , these rate the best quality and just overall fit/likeablility . They are holding up well with frequent use and frequent washing . I would recommend these to anyone !
 I am a novice runner -LRB- ~ 9 miles a week -RRB- and i got these to help with running on treadmills . These pants are confortable and they keep everything in place . I am 5 ' 10 '' 230 # - I got the XL and they are about 1 '' above the knee . My only nit is that the compression on the legs could be a little tighter but that is probably the fact that I went a size up . Bought a second pair with longer legs and I like them just as much .
 I got these shorts in order to get gear for my first mud run . These are awesome . They kept the mud and sweat out of all the right places . I would def recommend .
 Underarmour has the thickest compression shorts , very durable , comfortable and fairly inexpensive . I am a Nike fan , but I have to go with under armour with these .
 Five-star rating for the quality of the product , but they run small . I ordered a large and it was just too small for me . I wear 36 '' pants comfortably , although I measure 38 '' around my waist at its thickest point . My thigh is 25 '' at its thickest point , and I measure 41 '' around my butt .
 Great product especially for the price . Only know I have is the stitching between the legs can cause slight chaffing if you 're running for longer periods of time . If not for that it would get 5 stars for sure .
 these compression shorts are quite good . the fabric is good , very good I would say . on the outside it 's almost frictionless between the thighs for instance , when I 'm running . it deals with moisture very nicely as well and stretches very well . only con is that I 've had other compression shorts that have a small pouch/pocket on the backside with a zipper , that you can put your keys in for example . that 's something very useful . if these would 've had that , I would 've awarded 5 stars .
 Would recommend over any other brand not because its Under Armour but the fact that it is really great and stays tight to hold everything in place during exercise when using the treadmill or doing some Insanity Workout DVDs . Great Product if your considering this its worth the extra buck because of how durable it is .
 I got these compression shorts after starting to play indoor soccer again with some people from work and tweaking my quad . I have used these about 10 times sofar , each time it has remained snug , keeping my muscles warm . Washing them has not lessened their quality.Pros : - Remain snug the entire time wearing them keeping the muscles warm - Does not stretch out , high quality - Holds up fine in the washCons : - Only thing really is there a bit pricier than other options but they are worth itI would definitely get these again , and have actually been looking around to get another .
 The Under Armor Compression shorts were my first pair I ever had . I found them to be very comfortable and of good quality . I would buy this brand again , as well as suggest this brand for my friends .
 These are great , but since I am in between a small and medium , I had to order the mediums from Under Armour .
 if your going for more of just an under layer and not a layer of protection from sliding , id go with teh performance breifs .
 it arrived extremely late , to the point where i wondered if i had been robbed . Be prepared for an extra 2-3 weeks on the shipping estimate .
 At 14.99 for a Bill Blass ... It 's about time.Washes beautifully ... wears like a 50.00 shirt .
 These are great shirts for my tastes . I hate heavy shirts . I tend to wear short sleeves year round and I live in the north country ! I just do n't like heavy cloth on my arms . These shirts are just right for when I need to be in a coat and tie . They feel nice and do n't get too hot . The light colors are somewhat translucent but those who complain about see-through are the cretins that do n't wear underwear . Wear a T-shirt and they look nice and feel nice . For the price these are a bargain . I 've bought six in 3 separate orders .
 Two co-workers and I ordered these shirts . We are all extremely satisfied with them . These shirts are an excellent value . We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues .
 I bought this for my husband and we 've had no problems with this shirt or the polo shirts . they 've washed just fine . he wears the white shirt under suits and he 's an MBA student . he 's worn them to interviews .
 If you wear dress shirts to work everyday , you might choose to pick up a few `` cheapies '' for some days . These shirts fit well , the measurements seem to be accurate -LRB- mine were 16.5 34/35 -RRB- and in line with many of my `` brand name '' shirts . They are however thin , a nice clean undershirt is a must . That being said , they are good value for money , especially if you tend to stain shirts often ... cheap enough to throw away , nice enough to wear to the office .
 Nice shirts and they wash well . The material is abit -LRB- if you like thick fabric this is not for you -RRB- thin but in my case I like that , if you wear a tee-shirt under it 's perfect.Very simple and classic style , you can feel comfortable buying 2 or 3 and holding one back for later . This style does n't go out of style .
 My wife and I are in resale . I ordered these shirts about a month ago . Upon arrival , I was skeptical , so only ordered two , based on some of the reviews in here . But instead found these shirts to be very good in quality , considering the price . While it 's true that the material is thin , the quality of workmanship is very good . I only ordered two to see what the quality was . If this offer comes again I will surely order more .
 This shirt is really nice , fine quality . It is a great feel and a great look . I just machine wash and tumble dry and they look amazing fresh out of the dryer , no ironing needed .
 I did n't know what to expect since this shirt was priced at a `` clearance '' level . Wow am I surprised . What has amazed me the most is how well it takes and holds a press . With a little spray starch and a steam iron it looks like it was done by a professional . I would buy it again !
 Read all the reviews and bought 5 of these Bill Blass Dress Shirts.The fit is very good . Washability is excellent . Colors offered are the most popular for basic colors.As far as the few reviews regarding `` thin fabric '' ... some of the most expensive shirt fabrics are amde from fine yarns . Fine yarns are usually thinner yarns made from a good quality combed cotton.These are not THIN because they are poor shirts , they are thinner and finer fabrics . At this price everyone should buy at least a dozen shirts.Amazon ... keep up the good work.Hope you have more colors next year.Also ... Bill Blass was one of America 's premier desginers for over 30 years .
 Of course , it is just another white shirt -- but a great one for the price , and my husband loved it .
 The shirts are excellent . I wore both shirts that I bought the next couple of days to work . Excellent deal ! This was the first time I purchased from Amazon.com , and I am totally satisfied . I would purchase from Amazon.com again !
 My grandson is lable conscious ... I like value . This is a perfect combination of the two . The shirt is beautiful and he loves it . Plus he loves the Bill Blass lable ! I loved the value and it looks great on him . Anne V.
 For $ 6.00 , this shirt is great . Yes , it is thin , but it looks absolutely fine . I have the ecru and wear an undershirt .
 I love the way the shirt looks when you add a tie . This shirt comes out crisp and clean looking with a little spray starch and a good hot iron.I brought a few of these to wear for work and they go great with my suits . The shirt also looks great without as a tie as well .
 My son 's work shirts are a perfect fit . Also extremely quick delivery .
 I bought this dress shirt for $ 5 on Amazon and what a great deal . No seconds , etc. . Quality shirt . If you purchase this shirt you will not be sorry . Very impressive .
 How can you beat buying a Bill Blass dress shirt for the low low price of $ 7.50 . You ca n't ! Well I bought two and I 'm extremely satisfied , the timely manner that I received it in and the great packaging are excellent .
 I was wary about buying since the price was so low , but the shirt is quite good . I own many brands of dress shirts , some are expensive , some not . This is a nice shirt . It is n't see-thru like some of the other reviews said . It is just right for wearing under a suit in the warmer weather . You can go wrong at this price !!
 As always , Amazon.com delivers right on time and great quality . I bought this shirt for my son-in-law who will be changing job positions and will require dress shirts and suits . He lives in another state , so it is great to use the bill to this address and ship to this address feature that Amazon.com offers . My son-in-law was very pleased with the shirt and service .
 I like the shirt but I wish the material was thicker .
 This is a three star shirt with four stars because the price is so great . They are n't great but they 're certainly not bad - they 're a basic shirt , fit nicely , a little starch and they look real good . Hold the creases really well . I bought one , was happy with it and ordered two more .
 First off , the shirts are good . They are thin , but they look good . The collar tips have built-in plastic strips to keep them pointed and crisp . They come out of the dryer pretty good w/o wrinkles if you use the wrinkle-guard cycle . However , the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you . The shirt in this pic above has a much tougher , textured material , and the actual shirt has a white label , not black as in the pic . So , expect a very thin , smooth , untextured but stylish shirt , with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice , but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get .
 The shirt is very nice and the even the fabric is good I certainly recommand for very decent price . I do not think you can find a shirt so cheap.Thank you
 For 7.89 I was suspicious until I received my package.This is a real Bill Blass and is excellent.Going back for 2 Blues and 4 more White ... can never have too much of those colors.Wish the Ecru & Pink were availabe now .
 i was n't expecting much at first but this is actually top quality in any standards . First i bought one to make sure the size fits and then i bought more , many more .
 I am a guy who wears formal shirt and tie to my office , so I have lots of shirts and I know a good shirt when I wear it.This was my first purchase of a Bill Blass Dress Shirt , so I did not quite know what to expect.Well I have now worn it a few times and it has been laundered and ironed and is still holding up well.I would recommend this shirt which I bought at an excellent price in a recent Amazon sale .
 Paid about US$ 8 per for these and believe I got a true bargain . Compared to other shirts I buy for work , some costing 2 times more than I paid for these , I believe Bill Blass shirts stand a notch above the rest . They are a bit thin , I agree , but I usually use undershirts . Further , they are not really thinner than the Van Huesen shirts I pay at least 2 times more for and the cut is better.If you are in the sallary cap that normally buys US$ 42 - $ 50 shirts for work then you might be a bit dissapointed in how thin they are but for middle income people like me who only have a few special shirts over US$ 42 , they are just the ticket .
 Other purposes of a Bill Blass dress shirt beyond simply wearing it.-Contrary to popular opinion , the cufflinks DO stop bullets . -LRB- Yes , it does have cufflinks . -RRB- - For strong brews of coffee that need to be diluted , try filtering it through a pink Bill Blass dress shirt 2-3 times.-The Fashion Pointed Collars are a good substitute for a 5-bladed razor.-Also , if you happen to side part your hair , this shirt is a noticeable distaction , so people might not notice.-Are you aware that this is a fantastic field bandage kit for gaping artery wounds and 6th degree burns ? - Even though the label claims to help in the pursuit of a girlfriend , I have yet to capitalize on this function.I admire the pure genius of Bill Blass to design and put into being such a wonderful creation of pure , fabulous fashion and function . I heartily recommend this shirt !!!
 My French Blue Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar arrived on my doorstep the very day of my trip to the Bahamas . I was flying in my company jet plane with this outstanding shirt on . When my `` thingy '' on the plane went out . I do n't really have a pilot 's license , so do n't tell anyone . Anyway , I jumped out of the plane , but my parachute failed to deploy . I suddenly ripped off my shirt and used it to maneuver through the wind currents of the South Pacific . The shirt landed me safely on a local island . I spent the next 5 years of my life foraging for food on the island . At the end of the time I had run out of food , so I cut off the Fashion Pointed Collars and used them to spear local pigs . The rest of the shirt I made into my closest companion by drawing a smiley face on him and calling him `` Bill Blass . '' Sadly , I had to use Bill Blass for a signal fire , which I started by rubbing his buttons together . I was rescued by a low-flying plane who saw my signal fire . Now , in tribute , to Bill Blass , I have donated my life funds to buying a lifetime supply of shirts for myself and the rest of my family for 6 generations to come .
 lent tailoring and quality . I personally prefer a little more cotton in the material . Still , a good buy .
 The shirts were certainly worth the bargain price . The shipping time was fine .
 Of course the list price is a joke . However , for the price , the quality is quite good . It uses thin material but is fine for summer . It is about 1/2 size larger than most brands so you might want to go for the smaller sizes . Just remember , this is not your $ 65 deparment store shirt . And yes , only the blue colors look good .
 Great shirts for the price . Equal quality of the more expensive shirts at a fraction of the cost . I consider this purchase a real buy .
 for 8 bucks , these shirts are fine . super saver shipping is fast , too .
 I purchased this in white and Ecru colors and I love them . THey seem to be pretty comfortable and even the material may not be the best but it is not bad at all for the price .
 My husband asked me to send this in.He is very very pleased with these Bill Blass shirts.Comfortable , good colors , wash great.He does not understand the comments about Thin fabric ... this is a good weight fabric and not too heavy.Also the collar stays are permanently sewn into colllar instead of the removable type . Why id this a problem ? This way they do not get lost.Try these shirts ... they are good .
 Amazon always offers merchandise with magical properties . This shirt does not fall short of that standard . When most people buy a $ 10 shirt , they do n't expect it to be life-changing . This shirt changed my life !!!!!!!!! What makes this shirt so magical , is that it is crafted from the finest cotton found on the back of the Lovett Ogre . And the buttons were forged from unicorn ivory . When this shirt is buttoned up all the way , the wearer has the ability to take flight and disappear . And I 've also heard reports that people can dodge missiles when enshrouded in the magical Bill Blass dress shirt with a fashion pointed collar . For those who work in the world of academia , the magic does n't stop there ... it gets the ladies .
 These are very good shirts , especially when you consider the excellent low cost . I have about 8 of these and have washed and dried 4 of them at least 15 times . Shirt looks EXCELLENT and I am very happy with them.Collars still look flat and smooth.I certainly recommend them.Is it the best shirt I 've ever owned ... surely not , but it is a good product in good colors .
 This shirt definitely worth the bucks . It fits me nicely and pretty comfortable . The only thing people may pick on is it 's pretty thin and you got ta wear undershirt or else you might be showing your nips . I mainly wear it to work and some co-workers thought I am sort of `` dressed up '' . So , I guess that 's a nice thing to hear about this shirt .
 First , a horrifying coincidence happened when the UPS man dropped the package containing my Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar onto my doorstep just as The General , my wife 's wiener dog , was exiting through his doggy door . The weight of this seemingly light package crushed The General 's aft legs on impact as he went for his morning tinkle . The General gimped back into the house , without tinkling , limping and screeching . Since my wife was gone , and I had recently seen a program on the Discovery Channel about amputation , I decided to take it upon myself to help The General out of his misery . As I was cutting off his hind legs , my wife came home . End of story . Apart from that , it 's a lovely shirt , and I 'd recommend it to anyone ! Good luck .
 Nice shirt . Well made . Good price . What more can I say ?
 The shirts are what I had asked for . They are sturdy and well made . I would buy more if I needed more . Well worth the money spent
 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA
 they are awesome !! they have a great feel and nice texture-very rich looking . great for dress-up an down . Got 3 differnt styles for my husband
 I knew I should have bought more the first time . Now they are out of stock . I wish Amazon would get more great dress shirt brands like Gittman , Bill Blass , Brooks Bros.Any way I bought 5 a few weeks ago and this is a great shirt.Everyone in my office bought a few and loves them.Thanks Amazon ... you are THE BEST .
 Nice shirts and they wash well . The material is abit -LRB- if you like thick fabric this is not for you -RRB- thin but in my case I like that , if you wear a tee-shirt under it 's perfect.Very simple and classic style , you can feel comfortable buying 2 or 3 and holding one back for later .

 Great shirts for the price . Equal quality of the more expensive shirts at a fraction of the cost . I consider this purchase a real buy .
 for 8 bucks , these shirts are fine . super saver shipping is fast , too .
 I purchased this in white and Ecru colors and I love them . THey seem to be pretty comfortable and even the material may not be the best but it is not bad at all for the price .
 My husband asked me to send this in.He is very very pleased with these Bill Blass shirts.Comfortable , good colors , wash great.He does not understand the comments about Thin fabric ... this is a good weight fabric and not too heavy.Also the collar stays are permanently sewn into colllar instead of the removable type . Why id this a problem ? This way they do not get lost.Try these shirts ... they are good .
 Amazon always offers merchandise with magical properties . This shirt does not fall short of that standard . When most people buy a $ 10 shirt , they do n't expect it to be life-changing . This shirt changed my life !!!!!!!!! What makes this shirt so magical , is that it is crafted from the finest cotton found on the back of the Lovett Ogre . And the buttons were forged from unicorn ivory . When this shirt is buttoned up all the way , the wearer has the ability to take flight and disappear . And I 've also heard reports that people can dodge missiles when enshrouded in the magical Bill Blass dress shirt with a fashion pointed collar . For those who work in the world of academia , the magic does n't stop there ... it gets the ladies .
 These are very good shirts , especially when you consider the excellent low cost . I have about 8 of these and have washed and dried 4 of them at least 15 times . Shirt looks EXCELLENT and I am very happy with them.Collars still look flat and smooth.I certainly recommend them.Is it the best shirt I 've ever owned ... surely not , but it is a good product in good colors .
 This shirt definitely worth the bucks . It fits me nicely and pretty comfortable . The only thing people may pick on is it 's pretty thin and you got ta wear undershirt or else you might be showing your nips . I mainly wear it to work and some co-workers thought I am sort of `` dressed up '' . So , I guess that 's a nice thing to hear about this shirt .
 First , a horrifying coincidence happened when the UPS man dropped the package containing my Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar onto my doorstep just as The General , my wife 's wiener dog , was exiting through his doggy door . The weight of this seemingly light package crushed The General 's aft legs on impact as he went for his morning tinkle . The General gimped back into the house , without tinkling , limping and screeching . Since my wife was gone , and I had recently seen a program on the Discovery Channel about amputation , I decided to take it upon myself to help The General out of his misery . As I was cutting off his hind legs , my wife came home . End of story . Apart from that , it 's a lovely shirt , and I 'd recommend it to anyone ! Good luck .
 Nice shirt . Well made . Good price . What more can I say ?
 The shirts are what I had asked for . They are sturdy and well made . I would buy more if I needed more . Well worth the money spent
 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA
 I was pleasantly surprised with the swimsuit - it was exactly what I was hoping to find . The colors are amazing and I have received numerous compliments on the suit . People ca n't believe I found a suit without trying it on first !
 OK , I 'm like most women who would love to lose a few pounds ... well I did ! All I had to do was wear this bathing suit and I swear I look skinnier ! The suit is comfortable , and this print is contemporary .
 It fit me great , was on time - better than I thought judging from the pictue
 Looks and fits great ! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform . He loves them ...
 I 'm glad i got these shirts , i need them for work and they are working very well theyre long enough so that when you bend over or crouch down you do n't have to keep pulling them down , the material feels nice , and they dont shrink very much in the wash so they still fit fine after 5 washes . They are n't very thick or very thin so theres no problem there.I 'd recommend them to anyone who needs a good shirt at a fair price .
 They have a little bit bigger size . I ordered a medium shirt for my kid and its a little bit big . I have n't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him .
 This is a great shirt ! My husband has a very long back and this shirt was long enough even for him . Fits very well and fabric is nice too .
 I know that Amazon.com does not sell everything you need in life but they come darn close!I bought 2 polo style shirts for me & my Husband . I Coordinate a C.E.R.T. -LRB- Community Emergency Response Team -RRB- being a leader , I need to look as nice as I can when I am meeting new members , local elected officials , and other related `` CERT '' business . The shirts are a great quality , very reasonably priced and I am never disapointed in Amazon . From Gifts to Gadgets , Amazon is the place I go ! Thanks for all you do !
 The price was great ... delivery was on time and quality was terrific . I would definitely buy from this seller again . No disappointment .
 great lightweight loved the color when i got it ! The color on screen didnt do the shirt justice ! I am going to order a few more for my husband .
 The product was exactly as I had expected , and came quickly . I had to buy two for an expo , not knowing of they would of satisfactory quality , but fortunately , they were professional looking enough and did the trick.Overall , I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 You definitely feel that it is not 100 % cotton but for the price it is still a great shirt . They are lite enough that I just wear a cotton tank underneath so do n't feel the poly so much . They do shrink a bit , but not too much , I typically get shirts in XL so when the shrink they fit right . These almost did n't shrink enough . Probably after a few washes they will . I wear a 42-44 jacket as a reference .
 I like those shirts , comfortable good size , all the info correct so recommend for any body , I going o buy some more
 I took a chance on ordering these shirts -LRB- I do n't usually order clothing from the ` net -RRB- , and am very glad I did . They fit well , are light weight , and the collars hold up under washing . Great shirt , at a fantastic price !
 The quality was more than I expected for the price . Bought this for work and it 's perfect for the food biz .
 The size is accurate , the fit is just right , and the spot shield is an added plus . Overall , very happy with the purchase .
 what can I say other than it was exactly what I expected and fit well . I like the idea of &#34; SpotShield &#34; since I apparently get stuff on my front quite often .
 love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable , material is soft great price would definely recommend product
 I like the feel of the material and that it is by Jerzees.I recommend it to family and friends .
 Perkier bust ? Check.Lifts the tush ? Check.Smooths out the bulges and drops inches ? Check.I purchased this to help with diastasis recti after childbirth -LRB- seperation of abdominal muscles -RRB- . I suffered with it after having my children and have been looking for shapewear that could really do the job . So far this delivers . Immediately after putting this on I had already dropped 4 inches around my mid-section . After taking it off at night I can tell a big difference in my abdominal tone . The only negative for this would be that it is rather thick and may not work well for someone looking to wear it under evening-wear or other light-weight clothing , the rubber on the outside can make getting clothing on a challenge but it 's do-able . So far I 'm really satisfied with this .
 Its a wonderful product that helped my wife to regain her curves , so comfortably . Although she has been using this regularly , she 's been complaining of the garment not being able to breath through properly and as a result of this , she is forced to remove them within 1-2 hours .
 I have mixed feelings about this product . Before buying this product , I went online and read several posts that said that they had issues with the product being too tight . Surprisingly , I find this product slightly big , even though I bought the right size . This might be related to the garment not feeling tight enough , but I also measured myself before and after I put in the garment and found that I did NOT lose inches . As a matter of fact , I was the same even after I hooked myself up on the smallest setting . But maybe that 's because the material of this garment is a bit on the thick side ? Not sure . Anyways , I think I 'm going to send it back for the smaller size and see what happens . It does flatten my rolls of fat though ...
 Well , I purchased this bad boy after baby number two , and let me tell you ; je ne regrette rien . It 's tight , and takes some getting used to initially , but let me tell you , one look in the mirror after not having a waist for 6 months ... you will forget about that.I laave eet . Does what it says , which is why I slapped down paper for it . Ca n't wait to see the results after 30 days !
 When I purchased this item , I was looking for an item that I could wear everyday , with the idea of purchasing 1 for each day of the week . The sizing is a little tricky , inspite of measuring myself . I ordered 1 size up . I had to have my husband help me put on this garment , which he could hardly do without laughing . Once the garment was on his jaw dropped to see that there was a BIG difference . The compression is awesome ! This garment really helped my lower back pain ! It lifted my breast , reduced my saddlebags , but most of all flattened my stomach . It was a little difficult to slide my pants on over this garment , because of the outter rubber shell . I was able to wear this garment for almost 10 hours . All in all I like this garment , but it needs to be redesigned with the crouch opening a little further to the back for potty time . This garment is magical and it delivered !
 ok so I have n't had the squeem for too long to give a long term review -LRB- just received today -RRB- but I can say that it is torture just putting it on ! It took me a full 30 minutes to fasten all the hook and eye closures and adjust it . With that being said , it looks very promising and am excited to see what it does in 30 + days of full time wear . Very excited . I do like it so far -LRB- the few hours I 've been wearing it -RRB-
 Brought this product as a gift for my mom . She loves it ! It supports her back as well as hold her in and give her a better shape . You will need assistance putting this on though
 My niece just gave birth two weeks ago and started wearing it two days ago . You can already see the difference ! Amazing ! Works really well . My niece is normally M but after giving birth may be L. Buy it one size larger and you can adjust it to a tighter setting . Very well recommended !
 I received my Squeem Rubber Derriere Lift Body Shaper on Friday 11th ; after learning how to put it on I 'm now on my 3rd day wearing it for 8-10 hours a day . My 3xL garment fits my male body nicely and does most of the things advertised like helping with posture , nicely shape the bottom , and certainly helps with food intakes ; compression is mild yet firm . The bra straps work well with not letting the upper material roll down . All in all , a very nice garment worth wearing at all times . I will update my comment in 4 weeks.Squeem Rubber Derriere Lift Body Shaper Style 26JB - Black - 3XLarge
 fits well struggle to get it on first few times but great for holding you in . but tends to cut into arm
 This piece of shapewear has single handedly increased my confidence ten-fold . I wear it about 4-5 times per week and it makes me look amazing in clothes I have not been able to wear in over a year . I specifically selected this shapewear because I thought it would squeeze in my hip area and it definitely is . My muffin top is completely gone and I feel confident wearing almost any shirt now.At first , I thought I was doomed trying to fasten this thing together , but I quickly got the hang of it and found it to be quite comfortable . Of course , it is winter , so this extra layer of insulation is welcome . When I take it off at night , my skin feels freakishly soft and very warm -LRB- but not sweaty . -RRB- I have n't figured out an elegant way to use the restroom yet without basically taking off all my clothes , but it 's a small pice to pay for looking fabulous . The only complaint i have is that the arm area pinches a bit .
 I think these garments run small so I should have ordered the next size up which is what i am going to do very soon !
 It 's amazing what a little , well , alot of rubber will do to enhance one 's figure . Wore it under a saronge and too tight shirt to a wedding last night - felt like a Barbie doll . Got ta love a product that allows one to not only fit into , but unabashedly wear all of the tight clothes in one 's closet while making the bulges disappear , but also corrects one 's posture . Of course you know , standing up straight and tall makes the boobies stick out further too , hence , the Barbie doll look . The only real challenge comes at potty time - if one is wearing pants - but I 've got that one worked out to my full satisfaction . I like this product !
 UPDATE ! I decided to keep the size that I had , and if I could I would change my star rating to a 5 ! The first time I wore this for an entire day , I felt like passing out by the time I got home because it did constrict me a ton ! So I did n't wear it for a few days but then I decided to give it a try again . I 've been wearing it consistently and I 've LOST WEIGHT ! For one , I do n't eat as much because having it compress my stomach makes me not hungry . My waist has also MOST definitely shrunk in size -LRB- measuring it without body shaper -RRB- because of how it holds it all together . Anyways , this is a great weight loss aid ! Give it a week or so before you decide it 's worthless .
 this garment is very difficult to wear with jeans but overall the rubber outer layer is the insulating factor the rubber stays warm even when your not doing nothing . This garment helps you lose weight.I originally ordered a 2x I recently ordered another a smaller one in size xl . I am confident the rubber is the major factor in this garments effect of helping me lose inches.I am very pleased with this product I only wish the crotch opening carried all the way to the back that is the only reason I gave 4 stars
 pros : definately makes you look slimmer , I was totally amazed how flat my stomache got!fast deliveryseems durable enough to hold me inmakes you sweatmakes you not want to eat as much cause its so tightmade that `` hourglass '' figurecons : hard to put onrubs your underarmsALWAYS get one size bigger , i got a smaller size and my legs started to go numb , i guess from all the compression.hard to use the bathroom with it on.you can see the hooks through your clothesdo n't plan on sitting down or bending with it on cause its impossible
 After having 3 children i 've had what i like to call a muffin ' top ! There 's no exercise that has worked for me trying to lose my belly . I have been using this product for a little over a month now and i have lost about 3.5 inches around my waist without any sort of exercise . I do need a smaller size now but i will keep using it , it 's like magic , keeps everything in place . IT WORKS !
 This review is for the ` Squeem Ladies ' All-in-One Cincher ' , I totally LOVE this ! I bought it because it boasts being able to help reduce back pain . I am a nurse and spend three 12-hour shifts on my feet and my back hurts terribly bad by the end of the shift and during usually . With this is does make a huge difference ! My back does n't hurt as badly , just a slight tired feeling I guess . Also it smooths me out ALL over ... and makes me feel slimmer . I weigh -LRB- cant believe ima say this -RRB- 241 pound at 5 ' 6 Tall . I ordered the size 2XL - waist 40 inches . At first when I received it I tried to put it on and gave up quickly . This was because I have never in my life ever worn a body suit or body shaper , also because I tried to put the rubber side again my skin verses the cloth side ... I know lol read directions ... The hardest part with this suit is the fastening . It is hard being that it is meant to be very tight and I have a lot of pudge to control behind the belly flaps ... but once it is on it is well worth the struggle . Make sure you put your arms through the loops first , do the belly part , then around the legs last with your legs straight in standing position or you will not be able to fascine the thigh areas.But well thought the cost and struggle to get in it . I work drive 45minutes to work , 12 hour shift , 45 minutes home ... and it stay comfy and is n't painful or hard to breathe in . then I get home , take it off and shower quickly and go to sleep ! I bought two , one in black and one in beige .
 A little uncomfortable but definitely does the job . I looked at least 5-10 lbs thinner .
 I JUST RECEIVED MINE YESTERDAY AND IT WAS AMAZING . I dropped 5 inches off of my waist . The squeem pulled all of my lower abs up and it curved my buttocks more . Lastly all of my love handles vanished . I am about to order my second shaper so when I am washing one the other is ready to wear . I strongly recommend this over Body Magic .
 This is a great product and it is very comfortable to wear . However , this is summer and I found myself aggravated with the humidity and unable to tolerate my body being squished in this thing , so I have not worn it too much yet . I wear it out and I look great in my clothes . There are no lines or anything that you can see that I have something under my clothes . I is a little difficult for clothes to go over as it is rubber material , but it kept my form fitting clothes in place . The cotton inside is nice and comfortable and it did not make me drenched when wearing it so I still felt clean after removing it .
 Definitely order a size up . I only did so because the vendor was out of large . I 'm really glad this happened because I could barely squeeze into the XL . So that is definitely a tip worth following.So far , I 'm noticing that it gaps a bit in the legs and crotch area but under clothes it should n't be that noticeable . If you 're apple shaped like I am , expect it to be difficult to squeeze into . I 'm noticing that it definitely makes you sit up straight . Not a ton of mobility but that 's what you 'd expect from something like this . A definite trade off .
 This seller was great , I recieved my product in a matter of days , ... and not weeks . The product was exactly what the seller said it was , and it did everything the seller said it would do .
 I have been wary for some time about ordering shorts or pants online without trying them on , but when I saw these on the Friday Sale , I figured they were so cheap it was worth the risk . They fit exactly as advertised , which is not always the case with clothing companies selling on amazon . I have since bought 3 more pairs of shorts from Quicksilver through amazon , and they 've all been terrific deals .
 I love the way the shirt looks when you add a tie . This shirt comes out crisp and clean looking with a little spray starch and a good hot iron.I brought a few of these to wear for work and they go great with my suits . The shirt also looks great without as a tie as well .
 My son 's work shirts are a perfect fit . Also extremely quick delivery .
 I bought this dress shirt for $ 5 on Amazon and what a great deal . No seconds , etc. . Quality shirt . If you purchase this shirt you will not be sorry . Very impressive .
 How can you beat buying a Bill Blass dress shirt for the low low price of $ 7.50 . You ca n't ! Well I bought two and I 'm extremely satisfied , the timely manner that I received it in and the great packaging are excellent .
 I was wary about buying since the price was so low , but the shirt is quite good . I own many brands of dress shirts , some are expensive , some not . This is a nice shirt . It is n't see-thru like some of the other reviews said . It is just right for wearing under a suit in the warmer weather . You can go wrong at this price !!
 As always , Amazon.com delivers right on time and great quality . I bought this shirt for my son-in-law who will be changing job positions and will require dress shirts and suits . He lives in another state , so it is great to use the bill to this address and ship to this address feature that Amazon.com offers . My son-in-law was very pleased with the shirt and service .
 At 14.99 for a Bill Blass ... It 's about time.Washes beautifully ... wears like a 50.00 shirt .
 These are great shirts for my tastes . I hate heavy shirts . I tend to wear short sleeves year round and I live in the north country ! I just do n't like heavy cloth on my arms . These shirts are just right for when I need to be in a coat and tie . They feel nice and do n't get too hot . The light colors are somewhat translucent but those who complain about see-through are the cretins that do n't wear underwear . Wear a T-shirt and they look nice and feel nice . For the price these are a bargain . I 've bought six in 3 separate orders .
 Two co-workers and I ordered these shirts . We are all extremely satisfied with them . These shirts are an excellent value . We would recommend them highly to all our friends and colleagues .
 I bought this for my husband and we 've had no problems with this shirt or the polo shirts . they 've washed just fine . he wears the white shirt under suits and he 's an MBA student . he 's worn them to interviews .
 If you wear dress shirts to work everyday , you might choose to pick up a few `` cheapies '' for some days . These shirts fit well , the measurements seem to be accurate -LRB- mine were 16.5 34/35 -RRB- and in line with many of my `` brand name '' shirts . They are however thin , a nice clean undershirt is a must . That being said , they are good value for money , especially if you tend to stain shirts often ... cheap enough to throw away , nice enough to wear to the office .
 Nice shirts and they wash well . The material is abit -LRB- if you like thick fabric this is not for you -RRB- thin but in my case I like that , if you wear a tee-shirt under it 's perfect.Very simple and classic style , you can feel comfortable buying 2 or 3 and holding one back for later . This style does n't go out of style .
 My wife and I are in resale . I ordered these shirts about a month ago . Upon arrival , I was skeptical , so only ordered two , based on some of the reviews in here . But instead found these shirts to be very good in quality , considering the price . While it 's true that the material is thin , the quality of workmanship is very good . I only ordered two to see what the quality was . If this offer comes again I will surely order more .
 This shirt is really nice , fine quality . It is a great feel and a great look . I just machine wash and tumble dry and they look amazing fresh out of the dryer , no ironing needed .
 I did n't know what to expect since this shirt was priced at a `` clearance '' level . Wow am I surprised . What has amazed me the most is how well it takes and holds a press . With a little spray starch and a steam iron it looks like it was done by a professional . I would buy it again !
 Read all the reviews and bought 5 of these Bill Blass Dress Shirts.The fit is very good . Washability is excellent . Colors offered are the most popular for basic colors.As far as the few reviews regarding `` thin fabric '' ... some of the most expensive shirt fabrics are amde from fine yarns . Fine yarns are usually thinner yarns made from a good quality combed cotton.These are not THIN because they are poor shirts , they are thinner and finer fabrics . At this price everyone should buy at least a dozen shirts.Amazon ... keep up the good work.Hope you have more colors next year.Also ... Bill Blass was one of America 's premier desginers for over 30 years .
 Of course , it is just another white shirt -- but a great one for the price , and my husband loved it .
 The shirts are excellent . I wore both shirts that I bought the next couple of days to work . Excellent deal ! This was the first time I purchased from Amazon.com , and I am totally satisfied . I would purchase from Amazon.com again !
 My grandson is lable conscious ... I like value . This is a perfect combination of the two . The shirt is beautiful and he loves it . Plus he loves the Bill Blass lable ! I loved the value and it looks great on him . Anne V.
 For $ 6.00 , this shirt is great . Yes , it is thin , but it looks absolutely fine . I have the ecru and wear an undershirt .
 Great shirts for the price . Equal quality of the more expensive shirts at a fraction of the cost . I consider this purchase a real buy .
 for 8 bucks , these shirts are fine . super saver shipping is fast , too .
 I purchased this in white and Ecru colors and I love them . THey seem to be pretty comfortable and even the material may not be the best but it is not bad at all for the price .
 My husband asked me to send this in.He is very very pleased with these Bill Blass shirts.Comfortable , good colors , wash great.He does not understand the comments about Thin fabric ... this is a good weight fabric and not too heavy.Also the collar stays are permanently sewn into colllar instead of the removable type . Why id this a problem ? This way they do not get lost.Try these shirts ... they are good .
 Amazon always offers merchandise with magical properties . This shirt does not fall short of that standard . When most people buy a $ 10 shirt , they do n't expect it to be life-changing . This shirt changed my life !!!!!!!!! What makes this shirt so magical , is that it is crafted from the finest cotton found on the back of the Lovett Ogre . And the buttons were forged from unicorn ivory . When this shirt is buttoned up all the way , the wearer has the ability to take flight and disappear . And I 've also heard reports that people can dodge missiles when enshrouded in the magical Bill Blass dress shirt with a fashion pointed collar . For those who work in the world of academia , the magic does n't stop there ... it gets the ladies .
 These are very good shirts , especially when you consider the excellent low cost . I have about 8 of these and have washed and dried 4 of them at least 15 times . Shirt looks EXCELLENT and I am very happy with them.Collars still look flat and smooth.I certainly recommend them.Is it the best shirt I 've ever owned ... surely not , but it is a good product in good colors .
 This shirt definitely worth the bucks . It fits me nicely and pretty comfortable . The only thing people may pick on is it 's pretty thin and you got ta wear undershirt or else you might be showing your nips . I mainly wear it to work and some co-workers thought I am sort of `` dressed up '' . So , I guess that 's a nice thing to hear about this shirt .
 First , a horrifying coincidence happened when the UPS man dropped the package containing my Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar onto my doorstep just as The General , my wife 's wiener dog , was exiting through his doggy door . The weight of this seemingly light package crushed The General 's aft legs on impact as he went for his morning tinkle . The General gimped back into the house , without tinkling , limping and screeching . Since my wife was gone , and I had recently seen a program on the Discovery Channel about amputation , I decided to take it upon myself to help The General out of his misery . As I was cutting off his hind legs , my wife came home . End of story . Apart from that , it 's a lovely shirt , and I 'd recommend it to anyone ! Good luck .
 Nice shirt . Well made . Good price . What more can I say ?
 The shirts are what I had asked for . They are sturdy and well made . I would buy more if I needed more . Well worth the money spent
 I like the shirt but I wish the material was thicker .
 This is a three star shirt with four stars because the price is so great . They are n't great but they 're certainly not bad - they 're a basic shirt , fit nicely , a little starch and they look real good . Hold the creases really well . I bought one , was happy with it and ordered two more .
 First off , the shirts are good . They are thin , but they look good . The collar tips have built-in plastic strips to keep them pointed and crisp . They come out of the dryer pretty good w/o wrinkles if you use the wrinkle-guard cycle . However , the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you . The shirt in this pic above has a much tougher , textured material , and the actual shirt has a white label , not black as in the pic . So , expect a very thin , smooth , untextured but stylish shirt , with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice , but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get .
 The shirt is very nice and the even the fabric is good I certainly recommand for very decent price . I do not think you can find a shirt so cheap.Thank you
 For 7.89 I was suspicious until I received my package.This is a real Bill Blass and is excellent.Going back for 2 Blues and 4 more White ... can never have too much of those colors.Wish the Ecru & Pink were availabe now .
 i was n't expecting much at first but this is actually top quality in any standards . First i bought one to make sure the size fits and then i bought more , many more .
 I am a guy who wears formal shirt and tie to my office , so I have lots of shirts and I know a good shirt when I wear it.This was my first purchase of a Bill Blass Dress Shirt , so I did not quite know what to expect.Well I have now worn it a few times and it has been laundered and ironed and is still holding up well.I would recommend this shirt which I bought at an excellent price in a recent Amazon sale .
 Paid about US$ 8 per for these and believe I got a true bargain . Compared to other shirts I buy for work , some costing 2 times more than I paid for these , I believe Bill Blass shirts stand a notch above the rest . They are a bit thin , I agree , but I usually use undershirts . Further , they are not really thinner than the Van Huesen shirts I pay at least 2 times more for and the cut is better.If you are in the sallary cap that normally buys US$ 42 - $ 50 shirts for work then you might be a bit dissapointed in how thin they are but for middle income people like me who only have a few special shirts over US$ 42 , they are just the ticket .
 Other purposes of a Bill Blass dress shirt beyond simply wearing it.-Contrary to popular opinion , the cufflinks DO stop bullets . -LRB- Yes , it does have cufflinks . -RRB- - For strong brews of coffee that need to be diluted , try filtering it through a pink Bill Blass dress shirt 2-3 times.-The Fashion Pointed Collars are a good substitute for a 5-bladed razor.-Also , if you happen to side part your hair , this shirt is a noticeable distaction , so people might not notice.-Are you aware that this is a fantastic field bandage kit for gaping artery wounds and 6th degree burns ? - Even though the label claims to help in the pursuit of a girlfriend , I have yet to capitalize on this function.I admire the pure genius of Bill Blass to design and put into being such a wonderful creation of pure , fabulous fashion and function . I heartily recommend this shirt !!!
 My French Blue Bill Blass Dress Shirt with Fashion Pointed Collar arrived on my doorstep the very day of my trip to the Bahamas . I was flying in my company jet plane with this outstanding shirt on . When my `` thingy '' on the plane went out . I do n't really have a pilot 's license , so do n't tell anyone . Anyway , I jumped out of the plane , but my parachute failed to deploy . I suddenly ripped off my shirt and used it to maneuver through the wind currents of the South Pacific . The shirt landed me safely on a local island . I spent the next 5 years of my life foraging for food on the island . At the end of the time I had run out of food , so I cut off the Fashion Pointed Collars and used them to spear local pigs . The rest of the shirt I made into my closest companion by drawing a smiley face on him and calling him `` Bill Blass . '' Sadly , I had to use Bill Blass for a signal fire , which I started by rubbing his buttons together . I was rescued by a low-flying plane who saw my signal fire . Now , in tribute , to Bill Blass , I have donated my life funds to buying a lifetime supply of shirts for myself and the rest of my family for 6 generations to come .
 lent tailoring and quality . I personally prefer a little more cotton in the material . Still , a good buy .
 The shirts were certainly worth the bargain price . The shipping time was fine .
 Of course the list price is a joke . However , for the price , the quality is quite good . It uses thin material but is fine for summer . It is about 1/2 size larger than most brands so you might want to go for the smaller sizes . Just remember , this is not your $ 65 deparment store shirt . And yes , only the blue colors look good .
 I had tried this bra before in my normal size of 42DD and found that it did not fit well and the narrow shoulder straps dug into my shoulders . So I was very surprised that by going to the next larger cup size both the fit and shoulder strap issue were corrected . This is now one of my favorite bras and is the most supportive soft cup bra I have ever worn .
 I measured myself correctly according to Lady Grace 's site . I 'm sure it 's just one of those things where everyone 's body is different , but I had to have a seamstress friend reduce the cup size for me . The straps wo n't stay up to save my life , so that 's the big problem . Otherwise , the sides hold up well with the stays and are very wide . It 's only mildly uncomfortable in terms of the fabric not being soft enough . They discontinued this bra . Grab one if you can find one online somewhere !
 I have slight stretch marks on my hips and some celulite . I was amazed at how the mesh material hid those completely but you still could see some skin . My husband said it did ` nt look like I was trying to hide anything , it was a nice compliment to my bikini . mom-35-2 kids and bikini on the beach for the first time !
 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .

 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .
 Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal .
 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 I am 5 ' 10 '' and purchased the long in both white and black . The reviews are accurate in saying that the long is truly a long , but I love this purchase . The material quality is high and the style is very nice . The adjustable straps allowed me to pull it up , and while the straps do slip a bit , I could easily pin them in place and adjust according to the length of whatever I have on . I am very happy with this purchase .
 Item was sent quickly & well packaged . Item fit as the size indicated , and has held up to multiple washes w / line drying . I would purchase this item again .
 I ordered this slip online because it is getting more & more difficult to find larger size lingerie items in department stores -- especially full length slips . I like the design and material . It does seem to run a little small , but that 's OK becuse I want to lose weight !
 This is a wonderful slip . The fit is perfect and exactly to specified measurements . Excellent value !
 I bought it in a size 40 and I am a 38A bra , but it is still comfortable and fits well .
 perfect fit , and wonder why I have n't had one for so long . non clinging , full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort .
 Honestly , my biggest beef with this slip is that the white looks too white . I would 've liked the nude color in my size and short enough I can wear with the dresses I need this for , otherwise , does exactly what I needed .
 Washes and dries well in the dryer . Stays true to fit and keeps its shape wash after wash . This is the best lace full slip . I will be ordering another one .
 I love it ! It fits great ! and looks awesome ! I love wearing Vanity Fair full slips ! and my wife loves the look and feel !
 This is a very nice , well made slip . I plan to order one in a longer version . Sometimes I want the ease of a full slip under my dresses/skirts . I would recommend this . The slip arrived within a couple of days of my order which surprised and pleased me . I got it just when I needed it .
 The slip fit perfectly . The adjustable straps allowed me to play with the positioning under my dress and the length was on target .
 The cup area was just a little loose and bunchy -LRB- reason it got 4 instead of 5 -RRB- . I like the lace bottom , so if it shows a bit , it does n't look frumpy .
 I love this slip . I bought this slip to wear under my dresses that came to my knees and this works very nicely .
 Got this for my daughter for Christmas - she is delighted with it . Fits well , wears it with pride . She loves it .
 Vanity Fair slips are wonderful and made of excellent quality . They wear well and are very comfortable ... highly recommend them . Very feminine and sexy !!!!!!!
 THESE SLIPS ARE GREAT AND FUN TO WEAR !!!! AS A MALE WEARING SLIPS FOR MANY YEARS i FIND THAT THE VANITYFAIRS ARE THE BEST.THANX TO VANITY FAIR FOR STILL MAKING SLIPS WHEN MOST EVERYONE ELSE HAS DIED OUT !!!
 I wear skirts and dresses often and I have always liked to wear full slips with them . These days full slips are hard to find . Vanity Fair slips have always been my favorite brand . They are comfortable and look good . They hold up quite well , too . Thank you for having them available !
 I always love to wear a full-length slip , because it hikes up when your skirt or dress hikes up when you lift your arms . However , the little plastic strap length adjustor things are not really grabbing the thin silk of the strap very well , and the strap lengthens just a little over the course of the day .
 Very pleased with merchandise.Material is high quality and generous fitting.Would be glad to recommend this item
 I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early . The package was in excellent shape . I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip . The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected . I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black . I wish there were more color options than just black and white . I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them .
 As in the past , Vanity Fair slips fit like a dream , just make sure that you check the Vanity Fair sizing chart -LRB- size on lable is not bust size -RRB- . It feels good under a dress that requires a slip . I could n't be happier with the quality of the product .
 When it comes to Valentine 's Day , I 'm not looking to get my wife one of those teddies or chemises . I just want to get her a regular , white slip , with lace at the top and bottom . Vanity Fair delivers with this product , a very sexy item .
 I 'd recommend this if you need a basic slip . The shoulder straps are adjustable and the lace lining around the neck may be layered nicely with a low cut top . The only drawback is a personal one . At 5 ' 5 , 145 lbs , size 10 and pear-shaped , this slip * just * fits my frame , and there is a tiny bit of an awkward pull at the hip area . Next time I 'll order a 36 for more give .
 This is a very nice slip . It fits well and is the right length -LRB- a little above the knee -RRB- for most of my dresses . The shoulder straps do fall down at times during the day as the plastic adjusters slip down , but can easily be re-adjusted . I have that problem with most slips so am used to it . I had an old slip just like this one and it was falling apart with age so this was a replacement . I was happy to find it on Amazon and received it quickly and for a reasonable price .
 This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious , it is just okay . I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer . One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise . At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for , especially in this case .
 This is a good old-fashioned full slip . It 's hard to find these nowadays . This was slightly too long for the dress I had bought it for , but I took it to a dry cleaners and had it hemmed a couple inches and it 's perfect . The detailing/seaming at the bust is a little bit more than I 'd hoped for -LRB- shows slightly through my dress fabric -RRB- , but is only really visible if you 're looking for it . Overall , a good purchase .
 the slip was to small my fault i ordered the wrong size would order again and hopefully i get it right this time
 I had some compression shirts from about 5 years ago . These new ones are not the same fabric quality as they used to be , fabric is lighter and less stretchy . Despite they fit perfectly and work fine , I 'm worried about the durabilty of the shirt .
 These jeans are great . they may not be super tight when you first put them on , but wash them a few times and they will get tighter . They 're super comfortable , and really good for skating . Plus , they have a boot cut fit , so if you have hi top skate shoes like me , they look great with them .
 Ok , this product looks like a piece of junk . I received it as a gift and doubt I ever would have purchased it for myself with all the fancier training aids out there . To my surprise , Swing Groover fulfills it 's intended purpose just fine . I hammered mine into the grass at the edge of my lawn where I do n't care if it browns a bit . There it sits , day and night , ready for a few swings whenever I feel like it.Sometimes I 'll take a swing or two before going to work , sometimes arriving home from work , for 10 minutes here and there on the weekends . It 's a simple device . You swing , the ball spins on its cord . When you hit straight , it spins clean without hitting the vertical or horizontal metal posts . If you hit it skewed , it whacks or winds around one or the other . Generally it returns to starting position by itself . On occasion you need to unwind it from the horizontal post , which generally can be done with a nudge push from your clubhead , since the cord is n't really long enough to frequently double-wrap the post.The ball is lighter than a real golf ball , but heavy enough to feel substantial when you strike it.In all , nothing fancy here , but a convenient enough tool to park on your lawn from Spring to Fall .
 cool mask , got it for my son who collects horror masks . would tell anyone into Jason to buy one of these . fast service
 This pair of long underwear is one of the warmest that I have own . They are great for any outdoor use . The elastic waistband is adjustable so you can tuck in any top base-layer clothing comfortably . The sizing was correct , however , the ankles are a big snug and there is a lot of extra room in the crotch area . I am 5 ' 2 and 135 lbs and I ordered a Medium if that helps anyone out ! I was expecting them to be a bit stretchier -LRB- if that is even a word . . ! -RRB-
 We received the pants quickly , and they were of high quality . There were no problems with the purchase .
 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA

 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 I have found that these run about two sizes small , so be careful . Love the shirts , great to work out in . Shippiing was quick , very pleased with purchase .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .
 Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA
 Good quality and very durable . Fits well . Easiest way to shop as long as they fit you what you want in your size without going to the mall . Priceless
 Unless you 're into bigger name labels , there 's no need to look for a better carpenter short .
 I could not find my size anywhere !! I would also mention that you might want to order 2 sizes larger as my usual size was a VERY snug fit ... I am using for outside work and fishing so the color was not a big deal but they were what I would call an unwashed indigo .
 I have bought about 6 pairs of this short . They are very confortable and wear very well . I 'm pretty hard on them because I wear them for work . The hold up very well , good purchase .
 These jeans are comfortable to wear yet they are sturdy thick denim . I wear size 38 inch waist jeans and these `` Relaxed Fit '' fit well ; but I would think the regular size 38 inch would be too small for me . These jeans feel good to wear . The fabric is broken in evenly ; though still have new denim qualities . They are not loose or baggy on me ; but fit well . They cover my knee caps in length . They feel well made . They have nice uniform stone wash hues .
 The overall quality is good , but the fit is tight . If you want a relaxed fit , these may not be to your liking .

 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 great lightweight loved the color when i got it ! The color on screen didnt do the shirt justice ! I am going to order a few more for my husband .
 The product was exactly as I had expected , and came quickly . I had to buy two for an expo , not knowing of they would of satisfactory quality , but fortunately , they were professional looking enough and did the trick.Overall , I am very satisfied with the purchase .
 You definitely feel that it is not 100 % cotton but for the price it is still a great shirt . They are lite enough that I just wear a cotton tank underneath so do n't feel the poly so much . They do shrink a bit , but not too much , I typically get shirts in XL so when the shrink they fit right . These almost did n't shrink enough . Probably after a few washes they will . I wear a 42-44 jacket as a reference .
 I like those shirts , comfortable good size , all the info correct so recommend for any body , I going o buy some more
 I took a chance on ordering these shirts -LRB- I do n't usually order clothing from the ` net -RRB- , and am very glad I did . They fit well , are light weight , and the collars hold up under washing . Great shirt , at a fantastic price !
 The size is accurate , the fit is just right , and the spot shield is an added plus . Overall , very happy with the purchase .
 what can I say other than it was exactly what I expected and fit well . I like the idea of &#34; SpotShield &#34; since I apparently get stuff on my front quite often .
 love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable , material is soft great price would definely recommend product
 I like the feel of the material and that it is by Jerzees.I recommend it to family and friends .
 Looks and fits great ! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform . He loves them ...
 I 'm glad i got these shirts , i need them for work and they are working very well theyre long enough so that when you bend over or crouch down you do n't have to keep pulling them down , the material feels nice , and they dont shrink very much in the wash so they still fit fine after 5 washes . They are n't very thick or very thin so theres no problem there.I 'd recommend them to anyone who needs a good shirt at a fair price .
 They have a little bit bigger size . I ordered a medium shirt for my kid and its a little bit big . I have n't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him .
 This is a great shirt ! My husband has a very long back and this shirt was long enough even for him . Fits very well and fabric is nice too .
 I know that Amazon.com does not sell everything you need in life but they come darn close!I bought 2 polo style shirts for me & my Husband . I Coordinate a C.E.R.T. -LRB- Community Emergency Response Team -RRB- being a leader , I need to look as nice as I can when I am meeting new members , local elected officials , and other related `` CERT '' business . The shirts are a great quality , very reasonably priced and I am never disapointed in Amazon . From Gifts to Gadgets , Amazon is the place I go ! Thanks for all you do !
 The price was great ... delivery was on time and quality was terrific . I would definitely buy from this seller again . No disappointment .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 I have found that these run about two sizes small , so be careful . Love the shirts , great to work out in . Shippiing was quick , very pleased with purchase .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .

I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 I love Sherpani products , and this backpack is no exception . It 's comfortable to carry when fully loaded , and it looks great -- feminine without being too girly . It 's made of high quality materials that withstand the heavy abuse I subject it to .
 This is very nice for the money that we paid , I love how it looks on my wife and we both enjoy it . I will order from this company again . Great to have sexy clothing for the average size woman instead of outfits that only fit stick thin women .
 Its an ok product , just do n't get too rough with it or it will tear . If you are thinking of having intercourse with it on , do n't stretch or rub it too hard or it will tear . We have n't used it much , but the material is delicate . We used it twice and have n't used it in months . Sleek look , sexy , yet inexpensive .
 We purchased this for a weekend getaway , and did she love it and the fit was just right , she may want another one
 My lady friend looked so elegant in this item . it fit her like a glove . The bodystocking looked amazing on her !

 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !

 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .

 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited .

 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 I 've been looking for such camisoles for a long time and I 've finally found them ! After a double mastectomy without reconstruction , I needed something that provided a bit of comfort in the surgical area as well as some coverage when wearing lower cut tops . These camis are the very best . I 'm thrilled to have found them !
 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA

 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high .

 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 I disagree with the previous review . My son received this hat as a gift and loves it . I think it makes a great gift for any smaller child who 's interested in being a firefighter .
 We love this hat . It is excellent quality and very easy to adjust . It has a lovely soft lining and looks very authentic . When my 3 year old firefighter took it out of the wrapping , he said
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .
 Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal .
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .

 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA
 Very nice comfortable shirt.Bought the Blue and Grey to wear to the office , but now find they can double as a sport shirt too -LRB- no tie of course -RRB- . Excellent product
 Very pleased with the 3 I bought . Good looking with or without a neck tie.Nice cotton blend fabric.Great Price .
 I kept this shirt for three years . It was extremely soft and comfortable and I used it as a night shirt . I did not use it for work or events at all .
 Fits great . Very classic look . Has been in use for years . Washes well ... must iron though .
 I am using this shirt for over a year now and its still running good . For the price , this shirt is too good . The quality is comparable to some of the branded ones present in the market .
 I bought this shirt along with the other bill blass -LRB- solid color -RRB- one during the promotion $ 5 off 2 shirts -LRB- paid $ 10 for 2 -RRB- , I have amazon prime so couldnt resist the offer and bought 2 for hubby while he was skeptical about these reading the reviews . Now ever since he got them he wants to wear this one -LRB- blue color -RRB- as often as he can and the other one is quite nice too . I have to say that despite what others say , the quality is decent and the color/patteren is masculine and attractive . I regret that I bought just 2 now that the $ 5 coupon has expired ! ...
 $ 6 each , i did not expect much from it . actually , it is not bad .
 The t-shirt was what I was looking for and a good quality fir the price . I would order this item again .
 The T-shirt is great . We took a photo of our daughter wearing it and sent it to the family announcing my pregnancy . The quality is nice and the colors are great .
 Great product . My 4 1/2 year old little boy loved it & ca n't wait to wear it to announce that his little sister is coming . It 's very soft cotton & the screen print it very colorful & bright . Very pleased with this product . Size appears to be very similar to other size 5T products and fit my 4 1/2 year old little boy perfectly .
 The t-shirt was perfect for when my nephew went to the hospital to see his little sister for the first time ! It was soft , comfy , and adorable ! The shirt was shipped and recieved very fast !!
 The item was as described but although it says YOUTH 14-16 my nine year old could fit in it . SO they come small . . order bigger than you usally do !
 I picked this because I like the colors to match the baby sister outfit I had bought . My son is a small 8 yr old and fits in small-medium size 7-8 shirts . I picked the medium because I read other reviews saying it runs small . Well the medium says 10-12 on the tag . I really wish they would of put that in for sizes instead of me guessing . I 'm going to let him grow into it . That 's the only reason I give it a 4 . The quality of the shirt is good although he has n't worn it yet .
 Nice Shirt ! I ordered this a few sizes big for my 2 year old daughter , I think she will be able to wear it for a long time ! Very quick service from seller .
 Thanks love it ! Will def . use again when the time comes to order hard to find apparel !!! Thanks
 I loved these shirts i bought for my boys !! they looked very cute in them at the hospital ! thank you so much !
 A great gift for that new big brother ! My grandson loves it and showing everyone that he 's a new big brother !
 I ordered this for my niece 's son . My niece is having a baby in 5 days so I needed the shirt to arrive quickly . The seller did just that and my niece is thrilled with the shirt . After reading some of the comments I ordered a larger size than he usually wears . She said it was perfect !!
 Everything about this shirt was perfect -- size was perfect , it looked just like the picture on the site , I 've washed it a few times and it does n't show any signs of fading ... Would recommend this shirt for anyone expecting to become a big brother . : -RRB-
 This shirt is awesome and got here just in time for my son 's birth ! :-RRB- The shirt is good quality , and though it runs a little small , fits quite well : -RRB-
 ... my favorite design at the moment . very good fabric quality ! keeping me warm on the road!JohPWilbrand
 Very nice comfortable shirt.Bought the Blue and Grey to wear to the office , but now find they can double as a sport shirt too -LRB- no tie of course -RRB- . Excellent product
 Very pleased with the 3 I bought . Good looking with or without a neck tie.Nice cotton blend fabric.Great Price .
 I kept this shirt for three years . It was extremely soft and comfortable and I used it as a night shirt . I did not use it for work or events at all .
 Fits great . Very classic look . Has been in use for years . Washes well ... must iron though .
 I am using this shirt for over a year now and its still running good . For the price , this shirt is too good . The quality is comparable to some of the branded ones present in the market .
 I bought this shirt along with the other bill blass -LRB- solid color -RRB- one during the promotion $ 5 off 2 shirts -LRB- paid $ 10 for 2 -RRB- , I have amazon prime so couldnt resist the offer and bought 2 for hubby while he was skeptical about these reading the reviews . Now ever since he got them he wants to wear this one -LRB- blue color -RRB- as often as he can and the other one is quite nice too . I have to say that despite what others say , the quality is decent and the color/patteren is masculine and attractive . I regret that I bought just 2 now that the $ 5 coupon has expired ! ...
 $ 6 each , i did not expect much from it . actually , it is not bad .
 At a discounted price of less than $ 40 this is a real find . It is sturdy with plenty of zippered pockets and interior organizer pockets . There is a padded slot for a laptop in the main section as well . I picked it over other packs because it has a very sturdy carry handle at the top in addition to well padded shoulder straps . As a carry-on , a sturdy carry handle is a must . Most backpacks have a thin loop for this function that is painful if the pack is at all heavy.The only downside to this pack is that the major large section has a lining that is loose enough to interfere with its zipper - I have gotten the zipper stuck a few times and have to be careful in closing this section of the bag . Other than that , I am glad I went this route rather than a regular backpack . It is comparable to the Brookstone bag -LRB- also with a good carry strap -RRB- which was over $ 100 .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited .

 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .
 Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal .
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .

 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .
 Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal .
 I had tried this bra before in my normal size of 42DD and found that it did not fit well and the narrow shoulder straps dug into my shoulders . So I was very surprised that by going to the next larger cup size both the fit and shoulder strap issue were corrected . This is now one of my favorite bras and is the most supportive soft cup bra I have ever worn .
 I measured myself correctly according to Lady Grace 's site . I 'm sure it 's just one of those things where everyone 's body is different , but I had to have a seamstress friend reduce the cup size for me . The straps wo n't stay up to save my life , so that 's the big problem . Otherwise , the sides hold up well with the stays and are very wide . It 's only mildly uncomfortable in terms of the fabric not being soft enough . They discontinued this bra . Grab one if you can find one online somewhere !
 For the price , you ca n't beat it . The material is pretty thin , but the perfect spring or summer shirt . Its been great to have an extra few of these in my closet !!
 It is a good product to travel with or for an emergency , small enough to put in any bag . But it 's not for heavy rains or more than 1 person .
 ... my favorite design at the moment . very good fabric quality ! keeping me warm on the road!JohPWilbrand

 Unlike cotton handkercheifs , these wo n't shrink and wrinkle in the wash . It 's nice to know that I can still find permanent press handkercheifs on Amazon . Fast shipping too !
 THE HANDKERCHIEFS ARE OF EXCELLENT QUALITY . I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO BUY MORE OF THEM
 these are very nice handkerchiefs . they wash well and do not need ironing . They are soft enough not to irritate the nose . I can recommend them highly .
 Handkerchiefs are perfect . Service and shipping the best . I highly recommend this vendor working through Amazon .
 The handkerchiefs are very nice looking & a good size . I did n't realize they were n't 100 % cotton , but they seem to be absorbing adequately ,
 These were fine considering there inexpensive and not ment to be the very best quality.I have washed them already a couple of times and the stitching has not come out . The edges are not fraying and they seem just fine so far . They are not the heavest of materal but they are fine for my needs . I work outside all day and my nose is constently running . One , sometimes two hankerchiefs in my pocket gets me through the day . I would get these again if I needed more .
 I have never had handkerchiefs before so I was n't sure what I was getting myself into . But I wanted to stop wasting so much paper with facial tissues ; so I figured I would give it a shot.When I received these , the seller got them to me faster than expected and I appreciate that , I was a little disappointed . The seemed so thin . I could see right through them , even when folded in half . But they do the job great . And being thin they easily go into a pocket without being bulky . I would recommend them to anyone that is looking for a handkerchief for environmental , or any other , reasons .
 I bought these for my husband because I was tired of paying for tissues -LRB- besides he often did n't use them , yuck -RRB- . He loves the handkercheifs and keeps them handy . They have also become softer in the wash which is nice . And as a pack of 13 we do n't run out !
 Not too many men carry a cloth handkerchief these days . But my Father has always -LRB- and will always -RRB- . So these were a great bargain and he was pleased with the quality -LRB- plus my 85 year old Mother wo n't have to iron them like linen ones of old -RRB- .
 These handkerchiefs are just what I need . They are well made and reasonably priced .
 I looked all over the net for hankies for my dad for christmas and these were the best deal i could find . Too bad i found them a week later in a store for less money . live and learn
 When you have a really nasty cold that just hangs on , and when it spreads to the whole family , you want enough clean handkerchiefs that everybody gets to use without sharing . These days I can ; t find them in local stores . These came promptly and did the job .
 These are not going to come out of the dryer looking like you wadded them up and stomped on them . Reasonably priced and a nice convenient size .
 RRSVT DOB1952 review on pkg of 13 handkerchieves.Packaging is standard to 50 years , ago.Material is same , with process upgrade predicting greater durability.AddEdit - many clumps of cloth fiber are on each one , no question of durability with several washes .
 I had heard of handkerchiefs before but I honestly thought they were some old wives ' tale . Take it from me , a certified CPR instructor , they are real and you can actually use them to blow your nose into . I have been using these wonderful handkerchiefs for a couple weeks and they are nothing short of miraculous . If you have n't seen one before , it 's basically just a square piece of fabric that is specially treated to absorb nose juice . Yesterday , I was finished emptying out my nose into a fresh hanky -LRB- this is a word I made up for handkerchief -RRB- and I shoved it in the outer pocket of my suit . A few hours later , my co-worker said I was a regular Don Draper . I asked her who Don Draper was and she told me he was `` just the finest piece of hunk who had ever graced the small screen '' . I still had no idea what she was talking about and I did n't want to be impolite so I just laughed and walked away from her . Apparently , the `` small screen '' was some phrase she had made up to describe Television . Anyway , I looked into it on the internet and I found out that Don Draper is an ad executive who works in New York . Long story short , he puts these `` hankies '' in his pocket and apparently everyone thinks he is great so I 'm going to do the same .

 I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts -LRB- 0382 -RRB- and the Loose Gear shirts -LRB- 0084 -RRB- - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch -LRB- a lot ! -RRB- . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .
 I buy a decent amount of stuff on amazon and I do n't really write reviews but was compelled to do so after my workouts today . I 've been working out for a year using loose and a couple of fitted underarmour t-shirts ... I decided I 'd give these a shot since I really liked the feel of the fitted shirts . I bought two , and wore one of them for the first time today . Felt great during my morning chest/tri workout , and the little amount that I did sweat was absent only ~ 10-15min afterwards and it did n't even smell.Did some stairmaster cardio after work -LRB- with the same morning shirt ! -RRB- and pretty much changed the color of the shirt by the end of the workout ... Felt nice and cool afterwards , too . I was shocked that by the time I came home and took off the shirt -LRB- 20-25min later -RRB- , it had dried and STILL did n't smell ! I do n't expect the lack of smell to continue once I 've washed it , but I did n't feel like a sweatball which is nice . I bought 2 of these and I would n't be surprised if I bought more in the future.Just to give an indication of my size , i 'm ~ 5 ' 8 '' and weigh ~ 170 and a medium fits me very well . Hope this helps !
 The versability of the underarmour products is incredible . It is comfortable and protecting at the same time . When its cold it keeps me warm and when it is hot it keeps me cool . It is firm fitting and shapes to your body . I would n't wear anything else while i play sports .
 Not only does this shirt keep you cool during a workout , or while running , but it also seems to hold your body . That is to say , while the shirt forms to your body , it does n't feel tight , or restrictive . This is my first piece of Under Armour , but not my last .
 This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market ... I used Nike pro Ultimate before and I have to say that this one is far better in terms of compressing your body ... it fits perfectly however the length of the t-shirt is pretty short for me ... I wear size s ... I think the new design it 's better than the one in terms of fitting ... I think Under Armour really listen to customers and continue to provide great products to customers ... Personally I think short sleeve t-shirt is more convenience than the long sleeve t-shirt since most of the time you gon na wear it underneath your t-shirt ...
 I purchased this for my boyfriend who is a marathon runner and weight lifter . He wears it on his shorter , usually 10 mile runs , and also in the gym . I like the way he looks it in , he likes the feel . I purchased the dark green and it seems to fit true to size . Will probably purchase another for Christmas .
 After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing . Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com . I 'm 6 ' 6 and 220lbs , broad shouldered , lean and decently well muscled -LRB- working to gain -RRB- . Usually I wear an XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with -LRB- alot -RRB- of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back . The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight . The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both . I have not done any training in the shirt so can not at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking , energy level/recovery from compression or chafing . I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training . I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T 's . Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success .
 I have about 5-6 Under Armour shirts and these have been my favorites . While I love this shirt , I think they have terrible sizing description.I am 5 ' 8 '' 155 lbs , decently athletic . I usually wear small > medium size shirts.I order an Large for this shirt.It can be really tight in the armpits and I 've nearly gotten stuck in small and medium size shirts -LRB- literally stuck -RRB- . So , order a size or two larger than you think you should wear . I have put on an XL and it still felt pretty good , but Large does fit me * slightly * better , so -- order up one size , at least .
 I have been wearing compression shirts for years . Under Armour is by far the best quality . It is called compression wear for a reason . It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body . I am 5 ' 8 '' , 155 lbs . and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to . If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear . Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature . They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture . However , I think one of the best features is that since they do n't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides . Compression wear was not created to look sexy . It is serious workout gear . If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help . Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts are n't girdles . They make these things in loose fit also . Not quite the same benefits , but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt . If you can wear the compression shirts get them , but expect them to be skin tight . You wo n't regret it .
 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 I love the Arrington Jersey so glad that it is available on my favorite website !!!!!!!
 Purchased for my hubby - looks just like our Abi -- He loves it so much he has already worn it out !!! How can you not love , love , love that factArlene Shipley
 The t-shirt is very comfortable and keeps you extremely cool . Normally I wear size L , but the size L was very tight so I ordered XL and It fits well
 I am 5 ' 6 , 200lbs and a large fit me like my secondskin . So it was a perfect fit.Love the quality , that 's why my wardrobe is full oftheir product I have no negative comments other than price but thenthere is a saying that goes '' good thing not cheap ''
 It was a perfect form fit for my 11 year old . We bought the small and it fits exactly how he likes it .
 This shirt is really great . It keeps you cool during intense workouts , absorbs sweat.It fits really well , nice and tight . I could n't be more pleased.A must buy for anyone in fitness .
 I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here . Good thing I did they fit great . The only thing I do n't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt .
 there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .
 like the other reviews state order size bigger ... trust me I usually wear XL ... I 'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice . I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet . SO do order size up .
 I love these shirts , they keep me cool in the summer . I have a veriety of colors and they just feel good .
 I really like how it keeps my body warm so that I can keep the workout tempo high . I did buy a large from the sizing chart , but due to the chaffing in the armpits , I will buy extra large next time . If you need an extra psych for working out harder , it does show off your body exactly as it is . So whether that is good or bad , it should definitively help you work harder to keep or to get the body you want .
 First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .
 This shirt is great by itself , under an cotton shirt , under sholder pads , and even under a coldgear shirt . The coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while It gets to me and I have to put on my turf gear underneath it . This a must have for your under armour wardrobe .
 Looks great , but runs a bit small . Odor free is great.Would like if they add a sale or something if u buy more than 3 or so .
 Great Product - it is exactly what would you expect , Great Store - fast and prompt delivery
 Good quality but the small boy 's size is way too large for my 6 year old son .
 Solo es recomendable para personas que tiene un abdomen normal .

 This is the best gear I have ever bought . It keeps you warm in the cold . Keeps you dry in those intense workouts and cools you down . It is definitely worth the price . I will definitely be buying more underarmour gear .
 This item is very tight-fitting . I use small so I ordered it small despite some reviews that stated they run a size small . Well this is a compression t-shirt so it is very tight . I am 5 ' 6 '' and weigh about 135 lbs or 63 kgs . I have an athletic body tyoe . This does feel real tight . I had difficulty getting it through my head but once through it felt really well . It does stick to you like a second skin so every single detail of your body will be contoured . I use this for cycling and it works perfectly , keeping sweat away . I think the tight fit looks awesome , but if you are too much of a body image self conscious person that wants to hide it then this is not for you .
 I fell in love with Under Armour 's products four years ago , and that has n't changed.They were still a niche brand then , on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ... Gear products are the reason why . They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first , not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams . I tried some of the competitors first , but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one . I 'm glad I did . The HeatGear material is perfect . It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me , that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version . I like the sleeveless version for working out , because it helps your range of motion with your arms . The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt , but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt . UA has started to offer a sleeved `` Tactical '' version of the shirt , which I might buy one or two , but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise ; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton . The hold you in place . You are not as hot as some may be while working hard . You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money , and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can .
 is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need
 This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard . . Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt
 Ordered four shirts since I used them for work . Same shirts from the retail store ; however mine were n't in OEM packaging . Do n't really care , but it 's actually less packaging to throw away : -RRB-
 I bought this shirt to use for summer mountain biking and working out . I conforms to the body very well and keeps one cool while in the sun or working out in the gym . It is very tight , so for those wanting a looser under armour you are probably better off with another product . As far as sizing , I generally wear a medium or large t-shirt as I am 5 '10 and 180 pounds . I bought the large and it works great .
 Product is as good as you can buy from the outlets . Great gear !!! Under armour is the best !!! I 'd recommend it to anyone .
 When I purchased the Under Armour heat gear shirt it was mainly for recreational use such as sports , working out , and an odd urge to `` protect this house . '' Everything that 's promised from this shirt came through . It 's a comfortable light weight compression shirt and wicks sweat away to prevent chaffing/rashes . The heat gear part of the shirt is to designate that it 's for warm temperatures and to keep the athlete cool , it 's a really neat piece of technology that works well . If you 're in the market for a compression shirt , this one is worth the money , I definitely recommend it .
 I like the shirt , nice compression , good sizing . The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors , so i was n't sure what i was going to get . Its was a SHORT SLEEVE .
 It fits snug so take that in to consideration when ordering . It is comfortable and warm . Definitely worth the try .
 Great shirts . I bought this for work and they work great they keep me dry and fresh when its not
 Its under armour ... the very best workout shirt you can buy in my opinion because of the sweat absorbing and the fact that it is always cool and just feels right . Plus you know when you have made it too the point where you are buying the armor you are where you want to be in working out !
 Bought this T-Shirt as part of a gift for our son . He loved it . Great price and product was quickly received .
 Men 's HeatGear Compression Shortsleeve T-Shirt Tops by Under is a great product and it added to my exercise program . It fit as advertised and I will buy again from this seller .
 As an Under Armour product I expected this to be of a quality that earns its price -LRB- man , these things can be expensive ! -RRB- This shirt is very well made , the fabric is wonderful . Nothing I would change ... except if Under Armour could lower their prices a little bit !
 It was exactly what I was looking for . Looks great . Price nice and quality . I glad for my purchase . Recommend .
 I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad . It was exactly what he was looking for . It is lightweight , rich-colored , good quality stitching , breathable fabric ; perfect gear for a runner . This is a great gift or purchase for yourself ; a definite must buy .
 I love these shirts ! Makes wearing my uniform much more comfortable . Looking forward to buying more of them in the future .
 Great product , but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better . These type of shirts , however , provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples .
 The shirt was for my husband . It was very thin and can be used under some other stuff but he would n't wear it by itself .
 Exactly as described . Nice shirt . If you have never worn a compression shirt , I had not , you must try one . I had chill bumps two minutes after putting it on . Really cool . No pun intended .
 This underarmour is great and was the perfect color for my fiance who plays on a tag football team and needed a baby blue shirt ! Their first game is tomorrow , ca n't wait to see him play in it . Fits a perfectly . We bought a large .
 Not only did I get this item the next day for no apparent reason or extra charge but it 's amazing . Fits great -LRB- If you have n't ever bought something like this before , buy a size larger than your t-shirt size -RRB- . Truly does suck the heat away from you and keeps you cool . I 'd recommend to anyone and everyone
 Great shirt , as others have mentioned . I will also say that you should order up one size . I did , and it 's a perfect fit . For those of you that 're tall , this shirt should work for you , I 'm 6 ' 4 '' and it fits me great .
 I got the XL size and found it was a little tighter than I thought it would be . I would get an XXL next time around , but otherwise it 's a great product .
 My roommate asked me to buy this for him on a recent trip to the US . I , myself , am not a great runner or trainer -LRB- I get jaw aches when I do sports that do not involve a ball or disk of some sorts -RRB- so I was satisfied with a 6 $ shirt I found at Old Navy . My roommate , instead of just sending me a simple Facebook message containing the words `` buy this for me '' and adding the link , decided he wanted to share his life perspective in a two-page article containing this shirt , from which -LRB- after summing up what he had written -RRB- I gathered that this is a better brand than Nike . He did not add any comparison to Reebok or Puma , so I can not add more on that subject.After returning to my native land of Israel about three days ago , I gave him the T-shirt and he was excited . Footnote
 This product is just what I expected , minus the fact that due to being white , you can easily see my nipples through the shirt . I have several other compression fit underarmour heat gear shirts , but they are all more opaque due to being red and blue . The transparency of these white shirts , combined with the dark coloration of my areolae has caused me to have to alter my running form while wearing this shirt , so that I can keep my nipples covered with my hands as I run . Minus one star for shame .
 typical under amour product that works great to absorb sweat and all for easy movement while still keeping ones body cool while they work out or engage in any kind of physical activity
 I personally have had one of these shirts for about a year but I bought two more for my team mates after we made an airsoft team , and they look great . The shirts fit true to size but remember that they are suppose to fit tighter , so if you do n't like that then get the non-compression shirts under amour has . As far as performance goes , they are really great for active people who play any type of summer game or sport cause when you sweat the shirt will keep you cool . The durability and quality is there as to expect from under amour but mine does have some scuffs from abrasive surfaces so be aware for that but that is what to be expected from this type of material n the shirt . It is really light so its like wearing nothing at all and being so tight , it is like a second skin which is good of you are in any type of law enforcement or military service , or if you play mil-sim games like me . And every time I wash the shirt there is no oder like what you get with some cotton performance shirts . I 'd say that this is a great buy for anyone looking to look great and have functional clothes . And for the winter months I would recommend cold-gear compression long sleeve.Under Armour Cold Gear Longsleeve Mock
 After reading some reviews regarding sizing I went with one size larger and it worked out great . You ca n't go wrong with under armour .
 Great shirt , usually can get away with an XL , read some of the reviews here and ordered an XXL . Glad I did . THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more . Fits fine , feels fantastic , very comfortable . Suppose it does n't look too bad , either .
 With any luck I wo n't need these to hold the belly before long . I just have to keep up my will power and keep excerizing .
 Seems a little small . Otherwise great shirt . Shipped on time . Great color . Great price.why do they require so many words ?
 These shirts were purchased so that perspiration during strenuous workouts would be &#34; wicked &#34; away and these shirts do that to a tee .
 After my husband used these for playing football , we ended up buying a bunch for work under shirts , soccer game/practice under shirts , and working out . They absorb and keep body temp regulated .
 The Under Armour HeatGear T Top shirt fit as expected . I purchased a size Large as I normally wear a Large sized shirt , and this shirt fit nice and snug , not too tight . It was exactly as I had hoped it would be . As most other Under Armour products , it 's very breathable and stretchy . I 've had workout shirts that fit tight around the shoulders , but this shirt feels very comfortable in that area and all over , while still remaining snug against the skin . It 's not outrageously priced , but it 's not cheap either - obviously you 're paying a little premium for the Under Armour name.My only wish is that I had a little more muscle so I 'd look a little better in it!If you 're looking for a full set of top and bottom , check out the Under Armour HeatGear Legging Bottoms . I bought the bottoms with this top and they match perfectly .
 I bought this for my 25 year old son . He said it worked great and made him much cooler as he worked out .
 Excellent shirt my 4th one -LRB- I have different colors -RRB- , these compression shirts give you a feel of more energy and strength . No one else at the time of purchased had this in red but through Amazon I was able to find a retailer who had it .
 This product lived up to the high standard of Under Armour clothing . I would recommend this product to friends .
 I was always a skeptic but I bought one of these shirts and it really does work ! I will probably get another .
 My mom got me this shirt and i love it great for working in the warehousei had gotten a long sleeve one also but it was too bigso sent it back and got another short sleeve onethey are greatjon
 I 've bought these before , so I knew exactly what I was getting -LRB- and I like 'em -RRB- . Good price . Speedy service . No surprises .
 The quality is good , but be aware that Under Armour shirts tend to run very small and tight . Since I always wear medium , I ordered a medium but it was way too tight and I needed a large .
 I love these pants . Soooo comfortable , you can wear them all day . No buttons or zippers and a snug but not tight waistband . They fit wonderfully and seem to conform to your shape . What I really love about them is they never lose their shape either . too often my pants get baggy in the back and I wind up with droopy drawers . The feel is silky smooth . Great for working out , yoga or pilates , wearing around the house , and because the banding down the sides is the same color as the pants they do n't look as sporty as they are . So you can even wear them for casual dinners or shopping trips . I love em so much sometimes I even sleep in them - I practically live in them.They wash up great in cold water and dry very nicely on low . The color -LRB- I have black -RRB- , after several washings has not faded one bit . The only thing I would say that may not meet your expectations is that if you live in a cold area , you will probably need something warm underneath for running or going out . They are pretty thin . Also there are no pockets.I am short -LRB- 5 ' 2 '' -RRB- and the length -LRB- 31.5 inseam -RRB- is slightly long for me , but even with my sneakers that have about a 2 inch sole they fall just right . The bottom of the legs have a little bit of a flare.A good buy for the money - long lasting and versatile . I 'll be ordering another pair.I also liked : Jockey Elance String Bikini - 3 PackHappy Shopping and Happy HolidaysLaurie
 Very pleased that I can now sweat buckets and not have it show through . These pants are flattering but the leg was a bit long for me so I just cut off an inch or two .
 I had been looking for a workout pant and these were on sale . they fit well and are lightweight so I 'm happily satisfied with the purchase .
 These pants are pretty good . They are good at wicking away sweat so I do n't feel wet when running . The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 , is just my preference on fit . I have Nike Be Strong pants , and like the shape of them better . These are shaped different , and not quite as flattering . But they are comfortable , and do the job they are supposed to do .
 these pants are comfy , though I do get camel lips in them . My main complaint is that their skin tight , even at the right size and have no pockets . They 're more of a yoga pant than a track pant .
 Great for working out . Have a funny plastic smell that still has n't come out after 4 washings though ...
 I was slightly concerned over buying new workout pants without trying them on , but I absolutely love them . I am actually planning on picking up another pair I like them that much .
 Love these pants , they are just perfect !!! Very Comfortable , tight and loose enough , perfect length , adjusts perfectly . They look great ! Very good fabric !
 ... my favorite design at the moment . very good fabric quality ! keeping me warm on the road!JohPWilbrand
 The cover-up skirt was just as pictured . Matched bathing suit perfectly and had a nice fit - not too short . Well manufactured .
 I love this backpack , I stuff a lot of things in it and it carries very well which is not the case with many backpacks that I have had . As a petite female -LRB- 5 ' 2 '' , 105 lb -RRB- almost any backpack feels bulky and huge as if it would tip me over , specially that I always carry at least a laptop , a binder and a book not counting my bulky purse , even bulkier pencil case calculator ... the list can go on but I literally have EVERYTHING in it ... simply it is perfect ... what can i say it is a jansport :-RRB- oh and the design is just adorable !!
 Wear it everyday . Makes me feel sexy . I love the feel and show it off under my white TEE Shirt when shopping
 My daughter is on a weight loss journey of enormous magnitude , and this has been the bra with her as the bust line gets smaller and smaller . The support lasts for months before needing a new one , and it looks great . Sometimes it is difficult for a large busted woman to get the right level of support needed to keep those gals pointing in the right direction . This has been a dream come true keeping the gals up high . The straps are comfortable and do not dig into the shoulder leaving those icky grooved , and there is plenty of support along the back . I have never been happier with what this one offers my daughter . Thank you so much for providing a wonderful bra !
 If you have worn Goddess bras your whole life , like me , and could n't find a replacement until now -- this is it . I even heard that the cutter from Goddess changed to this company.I have a very small band size -LRB- 32/34 -RRB- and huge breasts -- I could never find a bra that fit much less supported me while active . Some woman at a bra shop actually asked me , `` What do you like about the no-stretch straps ? '' Ummmm -- they do n't stretch ! This bra is for those of us who need to run around , jump , climb and not flop all over the place -- this is REAL support . Yes the style is pointy , yes the straps are wide and you 're not going to wear this with some skimpy top -LRB- not that those of us this size could ever find a skimpy top to fit us ! -RRB- This is a supportive bra with a size range to fit those of us who need it.THANK YOU ELILA JACQUARD!PS -- If you are going by your old Goddess size , you will need to go up in the band size and the cup size -- their sizing is different . I ordered one , sent it back and then got the correct size . Good luck to all busty ladies you out there !
 I 've had this bra for a year now and am looking to order a replacement . I was very pleased with how well it fit my chest and the support it offered ... especially after ordering online without having tried it on in a store . I agree with the poster that commented about the strap cushions not staying put and sliding around . At times the loose end of the strap will work its way out of the cup also and is annoying . My main complaint about this bra , however , is the metal clasp on the strap . It tends to dig into my right shoulder -LRB- which is my heavier side -RRB- and then the strap slips and falls off my shoulder at times . Maybe it digs in bc I have it adjusted too tightly for the weight it is supporting ?? Overall though , it really is a good bra . Also 37 years old , it seems very old-ladyish , but gives me the support I have n't found in other bras my size -LRB- 46H -RRB-
 This bra is very comfortable for a support bra . The straps are the type where you adjust them and they hang down into the bra . You ca n't tell this from the image , and considering I do n't like this type it was a huge turn off at first . Yet , unlike others these straps do n't slide out of the grasps after a while , so that is a plus . The cup size is exact , I did not have to send it back , and the no roll band actually does not roll ! The shoulder cushions slide all over the place though , and are annoying but when they are in place they feel great , no bra burn . Overall a really good support bra for us well endowed females .
 Great bra with excellent support . Material a little hard , but by far the best bra I have bought so far.Thanks
 beautiful shape , wonderfully comfortable . All in all , a perfect undergarment ! I love that they have a wider range of sizes , so you can find one that fits perfectly no matter your size . I will be buying more of these !
 This is the only bra I will buy or wear again . It is so well made and actually holds up my large chest . The straps do n't budge which is great . They have metal clasp in the front to adjust the length you prefer and then it snaps right into place and stays there . Thats not an easy task for some of us with large chests . I highly recommend this bra .
 Product was exactly as described , great service and received it super fast , w/in days of ordering ! Would definitely order again and reccommend it to anyone !
 The bra fits well , with the exception of the straps falling off my shoulders and hanging low if not lifted periodically while wearing .
 The quality was good , but not what I wanted and it did n't fit . I returned it with no problems .
 It 's one of the most comfortable ones I own . Most of the comfortable ones are Olga .
 A very attractive bra but only if you are on the small side of B ! I had to send it back = -LRB-
 They look and feel like a glove ! They are my favorite pair , and I will have to buy more !
 Pajamas were what I expected . They were very soft and silky . They fit well and the care was machine washable .
 Well fitting , nice fabric , classic styling , fast service , good product that I like to buy as a gift for that special man
 These jammies were silky and very high quality ... everything was great from delivery to delight on my sig other 's face . Have n't washed yet , so ca n't comment there , but we are very satisfied !
 These pajamas are very comfortable . I wash them in the machine with cold setting and have no problems with how they come out.Good buy !
 I gave these silk Pajamas to my dad for his birthday . He told me '' He never felt anything so wonderful in his life '' . They are without a question the best pajamas in the world !
 I got these for my husband for christmas he liked them very much ! The size is just perfect as he is not tall and they fit just right .
 My friend was very happy with them . They are very good quality , and they fit him for the most part . The only issue we had was the length of the arms . They were a little too long . Other than that , we were pleased . They got here in time for Christmas , and they were just what he wanted .
 This `` Classic Silk '' pajama set is constructed with the classic-style and quality of bygone era . The silk is dense , durable and ladened with luxury ! This item will satisfy the most discerning of tastes and definately worth every cent ... quality worth paying for .
 Of all men 's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best . The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well . After reading other customers ' reviews , I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L . It turned out too small . I would recommend going one size up .
 I normally can not sleep in pajamas . They twist , grab hold , and drive me crazy when I sleep . I usually wake up in the middle of the night and take them off.Normally , I get a flannel fabric . As a last resort , I tried ordering silk pajamas . The fabric is a lot nicer and I sleep very well . I love these PJs .
 Great PJ . Really glad i got it.It 's pretty well built . I was afraid it would be a bit fragile , but so far so good.As a reference , I 'm 6 ' 0 '' with roughly 200lb ... I got the Large , and it 's a bit tight for my taste ... I 'll be trading it for the XL
 I was concerned that these silk PJ 's would be really thin and on the cheap side . But to my surprise , they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them . I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them . Plus the fit was perfect . I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size ... and another person said the opposite . -LRB- That confused me when I went to buy . -RRB- So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect ! :-RRB- My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ 's ever.The size is perfect , color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings . Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past . I ca n't find anything I do n't like about these.I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out . lol Anyone thinking of buying these I ca n't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least.Jan
 These are great . Well made , did ok in the wash . They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x . They are still cool enough for summer , but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT !!!!!! By a pair for your wife , yourself They are heaven .
 What a great pair of pajamas these are . So soft , non-binding , roomy , and great for lounging . I 've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays . Very good quality silk , well sewn and tailored . I 'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine .
 This is one manufacturer that gives ample measurements.I normally get XXL , but I drown in this one . I reordered in XL.The quality of the product seemed fine .
 I recently purchased this item and I ca n't say how relaxing it feels wearing it . It 's made with a high quality silk and does not stick to the body . Best part of this pajama set is that if you take turns in your sleep it really does not hold to your body as it slips through giving you that ease of turning over on your back or belly . Loved it ... would like to order more ...
 The pajamas are an excellent quality of silk although I have to admit I have not washed them yet . They ironed easily and look great on my husband . I was impressed with the workmanship and detailed sewing . The 2X I ordered was ample considering at 6 ' 3 ' and 225 pounds they fit . He is not broad in the shoulders so that problem was solved by having the cuffs shortened . My husband is comfortable in them and that is what counts .
 The cut on these is a little odd -LRB- European styling or something -RRB- but they feel great and seem built to last . I do n't like where the pockets are and have just left them sewn shut for now.I ca n't say that I have any other complaints about them and only time will tell how they hold up . I do wish they were a little less pricey but good quality stitching and silk costs . Let 's just hope the massive overspending the US is doing does n't devalue our dollar any more .
 I had searched high and low in my local stores for high quality mens silk pajamas , but was not satisfied with what I found . The Intimo brand carried by Amazon fit all of my requirements to a `` T '' . They fit very well , are extremely comfortable , and launder well . I just purchased my third pair . All I can add is
 Size Small fit my husband perfectly . He 's 5 ' 9 &#34; and weighs about 130 lbs . These PJ 's are super soft and after washing they are a velvety feeling silk . We are immensely pleased with the quality of these PJ 's .
 did n't belive i would enjoy the cool comfort . usually i tend to sweat when wearing cotten but the silk was cooler
 I bought the silk pajama for my husband and he loves them the way the feel so soft and silky the color was just as I saw it on the web site .
 This is a good quality pajama set and was worth the price I paid with an Amazon discount . Be forewarned that the color is a really bright red though .
 This item is of fine quality and I am very pleased with the product . I was disappointed that after my purchase I discovered that the same item was available from the manufacturer 's email site at about 25 % less than I paid . It pays to shop around .
 The quality here is great . It 's very comfortable and worth the money . However , I tried to judge my sizing based on reviews and hoping the sizing chart was accurate . I was off . I got an XL , but should have only gotten a L. I 'm 5 ' 10 '' 230 lbs with a 38-40 waist . The XL I got was too long . The waist fit well , but I need to grow a couple inches to make it fit perfectly . Just keep this in mind when picking your size .
 I bought these silk pajamas for my husband for our anniversary , and he LOVED them . They 're exactly as described - cool when it 's warm out , and warm when it 's cool out . He wears them all the time and says they 're very comfortable .
 Very nice comfortable shirt.Bought the Blue and Grey to wear to the office , but now find they can double as a sport shirt too -LRB- no tie of course -RRB- . Excellent product
 Very pleased with the 3 I bought . Good looking with or without a neck tie.Nice cotton blend fabric.Great Price .
 I kept this shirt for three years . It was extremely soft and comfortable and I used it as a night shirt . I did not use it for work or events at all .
 Fits great . Very classic look . Has been in use for years . Washes well ... must iron though .
 I am using this shirt for over a year now and its still running good . For the price , this shirt is too good . The quality is comparable to some of the branded ones present in the market .
 I bought this shirt along with the other bill blass -LRB- solid color -RRB- one during the promotion $ 5 off 2 shirts -LRB- paid $ 10 for 2 -RRB- , I have amazon prime so couldnt resist the offer and bought 2 for hubby while he was skeptical about these reading the reviews . Now ever since he got them he wants to wear this one -LRB- blue color -RRB- as often as he can and the other one is quite nice too . I have to say that despite what others say , the quality is decent and the color/patteren is masculine and attractive . I regret that I bought just 2 now that the $ 5 coupon has expired ! ...
 $ 6 each , i did not expect much from it . actually , it is not bad .
 Backpack is very sturdy and durable . Wheels move great along concrete . You fit a lot of stuff in it . My son in elementary school loves it .
 This backpack is very good for the price -LRB- $ 19.99 -RRB- and pretty much what I expected -- it has one large compartment and a medium sized pocket with small compartments for pens , swiss army knives , etc. . The material of which it is made is a tad thin , and it does n't stand up when filled to capacity -LRB- as it claims it will because of the extra legs -RRB- , but I personally would not spend $ 30 more -LRB- or more -RRB- in order to amend these small problems .
 Wonderful purchase - my daughter was getting backaches from hauling around so many books at school , it was so late in the year I could n't find a wheeled backpack locally . The pack is very sturdy and roomy , and easy for a rather short/slight girl to control . It was so wonderful to be able to find just what I needed at a reasonable price . I used the free shipping and got the pack with in a week . I love Amazon !!
 I ordered this backpack for my daughter who is in middle school . It is a very sturdy backpack with nice , smooth-rolling wheels . It was a bargain .
 I had a great time as Princess Leia this Halloween . The costume lasted through the elementary school parade , an outdoor family and friends party , and a day after Halloween adults only party . I could wear it again . Polyester is not the most comfortable fabric in the world , and the wig gets itchy after a while , but everyone knew who I was and I do recommend this product . Note that the `` cinnamon buns '' on the wig have fine mesh over them . I started to remove it and decided against it to maintain the shape . There are also some bobby pins involved that I was n't sure about . I left them in to be safe .
 This costume was just right . I am one of the class mom 's for my boys class . I walked in the school parade with my little Luke Skywalker . It was a lot of fun . Very simple costume to wear . I 'm only 5 ' 1 '' and I did n't have to shorten the costume at all which might be of some interest for tall ladies ! WARNING , You need to wear something under this as it is quite see through ! A pair of white long johns and a white t-shirt of some sort would do the trick . Would n't want to scare the kiddies ! LOLBiggest Con
 I loved the costume and the wig . This was an internet purchase , so I was worried what it would look like in person , but surprisingly it was perfect ! The one piece dress was easy to slip on and flattering with the belt . The wig looks dorky in the picture advertised and was much better in person . The only complaint is the neck - the velcrow is itchy and too tight around the neck . Overall , we had a blast dressing up and everyone loved the Princess Leia costume .
 Even though it is a one size fits all ... It fit me pretty well ! The costume was well made and the price is reasonable . It was a great buy !
 Wore this costume last Halloween at the Disneyland Halloween Party . Had a lot of fun . A must have for the Princess Leia fan in your life .
 The item was just what I ordered . It came on time and was new and packaged well . I was quite happy with this product and ths company .
 I love the skirt it goes with all my bathing suits !!! Fast delivery too !

 These are really nice looking and very comfortable , but they washed out very quickly . After a few times in the laundry , they looked old and tattered .
 The selection of nice &#34; lingerie &#34; for men is pretty limited . The items we 've had from Intimo have held up well over time and the fit is just right . They look and feel good !
 Size Small fit my husband perfectly . He 's 5 ' 9 &#34; and weighs about 130 lbs . These PJ 's are super soft and after washing they are a velvety feeling silk . We are immensely pleased with the quality of these PJ 's .

As a last resort , I tried ordering silk pajamas . The fabric is a lot nicer and I sleep very well . I love these PJs .
 Great PJ . Really glad i got it.It 's pretty well built . I was afraid it would be a bit fragile , but so far so good.As a reference , I 'm 6 ' 0 '' with roughly 200lb ... I got the Large , and it 's a bit tight for my taste ... I 'll be trading it for the XL
 I was concerned that these silk PJ 's would be really thin and on the cheap side . But to my surprise , they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.My husband did NOT expect these and is quite pleased with them . I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them . Plus the fit was perfect . I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size ... and another person said the opposite . -LRB- That confused me when I went to buy . -RRB- So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect ! :-RRB- My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ 's ever.The size is perfect , color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings . Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past . I ca n't find anything I do n't like about these.I need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out . lol Anyone thinking of buying these I ca n't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least.Jan
 These are great . Well made , did ok in the wash . They also did not split at the seam after wearing them 2x . They are still cool enough for summer , but nice and warm in winter and SERIOUSLY SOFT !!!!!! By a pair for your wife , yourself They are heaven .
 What a great pair of pajamas these are . So soft , non-binding , roomy , and great for lounging . I 've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays . Very good quality silk , well sewn and tailored . I 'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine .
 This is one manufacturer that gives ample measurements.I normally get XXL , but I drown in this one . I reordered in XL.The quality of the product seemed fine .
 I bought the silk pajama for my husband and he loves them the way the feel so soft and silky the color was just as I saw it on the web site .
 Pajamas were what I expected . They were very soft and silky . They fit well and the care was machine washable .
 Well fitting , nice fabric , classic styling , fast service , good product that I like to buy as a gift for that special man
 These jammies were silky and very high quality ... everything was great from delivery to delight on my sig other 's face . Have n't washed yet , so ca n't comment there , but we are very satisfied !
 These pajamas are very comfortable . I wash them in the machine with cold setting and have no problems with how they come out.Good buy !
 I gave these silk Pajamas to my dad for his birthday . He told me '' He never felt anything so wonderful in his life '' . They are without a question the best pajamas in the world !
 This cap is pretty neat . I go through caps like fish go through water since I run daily , train horses daily , work on tractors more than I like , and mountain climb less than I like - always in a cap . In the summer , if I 'm not careful I 'll get farmer 's tan everywhere but around my forehead and around my eyes where my sunglasses sit . In the winter , given the glare of the snow , I sunburn.The price is decent . Ca n't go wrong for eight to twelve bucks . This thing is casual , which I LOVE . Also , it does n't have logos on it , and it does n't cause excess attention . There are no panels to make your head look strange , and the hat eventually conforms to the shape of your head . The bill is perfectly structured , no 70 's trucker look . It 's ready to go as soon as you pull it out of the box , no structuring required . The rivets are still in place and they are firmly stapled in . The buckle/hardware is n't going anywhere either.If you 're in the sun often like myself , you MUST have some sort of sun-protection . I wear and apply sunscreen consistently and I always make sure I have a cap that protects . Otherwise you might end up looking likeTanning Mom , -LRB- not judging ! Just sayin ' -RRB- . This hat has n't let me down in that regard ; it shades my eyes without covering my face or smashing my ears.I also have a red one and they are both pretty sturdy . Both have held up to horses , dirt , and sweat , ahem ... sheen . I wash my caps a LOT since I am a girl and I still like to be feminine . The hat 's have held up even after many , many wash cycles . The destroyed/distressed look is cool . I get compliments from friends , and jabs from older family members on it . The rips do n't tear and shred after washing like a lot of other pre-distressed hats , and the color is still bright green . Not too much fading . I guess my only dislike for this particular cap is the color . For me it 's just a little bit too green ; just personal preference however.You really ca n't go too wrong with this one . Just buy more than one to get the most bang from your buck .
 This cap is exactly as pictured . It is distressed on the visor and on some of the seams but it still has enough integrity that it likely will not fall apart any time soon . It adjusts easily and fits well . . like any other painter style baseball cap .
 I have searched for sometime for this type of cap ... Better than I expected ! I will be ordering another one .
 I wanted a plain vintage baseball cap made out of canvas , and this fulfilled my expectations nicely . Was n't sure what to expect since these hats did n't have any reviews yet . I ordered the Scotland blue color , and the color matches the preview image well . The distressing looks nice and natural . The hat fits well . The item shipped and arrived promptly -LRB- in three days -RRB- . Not sure what else to say , but it was a good deal for a basic hat .
 It 's only been the last 7 years or so that I 've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house , I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning ! All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks , and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart . I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe , when it got here and I wore it for a couple days , I really like it.I bought the Large Black robe ; I 'm 6ft , about 200lbs , a little heavy around the middle , and the robe fits pretty well . The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist . The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs . It `` flows '' nice too , when I walk , not like the heavier terrycloth robe . And the silk lining makes me feel `` rich '' ! Overall , I like it !
 Wow I am completely impressed with this robe . I bought the silver/grey robe , and one big thing to note is that the picture just does n't do it justice . The outside fabric -LRB- mainly wool -RRB- has a pattern that is hard to explain but looks very sharp . The seams are silk and really accent the robe in the right way . The inside of the robe is smooth silk and the entire robe is not heavy or light its right in the middle . I bought the medium size and it fits perfectly . I am 5 '10 and the waist/arms were a spot on fit . Kudos on the fast shipping as well to Amazon !
 Not the lowest price robe out there , but very well priced for silk.Soft silk wraps you in luxury . It 's sooo much better than a plain cotton terry robe.Gotta go , Hugh Hefner is calling .
 This is a great robe , warm and feels great . The one negative is that the material looks like it might pill after time .
 This dress shirt has been a wonderful summer dress shirt for me as it 's nice and light weight . It does wrinkle a little , but water spots -LRB- or sweat -RRB- seems to evaporate rather quickly and it breathes nicely . It also has nice color and retains nice shape over time.I give it a four as not many shirts attempt to be summery & lighweight , and I imagine this one was n't intending for that either . It seems to not be quite as nice other dress shirts out there . But it is a nice shirt and I 'm often complimented on it when it is worn .
 I own a couple of running hats , this one compares well with other designs . The meshing in this hat helps to whisk moisture away and the white color helps you keep cool .
 Well , this is a pretty flimsy cap but looks exactly the same as on the web . The side lettering says `` Headsweats , '' which I would 've liked to have known prior to purchasing the hat -LRB- ca n't tell from the picture -RRB- . The brim is pretty rigid , but shapeable . An interior cotton terry cloth hangs loosely around the rim . It 's not sewn down on both edges , so it can easily come down onto the forehead when putting the cap on.Back buckle is cheap plastic , but works fine.Hat is VERY ligthweight , and ideal for hot , sunny climates during exercise .
 I have always had a problem finding a bra that really fits me well and is also comfortable because I am short and wear a D-cup but I finally found one at a local dept store where I live . When I went to buy another one , they no longer sold it so I was so happy to find this bra on Amazon.com . It is the only molded cup bra that has ever fit me . Its comfortable , has great support and shaping and the straps stay put . When buying a t-shirt bra , it is best to get one in a smaller size than what you wear because thats how they are sized . My usual size is 38DD but in this one I wear a 38D . I would highly recommend this bra !
 The bra fits well , with the exception of the straps falling off my shoulders and hanging low if not lifted periodically while wearing .
 Been buy them at store in my home town but have been to happy with the owner . Glad i could find them here . Thanks
 Wear it everyday . Makes me feel sexy . I love the feel and show it off under my white TEE Shirt when shopping
 My daughter is on a weight loss journey of enormous magnitude , and this has been the bra with her as the bust line gets smaller and smaller . The support lasts for months before needing a new one , and it looks great . Sometimes it is difficult for a large busted woman to get the right level of support needed to keep those gals pointing in the right direction . This has been a dream come true keeping the gals up high . The straps are comfortable and do not dig into the shoulder leaving those icky grooved , and there is plenty of support along the back . I have never been happier with what this one offers my daughter . Thank you so much for providing a wonderful bra !
 If you have worn Goddess bras your whole life , like me , and could n't find a replacement until now -- this is it . I even heard that the cutter from Goddess changed to this company.I have a very small band size -LRB- 32/34 -RRB- and huge breasts -- I could never find a bra that fit much less supported me while active . Some woman at a bra shop actually asked me , `` What do you like about the no-stretch straps ? '' Ummmm -- they do n't stretch ! This bra is for those of us who need to run around , jump , climb and not flop all over the place -- this is REAL support . Yes the style is pointy , yes the straps are wide and you 're not going to wear this with some skimpy top -LRB- not that those of us this size could ever find a skimpy top to fit us ! -RRB- This is a supportive bra with a size range to fit those of us who need it.THANK YOU ELILA JACQUARD!PS -- If you are going by your old Goddess size , you will need to go up in the band size and the cup size -- their sizing is different . I ordered one , sent it back and then got the correct size . Good luck to all busty ladies you out there !
 I 've had this bra for a year now and am looking to order a replacement . I was very pleased with how well it fit my chest and the support it offered ... especially after ordering online without having tried it on in a store . I agree with the poster that commented about the strap cushions not staying put and sliding around . At times the loose end of the strap will work its way out of the cup also and is annoying . My main complaint about this bra , however , is the metal clasp on the strap . It tends to dig into my right shoulder -LRB- which is my heavier side -RRB- and then the strap slips and falls off my shoulder at times . Maybe it digs in bc I have it adjusted too tightly for the weight it is supporting ?? Overall though , it really is a good bra . Also 37 years old , it seems very old-ladyish , but gives me the support I have n't found in other bras my size -LRB- 46H -RRB-
 This bra is very comfortable for a support bra . The straps are the type where you adjust them and they hang down into the bra . You ca n't tell this from the image , and considering I do n't like this type it was a huge turn off at first . Yet , unlike others these straps do n't slide out of the grasps after a while , so that is a plus . The cup size is exact , I did not have to send it back , and the no roll band actually does not roll ! The shoulder cushions slide all over the place though , and are annoying but when they are in place they feel great , no bra burn . Overall a really good support bra for us well endowed females .
 Great bra with excellent support . Material a little hard , but by far the best bra I have bought so far.Thanks
 beautiful shape , wonderfully comfortable . All in all , a perfect undergarment ! I love that they have a wider range of sizes , so you can find one that fits perfectly no matter your size . I will be buying more of these !
 This is the only bra I will buy or wear again . It is so well made and actually holds up my large chest . The straps do n't budge which is great . They have metal clasp in the front to adjust the length you prefer and then it snaps right into place and stays there . Thats not an easy task for some of us with large chests . I highly recommend this bra .
 Product was exactly as described , great service and received it super fast , w/in days of ordering ! Would definitely order again and reccommend it to anyone !

 I have read reviews of On Gossamer 's bikini being very very good . But quite frankly for the price , I was skeptical . When amazon had a multiple-buy sale , I said , heck , why not ? give it a try . I am impressed - the cotton is very thick and workmanship is high quality . Each bikini is individually wrapped around a cardboard and plastic - sounds great , but perhaps we should worry about sustainability . They are cut a bit big so sizing needs some experimentation . It 's rare to find all cotton bikinis these days - I highly recommend this one .
 These are the MOST comfortable panties I have ever worn . They are great for hot weather and are so soft . Never binding and they wash well .
 ... I have ever worn . I hope they keep making them forever !
 Excellent shirt . I have used it for over 6 months and they still look great .
 As always adidas did an excellent job . I get the XL size because i have a supernova shirt and is size L , is a little bit small for me -LRB- i 'm 85kg -RRB- and i thinked that if i have the XL size it should be the perfect size for me . But boy i was wrong . It 's Really big but not that big . Just be carefull with the size .
 This shirt seems to be made of the same , good quality , wicking fabric that my previous Adidas shirts were made of . Unfortunately , however , I am currently unable to wear this shirt comfortably . Even though Amazon 's description says this is a `` loose fit '' shirt and I ordered and received the same size of shirt that I 've purchased before -LRB- in many brands -RRB- , this shirt is simply too tight on me for comfort . If I had absolutely no bodyfat , I would n't mind this form fitting shirt . With a bit of love handle action going on , however , a cut like this only accentuates the bodyfat.Buyers should be aware of this prior to ordering this shirt . Perhaps I simply received a shirt that was improperly sized and is n't really a medium after all , but if the shirt I received is representative of the normal cut of this shirt then I would say that this shirt is anything but loose fitting .
 T-shirts are very slight , adapt very well to the body , very beautiful , the fabric is wonderful .

 Fast delivery , good price . I found it first at Sport Authority on sale , but I waited too see if I could find it cheaper at Amazon , and i did.I saved appr 30 dollar , and also without sales tax delivered to the door in 3-4 days . / / Jonas

 I just bought this pretty Sarong in pink & so far love it ! I was impressed with the pictures of all the different ways you could wear this -LRB- that I never would have thought of -RRB- . I wore it yesterday with my bakini tied around my waist -LRB- hid my `` problem '' area 's well , lol -RRB- & it looked fabulous . I got many compliments on it . A few of the shells did fall off but I must admit sometimes I am kind of hard on my things & because it 's hand made I kind of expected a few to fall off when you keep tying it right over the shells . I guess I will have to hand wash it but that is okay . You ca n't beat the price & I know you are n't suppose to review the seller here but I was very pleased with how fast this item shipped , only took 3-4 days & that was over Memorial Day weekend -LRB- just for those wondering -RRB- . Over all I ca n't see anyone being unhappy with this Sarong .
 I love the item but I have been the one receiving rave reviews for the past 5 years . I purchased this on Madison Avenue in one of those extravagant places and here is the same exact thing for 12.99 ??? Anyway , I wear it over my shoulders , around my waist with sexy pants , around my waist as a sarong and use it as a blouse sometimes when I travel to a tropical area of course.Everyone loves it and even now years later , I still get compliments . I am buying one now in case something happens to this one .
 This is a beautiful sarong , with tiny shells attached to the fringe . It can be worn as a beach cover-up , or around the shoulders if you need to cover-up a tank top . Unfortunately , when the sarong arrived it smelled heavily of the dye . After hanging it outside to get some air through the fabric , it still smelled funny so I decided to rinse it in water . Alot of dye came out in the sink so I decided to stop doing this -LRB- I did n't notice a change in color despite the washing away of dye -RRB- . I am afraid to use it at the beach now or over a white tank because of this -LRB- and it still smells funky -RRB- . Any one have any tips ?
 I bought a swimsuit with this turquoise color as one of the stripes , and it looks great . I 'm about a size 12 and it still fit me fine , did n't look too tight . It 's semi-sheer but still discreet . The beaded fringe is very pretty .
 My wife and I go on vacation only once a year but this is perfect for the beach . It 's also nice to walk on the board walk or in surf shops .
 Covers me well Color fantastic , frabric soft , shingles lay straight down none pokie . Overall what l Wanted and expexted . Will buy . More .
 Bought this product right before I went to Hawaii . The sarong looked far more $ $ than the price . Its very beautiful and actually has seashells dangling off the ends for that real beachy feel . I am happy I bought this product , recommend to all ladies for a cover up ! Turqouise color is beautiful .
 Love Love Love !!!! So so sexy . . I bought this before going away to Vegas and it was def a head turner for the pool parties ... You feel like Shakira wearing this . Def worth it and the price is great
 I love how it clings to your body . I did n't know it little sea shells onthe tassels . Im a bog shopper and like to find great deals and this is cute and original with a great price : -RRB-
 I bought two sarong 's from this seller . I bought one in white and black . It is very stylish and i 've worn them to the beach a few times already . My only complaints would be that it gets trangled when I tie the sarong , and the tassles on the end constantly fall off . I put it on and was walking around the house and then walked across the street to the beach and I noticed I left a trail of tassles everywhere I went .
 I wanted something beachy looking to cover my thighs that was n't skintight . After reading the reviews , I was comfortable enough to make the purchase and I 'm glad I did . It 's adorable and so easy to manage ! Came quick , too ! Def recommend .
 I thought i already submitted a review but apparently not ? Anyhow i love how light and sheer this sarong is . It looks great on , my only complaint is the shells go right down to the corner edges and get tangled when and where you tie the sarong . But i can live with it . . all in all i love it !
 I have read reviews of On Gossamer 's bikini being very very good . But quite frankly for the price , I was skeptical . When amazon had a multiple-buy sale , I said , heck , why not ? give it a try . I am impressed - the cotton is very thick and workmanship is high quality . Each bikini is individually wrapped around a cardboard and plastic - sounds great , but perhaps we should worry about sustainability . They are cut a bit big so sizing needs some experimentation . It 's rare to find all cotton bikinis these days - I highly recommend this one .
 These are the MOST comfortable panties I have ever worn . They are great for hot weather and are so soft . Never binding and they wash well .
 ... I have ever worn . I hope they keep making them forever !
 It 's only been the last 7 years or so that I 've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house , I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning ! All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks , and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart . I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe , when it got here and I wore it for a couple days , I really like it.I bought the Large Black robe ; I 'm 6ft , about 200lbs , a little heavy around the middle , and the robe fits pretty well . The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist . The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs . It `` flows '' nice too , when I walk , not like the heavier terrycloth robe . And the silk lining makes me feel `` rich '' ! Overall , I like it !
 Wow I am completely impressed with this robe . I bought the silver/grey robe , and one big thing to note is that the picture just does n't do it justice . The outside fabric -LRB- mainly wool -RRB- has a pattern that is hard to explain but looks very sharp . The seams are silk and really accent the robe in the right way . The inside of the robe is smooth silk and the entire robe is not heavy or light its right in the middle . I bought the medium size and it fits perfectly . I am 5 '10 and the waist/arms were a spot on fit . Kudos on the fast shipping as well to Amazon !
 Not the lowest price robe out there , but very well priced for silk.Soft silk wraps you in luxury . It 's sooo much better than a plain cotton terry robe.Gotta go , Hugh Hefner is calling .
 This is a great robe , warm and feels great . The one negative is that the material looks like it might pill after time .

 The size is very accurate , and the blousing ties come out of two separate holes instead of the same hole , making unblousing a snap . A word of caution if you buy the black pants -LRB- or other dark colors -RRB- wash with similar colors the first couple of times . Like any BDU style pants , the color will bleed , but not fade . This was okay for me , because the rest of my uniforms are black as well . I have been using them for about 4 months now , and they are still like new . Worth the buy . I will be getting more .
 i am a nurse and i wear these to work . they are heavy duty without being too warm . the cargo pockets are fantastic for all my `` things '' i need to carry with me . since finding these i have to gone back to silly scrub pants .
 I came fast and well packaged . These are great pants . Very thick and sturdy . I use them for military work and they have held up to rigorous use for over a year . I would definitely recommend this item !
 All i were are BDUs and have been looking for a black pair . i love Propper products and am always satsfied
 I ordered a medium in A-TACS FG and found out that was waaay too big after already ordering this in medium as well . Turns out A-TACS just sizes really large . I do have to cinch the waistband pretty tight , and will probably get the waist taken in , but the legs of the pants are perfect , not too tight , not too fat . Works well and after blousing , cinching , and putting on kneepads , I 'm comfortable . Add to the comfortability that even though this is poly-cotton it feels like all cotton , it 's soft and wears well without being too lightweight or feeling like it will rip in duty . I like them , and would buy again .
 These are well made and hold their color well -LRB- black in my case -RRB- . Plenty of pocket room yet not too large that you must fish around for your wallet like another manufacturers .
 Excellent work clothing , quality garment , proven to be very durable . Propper has a reputation for these feature which drove the purchase . Definitely well earned !
 I had bought some black BDU pants in the early 90 's . I do n't even know who they manufacturer was but they were this real lightweight ripstop nylon that was even cheaper and lighter than the fabric they used in the standard military cammies BDU 's they sold for the military.I just got these . It is a summer weight BDU material , but you can tell the quality difference in the material right off.The sizing chart is right on . If you are used to the BDU sizing that you would buy your uniforms at AAFES you 'll feel right at home.I only bought two pair . I think I 'm going to end up buying a bunch more to be my daily work wear -LRB- casual to business casual -RRB- . They are n't Dockers , but I think they could fly in a business casual environment , especially if your a techie type .
 I got these for my husband who loves , loves , loves them for work ! As a matter of fact , everyone in his office loved them and bought a pair too ! They are durable and wash super easy . And they look good too !
 These pants fit great -LRB- I have a straight , non-hippy frame -RRB- . Only problem is they fade pretty bad . Run true to normal jean/pant size . I 'm 5 ' 8 &#34; and lenth is perfect .
 I really like these pants . I bought them to replace the standard issued junk pants work pants that fit like they were modeled on a piece of plywood with two 2x4 's for legs . These pants are a great , comfortable product .
 Excellent work clothing , quality garment , proven to be very durable . Propper has a reputation for these feature which drove the purchase . Definitely well earned !
 Excellent shirt . I have used it for over 6 months and they still look great .
 As always adidas did an excellent job . I get the XL size because i have a supernova shirt and is size L , is a little bit small for me -LRB- i 'm 85kg -RRB- and i thinked that if i have the XL size it should be the perfect size for me . But boy i was wrong . It 's Really big but not that big . Just be carefull with the size .
 This shirt seems to be made of the same , good quality , wicking fabric that my previous Adidas shirts were made of . Unfortunately , however , I am currently unable to wear this shirt comfortably . Even though Amazon 's description says this is a `` loose fit '' shirt and I ordered and received the same size of shirt that I 've purchased before -LRB- in many brands -RRB- , this shirt is simply too tight on me for comfort . If I had absolutely no bodyfat , I would n't mind this form fitting shirt . With a bit of love handle action going on , however , a cut like this only accentuates the bodyfat.Buyers should be aware of this prior to ordering this shirt . Perhaps I simply received a shirt that was improperly sized and is n't really a medium after all , but if the shirt I received is representative of the normal cut of this shirt then I would say that this shirt is anything but loose fitting .
 T-shirts are very slight , adapt very well to the body , very beautiful , the fabric is wonderful .
 This is a Great polo the only bad thing is the size , American sizes are way too big for Latin American people . size S feels more like a size L. generally I use size M and when I try this polo on size S realize that is a little big for me but I used anyways
 This product is of experience quality and very durable , great colors . I would recommend this product and the seller as well . Totally satisified with my purchase and will definitely shop again .
 These panty 's are gorgeous . They feel gentle against the skin like a wispy breeze . If you like being in the nude , yet , one pair of something nice , these are a Lady 's undies . You 'll enjoy the comfort .
 Men , if you want to wear panties , or Women , if you want to see your man wearing panties , BUY this ! Yes , the front is `` poofy '' in the front and at first I was disappointed by it . However , after I put it on it felt wonderful ! Loved walking around in it feeling my `` package '' bounce around in the front . When I became erect if felt fabulous ! I am ordering more of these ! If you want a tight snug fit , the this is n't for you , if you want room to grow , enjoy the soft silk feeling , then by all means , buy this . The sizing runs a little large , so order the next smaller size .
 Wear it everyday . Makes me feel sexy . I love the feel and show it off under my white TEE Shirt when shopping
 My daughter is on a weight loss journey of enormous magnitude , and this has been the bra with her as the bust line gets smaller and smaller . The support lasts for months before needing a new one , and it looks great . Sometimes it is difficult for a large busted woman to get the right level of support needed to keep those gals pointing in the right direction . This has been a dream come true keeping the gals up high . The straps are comfortable and do not dig into the shoulder leaving those icky grooved , and there is plenty of support along the back . I have never been happier with what this one offers my daughter . Thank you so much for providing a wonderful bra !
 If you have worn Goddess bras your whole life , like me , and could n't find a replacement until now -- this is it . I even heard that the cutter from Goddess changed to this company.I have a very small band size -LRB- 32/34 -RRB- and huge breasts -- I could never find a bra that fit much less supported me while active . Some woman at a bra shop actually asked me , `` What do you like about the no-stretch straps ? '' Ummmm -- they do n't stretch ! This bra is for those of us who need to run around , jump , climb and not flop all over the place -- this is REAL support . Yes the style is pointy , yes the straps are wide and you 're not going to wear this with some skimpy top -LRB- not that those of us this size could ever find a skimpy top to fit us ! -RRB- This is a supportive bra with a size range to fit those of us who need it.THANK YOU ELILA JACQUARD!PS -- If you are going by your old Goddess size , you will need to go up in the band size and the cup size -- their sizing is different . I ordered one , sent it back and then got the correct size . Good luck to all busty ladies you out there !
 I 've had this bra for a year now and am looking to order a replacement . I was very pleased with how well it fit my chest and the support it offered ... especially after ordering online without having tried it on in a store . I agree with the poster that commented about the strap cushions not staying put and sliding around . At times the loose end of the strap will work its way out of the cup also and is annoying . My main complaint about this bra , however , is the metal clasp on the strap . It tends to dig into my right shoulder -LRB- which is my heavier side -RRB- and then the strap slips and falls off my shoulder at times . Maybe it digs in bc I have it adjusted too tightly for the weight it is supporting ?? Overall though , it really is a good bra . Also 37 years old , it seems very old-ladyish , but gives me the support I have n't found in other bras my size -LRB- 46H -RRB-
 This bra is very comfortable for a support bra . The straps are the type where you adjust them and they hang down into the bra . You ca n't tell this from the image , and considering I do n't like this type it was a huge turn off at first . Yet , unlike others these straps do n't slide out of the grasps after a while , so that is a plus . The cup size is exact , I did not have to send it back , and the no roll band actually does not roll ! The shoulder cushions slide all over the place though , and are annoying but when they are in place they feel great , no bra burn . Overall a really good support bra for us well endowed females .
 Great bra with excellent support . Material a little hard , but by far the best bra I have bought so far.Thanks
 beautiful shape , wonderfully comfortable . All in all , a perfect undergarment ! I love that they have a wider range of sizes , so you can find one that fits perfectly no matter your size . I will be buying more of these !
 This is the only bra I will buy or wear again . It is so well made and actually holds up my large chest . The straps do n't budge which is great . They have metal clasp in the front to adjust the length you prefer and then it snaps right into place and stays there . Thats not an easy task for some of us with large chests . I highly recommend this bra .
 Product was exactly as described , great service and received it super fast , w/in days of ordering ! Would definitely order again and reccommend it to anyone !
 The bra fits well , with the exception of the straps falling off my shoulders and hanging low if not lifted periodically while wearing .
 I 've been wanting these pants for a long time and now that I have them , its great . I 'm a big fan of the Dickie 's Girl stuff and the pinstripes are a flattering pattern . I like the stretch so that they still move even when they are tight.I 'm a bigger girl -LRB- women 's 10-12 -RRB- and usually do n't look good in Juniors clothes . The size 13s in these pants fit great , however.Also , these pants are made well so they last a long time and do n't fade quickly either .
 I love these pants ! These pants can make any woman 's behind to look amazing . They are form fitting to your body , and the white stripes make you look slimmer . The only problem that I have with these pants is the fact that I ca n't find another pair anywhere !
 They fit like a dream , they 're comfortable to wear , and they look fantastic ! Super-shiny silver pinstripes down a solid black twill fabric = divine ! The only thing is that you have to dry-clean them , or wash them by hand and let them sit out to dry . Still , I love these pants . = D
 I absolutly LOVE these pants . They got here quick , they fit perfect , my boyfriend loves how they look on me . They are perfect for at work or to go to an interview , or even to go out in . The pinstripes are really slimming , they totally make you look skinnier , and I get compliments on them everywhere I go .
 I bought a pair of Ray Ban 3025 metal aviator sunglasses for my boyfriend for Christmas . They came in a case and had lense cleaning clothes in the case . I recieved them with in a week and he loves them .
 I 've been looking for a pair of sunglasses that I could use during formal occassions or even for a walk that do not require any major activity . I already have a sports sunglasses -LRB- the type that kind of wrap around your face -RRB- for hiking , playing outdoor sports , etc.Since it 'll be a secondary pair , I opted for a cheap pair but I already have my eyes set on the aviator style . This was a wrong decision and it took me after 2 purchases -LRB- that I had to return due to defects -RRB- before finally deciding to get an expensive pair so I 'm sure of the quality I 'll get.This is why I bought Ray-ban sunglasses . The style has been around for many many years and the price is way lower compared to even outlet stores . I researched on how to check if a pair of Ray-ban aviator sunglasses is original or not and this pair is definitely original . Facing the mirror , the usual white Ray-ban logo in script on the right lens and an embossed RB on the left . There 's also an RB script on both nose pads . Both inner temples have white inscriptions that bear the model number , size , brand , and where the sunglasses were made . Finally , just below the topmost bridge , there 's also a model number written.I 'm really happy with this pair with regards to its price , quality and style . Definitely a great buy for a look that will be in style forever .
 These are n't called `` Aviators '' as some marketing ploy . These really are well designed glasses for flying , which is what they were originally crafted for.They dip low on the cheek to stop sun glare from that area . This is helpful in protecting your eyes from sun glaring off panels , instrumentation , etc. . The lenses are glass , which is the only con . Modern glasses with shatter proof , impact resistant lenses are better to avoid shards in your eye in case you eject after entering a flat spin with Goose . For good aviators who do n't crash , or others protected by a windscreen , this is n't much of a problem . Having glass lenses means less scratches and nicks which means much better vision in the air . It can be hard locating other air traffic when specks get on your windshield or glasses . So , these will definitely better help you find Viper under the harddeck.If you want true aviator glasses , these are the ones for you . Built for a job , and built right . Why are they called `` Aviator Glasses '' and not `` Pilot Glasses ? '' Because they were first made for Naval Aviators , who are better than pilots . Yep , and it 's true.Oh , if you want to stay true to form , get G-15 lenses and not polarized . From an FAA pilot safety brochure
 These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person 's face even though they say they are large . the only thing i do n't like it that the lens are n't a non-see through green , depending on the lighting , people can see your eyes , this happens about % of the time . outside of that they are amazing glasses and look great .
 I LOVE THESE SUNGLASSES !! These are my second pair , I left the first on top of my car and drove off . I am small , 5 ' 2 '' , and they still fit good . GREAT , GREAT , GREAT
 The glasses came in good order . . they were just really late with the shipping . . but my customer service inquiry was dealt with immediately and they offered a full refund . .
 looks exactly like pictured . I ordered it for a friends birthday and he loved it .
 Good replacement for previous case , a hard sided case that lasted over 30 years . Very useful for carrying items that would be damaged by a soft-sided case .
 This is a great briefcase that looks very well made . We have tried many different types of briefcases throughout the years but hope this one last until retirement ... . his first case was a Samsonite and hopefully his last one before retirement !
 This fit a 17 '' notebook computer , as well as all the cables and chargers , easily ... and i had room for other stuff.Keep in mind , it 's a little bulky ... but if you need a hard-case , you ca n't go wrong here . This would be perfect for someone who travels , or is outdoors a lot ... like a contractor.Sturdy , dependable , and travels well ... just like a golden retriever .
 I love this briefcase . My last briefcase was a tad too shallow for my needs . I found this was one of the only cases that was deeper . The added workspace flap thing is genius . If you do n't like it , or are looking for just a bit more space , it can be removed.The big center storage piece on the case when open has a plastic form meant for pens ... It 's a total waste of space . My pens did n't fit inside there , so I just ripped it out and use it as a general storage compartment . Other than this thing , the only other drawback is the size of this case . Some of my friends tell me that I am carrying a `` suitcase '' . You get used to it . ; -RRB- I 'm a computer programmer , and carry this case everyday to work . Laptop , textbooks , notebooks , keys , DVDs , and a few file folders . :-RRB- Enjoy .
 THIS IS THE FORTH SAMSONITE ATTACHE CASE I HAVE OWNED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS . IT IS HEAVY DUTY . IT CARRIES TOOLS , DEMO SUPPLIES , AND CONTRACTS . I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN . I AM HAPPY WITH AMAZONS QUICK SERVICE
 I got this bag to carry around books I use for religious meetings . It 's very large and is a little heavy . But it looks great and it very rugged . I 'd recommend it to anyone who needs a large attache and does n't want to worry about scratching it all the time .
 No fluff , but if you want something that holds up it does the job . It will carry a fair amount and allows for easy access to your files .
 I bought this to replace a 25-year-old Samsonite 6-inch attache case . The fact that the old one worked so well for so long made me buy this one when the handle finally fell off the old one . The new model is sturdy and works well . However , where my old model included dividers in the upper compartment to form three separate compartments , this model has only one compartment . Also , the new one has two hard plastic compartments on the inside of the upper section for storing pens , etc. and an elastic strap that I use for holding a calculator . I would have preferred that the hard plastic compartments be replaced by straps or something more adaptable . If what you have does n't fit in those hard compartments , they become useless .
 Everything I hoped for . It 's a bit heavier than I anticipated , but very well put together . It will soon be a padded instrument case .
 Very happy with quality of purchase . All I expected . It came promply and in excelent shape - packsged well . I was so happy with it .
 This product is just how they said it is.I really like how it fits and it is not very heavy.I recomend it .
 I have had my Nimbus for over two years now and I still love it . I live in Florida and was looking for a lightweight hat that would shield me from the sun and rain , BUT would also look fairly decent.This hat 's design not only looks good , but the wide brim and low back covers your neck and face from the intense sun better than any other hat I have owned . Originally the hat 's main purpose was for sun protection , but I have found myself caught in major downpours and the goretex construction blocks ALL rain and again the design directs the water off you . The hat is easily rolled , folded , smashed and always pops back into shape . The adjustable head band is great for windy days . I can not recommend this hat enough , if fact the reason I am on Amazon today is to order a black Nimbus ! And guys , I am a 43 year old father of a trendy 14 year old daughter who actually thinks the hat looks `` good '' . After already getting various skin cancers excised from my person -LRB- pasty Caucasian original Floridian here ! -RRB- , trust me wear the big hats when out in the sun !
 This is a very good hat - the adjustable band gives you the ability to make a secure fit . You may sweat a little , but it is gore-tex . Very lightweight , and it keeps its shape if you pack it and need to pull it out in bad weather . Chin strap is not bothersome like some hats that are similar.I would definite recommend to others looking for a good day-hike/backpacking hat that will cover many weather conditions .
 Just as advertised . Only been out in rain and snow -- waterproof ! No drips down back - no wet glasses !!
 Hat is comfortable and waterproof as described . Recieved the hat in a reasonable amount of time . Overall very happy with this purchase . Only downside was the price was not any cheaper than buying at a local store .
 needed a rain hat with good coverage , but did n't need it to be insulated ... chose this over the seattle sombrero and am very happy ... been backpacking and hiking in heavy rains and hat has performed well .
 I bought this shirt for a friend as a gift , and he loves it . Everyone compliments him on it , even the kicker Robbie Gould ! At the Bears Convention at Soldier Field this year , my friend wore it . While getting Gould 's autograph , Gould told him he loved his shirt !! The color has n't faded yet , and the graphic has not altered at all -LRB- after one year ! -RRB- . Great shirt , highly recommended !!
 Excellent product , good customer service by vendor . Would recommend to anyone . Go Bears !
 I bought this shirt for my step-dad who is a huge Chicago Bears fan ! He said it fits just right & is very comfortable . I recommend it to any Bears fan .
 Great shirt !! My favorite team -LRB- da Bears -RRB- , and my favorite SNL skit - if you have n't seen it , google bears superfans .
 My hubby is a huge Bears & SNL fan , so this shirt was a perfect gift . It was good quality and runs true to its size . And when he wears it out in public he gets tons of compliments from other Bears fans !
 This item arrived within the projected delivery window . The shirt looks good . I would 've liked for the graphic to have been bigger considering I bought a XXL , but it was straight and centered . I dig it for its novelty and will wear it as a proud and loyal Bears fan !
 The shirts do tend to run a bit small . My husband is a M , but he needed a L . The exchange was smooth .
 My husband loved this shirt . It came just in time for the divisional championship game . I did have a little trouble with the shipping ... I purchased it with normal shipping originally , then feared it would n't make it here on time . I went back in to check the price difference for 2nd day , but decided that was more than I wanted to spend so closed out of my browser . Come to find out , my order got changed to 2nd day and I ended up spending more than I planned . Oh well , my husband was super excited and he loves the shirt !
 This is a great shirt for any Bears fan ! My hubby wanted it forever and was so happy to get it for his birthday this year .
 I love this shirt ! It fits perfectly and I wear it every game day to give my boys good luck ! I especially wore it around my home for my fiance with his friends when we beat Dallas . . b/c they are huge Cowboys fans ... LOLI have already washed it a few times and the logo is still intact and the shirt has n't shrunk . It arrived quickly in the mail and I could n't have been happier !
 I was sent this t-shirt for Christmas - it was awesome . We used to laugh about this skit on SNL all the time and now I can remember it and share with others as I proudly display this while I 'm out in public.Delivery was fast and the sizing was perfect !
 I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it ! He is a huge Bears fan and just loves the SNL sketch ! This is a great gift for any `` Da Bears '' fans out there !
 This item arrived very quickly , and I was very happy with this purchase and the quality of the item I ordered .
 Got this for my fiance for christmas . He loves it . The shirt is good quality and soft matterials . Go Bears !!
 I was so excited about this shirt - we love The Super fans , and my son is a wild Bears fan . I 'm still pleased that someone has made this shirt , but the silk screening -LRB- or however it 's done these days -RRB- is not of the best quality . Still , I 'm glad that this shirt is available .
 It was a great t-shirt and the gift recipient loved it ! I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested ! Fast delivery , easy transaction , reasonable price !
 What can I say ... I ordered a shirt that said &#34; Da Bears &#34; and that is exactly what I received . Great shirt and I got it in record time .
 This shirt is very comfortable and the size was perfect , it was not to small like some people have said . Not to mention after I bought it the Bears went 7 - 1 and I have not worn it in a while now that winter is coming and the bears lost the last 4 of 5 games ... Hey I 'm a bit superstitious what can I say .
 I bought this as a gift for my brother in law . I was told to order a size up as he was a medium and I purchased a large . Its a pretty firm t shirt that is pre-shrunk . I prefer softer thin t shirts and this is a normal cotton heavyweight type shirt . It came fast and it seemed pretty sturdy and not like any sort of screen print that would wear off or anything . I 'm happy with the purchase .
 The shirt , `` Da Bears '' SNL was as described . It arrived on time for Father 's Day . He was very happy with this gift . Thank you , Amazon
 I loves this bag , its not too big or too small and Comeback Kid is an awesome hardcore band that I 'm proud to represent
 This is everything I could want in a hat , and has changed my outlook on life . Nice low profile on top , comes down low enough in the back , the ties are just long enough to tie under my chin but not so long as to be a nuisance , and my peripheral vision is still clear , totally covers the ears , and it 's very warm and not itchy.A + + would buy again -LRB- if lost or something -RRB- .
 Great hat that fits even larger size heads . I purchased this for my 16 year old and she loves it ! Great colors that really bring out the detail of the knitting . She also likes that it is lined so it stays in place and is less itchy than most out door hats ! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new ski/winter hat !
 Absolutely love my ` wool chullo fleece lined ski hat with ear flaps ' ... I live in Oregon and its pretty cold in the winter . This is the first cap that has kept my head and ears warm , and its pretty too . I 've got lots of compliments on it . I 'm going to buy another one , only without the fleece for when its not quite that cold . I love it !!
 This hat is worth more than you are paying , I promise . It 's incredibly warm , it 's insanely comfortable with the fleece lining , and it looks awesome . Everyone wants it xD . Get this for sure , its an awesome buy
 I Love this Toque ! I work in a milk refrigerator and wear it in there all the time . Supper thick and comfy .
 This hat is really nicely made and is super warm . My spouse loves it ! It looks very nice as well .
 Soft lining , very warm , everything you could hope for in a hat . Gave it as a gift to a family member and they love it .
 This hat fits my big head well and keeps me warm . The inner lining is soft and not scratchy . I love it !
 I love this hat for skiing . The lining kept me nice and warm in blizzard conditions . I wore it every day of my week long ski trip .
 This hat was exactly what I expected . It is quite warm and the flaps seem to stay in place , except extreme wind .
 This backpack has room for everything my daughter needs for school . I did not have to drive around town like a mad women to purchase the exact colors and type of bag she wanted . It fits all types of books , her lunch , etc just fine.Thanks !
 When I saw the price of these I thought there was no way they could be high quality . However , I was wrong ! I 'm a size 10.5 shoe and the fit could not be better . These are a low-rise sock and just barely come up to the bottom of my ankle bone -LRB- they are almost totally hidden in sneakers and wick moisture away from my foot remarkably well . The exact fiber composition is 48 % acrylic , 39 % cotton , 11 % polyester and 1 % nylon.A word of caution would be that these socks are pretty slippery on smooth floors .
 It is very nice . . the problem is that it shrinks after u wash it the first time . . make sure u order the next size to yours . .
 I was shocked when I received my first order of these . Excellent quality material with good craftsmanship . These are better than many $ 30 polo shirts.I bought 4 more .
 I bought 3 of these and they are absolutely a great find.Don ' t know what Blumkin 's problem was , but these are worth 40.00 each.Will buy more of the others now.Collars stay nice and flat after washing .
 Bought 3 for myself they were wonderful . Came back for 4 more for gifts . Spent 9.99 ... people think I spent 30.00-40 .00 .
 Little pricey for 2 pairs of underwear but they are soft and very comfortable.No elastic cutting into my waist was a joy.They do run a little big and dont shrink in the wash . .
 Love this bra ! Fits perfectly , looks great , wish it was sold in stores still ! Amazon is the only place I can find it , and in my size !
 it 's a nice bra for support . i like it because it 's full coverage . it 's pretty much the same as my other victoria secret bras . but i paid less . : -RRB-
 I purchased this for a friends wife that has lost her wallet several times . I gave it to her at a Christmas Party and it went over well .
 Perfect size , I can even put my checkbook register in it . It 's not leather -LRB- it 's heavy canvas -RRB- , but for the price , you ca n't beat it !
 It 's been a long time since I had worn tennis panties and now I remember why I did n't miss them . Is n't there a way to design panties that are functional , modest , and flattering?These knickers indeed hold balls . The pockets are very accessible and the fabric seems like something that will endure many sets and subsequent washings . I just wish they did n't look like granny panties .
 I got this in black and it is absolutely beautiful ! So soft and pretty ! I 'm delighted !
 I GOT THIS PANTY FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT !!!!! SHE LETS ME WERE IT AS WELL !!!!
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 I was looking for tons of new things as my birthday gifts from hubby and parents ... as part of my decision to take up golf . I looked at many hats and visors , and based on price , appearance , and reviews , went with this one . It is very cute , fits nicely , and is embellished without being over-the-top . As a woman that never wears hats or visors , I find it more comfortable , and can wear it longer without it itching me , than I can most other hats/visors . I definitely recommend it , and would consider buying another one in a different color for other outfits in the future . For the first time ever , I am uploading a couple of photos of me wearing it ... I think it will truly help you decide if it 's `` the one '' for you . : -RRB-
 I GOT THIS PANTY FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT !!!!! SHE LETS ME WERE IT AS WELL !!!!
 There is only one bra in the world that I like the best . I was able to obtain this bra through Amazon and the vendor with the best price . The bra came promptly and far below the local store price . Very satisfied
 to whomever this may concern , i ordered 2 beautiful bras in my size -LRB- 36D -RRB- which did not fit as they were wrongly sized , now i lost my shipping charge due to wrongly sized bras.i also requested a larger size but was not carried in this style.i am left dissapointed with my purchase and will not order through this company again . sincerely , karelynnd
 This is a beautiful product , much more than I expected from the price . The fabric is lovely and delicate looking yet strong and not flimsy . This bra gives very good support , does not cut in or ride up . In short , it does just what you want a bra to do . I intend to reorder this item .
 I am a 38D and this is the only underwire I have been able to wear . Its so comfortable and it fits right and covers the sides well too.I hope these bras are around forever .
 Really makes them smaller !! You can do jumping jacks or whatever . The only thing is it hurts the back .
 Years ago I would buy only from Bali & Maidenform and was never really completely happy with the bras I was buying and wearing until I came across these Olga Sheer Tapestry Bras . I 've now been wearing these bras for about 7 years now and am always happy with how they fit & the support it gives , how the band in the back & the shoulder straps stay in place , the minimizing of my boobs so I get a more clean flatter look and how comfortable it is for a bra . I tend to always buy these in either the white or the black color and since finding these Olga Sheer Tapestry bras have never gone back to the other bra companies or to any other bra . They used to make a pretty lavendar and a powder blue color bra but I never see those anymore so just buying the black and also the white bras is always the best since they match everything . I have to admit though that you have to be a bit careful that you do n't snag the lace or else the bra tends to rip and sometimes the hooks tend to get bent out of shape but as long as they make these I 'll keep on buying and wearing them . I find the bra great for when I leave the house and have to go places but sometimes when I get home all I want to do is take it off since it tends to be a bit tight around the back area when you first buy them since its so new . I usually end up taking off the new bra and putting on an older - more stretched out one or just putting on a tight fitting tank top . For all the women who say this is tight around the back area you could also buy those bra extenders and hook it to the bra so its not so tight and a bit more comfortable since they did start making these just a bit tighter than they used to . But , all-in-all this really is the best bra for larger busted chicklets like me . I always wait for them to go on sale which they go for $ 14.99 - $ 19.99 when they are on sale & well worth it . Great bra that I know you 'll love !
 I have been trying to find this bra for months ! I had one that I bought a long time ago , and I loved the fit . Unfortunately , when I looked at the tag -LRB- s -RRB- to determine the name brand and size , it was too faded -LRB- by washing -RRB- and , without that information , I was unable to shop by brand . Fortunately , I tried Amazon ... and found this long-lost item that I was looking for . No other bra fits me as well ... I ordered several of them !
 Yes this bra has changed . Ca n't even remember the first one I bought eons ago . The original number was 35964 -LRB- Yes I still wear one of the old ones ! -RRB- . But the fabric now is lighter and the wire does poke under the arm . I found a little silicone pad that I slip into the cup when I want to prevent `` show through '' and am working on an ultrasuede cushion for under the arm . The fact that I would bother with all that just shows how well the darn thing fits me and my one shoulder lower than the other . It minimizes in the right places too , pushing side spread forward where I prefer it . Sure would like to find that blue one on the model . Never seen any but basic colors .
 Thank goodness I found this at Amazon ! I moved to the Caribbean 7 years ago and brought 4 of these with me . With a very active life in this tropical climate , they were perfect . Just the right amount of support and quite comfortable . The first thing I did a few years later , on my first trip back to the States ... was look for more ! Now they are truly falling apart , but I say many years of hard use means they held up extremely well . I 've tried many others but can not get the fit as I get from these . I range from 38C to D and only once did a wire poke through.The antique beige works well , even under white linen shirts , and the tapestry design is smooth enough to work under quite thin fabrics . I 'm not sure what people mean about `` show through '' as I teach ... and am concerned about modesty , of course . Anyone who is full-figured and wants a great bra ... this is it ! -LRB- But save some for me . -RRB-
 It 's hard to go shopping for a bra anytime ! To find one over the internet and have it fit , was a first for me ! Olga is a great name brand and I 'm glad I took a chance on buying it .
 This item was mailed promptly . It is exactly what I ordered . I am very pleased with my purchase .
 I have been wearing this bra for a few years now and love it . I have several other types of bras in my drawer that I pass up in favor of this one . It has great support and the straps are comfortable . It is a little tight but that is because it is minimizing -LRB- and it does a great job of that !! -RRB- . Another plus is that it is fairly low cut , when you get into larger sizes -LRB- I am a 36 DD -RRB- , bras tend to be too high cut and the underwires seem to go up to your neck . This one does n't look like your grandmother 's bra yet does n't sacrifice support . I do wish it was a little more opaque ... a sheer shirt is just going to show too much .
 These are the most comfortable bras I have ever bought . Most bras do not have a wide enough band on the side so the body tends to hang over the material . This bra has a nice wide side band.I now have several of these in all 3 colors .
 This was a buy on a whim deal , and my wife says it 's soo comfortable that she 'll wear it out before she gets her next one .
 This is the best bra I 've ever owned ! I 've been wearing it since about 1998 . I always go back to it even when I try to broaden my bra horizon . I am a 38DD and I love how this bra minimizes . I 've only ever had a problem with the size when I bought them from Kohl 's once . They were defective or something . I ended up returning them . And recently in my area , Filene 's turned to Macy 's and they do n't carry them anymore . And so now I have to buy this bra strictly online , but they have it for a cheaper price !
 Yes , the bra runs small in the cup area . However , that 's what the bra is supposed to do . I 'm a D cup and this bra makes it possible to wear tighter fitted , button down shirts without the buttons bulging & making my chest feel like it 's being crushed.Recommended for the larger chested folks .
 I have worn these bras for years . The comfort is amazing , support fantastic . Straps do not fall off , back rolls are controlled too.On the down side however , the metal rings make me itch like crazy -LRB- I am allergic -RRB- and the wires poke through on a regular basis . This could be the perfect bra with a little tweaking !
 Itis my favorite style and type of bra , so I was happy to be able to order it online at a reasonable price.It is as I expected and came on time .
 I have worn minimizer bras for some time now , and a few years ago was lucky enough to stumble over this bra at TJMaxx . I bought 2 of them and wore them out . I am so glad that Olga still makes this style . Very comfortable and the straps never fall off of my shoulder!You have to get this bra !!
 Brand New , tags and everything !!! Arrived within a week , no glitches . Just like ordering new from catalog . Will search and order again for merchandise all at fairer price or even 50 cut of new brand name items that either are not in stock in your size , or ca n't be found in store or are marked up 20 % 0r more!LUUVV ITT !!!!!!! BONNIE
 this is the only bra I buy , I 'm glad it 's available from Amazon . Looks nice , lots of support .
 Although it does run small , this bra has great support ! I love it !
 Good qulity item , arrived as ordered . The price and shipping cost were well in line . I reccommend Bare Necessities .
 I love this Bra ! It 's the only bra I plan to buy from now on !
 This is my favorite brassiere , because the shoulder straps stay up and because it gives natural-looking support without appearing pointy or misshapen . I wore my last one until it was in threads and am happy to have found a way to continue to order it .
 Video review ... no thanks ! This bra looks beautiful . I 've worn several times but how it minimizes is to push offside and then the wires are poking my arms . Maybe I 'm asking it too much .
 I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store , and I did n't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later , and panicked when I could n't make out the writing on the tag . I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES ! Finally ! I found it again ! I am so stoked ! The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra , and it looks pretty sad by now . Like other reviewers ' bras , mine developed a split in the fabric , but it was only after many , many washes in the machine , rides on the bike , exercise DVDs , naps , etc. I like this bra because it fits me so well , but also because the fabric is so breathable -- no cotton , so it dries fast ! It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra , because sports bras suck . If I could , I would people the lingerie world with these bras . The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related
 This is a great and comfortable bra , and it works for me . It 's a MINIMIZER , and is great for larger sizes . I exercise a lot and it provides great support , even good enough for running on the treadmill . I have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years . I am so impressed with them that I looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more , and it is half of what I paid in the mall . Now it is all I wear for everyday : -RRB-
 This is my second set of these bras . My first set has worn well although the fabric does tend to pill after time . This has not affected the wear I have gotten from them . One of the most important reasons I like these is that they do n't fall off my shoulders . That has been a problem all my life and when I found these bras - problem solved . I have found that if you wash them in a lingerie bag and hang them to dry , they last for several years . I had four before and bought three this time and for the price , you ca n't beat them .
 I only wear Olga bras because of the way they are designed in the back -- they are the only bras that do not slip off my narrow shoulders . This one is the one I buy most of the time , as it does have a minimizing effect . The sizes are slightly different from other bras -- it 's best to try one on in the store to get your size , then buy from Amazon because of the price . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because it is a little too see-through ; I would prefer a thicker lining .
 I love this bra and I wear one daily . If you like comfort combined with beauty , then this one is for you .
 This bra is much more comfortable than I had expected . I found the sizing perfect in the cups , but the it does run a little small in the band . I usually wear a 38 DD , but because Amazon did n't offer this bra in a DD in a 38 , I sized up . Good thing too , because there is no way the 38 would have fit . However , since I did order a size up , it does fit just fine . I wore it all day shopping and did n't have to tug at my straps even once . I forgot I was even wearing it ! I definitely recommend this item .
 This is the 5th bra -LRB- same bra being sold -RRB- I have bought in the past few years and I love the bra . I am a 38dd and most bras make me look like I have 2 watermelons . I love the fact that the bra actually makes you look smaller and firmer , not to mention a sexier cleavage . I have not had sizing problems like other reviews I have read . I feel the reason why in some cases were there are problems with sizing is that the bras are made of a lacey material and there is no give like other spandexy bras , washing and hang drying is a must . I must add being the bra is not as stretchy the support is excellent !
 This is not the first messenger bag my teenager has had but it is the best . The size is perfect for books , papers and stuff . The materials are very durable without being stiff . And it looks really cool !
 Basic black bag with side water-bottle holder that has trudged through grad school , internships , and moving across three states . Holds up extremely well considering the abuse it has been put through ; color is drab black with internal grey flap - but that is its only flaw . Bag does not have much `` shape '' to it - which may account for its ruggedness .
 Socks stay up and do not look all that thick but you can feel the cushion ! work great for standing all day on your feet at work
 I got these for my husband who loves , loves , loves them for work ! As a matter of fact , everyone in his office loved them and bought a pair too ! They are durable and wash super easy . And they look good too !
 These pants fit great -LRB- I have a straight , non-hippy frame -RRB- . Only problem is they fade pretty bad . Run true to normal jean/pant size . I 'm 5 ' 8 &#34; and lenth is perfect .
 I really like these pants . I bought them to replace the standard issued junk pants work pants that fit like they were modeled on a piece of plywood with two 2x4 's for legs . These pants are a great , comfortable product .
 Excellent work clothing , quality garment , proven to be very durable . Propper has a reputation for these feature which drove the purchase . Definitely well earned !
 I GOT THIS PANTY FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT !!!!! SHE LETS ME WERE IT AS WELL !!!!
 The bag is pretty much as represented - it 's larger than I expected and could hold -LSB- as an example -RSB- the Dungeons and Dragons Player 's Handbook - three or four times over.However , the fabric at the mouth of the bag is very stiff , so when you initially get it , it will not close all the way . I suspect it 'll take a week or three to get the fabric malleable enough to actually close the backpack.Still , looks very sturdy and well-made .
 What can I say ? It 's a tee shirt . The quality is excellent and it has withstood numerous washings with no noticeable fading or shrinking . It gets the desired reactions .
 I had tried this bra before in my normal size of 42DD and found that it did not fit well and the narrow shoulder straps dug into my shoulders . So I was very surprised that by going to the next larger cup size both the fit and shoulder strap issue were corrected . This is now one of my favorite bras and is the most supportive soft cup bra I have ever worn .
 I measured myself correctly according to Lady Grace 's site . I 'm sure it 's just one of those things where everyone 's body is different , but I had to have a seamstress friend reduce the cup size for me . The straps wo n't stay up to save my life , so that 's the big problem . Otherwise , the sides hold up well with the stays and are very wide . It 's only mildly uncomfortable in terms of the fabric not being soft enough . They discontinued this bra . Grab one if you can find one online somewhere !
 I tried this holster after using another one that was simply too big to properly retain the tools . This one , on the other hand , is just about right . The scissor slots are just about perfectly sized , and the retaining strap makes certain they stay in place -LRB- I have a pair of paramedic shears and a pair of bandage scissors in mine -RRB- , and the two front slots will easily fit a pen , penlight , or _ very _ slender clipped pocket knife -LRB- I have a Kershaw `` leek '' in mine and it _ just _ fits -- you wo n't get a Spyderco in here -RRB- . I usually keep this holster in a gear bag , so it must retain the tools in every direction while the bag 's being tossed around . So far , I 've had no problems whatsoever . This holster is n't a great option if you need it to carry a larger knife or a multitool , but for two pairs of scissors and two pen-shaped tools it 's just about perfect .
 Fantastic shirt . The printing is excellent and the quality of the shirt is top notch . Never thought I could replace my very worn Damage Inc. shirt . Now I can keep clinging to freshman year of high school . Please note that if you wear this shirt , you should at least know Metallica 's history pre-dating the `` Black '' album .
 This shirt exceeded my expextations . It 's made of this heavy cotton material and it 's a bit heavy compared to other shirts . Came within 3 days of ordering and it 's worth your money .
 I bought this shirt for my boyfriend , and he was extremely pleased with it . He had it back when it first came out , but of course that shirt is long gone , well now he 's got another one . Thanks again .
 As a lifelong metalhead there is NO better band than Metallica ! I only wish the guys had n't wasted Jason Newsted like that . I have a Masters in Psychology and Jason certainly could have got `` to the place where they were at '' I think the Oz Man got lucky getting him . Sallyjp8 .

 This shirt is amazing , the product arrived in time and form . The colors are great , the material is 100 % cotton , I am very happy to have bought it.Esta camisa es increible , el producto llego en tiempo y forma , los colores se ven geniales , el material es 100 % algodon , estoy muy feliz de haberla comprado .
 I bought this shirt for my daughter . I like it so much , I 'm getting me one ! Why could n't band shirts like this be this easy to obtain back when I was growing up ?! Kids do n't know how lucky they are nowdays ! , B.
 The shoes are really great and the quality is really good as well . The only thing that was n't quite right is the color of the shoes on the picture . The inside of the shoes on the pictures look more red , but in reality the inside is more of an orange color . But it is n't a big deal to me.I was really -LRB- positive -RRB- surprised by the seller . The shipping was extremely fast and the customer service is outstanding ! I have no problem recommending this seller to others !
 I bought 2 pairs of these wrestling shoes for my 2 sons that wrestle . They say the shoes are very comfortable , get good traction and breathe well . I like that they look nice , are durable and they do n't smell after they are done wrestling . They still look like new , even after the season is over .
 I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE ITEM I ORDERED & I RECEIVED THEM VERY QUICKLY ! I WOULD RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN .
 My son love these shoes . He is in 10th grade and they are love by all the kids in the school .
 Very good product , everythin I was hoping for . I am always a bit nervous ordering online as you never know what to expect ... I am very satisfied and thank you for a good quality wrestling shoe at less than half the cost of purchasing it in a store .
 I bought these for my son . He is a Varsity Wrestler for our local high school . He loves how these shoes fit , and also loves how he can grip the mat better than his old shoes !

 I was looking for one of those gaiters that stretches and wraps every which way . This one is not one of those , in case you 're looking for one like that . Information like this would have been useful to me before buying the product . I could have saved even more money by purchasing this product at my local camping store if it was really what I wanted.It is a good product , nonetheless . It is not , however , standard military issue which I think was actually advertised . The other type I described is .
 I bought this for a friend and she says she likes it . I wish I had purchased one for myself .
 I have been wearing this at work for 3 years . It works great . It is fairly thin while still being warm . Since it is thin material , it will roll up easy to put in your coat pocket.My one small complaint is that after using it for a couple years , the seam in the back had to be stitched as it was starting to come apart . As much as i use it though it was not entirely unexpected . And putting a few simple stitches in it made it look like it was still fairly new as the material itself is fairly strong and resistant to wear and tear while remaining flexible .
 This is very warm for cold weather for about 30 minutes . I stayed repeatedly in 0 degree weather and this kept my neck and face warm for about 30 minutes . If you need to spend longer than that outside I would recommend something heavier.The length is a little short . I wore a jacket with a very high collar so it was n't a huge deal for me , but if your jacket does n't zip tightly up to your chin try and find something longer .
 I use this in cold months on my motorcycle ... the material is nice and thick and warm , but just wish it was a bit longer . Otherwise it 's a solid gaiter .
 Perfect for my husband who rides the motorcycle in winter and summer . Blocks all wind that come up under his helmet to his neck .
 The items were fine , but they were all shipped individually and arrived and different time spread out over a 4 week period . The item was not what i expected though and i returned them . The return was hassel free
 This was a really high quality pair of Jones Pants ; which I love . They came right away , packaged neatly .
 I have been purchasing this Brief for years and I will never get tired of it or move to another one . Okay , maybe that is lame because different , sometimes better Briefs come out in the Market , buy why change something that works for you PERFECTLY & is still available ? I have always been pleased greatly with this item and will continue to purchase it , where I can find it . Some department stores quit carrying this particular one but I keep searching . It was nice to find it here at Amazon.com !
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 This dress shirt has been a wonderful summer dress shirt for me as it 's nice and light weight . It does wrinkle a little , but water spots -LRB- or sweat -RRB- seems to evaporate rather quickly and it breathes nicely . It also has nice color and retains nice shape over time.I give it a four as not many shirts attempt to be summery & lighweight , and I imagine this one was n't intending for that either . It seems to not be quite as nice other dress shirts out there . But it is a nice shirt and I 'm often complimented on it when it is worn .

 These are my favorite burp cloths ! The size is large , they 're super soft and super absorbent . My baby spit up quite a bit when younger and this would do the job without getting soaked like other thinner burp cloths . And , I love that it 's organic . Baby is now 7 months old , and they are still in great shape ! And , I love that they 're a neutral color .
 The Bumkins Organic Cotton Burp Cloth are made of very good quality . We purchased them , as well as , the matching Bumkins Organic Cotton Bibs and we love them both .
 I love these burp cloths ! I registered for them before my daughter was born and they have been on heavy rotation ever since -LRB- she is now 2 -RRB- . We have not had any problems with falling apart or fraying . I am going to get them as a shower gift for my sister-in-law who is expecting in February . LOVE THEM !
 I purchased these 3 months ago and use them daily . I have found them to be durable . I like that they are soft and absorbant . I just wish they were a little bit bigger .
 I had registered for several different kinds of burp cloths and received Gerber , Carter 's and these ... These are the best . They are the most absorbent and the softest . Carter 's are cute , and Gerber was cheaper , but these are DEFINTELY worth the extra money . Plain , but totally functional . I highly recommend !!!
 These are my favorite burp cloths . They are so soft and absorbent . Shape drapes easily over shoulder too .
 I own the wash cloths , and one hooded towel by bumkins . This burp cloth is great . It absorbs better than most other cloths , and is a great size . I use it often now , in place of the wash cloths that I used to use all the time .
 Durable , cute and organic . The best burp cloths I could find and they are WAY better then cloth diapers for messy burps .
 I bought these for a family with twins . They wash very well and have made it through many messes . I would recommend them .
 Larger than a washrag but smaller than a standard trifold diaper . These are well made , the satin edge is a nice touch .
 These are pretty nice burp cloths , certainly better than cloth diapers . The color of them is different than what shows ... they are really more of an organic , unbleached coffee and cream color . The satin ribbon is cute , seems durable . My only con is I wish they were larger , when you drape them over your shoulder there is n't much coverage and I am afraid the baby will `` miss '' the cloth . But you can say this about ANY burp cloth ... which is why i will buy a bunch of cheap receiving blankets too .
 These burp cloths are the perfect size , soft and absorbant . My daughter tends to make a mess with her bottle but these burp cloths keep her sleepers clean during feedings . Larger and softer than a washcloth which is what we were using before we bought these .
 I ordered this top years ago and just now realize I have n't reviewed it ! Great quality and shape , and through the years it has worn wonderfully . Nice and warm and the logo still looks great .
 Color was true to picture . I do wear extra small tops , and this one could really be labeled XXS as it is on the small size . Next time I think I would order a small instead of XS . Many thanks for having a cotton cardigan in XS size ! Not as soft as other fine gauge cottons .
 This sweater is comfortable and goes with lots of shirts . A good buy to wear to work . Not too heavy , so good to layer .
 I just love this sweater . The fit is very flattering . It is so comfortable and not too `` heavy '' .
 Mid weight . Bottom hem of shirt needs to be ironed so it does not flip up . Fitted , nice buttons , good quality . I purchased the grey as well . Would be too thick for summer .
 I bought this sweater for my Mom for Christmas . She is very petite and it is the perfect cut for her size . She loves it and the color is just beautiful !
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 Hat shipped fast , fit to specs as described . The print is true to uniform.Brim a little stiff , needs shaping .
 this is an awesome product . i utilize it to the fullest extent and recommend it to everyone to purchase now .
 I 'm in the military and will be comparing these to the patrol caps received as standard issue at basic training . I will be referring to these as RC -LRB- Rothco -RRB- and the issued caps as OI -LRB- Original Issue -RRB- . First , the brim on these RC caps is outstanding . They 're firm yet they can easily be flexed to your desired curvature . I could never manage this with the OI caps ; it would always tend to flatten out on its own . The velcro on the back is fine . The fabric on the RC caps is noticeably thinner than the OI caps . I prefer the heavier fabric of the OI caps but you may not . But by far , my favorite thing about these RC caps is their fit . I had to give the OI caps constant attention and some serious tweaking every time I put them on just to avoid looking like a combat baker or tactical train conductor . These RC caps require no extra worry and look fine when donned like a baseball cap . This is a big plus factor for me.Hopefully this will help someone out there .
 I bought this because my boyfriend is in the Army and I wanted a hat like his because I really like them :-RRB- This is the exact one he has , I just bought it in a smaller size . Great product for a cheap price !
 My Son is into anything camo , and he had found a cap just like this at a flea market , and instantly fell in love with it . I decided to look around online for one instead , and to my surprise found it here on amazon . This one is even better then the first one as it was brand new -LRB- tags on -RRB- had the map pocket and had the velcro on the back for the name strip . It was an instant hit ... too bad amazon did not have the name strips ! But all in all a great purchase .
 I have bought 2 of these already , they are great caps , they are made in china but very nicely made , i have worn mine every day for a while now and many machine washes and the digital camo is still very sharp -LRB- no fadind in the wash -RRB- and the sewing is all still perfect , good product for the money .
 This is the exact Army issue . Even has combat cap stitched on the underside . It 's cheap , and GI issue . Shipping was extremely slow though , I have no idea why but it took 8 days to get from NJ to Texas . Ordered on the 25th received on the 3rd . I have ordered things from China that did n't take as long . Either way , it 's a great cap and glad I got it .
 This style of Digital camo hat was hard to find . My Grandson wanted it , so after looking everywhere , I checked Amazon -LSB- should have known to look there first -RSB- of course I found it there . It was sized well , looks good & made of good quality ! We received it quickly . This is a very nice looking cap !
 Top quality product , well made , issue-type . Brim very sturdy , hat has velcro strip on rear to attach to field jacket if wanted .
 Great price , great product , same as buying it on base - the sizing of the cap is close to that of a fitted ball cap , it also has velcro on the back to stick it to your uniform - would recommend this to friends
 i got a medium it was way to tight but i put a slit in the back and its good now its really good looking and it has map pocket its like a pouch in the top of the inside of the hat id recommend getting it
 This product is everything I was looking for including a ` map ' pocket . It does have the ` Velcro ' receiver on the back panel as needed/required . You will look OUTSTANDING with this patrol cap on the drill floor . I would recommend this to any military personnel or military enthusiast that wants to have the same item used by the U.S. Army . The ACU camo pattern is - perfect .
 Fits a little snug but overall is amazing , love that it has a little velcro spot in the back for your name or rank .
 I got this bag for a gift for my husband and it is wonderful . He has a very classic sense of style , and has always carried an attache case . I was worried of his reaction , but he really liked it . It fit everything he had to throw at it and still had room for more . The leather feels soft and of high quality . The color was exactly as shown in the picture . Over all I am very satisified that I made the correct choice in this purchase .
 This dress shirt has been a wonderful summer dress shirt for me as it 's nice and light weight . It does wrinkle a little , but water spots -LRB- or sweat -RRB- seems to evaporate rather quickly and it breathes nicely . It also has nice color and retains nice shape over time.I give it a four as not many shirts attempt to be summery & lighweight , and I imagine this one was n't intending for that either . It seems to not be quite as nice other dress shirts out there . But it is a nice shirt and I 'm often complimented on it when it is worn .
 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA
 This pacifier is so cute and could make anyone laugh . I bought it as a shower present for my niece , and there 's nothing like getting pictures emailed to you with a sweet baby using this bink . It 's a great little gag gift to include in a present for a new mom , especially if you tease the new mom about Twilight .
 Everyone found this so funny ! Great if you want to draw attention to your baby .
 This pacifier was the best part of my son 's Halloween costume . We got so many compliments on it . It is so much easier than putting a baby in a goofy costume they do n't want to be in .
 We 've had our Lil Vampire pacifier for a week now and my daughter loves it ! It was supposed to be for Halloween but I just could n't wait . After a week of being dropped from a highchair , being chewed on , slept with , thrown to the hard wood floor and stepped on , I can assure you that it is well made and durable as well as adorable , funny and slightly creepy -LRB- especially at 3AM -RRB- .
 This is my son 's favorite pacifier . He 's 17 months old . He loves it and we always get compliments on it .
 This pacifier is for a child over 6 months . It is my grandson 's favorite and I had to order multiples .
 Everyone looks twice when they see the pacifier and then laugh . It 's great if you want to draw attention . Anatomic , my two year old is still using it .
 Great shoe , high arch , great bottom . Grips all surfaces.Very very comfortable feel.Comes with good laces , they stay tied all day.Soft feel while worn .
 Maxit is Under Armour if Under Armour was a watch company only turning out high quality , low production , Swiss-made time pieces . It is just a superb clothing company with top of the line professional grade products . This shirt is no exception . I was suprised at a performance shirt with 70 % cotton . Usually that means not very good performance . But Maxit makes it work with this shirt . Excellent wicking with the comfort of cotton.The shirt has a curved bottom , is true to size , and is one of those rare shirts that can be used very comfortably in both hot and cold conditions . With the clearence prices on Amazon this is a very good buy . Note at least when I have ordered Maxit items on Amazon from Maxit Designs as a seller the more items you buy the better price per item shipping . $ 5 for 1 item , $ 6 for 2 , $ 7 for 3 .
 This a great product for it 's price , Not as thick as I would have hoped but otherwise awesome !
 This roller bag is quite sturdy , and it 's convenient that there are back straps to carry like your traditional backpack -LRB- not recommended if you have the entire thing filled with heavy books , of course -RRB- . A few downsides : - the back pouch is larger , but it has been difficult for me to fit in anything in addition to my 12 '' wide , 1.5 '' thick laptop , 2.75 '' textbook , and a 3 '' binder.-if you 're not used to rolling around a backpack on the ground , you have to be somewhat conscientious about your turns around corners because it does n't maneuver sideways - and that 's not fun when you 're lugging around a ton of books in that , in addition to carrying a traditional backpack with more books -LRB- I 'm a nursing student with a plethora of books and supplies -RRB- . - it is taller than it is deep - problem that will cause issues with stuffing multiple large textbooks into .

 It is very nice . . the problem is that it shrinks after u wash it the first time . . make sure u order the next size to yours . .
 I was shocked when I received my first order of these . Excellent quality material with good craftsmanship . These are better than many $ 30 polo shirts.I bought 4 more .
 I bought 3 of these and they are absolutely a great find.Don ' t know what Blumkin 's problem was , but these are worth 40.00 each.Will buy more of the others now.Collars stay nice and flat after washing .
 Bought 3 for myself they were wonderful . Came back for 4 more for gifts . Spent 9.99 ... people think I spent 30.00-40 .00 .
 I bought this outfit and I just love it . I have never worn anything as comfortable as this outfit . I just love it . Its very comfortable and you can wear this item many ways.Just love it .
 Some years ago my sister sent me some Gold Toe socks as a gift . They lasted for years , and when I needed new socks , I asked her to get me more Gold Toe socks for my next birthday since they do n't sell them where I live . I was so glad to now find Gold Toe on Amazon . So glad , in fact , that I just ordered FORTY pairs for the adults and near-adults in my family . Need I say more ?
 The necklace is made with real freshwater pearls ; the way they are strung is really flattering and much more unique than the average string of pearls . They are so pretty , I wondered if they were n't real , but checked , and they are . I get many compliments on this piece and have taken to wearing it everyday . It looks MUCH more expensive than it was , and I 'll gladly purchase from this merchant again .
 This outfit was a favorite . So cute . So comfy . The only thing that was disapointed was how wrinkled the flowers on the shirt were after washing . Totally adorable though , lots of compliments .

 This is a great jacket made with quality fabric . It 's the crisp , shiny kind of wool , not the itchy , fuzzy kind . The three-button design and the sculpted fit suit my frame well . Great blazer for tall guys .

 Great for a parrot head party OR for lounging in the tropics . Have just tried mine in the party setting but hope to do the tropics some time in the future .
 I bought it for Crazy Friday at work.There is n't a day go by that someone does not comment on this awesome shirt .
 Love this shirt . The bright colors have held up , and it is part of a rotating collection of similar shirts that get used on `` Hawaiian Shirt Fridays '' at work .
 It 's a great shirt . Made in Hawaii and has beautiful , vibrant colors . Unlike many Hawaii shirts I see in stores on the mainland , this one does not have buttons up to the collar . It gives you the excuse to show your taco meat hairy chest and gold chains .
 My husband like tropical comfortable shirts.I bought this for Father 's Day & he was very pleased .
 Apart from the fact that this shirt fits me snuggly -LRB- I 'll order a bigger size , no problem -RRB- , this shirt is awesome . I where a size M comfortably in Island Shore Brand Aloha shirts but I bought a size M of this shirt and it is actually pulling mildly at the shoulders . I feel that a Hawaiian shirt 's shoulder seems should actually rest comfortably below your shoulder . For reference , I 'm 6 `` 3 and 200 lbs and generally wear a size L but like I said , I was mislead by the sizing of another brand ! These would probably be considered `` true to size '' . Heads up!The coloring is very well done , bright and contrasted . You will be surprised at the level of detail in the design , and the cotton fabric is quite smooth and comfortable but I could see it becoming a bit warm for actual tropical weather .
 I needed an Hawaiian shirt for a party - ordered this one - it 's very colorful and came right away .
 I bought this for a Max Payne Halloween costume I want to do this year . Im 5 ' 10 '' and weigh about 200 lb . and I got the large and it fits perfect . Great quality and I ordered the free shipping and it came way sooner than expected . I will definitely wear this all the time , its a great shirt !
 I got this for part of my Halloween costume , this shirt is the exact same one max payne wears in Brazil .
 My boyfriend loves Hawaiian shirts , so I had to get this when I saw it . It 's so bright and colorful , he loves it . I docked it a star because it 's not very soft at all . . But maybe after some wear , it will soften .
 AWESOME SELLER ! FAST FRIENDLY SERVICE ! SHIRT IS SUPER < SO SUPER I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE ! BUY FROM THIS SELLER AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED !
 This shirt came right on time , exactly as described . Perfectly parroty . I would recommend this product to anyone with good taste .
 This great shirt is actually made in Hawaii , where all Hawaiian shirts should originate -LRB- seriously who wants a Hawaiian shirt that 's made in China?This shirt is made right , and it all shows in the details , there is actually a front pocket on this shirt , and yes it 's almost impossible to see it because they actually took the time to line up the design on the pocket with the rest of the shirt . This is one sweet shirt .
 The bra fits well , with the exception of the straps falling off my shoulders and hanging low if not lifted periodically while wearing .
 Been buy them at store in my home town but have been to happy with the owner . Glad i could find them here . Thanks
 Wear it everyday . Makes me feel sexy . I love the feel and show it off under my white TEE Shirt when shopping
 My daughter is on a weight loss journey of enormous magnitude , and this has been the bra with her as the bust line gets smaller and smaller . The support lasts for months before needing a new one , and it looks great . Sometimes it is difficult for a large busted woman to get the right level of support needed to keep those gals pointing in the right direction . This has been a dream come true keeping the gals up high . The straps are comfortable and do not dig into the shoulder leaving those icky grooved , and there is plenty of support along the back . I have never been happier with what this one offers my daughter . Thank you so much for providing a wonderful bra !
 If you have worn Goddess bras your whole life , like me , and could n't find a replacement until now -- this is it . I even heard that the cutter from Goddess changed to this company.I have a very small band size -LRB- 32/34 -RRB- and huge breasts -- I could never find a bra that fit much less supported me while active . Some woman at a bra shop actually asked me , `` What do you like about the no-stretch straps ? '' Ummmm -- they do n't stretch ! This bra is for those of us who need to run around , jump , climb and not flop all over the place -- this is REAL support . Yes the style is pointy , yes the straps are wide and you 're not going to wear this with some skimpy top -LRB- not that those of us this size could ever find a skimpy top to fit us ! -RRB- This is a supportive bra with a size range to fit those of us who need it.THANK YOU ELILA JACQUARD!PS -- If you are going by your old Goddess size , you will need to go up in the band size and the cup size -- their sizing is different . I ordered one , sent it back and then got the correct size . Good luck to all busty ladies you out there !
 I 've had this bra for a year now and am looking to order a replacement . I was very pleased with how well it fit my chest and the support it offered ... especially after ordering online without having tried it on in a store . I agree with the poster that commented about the strap cushions not staying put and sliding around . At times the loose end of the strap will work its way out of the cup also and is annoying . My main complaint about this bra , however , is the metal clasp on the strap . It tends to dig into my right shoulder -LRB- which is my heavier side -RRB- and then the strap slips and falls off my shoulder at times . Maybe it digs in bc I have it adjusted too tightly for the weight it is supporting ?? Overall though , it really is a good bra . Also 37 years old , it seems very old-ladyish , but gives me the support I have n't found in other bras my size -LRB- 46H -RRB-
 This bra is very comfortable for a support bra . The straps are the type where you adjust them and they hang down into the bra . You ca n't tell this from the image , and considering I do n't like this type it was a huge turn off at first . Yet , unlike others these straps do n't slide out of the grasps after a while , so that is a plus . The cup size is exact , I did not have to send it back , and the no roll band actually does not roll ! The shoulder cushions slide all over the place though , and are annoying but when they are in place they feel great , no bra burn . Overall a really good support bra for us well endowed females .
 Great bra with excellent support . Material a little hard , but by far the best bra I have bought so far.Thanks
 beautiful shape , wonderfully comfortable . All in all , a perfect undergarment ! I love that they have a wider range of sizes , so you can find one that fits perfectly no matter your size . I will be buying more of these !
 This is the only bra I will buy or wear again . It is so well made and actually holds up my large chest . The straps do n't budge which is great . They have metal clasp in the front to adjust the length you prefer and then it snaps right into place and stays there . Thats not an easy task for some of us with large chests . I highly recommend this bra .
 Product was exactly as described , great service and received it super fast , w/in days of ordering ! Would definitely order again and reccommend it to anyone !
 The musical design on the umbrella was nicely designed and printed . The umbrella is good quality with a reliable auto open/close mechanism . Good sized umbrella when open and folds up into a convenient , compact size .

 I bought 3 of these and they are absolutely a great find.Don ' t know what Blumkin 's problem was , but these are worth 40.00 each.Will buy more of the others now.Collars stay nice and flat after washing .

 I had ordered a costume from another company in sept , and they had waited untill 3 dayd before halloween to tell me they were sold out , so in a panic I had found 3 wishes who were able to send me the exact costume I wanted in my size and at a much better price with only 3 days to spare . My costume arrived before i thought it would and I ca n't say enoughf good things about there outstanding customer service I highly recomend shopping with them . Unlike other companys who shall remain nameless they do n't advertise merchandise they do n't have so what you see is what you get and I realy am happy about my purchse I will be returning to shop with them very soon .

 What better way to show your love for Bruce Lee than by wearing the image of Rock Lee , Masashi Kishimoto 's homage to him ? The keychain is about 3 and a half inches tall , and surprisingly is made of rubber.The likeness to Rock Lee is spot on.I 'd recomenned it , if only for the pure dork factor .
 Sturdy handle and wheels . Like the fact the backpack straps are hidden . Good size for younger students that do n't have a lot of textbooks to move around , but for older students that have to move around a lot of textbooks it might not be big enough . Liked the brown backpack , it makes it very easy to find among many backpacks . Wish it had a few more pouches with pockets for pencils and maybe a webbed and zippered pouch for coins and whatnot . Still new so do n't have an opinion on durability .
 If you have worn Goddess bras your whole life , like me , and could n't find a replacement until now -- this is it . I even heard that the cutter from Goddess changed to this company.I have a very small band size -LRB- 32/34 -RRB- and huge breasts -- I could never find a bra that fit much less supported me while active . Some woman at a bra shop actually asked me , `` What do you like about the no-stretch straps ? '' Ummmm -- they do n't stretch ! This bra is for those of us who need to run around , jump , climb and not flop all over the place -- this is REAL support . Yes the style is pointy , yes the straps are wide and you 're not going to wear this with some skimpy top -LRB- not that those of us this size could ever find a skimpy top to fit us ! -RRB- This is a supportive bra with a size range to fit those of us who need it.THANK YOU ELILA JACQUARD!PS -- If you are going by your old Goddess size , you will need to go up in the band size and the cup size -- their sizing is different . I ordered one , sent it back and then got the correct size . Good luck to all busty ladies you out there !
 I 've had this bra for a year now and am looking to order a replacement . I was very pleased with how well it fit my chest and the support it offered ... especially after ordering online without having tried it on in a store . I agree with the poster that commented about the strap cushions not staying put and sliding around . At times the loose end of the strap will work its way out of the cup also and is annoying . My main complaint about this bra , however , is the metal clasp on the strap . It tends to dig into my right shoulder -LRB- which is my heavier side -RRB- and then the strap slips and falls off my shoulder at times . Maybe it digs in bc I have it adjusted too tightly for the weight it is supporting ?? Overall though , it really is a good bra . Also 37 years old , it seems very old-ladyish , but gives me the support I have n't found in other bras my size -LRB- 46H -RRB-
 This bra is very comfortable for a support bra . The straps are the type where you adjust them and they hang down into the bra . You ca n't tell this from the image , and considering I do n't like this type it was a huge turn off at first . Yet , unlike others these straps do n't slide out of the grasps after a while , so that is a plus . The cup size is exact , I did not have to send it back , and the no roll band actually does not roll ! The shoulder cushions slide all over the place though , and are annoying but when they are in place they feel great , no bra burn . Overall a really good support bra for us well endowed females .
 Great bra with excellent support . Material a little hard , but by far the best bra I have bought so far.Thanks
 beautiful shape , wonderfully comfortable . All in all , a perfect undergarment ! I love that they have a wider range of sizes , so you can find one that fits perfectly no matter your size . I will be buying more of these !
 This is the only bra I will buy or wear again . It is so well made and actually holds up my large chest . The straps do n't budge which is great . They have metal clasp in the front to adjust the length you prefer and then it snaps right into place and stays there . Thats not an easy task for some of us with large chests . I highly recommend this bra .
 Product was exactly as described , great service and received it super fast , w/in days of ordering ! Would definitely order again and reccommend it to anyone !
 The bra fits well , with the exception of the straps falling off my shoulders and hanging low if not lifted periodically while wearing .
 Wear it everyday . Makes me feel sexy . I love the feel and show it off under my white TEE Shirt when shopping
 My daughter is on a weight loss journey of enormous magnitude , and this has been the bra with her as the bust line gets smaller and smaller . The support lasts for months before needing a new one , and it looks great . Sometimes it is difficult for a large busted woman to get the right level of support needed to keep those gals pointing in the right direction . This has been a dream come true keeping the gals up high . The straps are comfortable and do not dig into the shoulder leaving those icky grooved , and there is plenty of support along the back . I have never been happier with what this one offers my daughter . Thank you so much for providing a wonderful bra !
 Calling this a thigh slimmer misses the main nice feature of this product . The sculpting band around the waist smooths and slims your waist and yet is comfortable and looks good . The thigh part is fine but I also like this product without the thigh part . Unfortunately , I ca n't seem to find those on Amazon ! I would recommend these to anyone who wants to fit into your jeans more easily !
 I had to get a bag w / enough support and room for many books ... -LRB- nursing program -RRB- . It 's held up pretty well so far w / no problems and I have to drag this thing thru street n rocks , conrete , & brick . Its only been a month but its held up great and I get alot of compliments in it being so different and cool lookin .

 I 've had shirts custom tailored for me while overseas , often with fine , imported fabric . These shirts , stitched in Vietnam , rival the best custom shirts . The collars are extremely clean looking , and lay down well . The ` tonal diagonal ' fabric has subtle darker pistripes every 1/16 '' and , every 3/4 '' , a diagonal angled row of slightly raised , slightly lighter stitches . Hard to describe ! But from mirror distance it is highly professional , not too showy look . Also comfortable looking , as well as to wear . I also like the long tail of the shirt to prevent pull outs . I am on line today to order several more of each . I prefer the tonal diagonal myselfbut presume that fabric and tailoring are of similar quality across the line . -LRB- The French cuff variety if this shirt is a real bargain . I recently paid $ 80 for a similar shirt , and am not highly impressed with the fabric . The 60-40 blend makes the shirt relax a bit more than the all-cottons one I have . -RRB-
 I think that it is a pretty nice shirt for 10 bucks . Something comparative at K&G would run between $ 15 and $ 20 . It has a $ 45 tag on it , and I 'm not sure about that - but for a good daily dress shirt I 'll but 5 more of them .
 If you are looking for fine wearing apparel let me give you a tip.Cacharel is one of the top clothing manufactures in France.My wife is from Paris France and I was a what you could call a clothing enthusiast -LRB- Freak -RRB- in my younger days by spending up to 30K a year on only the best clothing . Now that I am 57 and got away from the more finer apparel I am happy to have found these Cacharel men 's dress shirts . At first I was a bit leery if these were in fact real Cacharel . Tonight I picked up my Amazon.com package containing my three dress shirt and open the box was was very happily to see that they were indeed Cacharel.I open and tried one on to see how it looked . My wife said that it fitted great and she loves them.Now I am going back to see what else I can find to buy of the Cacharel 's . Lol ! do n't worry if you did not believe this review as I do not wont to have them run out of stock before I buy as many as I can . ; -RRB- Amicalement , Toney BurkhartSan Francisco , CA

 I bought this scarf about a year ago , and immediately fell in love with it . It is indeed very soft , it 's longer than many scarves , but not too long . It also does n't get `` pilly '' right away like so many fabrics .
 My wife loves this . She always carries it with her . It is very light and quite spacious even though it is small . The color is quite bright , though .
 recently purchased this item for my gf , and she loved it . great vintage look , and much attention to detail . the service was top notch and shipped quickly . would shop again , thanks world of good !
 This bag is beautiful ! I love the story behind it , and it is not only great quality -LRB- as a student , everything tends to get destroyed -RRB- but the cell phone pocket is wonderful , and it 's large enough to fit my notebooks and everything . And it 's so beautiful and intricate that I take it out as an evening bag as well . Great find !
 Love my Sari Tote -LRB- i have the blue one -RRB- and never fail to get compliments every time I carry it . I really like how it combines an ethnic look with a very practical design .
 These shoes have a elegant look to them and they could be worn with most outfits that require a little class . And they are padded for comfort . I am very happy with this purchase . And as an added bonus
 cute - functional bag for the price - when you do n't need to carry much
 I like the adidas +10.7 's because they are very light and durable and they are also very comfortable on the feet . You get very good traction , I have n't slipped for the time that i have had them they are great in wet and dry conditions . I would deffinatly recomend these for soccer .
 My son ordered these cleats -LRB- with my permission -RRB- after shopping around . He knew what he wanted , but he waited to find a reasonable price . The cleats arrived quickly in tip top condition . I am very satisfied with this purchase .
 they are really nice , they fit great but they are really thin so when you get stepped on you really feel it
 Very nice soccer shoes . Comfortable , good quality.The cleats are not changable . I suggest use it on grass or soft ground instead of hard ground .
 Excellent seller , everything developed with normality and the product is the original one and very but very well

 The wig is the only downside to this costume . It is flattened and does n't want to style when you receive it . Outside of that , great costume and worth the purchase !
 Arrived in the nick of time , it fit , and I loved it . Perfect for a Jane and George duo , which we are !
 This hat is honestly one of the very cutest things I have bought for my daughter thus far . Everyone comments on it wherever we go and thankfully , there is plenty more room for her to grow into it!It 's been machine washed and dryed several times with no problems . No fading , fraying , shrinking , or pilling.Super cute !
 This is such a cute hat ... My daughter looks so cute in it ... Ca n't wait for the weather to cool off so she can wear it out !
 works better than I expected and even better with the calvin klein logos on them
 This product is great . My son looks so cute in his muscles . One thing is that the mask is not very sturdy . It 's acutally pretty cheap . But the rest of it looks great .
 My 4 year old absolutely loved this costume . We gave it to him for his birthday and he was extatic !
 I bought this as a gift for a three year olds birthday . He is power ranger crazy !! He wears this suit EVERYWHERE and I do mean everywhere . Mom takes it off at night to wash it so it is ready for the public wearing the next day . He is thrilled .
 My son loved it . Very well sewn and good quality . Usually my son takes off face masks because they bother him ... kept it on all night because it was comfortable .

 I enjoy this sarong -LRB- as a drapey scarf -RRB- , and the print is just fun . It 's light-weight , which is nice on warmer days , but that 's also a problem -- I accidentally tore one corner just trying to detangle the fringe after I washed it the first time . Since then , I have n't had any problem with it and have enjoyed wearing it -- I just keep in mind that I should treat it a bit gently -- not hard to do and well worth it . But I 'd want it to be a little sturdier to give it 5 stars .
 I buy shirts for my husband very often . This is definitely a very good shirt you can get for under $ 10 . I 'd guess it retails for around $ 35 . Excellent packaging and fabric quality . Note

 Product was exactly as described , great service and received it super fast , w/in days of ordering ! Would definitely order again and reccommend it to anyone !
 The bra fits well , with the exception of the straps falling off my shoulders and hanging low if not lifted periodically while wearing .
 Wear it everyday . Makes me feel sexy . I love the feel and show it off under my white TEE Shirt when shopping
 My daughter is on a weight loss journey of enormous magnitude , and this has been the bra with her as the bust line gets smaller and smaller . The support lasts for months before needing a new one , and it looks great . Sometimes it is difficult for a large busted woman to get the right level of support needed to keep those gals pointing in the right direction . This has been a dream come true keeping the gals up high . The straps are comfortable and do not dig into the shoulder leaving those icky grooved , and there is plenty of support along the back . I have never been happier with what this one offers my daughter . Thank you so much for providing a wonderful bra !
 A thank you to Massey 's Outfitters for having the cobalt color in stock , it is very beautiful and bright without being obnoxious . I normally walk to work -LRB- night shift -RRB- and I am confident that even in the dark and rain I will be very visible to drivers in this jacket . It is very lightweight which I appreciate as I will be moving overseas in a few months and will have to leave a lot behind , but not this jacket . The jacket goes . I am 5 ' 6 '' , 33 '' waist , 36 '' bust and carrying some extra weight -LRB- 156 lbs -RRB- so I bought a medium . Even with the extra weight I 've gained , I will still be able to fit a micro puffer jacket or sherpa hoodie underneath this rain coat when the weather calls for it .
 Marmot knows how to cut a jacket . It was one of the few I tried that had good hood coverage . On other coats -LRB- REI , Patagonia -RRB- , the hood dipped over my eyes , or sat too far back on my head . The only alternate I considered was North Face . I opted for this as I was traveling to the rain forest and needed feather-light gear . It kept me bone dry as I hiked through Costa Rica downpours . Only downside -- white stained easily . Zipper pocket broke on first wear .
 I buy shirts for my husband very often . This is definitely a very good shirt you can get for under $ 10 . I 'd guess it retails for around $ 35 . Excellent packaging and fabric quality . Note

 This shirt is thin and cool ... great fabric for wicking away perspiration while you work out or play sports . XL runs a bit small compared to traditional XL shirt sizes , so if you like your shirts a little more roomy , order size accordingly .
 My girlfriend loves it . She can sport her team spirit with a little bit of sexiness . She loves the detail on the red piping and straps . It says New York Giants in red embroidered letters .
 I probably have this bra in about 5 different colors , and its super comfortable . Its very supportive , it lifts and separates so to say . The great thing about Freya is that it makes a wide range of bras for girls who are large breasted but narrow chested ie . 32G . Not all girls who are large chested are over 36 in the chest area . The only negative about the bra is the ribbon at times can be seen through thin shirts and if its cold outside , well it shows because the mesh the bra is made of is thin . Despite both of those I would get the bra again in a heartbeat .
 I got professionally fitted and the associate brought this to me . Originally I was n't planning to spend so much on a bra , but it looked so beautiful both in and out of clothes that I just had to have it . Now that I know my perfect size I stock up from Amazon.This bra gives excellent support . The shape goes more forward , instead of either pressing together or going sideways . I noticed that my figure looked much better , and I looked slimmer with the great lift . It 's very sheer , and a bit lacy so it 's not for t-shirts , but other than that it is my go-to style . I love the plunge neckline so it does n't show under my v-necks . I always love pink and black . It 's so sexy and flattering , and my husband loves it . Worth every penny !
 I just wore this for the first time yesterday . it is absolutely gorgeous . Totally sheer -LRB- the person who said hers was not sheer must have gotten a different one - I got the back and pink . -RRB- It looks wonderful and sexy but by the and of the day I was in agony - It may be that the size was n't quite right but the under-wire was stabbing me on both sides all day . I spent so much time trying to tuck my dress under it to protect my sides . I felt like I was being skewered.I will wear this bra for short periods when I dress up but it is not going to work for me for daily use . Too bad because I love the way it looks on me .
 I wear a 38H , so pretty bras that have support are hard to come by ! This bra is beautiful , it has also has good support ! Happy with my purchase thus far .
 A really pretty bra , that handles the girls well ! Yippee , a company that makes gorgeous bras for big-busted women !
 Perfect fit and comfort ! Most important in a bra . liked it so well I ordered this same bra in another color . Ca n't ask for more than that .
 This bra fits really well and it is very pretty . Freya is the first brand I have found to fit me properly and I have since bought several more in different styles . I bought 36G -LRB- label says 36F because they are in UK sizes -RRB- . The wires sit nice and flat on my breastbone , which I have never found another brand to do . The only complaints I have are that the underarm side of the wires can get a little pokey and the fabric sometimes feels rough on my skin , even after washing . The fabric never really softens up like other brands of bras . On the other hand , the `` girls '' are always where they are supposed to be ! Not for white T-shirts .
 It looked sexy in the picture & it is even sexier on me . My husband noticed it and that says a lot !
 Being tall but not fat I have job finding good fitting jeans . These are great - colour very pleasing , quality excellent - one happy chappy .
 I love these Jeans . I like them , because they streach and that makes them sooo comfortable . What else can I say .
 My size changed and these jeans fit perfectly I am completely with them and intend to buy more of them .
 I wore these for years back in my working days and loved them.These are happily the same which pleases me very much.The fit is perfect and the stretch makes them quite comfy.They will shrink a bit but will stretch back out again .
 This is a good buy for this price.I do n't think this is of great quality.Color is little different than you see on screen but not much an issue.I will recommend .
 My husband has purchased the same size and style # for years in the retail store . They are VERY hard to find . When he saw these on Amazon , he decided to order two pair . As I stated , they are the same size and style number , but had to return them and order a size larger . Why ? I have no idea . Great price !
 As I said in the title , they just fit . And stretch jeans are much more comfortable to wear than regular jeans .
 These are the best fitting jeans I have ever had ! I have a 42in . waist but most jeans of this size have way too much room in the seat and legs which I do n't need . These jeans are also very comfortable even when new . I will buy more of them in the future .
 USE FOR MANY YEAR FROM THE PANTS LEE , FOR MY TYPE OF WORK , I HAVE NEVER HAD PROBLEMS , THE USE AND ABUSE THEM . THE SHIPMENT WAS DELIVERED ON TIME AND GOOD PACKAGE TO RECEIVE , WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM . TRUST IN LEE .
 After purchasing David Taylor stretch jeans for several years for my husband and finding each year that both the colors of the fabric and quality of the jeans have drastically deteriorated , I went in search of something better on Amazon . I was so glad to find these well made jeans with nice choices of colors and a style that is both `` HIP '' and comfortable . The fact they are stretch jeans is not evident by the fabric and my husband is extremely pleased with the fit .
 Very comfortable pair of jeans ... recommend all buyers to buy ... will be satisfied with the quality of the pair . Expected the pair to be more stretchable ... but can work with it . Superfast delivery and customer service .
 My dad has used the same model and brand jeans from thy kingdom come and he was so happy when we found these jeans because he does n't see them in stores anymore . Great buy in his eyes too old fashioned to me
 Add these to your cart and you 'll never regret it ! I was wanting some dark denim without artificial wear or distressing , but I have a long torso -LRB- high rise -RRB- and short legs . Since Levi 's decided to change the fit of the 505 , I had to look around . Finally , I remembered the jeans that I wore in junior and senior high
 These Lee stretch jeans run a little small , order one size larger in the waist than you normally wear . You will be hooked ! They arrive fast and ready to wear . Also excellent value . I am wearing mine now and ordering another pair .
 My husband really likes to wear Lee Regular Fit Stretch Jeans everyday . They move with him and do not cling when he gets hot and sweaty . They are quite comfortable .
 These jeans are at least for me the best fitting jeans on the market . I have tried every brand including Polo , Levi , Hilfiger etc. loose , baggy , stiff or just do n't fit the way jeans should fit . One review said they run a little small but I am over fifty and that is the way all jeans used to fit . Jeans should fit tight . I hate the loose baggy ass look of some jeans . Relaxed fit means you are too fat to be wearing jeans . It 's like having a relaxed fit bikini , anyone that needs one should not be wearing one . You may think someone over fifty should not be wearing jeans but if you still have the body it 's okay . If you do n't have the body jeans will never look good no matter what your age .
 great look , great fit , nice and soft almost like jeans you 've had for a long time
 Standard looking Lee jeans , but they have a bit of stretch . They fit me great and even when new they feel like they are already broken in.As somebody has already noted
 Here it is , short and sweet
 The Lee Stretch Jeans that I order from Amazon are alwaysexactly what I wanted . And , the delivery is on time too.Hey , where 's the bad !!!
 I 've tried buying jeans locally and have tried every brand availably locally but can not find a brand that feels or fits better than these Lee jeans . The little bit of stretch in them must be the difference . I have been buying them online for years as I ca n't buy them locally . The price is right , the quality is fine and I will continue o buy them online .
 I have been purchasing and wearing the Lee stretch jeans for over 20 years and any other jean just does n't fit right or feel good .
 Very well pleased , it was the jeans that i have been hunting for a over a year in the local stores . Thanks
 Pants are a perfect fit and better price than most retail stores . I love the fact that they fit so well since I ordered them on line .
 Typical Lee product -- cut well , good fabric , strong zipper . I 'd have preferred a little more stretchiness , but they 're good pants .
 The order arrived right when the seller said it would . When it arrived it was held secure in an envelope . The keychain looks great , the fabrics used for the text and outline are bright . The stitching was done very well , and the keychain feels well made , and sturdy . Very good job by the seller .
 Nice hat . Not the highest quality , but still worth having . Minor grip -- wish 2007 Series was on it . Price was great . Shipping and handling was prompt and fair .
 MUY BUENOS PANTALONES LA TALLA FUE LA CORRECTA SIN PROBLEMA EL PRECIO MUY BUENO Y SIN DIFICULTAD EN EL ENV&Iacute;O DE LOS MISMOS
 My husband has worn these work pants for along time and he likes them alot . They last so long . And are easy to wash .
 bought these pants for work and they are great . comfortable , strong , and durable . plus buying them online was much cheaper then at retail store .
 Sure , they 're just work pants . The brand is not well known in Australia , particularly with the older folk . But I tells ya , they are extremely comfortable , at least after they have had a wash or two . Fit is perfect , and the price , look at the price !!! I 've ordered two more pairs . I am soo mad that it took me to I was in my 50 's to discover Dickies . I intent to be buried in these things .
 Can not believe the pants I ordered , on time , and the best pants I own for the work I do -LRB- retail receiving -RRB- I will be ordering more !
 Arrived as expected and were exactly what I used to buy in the stores before they reduced their inventories and no longer offered the color and size I need.Thanks Amazon.com
 I 've worn Dickies pants for years and honestly I can not find a better quality of work pants . The price is great , too , since I also do n't have to have any alterations done to them ... an additional savings bonus .
 love these . bought these for years . they hold up and amazingly , stains come out pretty easy in the wash . look good enough to wear on or off the job!i love dickies pants !
 Price could be a bit better . Dickies quality , so good or bad depending on your opinion of Dickies . Color does n't fade .
 I love these pants ; Dickies are the best . The quality and durability are long lasting . Will definitely buy again soon .
 worn and washed several times , used for my job onboard a ship for 6 months . no color fade , very rugged . they dont quite fit like regular wranglers though . a regular work pant .
 Blue collar jobs require some comfort level . I have an average build and this pant fits me well in all sorts of positions . Whether squatting to pick up a heavy object or climbing across blocked off areas to get merchandise , this pant gives me ample room . If you have thicker thighs , that might be a problem . After 10 + washes , it 's still rough . I do n't mind though . I normally wear a 30 L and it should be fine but this one seems to ride up on the back of the shoe . It did n't shrink or anything after the washes but it just needs a tug to get it back down after going up stairs . Maybe I 'll get the 31 L next time . The waist was fine . Big plus is that my sweat does n't show through under the waist line for some reason . That 's good because w / my old pants , once the sweat dried , it would leave a white residue on my backside .
 the original 874 is a little too big on the thigh , so it look a oversized pant on me.the quality is good .
 Ca n't find these work pants very many places . And when I do find them the size that I need is never there ! I can decide which type and the shortest length that I need . I have short legs and women 's dickies do n't work out for me ! I 'd always recommend dickies work pants !!
 I 've been wearing Dickies for 10 years now and they are still as stout and well fitting as ever . In these pants you will not be confused with a hipster . The fit is baggy overall , they look dressy but they 're cheap enough that you can work in them like they were jeans .
 My Hubby has wanted this dark color for a long while . These are well made and should last him for years .
 Dickies are the best pants ever ! Affordable , durable , and stylish - never going back to over priced jeans and chinos again
 I wear these for yard work and rehabbing houses . Hold up much better than my normal Khakis . The waistband is uncomfortable until washed a few times , but it keeps your pants up when working . Only gripe is the front pockets could be deeper . Concealed carry users will be disappointed.They also look good enough when new that you could wear them for more than work situations . Fit true to size .
 My husband has worn these pants for years to do his gardening and other outside chores . After many washings they are soft and these pants are very durable .
 great pants just fine good price i enjoy them to work in and wear casually they are great so that is good thank you
 This was a Xmas gift for my son-in-law which he said fit him great and he loves to wear them
 My husband looks so cute in these . I bought them for him for work . He 's constantly ripping holes in his front pockets from pulling tools and pens in and out , but so far , has n't had any problems with these . The flat-front is very attractive . As some other reviewers mentioned , the waist fits snugly . I took a chance and purchased my husband 's usual size , and he actually likes the way they fit . It took him a few wears to break these pants in , but he 's very happy with them . I expect that they 'll outlast the brands he usually purchases .
 These are the only pants my husband is allowed to wear at work . They are made well ; durable material that does n't fade with regular wear and washing .
 nice pants , i ordered 5 of them , different colors , , for gifts for Christmas , , my son is happy with them also , i would recommend this product
 My son loves the jeans . He told me they fit well . Great to wash and wear . They hold up very well .
 These pants are excellent work pants . My husband has a very physical job and these pants hold up very well .
 these are excellent working pants ... i gave the 4 stars because my only complaint is that htey run a bit tight on the waist . i would advice if you are a 38 waist , order them 40 and it will be an excellent fit . I have washed the several times and the keep their form and havent shrunk . Great Deal .
 Very pleased with order . Dickies 874 pants - very good quality . Contacts about order equals A + in Customer Service . I will buy again ... thanks !
 Great for work , sturdy material . I 'm always getting dirty , dark color hides the dirt . Matches well with navy work shirt .
 These pants are durable and professional and i love em . I wear them for work and I 've actually gotten compliments on them .
 this 874 is now my standard working pants that the quality is damn good and also the style is just fit my body .
 What can you say about Dickies . A classic brand for the workman . Reinforced knees and crotch make sure proper lifting techniques -LRB- with the legs -RRB- do n't rip or ruin the trousers . heavy fabric in the waistband also make sure a belt does n't deform or ruin the waistband . If you 're a working man you need a pair of Dickies , nuff said .
 My 16 year old son will wear only Dickies traditional work pants . This is cool because they last longer than most jeans and cost a little less . He says the cell phone pocket models are a looser fit , so he wo n't wear them and sticks with the traditionals . The only wear problem he has is that the front pockets tend to get holey because he jams his wallet , cell phone , and keys all into his front pocket . Sometimes I have trouble finding his skinny size , 30x32 , but am usually able to find them online . They come out nicely from the wash , and if you choose black like he does , you do n't have to worry about any stains.Peace out , Ed 's Mom
 I believe that these are the best-looking , longest wearing pants you will ever find . I bought them for my nephew to wear in a very hot and greasy commercial kitchen , hoping they would be as good as the Dickie medical uniforms I used to wear to work in a hospital . They came through with flying colors ! They wash and dry like a dream , with no shrinkage , very little fading , and no wrinkles - even after 10 or more times through the washer and dryer , with my nephew mostly washing them in hot water . I would highly recommend these pants to anyone .
 I work in a warehouse that deals with super heavy freight -LRB- I do n't remember the last time I picked something up that weighed less than 100lbs at work -RRB- . Anyone that works freight/shipping/package handling knows that sometimes it can be very brutal on pants . The main area where most pants break is right at the crotch . This is caused by the proper lifting technique of using one 's legs instead of one 's back to lift a load
 My son wanted a pair of `` crimson '' Dickies to wear to the Alabama/Auburnfootball game . The only place I could find them was through this seller on Amazon.com . He loved the pants , the seller was great , the price was great ... perfect transaction !
 Thse are great pants.Better for hot weather than cold ... they are thinner than jeansNot baggy , not tight.I were them for mechanic work & they are just fine.They do not have a button wasteband . They use a metal hook . I like this better . It is easier than a button to fasten and more durable as well
 Good pants with the Dickies look . They do run small , I normally wear 32 '' waist in every brand under the sun except Dickies . I ordered 34 '' waist and they are perfect . I wish they were low rise on the waist because they come up to my nipples , but that is what you get with this brand . Just keep your shirt untucked so you do n't end up looking like Dustin Hoffman in Rainman . I bought them for the style so I do n't plan on using them as they were intended -LRB- work pants -RRB- so I have no doubt they will hold up . I have another pair in black I wear at the office -LRB- during the winter months - too hot for summer -RRB- and they are great . They wash up nice , never shrink and NEVER need ironing ! Good stuff over all .
 I received my pants very quickly and was immediately impressed . I got the Charcoal and they are a very nice color , sort of a dark grey , exactly as advertised . I had heard some reviewers say the pants were thin material , but I ca n't DISAGREE more ! These pants are hardcore , tough , stiff at first , but i can already tell they are going to loosen up a little bit . I am certain after a few washes they will be less stiff . Overall , great pair of pants , seems they will last a long time , they are dressy enough for business casual and the price is right ! In summary
 These workpants are long wearing and are a good value . They are available in a variety of lengths and waist sizes .
 I bought these looking for a more classic style in something that lasts . These fit the bill . The waist to inseam is longer that many modern pants so make sure that is what you want before ordering .
 The material was actually a lot tougher than I had imagined it being , but that was only a good thing . Very happy with the purchase .
 I have had Dickies pants/shorts on and off since high school . I used to skateboard much more than I do now , and find that these are quite durable . The regular 874 pants have the best fit out of all the other selections available . The only thing I do n't like is they attract lint a little too much .
 It resembles the classic khaki , but is a different fiber and is tougher , but a bit scratchy at first . It is also full cut and comes in a full range of sizes .
 Dickies makes a quality product . The fabric is super durable , comfortable after a few washes , and the cut of the pants is classic . I purchased two pair for my husband and he claims that he will never buy jeans again - they just do n't compare to Dickies when it comes to durability . The waist measurements run a little small , so I recommend ordering one waist size larger . Luckily , my husband had already discovered this before I ordered these and the next size up fits perfectly !
 These pants were a perfect fit - exactly the size as ordered , and exactly what I was looking for in a work pant . They fit snug but not tight and not baggy . The length was exact . It is nice to buy a pair of pants that is the size the label says . The pants are made of a seemingly durable fabric but are a little stiff at first . They become softer after a few wearings and washings . I expect long service . .
 I am happy with my order . the pants are perfectly cut , i did not even need to hem them . the fabric is very good quality . i recommend those , and i will by this product again
 The reason I purchased these pants is that my employer actually supplies uniforms through a uniform company . The problem is that the uniform company only does even numbered waist sizes . I wear an odd number waist size so I purchased the pants hoping they would fit right and also because they had the exact color as my work uniform . The pants arrived and actually fit very well . The only problem I encountered was the price , It 's a little high compared to Walmart which offered the pants about $ 5.00 less per pair . The reason I did n't purchase from Wally World is that they did n't offer the right color to match my uniform . Overall I 'm very happy with my purchase .
 I bought these pants for my son 's high school uniform pants . It 's a good shade of gray and they always look crisp and sharp with no ironing . Love that . Sturdy fabric means he can play video games on the floor without wearing through the knees or butt . Just wish the fabric was a bit softer and I do n't like having to carefully clip off the little Dickies patch - always afraid I 'm going to tear the fabric . But a great choice for school uniform pants .
 very good work pants comfortable and rugged makes for a maintenance man best part of his or her uniform , the length is awesome .
 Needed pants for work . When I first got it the pants did n't seem to fit nicely , but after washing them it was perfect . Great pants for the price .
 Nice Pant , resistent , easy iron , not decolorized by washing.Very happy with them , I will still buying this for more time .
 Easy to order the size and many colors to choose from . They got here in a reasonable time and looked exactly like they said they would be . Right size , right color , perfect fit .
 They fit right , the right length and are very comfortable . They are very durable . I am wearing them right now .
 Pants are comfortable Wash and wear well . I am a truck driver and I get very dirty and a lot of things to get caught on . These pant are performing well .
 The product is excellent in quality and fair in price . The delivery is prompt . I am a happy customer . I will order another one soon .
 You can not go wrong with classic Dickies . These pants always look like they have been pressed and look sharp .
 I must admit that the pants were very stiff when I removed it from the packaging , but when I wore them I received great comments from people around me . They fit well and I would recommend them without hesitation .
 what can I say about the classic Dickies work pant ? I 've been wearing them ever since I was about 12-13 years old . I 'm 25 now . I incredibly still have some pairs from that time that I 've passed on down to younger brothers or siblings . These pants are durable , comfortable , and long lasting . They are fit for working as well as a casual pant for everyday use.I gave it 5 stars because I enjoy these pants and plan to continue wearing and buying them . However , they are not true to size and vary a little . It is best to try them out in a store rather than buying them online . I have bought a couple online and 1 is too tight on the wait , another is too big , one if just right , one is really tight and small everywhere ... regardless of them saying the same size ...
 I purchased these work pants for my husband . He wears Dickies brand work pants everyday at his work . I like them because they never need ironing after they are washed . I like to order them from Amazon because they have more colors than the stores where I live . I would recommend these pants .
 I bought these for a retired neighbor who only wears permanent press work-type pants . They fit him nicely & they look freshly pressed even after wearing them all day . The olive is a deep rich green & the material is substantial enough that the pants have a good weight to them . I would definitely buy them again & would recommend them to others .
 My college-aged son manages a super-service car wash and detailing business . He LOVES these Dickies pants and was very happy to get a new pair for Christmas . They 're hard-wearing and comfortable .
 Comfortable pants . I am satisfied . The product is as advertised . Packaging was good . I would recommend to my friends and family .
 Great pants . Perfect fit.Wrinkle freeStain resistant . What more could you want?I do n't know how other people are getting too big or small pants . I have ordered Silver , Khaki , and Black . They are a perfect fit . I always order a size bigger just in case they shrink after washing . I will update if any changes after washing . I would give this a 5 star but I do n't like the clasp closure , I 'd rather have a button . But Dickies does not have 34x29L pants with a button closure.Thank you amazon .
 These are standard run of the mill work pants . The stitching in the rear looks a little weak but it 's still early so we 'll see how they last .
 My husband wears these for work and they last forever . Good quality and durability . - - - - - -
 These pants look good and hold up well when washed . The fit is just as you expect , too . Well worth the price .
 Too large although it is a great product . This is a product I would recommend to anyone . Wonderful customer service . The quality is fantastic ! Even though I have to return for a smaller size .
 They are traditional dickies , what more is to be said . If you want pants you will have for 10-20 years + + , these are the pants for you . I saw rambo walking down the street in a pair of these last week.They are nice because they can be work pants , casual pants , and even dress pants if you 're daring . I got hit by a truck in these pants , and they held up the crash , but where destroyed when the EMT 's cut them off , so scissors/knives may cut them , but not easily.Initially these pants are a bit stiff , but a few washes and a few hard working days breaks them in nicely . Once the pants are broken in they are the most comfortable , durable pants you will find.God Bless .
 Great product , I have ordered 4 and will be ordering several more in the near future .
 These Dickies ` workpants ' -LRB- which are suitable for casual wear as well when khakis are appropriate -RRB- are sized much smaller thatn the same size in the jeans we purchased . Luckily , my husband is quite fit so he could make the smaller size work but they may not work for folks who like to kid themselves about their true size .
 Good price , for the quality of the produced . Fast shipment to get me working . will order again and again . Thanks
 These are very durable . They look nice enough for casual dress and they fit good . For the price , I doubt you can find better .
 These are just the pants I was looking for when I ripped through two pairs of jeans during home projects . They are sort of stiff right out of the box , but after a wash are fine . After 10 washes , I 'd be okay lounging around the house in them
 These are excellent work pants . They are durable and do not require any other attention besides washing . They get ironed every couple of washes to maintain the pleats , and hold nice pleats for about three wash cycles .
 We ordered a set of Dickies work pants because they are tough and long lasting for many different applications . I still wear pants from 10 years that are in good shape , just faded from excessive washing .
 I really enjoy these work pants . My job requires me to dress up ; but having sturdy work pants makes being in an industrial area good . Amazon 's prime shipping is easy and they sale for a great price .
 I ordered two pairs of Dickies Men 's Original 874 Work Pants for my husband . Upon arrival , the pants had a very strong musty smell . I put both pairs through two wash cycles and then dried them . Problem solved.The initial odor problem aside , the material and workmanship of the pants are outstanding . The wide variety of color choices and sizes are much better than those offered in local stores . I was especially pleased to be able to find them in dark brown , in addition to charcoal grey.The pants fit perfectly , look great and are very durable . They never wrinkle and come out of the dryer ready to go , absolutely no ironing required.It 's wonderful to find products like the Dickies Men 's Original 874 Work Pants that are being made as well today -- using the same high quality , heavy-weight permanent press material -- as they were years ago.I was so pleased with these pants that I ordered two more pairs , in black and khaki , a week later . They arrived without the musty smell . My husband loves them .
 I 've been buying Dickies work pants for my son for years . They wear well , wash well , and generally need no ironing . They 're great as working pants , but when necessary , they can be dressed up too . He is tall and thin -LRB- 32 x 34 -RRB- and prefers the traditional style over the one that accomodates a cell phone .
 These are the excellent durability of typical Dickie work pants . I ended up getting a few pairs of these Dickie work pants -LRB- black -RRB- for a school uniform , they are superb . BTW , a tiny trick for parents of uniform students
 Great product and fast shipping . I W \ will buy more later . Material is sewn together well . No frays at all . Durable fabric that will stand up to some rugged use .
 These are great work pants . Jeans are not an option and Dockers do n't hold up to the wear . Glad I found these !!!!!
 These are very durable pants . My son has been wearing them in one form or the other since 1st grade . Now in the 9th grade , they 're not just durable , they 're pretty fashionable too . Seller shipped them out in a timely manner .
 I love that Dickies pants are available in `` odd '' sizes . As a short , slim guy it makes finding comfortable and well-fitting pants very easy . My only complaint is that these pants do run small . I normally wear a 30 or 31 waist and ended up buying a 33 waist . The return/exchange was easy . In fact , it was much less hassle than returning them to my local mall!The pants themselves are sturdy and tough . They straddle the line between looks and function - I can wear them everyday for work but they still look nice enough for a family dinner . They are great for people with kids , being easy to clean and extremely stain resistant . I wish the pockets were a pit deeper but that 's about all I 'd change .
 This is the 2nd time I 've ordered this product for a friend . She likes the overall quality and price of the products . Items arrived exactly as requested , service excellent .
 This brand of Work Pants are extremely durable.I can attest to this because I have been wearing a pair for 2-3 work days weekly for the better part of 15 years and they 're still in good functional condition , though they look pretty shabby .
 Purchased these pants for my retired farmer father . He always wore dickies for his daily attire and of course being from old school habits he does n't like change . The original/traditional dickies are hard to find . But of course if you look long enough , you can find almost anything on Amazon . He is totally satisfied & loves the pants . They are great , good quality and all .
 We have used this same work pant for our service business for many years . It always looks neat and wears very well . Size is right on . Best of all , they really are `` no-iron '' , if you pull them out of the dryer right away . This is the best price I have found anywhere . I highly recommend the Dickies Mens Original Pant for a professional look and excellent wearability .
 These pants are fantastic . I got them to be used as a cheap alternative for mountain bike pants when the weather is colder , but they turned out to be so much more . I use these pants for everything . They are work pants , chill pants , biking pants , and even look good as casual pants with the right shirt . Dickies quality really shows with these pants . The only small negative is when they come they are super stiff . It looks like when they are manufactured they dip them in a vat of starch . Solution for that is just to wash them once or twice before wear and they 'll be all set . I 'm 6 ' 1 '' and 180 lbs and I ordered the size 36x32 and they fit perfect with a bit of extra room in the waist just the way I like them . These are billed as work pants so be mindful that the sizes do run a bit on the small side . I can usually wear a 34 waist , but I always size up with `` work '' clothing since they seem to run small . So if you want them to be comfortable and not on the tight side I would recommend sizing up one size .
 These pants are a work horse of a product . They are durable and stand up to daily grease and grime . Stains come out easily and last through many washes . Good product .
 I work outdoors in thorny bushes , and these pants have held up very well against rips . I recommend buying a waist size larger than you need and wearing a belt ; my pants fit snugly but the metal clamp that buttons the pants has bent from too much use . Oh well . Another thing I feel like I should mention is that these pants get totally soaked instantly by any water , but dry very quickly . So if you get caught in the rain they 'll dry out much quicker than jeans .
 I really like Dickies work pants . It 's hard to go wrong with these . The material and workmanship is tough enough to wear in the field , and the look is professional enough to wear in the office . The only thing that keeps these pants from being five stars is the fact that they take a while to wear in and get comfortable . When they first arrive , you will notice the fabric is fairly stiff and a bit scratchy against the skin , but after they 've been worn and washed a few times they soften up and get comfortable . You will find the fabric and colors are nearly identical to some lines of Dickies work shirts as well , which is nice if you need a uniform look .
 This order is just right in size and color.They are a light weight , easy to care for.They look good on my man also .
 I got these pants for my new job working in a warehouse and they are perfect . The only complaint I have is that they run a little snug in the waist .
 These pants are perfect for best wear and work . My Husband loves them . he wears them every day and every where .
 Exactly what I needed , cheaper than the retailer , fast service ! Will definitely use again and will refer friends and co-workers to .
 i thought these pants i bought for my son were well made and i particularly like the heavy duty zipper front
 Dickies Mens Oringinal 874 Khaki Pant in Dark brown size 33X32 was a perfect puchase for my son . Great fit and very happy to find this style in the color brown .
 Let me start by telling you that prior to ordering these from Amazon , I ordered the exact pants 1st from Kohl 's and then from Walmart . They have a greenish cast so I kept returning them . I actually chatted with Amazon who assured me they were tan . They arrived with the same green look -LRB- depends on the lighting -RRB- as the others . My son needs tan color for work but apparently , ran into no problem wearing these . I ordered the same pants the year before with no greenish cast so I do n't know why the khaki color has changed .
 Dickies original pants are the only work pants that last a long time I have found . They are quality built , reinforced pockets , and at the same time comfortable .
 I love Dickies , and this pair is what I expect from Dickies ! Great quality , great fit , great durability , great color . I will be buying some more soon .
 They are well made pants . I usually wear a 34x32 pair of jeans , but a 38x30 -LRB- or 32 -RRB- pair of Dickies . If you know your Dickies size , you 're set . These are the pants you want .
 Dickies is known in our household for making quality products . -LRB- nurse & construction worker -RRB- These durable pants do not disappoint .
 I got this for my teenager son who just started working par time . He loves it . He likes the starched and wrinkle-free pants .
 I would definitely recommend these pants . They fit well and the color is great . We buy Dickies pant a lot for their durability .
 I have mostly praise for Dickie 's work pants
 I bought these Dickies work pants , we used to call them &#34; chinos &#34; in the 1950s , do n't ask me why.Ok so they are comfortable and light to wear not heavy canvas pants which is what &#34; bluejeans &#34; really . You walk around in heavy canvas pants or dungarees and wonder why your legs get tired so easy ! DA ! Anyway I woke up and now I will wear light workpants like Dickies and relax . I do recommend these to anyone .
 I needed a good pair of work pants and these filled the bill . I often work outside and these dry quickly when rained on unlike denim . As with the other dickies ive owned in this style , the clasp that takes the place of a button in the front will give out before the material does . That may be because the they last so long that my belly outgrows the pants and the clasp bears most of the brunt .
 I ordered these work pants as a Christmas present for my nephew after Sears , surprisingly , screwed me up by not having them in stock , so I went to Amazon.com and sure enough there they were . Received them in a few days , even though I ordered them late , and he was delighted because these are the work pants he always wears and it was time for a new one . Trust Amazon to come to my rescue . Should have gone there first .
 The pants were a bit stiff but very sturdy . Due to the stiffness the inside seams were uncomfortable rubbing the inside thigh area but did get better with washing for a period of time .
 Cheapest price researched . Product is new and looks nice . Very good buy for the money .
 It is hard to find pants for my son , but Dickies have pants that fit , wear well , and cost a fair price .
 Our 2 year old son loves Big Bird and I was disappointed at the lack of costumes available and was n't real crazy about this one , but decided to give it a shot . It 's actually really cute in person and the size 1-2 fits him perfectly -LRB- he 's about 27 lbs and 35 '' tall -RRB- . I read another review where they said they had a hard time keeping the head upright , but that has n't been a problem for us . I think it 's a cute and functional costume for a little kid . It 's easy to put on and take off and since they wear their own pants changing a diaper is easy .
 I buy shirts for my husband very often . This is definitely a very good shirt you can get for under $ 10 . I 'd guess it retails for around $ 35 . Excellent packaging and fabric quality . Note
 I love this wallet!Not to mention it 's cute - you would n't be reading this if you did n't already like Betty.It is lighter than most wallets and I really like that the main paper money part is open on one side so bills are easy to flip through . It is surprisingly durable , I wear my stuff out quick and have had this wallet for 2 years now.It also holds loads of credit cardsNote
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 This off the shoulder mini dress is super cute ! I like the way it fits and it makes me feel sexy . The order was promptly shipped too .
 This is a great top . Looks great with jeans . Very sexy . However , the sizes run a bit big .
 I wear skirts and dresses often and I have always liked to wear full slips with them . These days full slips are hard to find . Vanity Fair slips have always been my favorite brand . They are comfortable and look good . They hold up quite well , too . Thank you for having them available !
 I always love to wear a full-length slip , because it hikes up when your skirt or dress hikes up when you lift your arms . However , the little plastic strap length adjustor things are not really grabbing the thin silk of the strap very well , and the strap lengthens just a little over the course of the day .
 Very pleased with merchandise.Material is high quality and generous fitting.Would be glad to recommend this item
 I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early . The package was in excellent shape . I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip . The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected . I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black . I wish there were more color options than just black and white . I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them .
 As in the past , Vanity Fair slips fit like a dream , just make sure that you check the Vanity Fair sizing chart -LRB- size on lable is not bust size -RRB- . It feels good under a dress that requires a slip . I could n't be happier with the quality of the product .
 When it comes to Valentine 's Day , I 'm not looking to get my wife one of those teddies or chemises . I just want to get her a regular , white slip , with lace at the top and bottom . Vanity Fair delivers with this product , a very sexy item .
 I 'd recommend this if you need a basic slip . The shoulder straps are adjustable and the lace lining around the neck may be layered nicely with a low cut top . The only drawback is a personal one . At 5 ' 5 , 145 lbs , size 10 and pear-shaped , this slip * just * fits my frame , and there is a tiny bit of an awkward pull at the hip area . Next time I 'll order a 36 for more give .
 This is a very nice slip . It fits well and is the right length -LRB- a little above the knee -RRB- for most of my dresses . The shoulder straps do fall down at times during the day as the plastic adjusters slip down , but can easily be re-adjusted . I have that problem with most slips so am used to it . I had an old slip just like this one and it was falling apart with age so this was a replacement . I was happy to find it on Amazon and received it quickly and for a reasonable price .
 This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious , it is just okay . I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer . One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise . At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for , especially in this case .
 This is a good old-fashioned full slip . It 's hard to find these nowadays . This was slightly too long for the dress I had bought it for , but I took it to a dry cleaners and had it hemmed a couple inches and it 's perfect . The detailing/seaming at the bust is a little bit more than I 'd hoped for -LRB- shows slightly through my dress fabric -RRB- , but is only really visible if you 're looking for it . Overall , a good purchase .
 the slip was to small my fault i ordered the wrong size would order again and hopefully i get it right this time
 I am 5 ' 10 '' and purchased the long in both white and black . The reviews are accurate in saying that the long is truly a long , but I love this purchase . The material quality is high and the style is very nice . The adjustable straps allowed me to pull it up , and while the straps do slip a bit , I could easily pin them in place and adjust according to the length of whatever I have on . I am very happy with this purchase .
 Item was sent quickly & well packaged . Item fit as the size indicated , and has held up to multiple washes w / line drying . I would purchase this item again .
 I ordered this slip online because it is getting more & more difficult to find larger size lingerie items in department stores -- especially full length slips . I like the design and material . It does seem to run a little small , but that 's OK becuse I want to lose weight !
 This is a wonderful slip . The fit is perfect and exactly to specified measurements . Excellent value !
 I bought it in a size 40 and I am a 38A bra , but it is still comfortable and fits well .
 perfect fit , and wonder why I have n't had one for so long . non clinging , full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort .
 Honestly , my biggest beef with this slip is that the white looks too white . I would 've liked the nude color in my size and short enough I can wear with the dresses I need this for , otherwise , does exactly what I needed .
 Washes and dries well in the dryer . Stays true to fit and keeps its shape wash after wash . This is the best lace full slip . I will be ordering another one .
 I love it ! It fits great ! and looks awesome ! I love wearing Vanity Fair full slips ! and my wife loves the look and feel !
 This is a very nice , well made slip . I plan to order one in a longer version . Sometimes I want the ease of a full slip under my dresses/skirts . I would recommend this . The slip arrived within a couple of days of my order which surprised and pleased me . I got it just when I needed it .
 The slip fit perfectly . The adjustable straps allowed me to play with the positioning under my dress and the length was on target .
 The cup area was just a little loose and bunchy -LRB- reason it got 4 instead of 5 -RRB- . I like the lace bottom , so if it shows a bit , it does n't look frumpy .
 I love this slip . I bought this slip to wear under my dresses that came to my knees and this works very nicely .
 Got this for my daughter for Christmas - she is delighted with it . Fits well , wears it with pride . She loves it .
 Vanity Fair slips are wonderful and made of excellent quality . They wear well and are very comfortable ... highly recommend them . Very feminine and sexy !!!!!!!
 THESE SLIPS ARE GREAT AND FUN TO WEAR !!!! AS A MALE WEARING SLIPS FOR MANY YEARS i FIND THAT THE VANITYFAIRS ARE THE BEST.THANX TO VANITY FAIR FOR STILL MAKING SLIPS WHEN MOST EVERYONE ELSE HAS DIED OUT !!!
 This shirt is a lightweight jacket but warm . I bought it as a gift for my dad that worked in areas without heat . he found it very useful and comfortable , and plus he did not have to wear his heavy coat to work .
 This flannel lined work shirt should be called a lightweight work jacket . It 's nice enough to go out in , but tough enough to work in . Highly recommended .
 My dad works a lot outside and in cool areas in St. Louis . He said that this shirt will be a perfect outdoor shirt/jacket for when he 's working . Too heavy for regular indoor work , but good for what he needed .
 Really good looking shirt and definately heavy enough to wear over a long t-shirt or button down as a light jacket . It 's obviously stiff right now b/c it 's new but I am hoping it loosens up . It 's the same with Carharrt pants , a little stiff but just a sign the thickness is a sign of the fantastic quality . Ca n't wait til he breaks it in . I like it a lot and hope he does to !
 The Carhart shirt I purchased is very good quality and was less expensive though Amazon .
 We liked it so much that I was n't even upset it was too big for me . It just slipped on my husband as if tailored for him . My one-size smaller came today and it 's perfect ! Warm , cozy , and classy cool .
 This was a gift to my son who is 6 ' 7 '' . It fits perfectly and is really good quality .
 I ordered this as a Christmas gift and was glad to see that the sizing was accurate . The shirt fits , he likes it , it 's warm -LRB- good thing because it 's COLD here now -RRB- , and all is well . Shipping was prompt , packaging was secure . I 'm very happy with the purchase .
 I buy shirts for my husband very often . This is definitely a very good shirt you can get for under $ 10 . I 'd guess it retails for around $ 35 . Excellent packaging and fabric quality . Note
 White elegant shirt for men ... What can be more romantic?This shirt has very subtle but nice embroidery , not in your face but noticeable and clean . The quality of work just makes you wish that all clothes for men would have such quality and be that affordable.The silhouette is tapered and would compliment a fit body.My husband wears this shirt very often . After spending about 15 minutes choosing what to wear tonight he always picks this shirt . I would buy it again .

 Very cute . I would order this product again . Just one thing ... `` berry '' is more of a PURPLE color and not red . The colors seen on the computer monitor are not very accurate which is not the fault of the manufacturer .
 We love this product , it 's stretchy and fits my baby 's head , which other hats do not and it 's fleece to keep his head warm !

 This bag is great , the 4 stars are because it is smaller than I hoped for . It does seem like sturdy but , does not hold quite enough .
 this bag was bought for my 15 yr old son , , thought it was quite efficient and durable for carrying small amount of books on certain days instead of his normal back pack
 My wife really likes it . It 's not that big so you ca n't carry your notepads in it . It 's more like a general purpose street bag . My wife carried it on our trip to Canada . She loves it .
 This is a cute little tote that I bought for my active days with the kids . It was inexpensive and works great . The strap is adjustable and can be used as a crossbody . The body of the tote itself does n't have form which is also great because it 's not a `` little box '' you 're carrying around . It 's like a little backpack purse . It has a zipper and then a velcro flap closure which can be annoying at times but I 'm ok with that .
 I bought this bag before I studied abroad in Europe ... this bag was a lifesaver and I adored it ! It was perfect for traveling - I could keep all my important documents close at hand without wearing an awkward money belt . Because the bag hung over my neck and was close to my body , I never ran the risk of being pick-pocketed . It 's a great size so that you can fit essentials and extras -- I often used mine to carry a water bottle , ipod , cell phone , brush , maps , wallet , camera , my lunch , and more all at once ! As a young traveler I adored this bag and was so thankful to come across it ! It served me well and has now been all sorts of places - New Orleans , London , Paris , Dublin , Edinburgh , the French Rivera ... a great constant companion . :-RRB- Like all Jansport its mostly waterproof which was wonderful for rainy days in the UK . Could n't have asked for better : -RRB-
 I bought a few of these , as well as some of the thicker ones for colder weather . Since I do a lot of hiking and backpacking , this is the best way to go as it keeps you cool and dry and provides enough insulation and to block out the sun 's rays . The material itself feels light as a feather -LRB- hence the name -RRB- and very comfortable against your skin . However , depending on the type of conditions , I suggest going for lighter colors like blue or silver -LRB- if available -RRB- and not black , as even with the lightweight fabric it will still draw too much sun . This has become an essential item for all of my hikes .

 I am very pleased with my coin pouch . I ordered this on a Saturday afternoon , and it was shipped the same day , and it came on Wednesday . Extremely quick shipping . The product itself was exactly what I was hoping it would be . There is a key ring inside , and the metal hinges are covered with leather , so there is no exposed metal .
 I have used this type of coin pouch for years and lost two -LRB- 2 -RRB- in the lastthree -LRB- 3 -RRB- weeks and I was bewildered . Did n't know where I was going to findthem again . Thank to Amazon I found them and I 'm happy again . And thanksto Menswallet for having them in stock .
 I encountered these Italian spring closures decades ago on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley . Occasionally I lost one or a nail came out , and they were hard to replace . These coin purses are the handiest solution you can find . To operate , you have to pour your coins into your off hand . If a nail comes out , you can replace it from a hardware store , try for a tight fit and clip off the point if needed . The springs and leather will last forever .
 I needed a way to hold change and had seen these change purses in the past so i thought id give it a try . It works as advertised . I have had it for alittle over a month and no signs of wear/tear yet -LRB- though I 'd hope not -RRB- . Not much more to say , considering the price you get more than you pay for .
 Have used these coin pouches over time . I travel a lot , so sometimes I lose one . I ordered two this time , one for backup . The seller only sent one , but followed up quickly to send me the second one .
 Items arrived ahead of schedule and were exactly as described . I am very satisfied with the quality of the coin pouches .
 Thank you so much for the speedy delivery . This pouch was wrapped very well too . I was pretty impressed by that alone haha I tested it to see how much it would hold and it seems to really hold a lot of change . My boyfriend is going to be a proud owner of a good quality leather pouch.Again thank you :-RRB- I recommend this product to anyone , especially as a gift to guys .
 Works great and seems like it will last a long time . Stops change from falling through a small hole in my pocket .
 I purchased this for my grandson as a companion piece to his wallet . He makes sure he carries this everywhere along with his wallet . It prevents carrying a lot of loose change and it 's very appropriate for a boy to carry since there is nothing ` girlie ' about it . My dad always carried a change pouch too since he could n't stand loose change jingling around in his pocket , and my grandson enjoys it for the very same reason . I highly recommend this product .
 The squeeze purse is exactly what I wanted , does a great job . I ordered one in black and one in brown . I have a difficulty finding such a product and I received these very fast , excellent service and priced right .
 This is a handy little device designed to stop pants pockets from jingling with loose change . It does what it sets out to do and does it well . This should not be purchased by people missing fingers or by complete weaklings since it takes a bit of ooomph to open it to drop the coins in . If you fall into neither category , it 's a good product .
 I bought it not for coins but rather so I could carry the headphones for my iPhone in my purse and have them be protected . This coin pouch does the trick ! It is exactly what I was looking for . It is small and flat and doesnt take up a lot of room but my headphones are protected and handy at all times .
 I had been looking for this exact coin pouch and was thrilled to finally find it . My husband has had one like it before and really liked it . So I bought three for the men in my family . We really like it . I hope you will find it as good as we do .
 I like to carry my cash in my pocket when possible . A purse is a pain . So this is very nice for a few bills and lots of coins . It 's a bit of a bear to open until you understand how . You open at the sides rather than squeeze . So it does n't actually work the way it 's designed to -- at least not well . But that 's a small issue and this is a nice , well made product that should last a long time . It 's easy on the pocket -- no bulge . And it 's handy .
 I purchased 2 of these leather pouches to carry my hearing aids in . Very inexpensive and well made!Fits in my pocket easily without any edges sticking out .
 There really is not too much to say about this product . It is a classic squeeze leather coin pouch . I replaced an older , worn out one just like this one . The quality of the new one is very good , and the squeeze mechanism is very tight , so nothing will slip out when it is closed . I actually bought two of these , so I have one keep in the drawer as a back-up . My old one still works , but does not look too great , and the squeeze closure does not keep closed too tight , So I hope these 2 new ones last as long .
 This is just a practical little item that helps a person keep organized ; not a one pocket on a fold-up whatever of thirty pockets , just something to keep coins together . Great to have inthe car , the pocket , or the briefcase . Recommend for anyone who hates fishing around for a quarter .
 One of my all time favorite change pouch . I have used them all of my life , they are handy and hold everythingin its place .
 I needed a coin purse that would n't take up much room or let my coins spill out . This one does just that .
 This is a nice coin holder . The top snap closure closes completely so that coins do not slip out . Can also hold a few dollar bills for a quick trip into the store . Feels soft and perfect size . Good for men AND women . I recommend this for anyone looking for a small pocket for coin . Helps keep my purse organized .
 I bought this pouch to hold the coins in my car . It does just what I need it to do . I feel that it is easy to open and close . Overall , it was a good purchase .
 Recently I decided it would be a good idea to keep a set of ear buds as an EDC -LRB- every day carry -RRB- item . I did n't want the ear buds floating loosely in my front pocket because
 Purchased this coin pouch to replace a worn out one . This coin purse is almost exactly the same as the former , except that it is about 1 1/2 inches shorter , which allows credit cards to be exposed -LRB- folding cash not a problem . Good quality purse .
 Squeeze Coin Pouch by North StarI AM WELL SATISFIED WITH THIS POUCH . I BOUGHT IT FOR A GIFT AND IT WAS JUST WHAT THEY WANTED.IT HAS GOOD QUALITY AND IS VERY PRACTICAL AND ECONOMICAL.VERY SPEEDY DELIVERY AFTER ORDER WAS PLACED.THANKS , CHUCK
 I got this for a gift for my dad he loves it ! It 's still in great condition and I received it sooner than expected . Overall , well worth it !
 I ordered a leather coin purse which arrived promptly in good condition . The description of the product in Amazon was quite accurate . I am very pleased with the product .
 Many years ago when I was stationed in Germany I came across a leather coin purse which allowed me to put all of my loose change in a compact pouch which was simpler than having coins constantly swishing around in my pockets . The coin purse is held closed by a spring mechanism which allows the pouch to be opened simply by squeezing it . It closes shut when you release the presure . This coin purse -LRB- pouch -RRB- is similar to the ones I previously owned . -LRB- They wear out after a few years use ! -RRB- I purchased one for my adult son and two for me . They work fine and I am pleased with the quality and the price .
 This squeeze coin pouch is leather that is quality made has strong clasp closure , thin enough to put in your back pocket , they are buttery soft and even smell like leather , so you know it 's leather . I purchase this for my husband and he really likes this coin purse .
 Size is just right to carry pocket change . I looked in 6 stores to find one , but either found none or ones too bulky for convenient use . I also keep two extra keys in event I were to lose my belted key chain clip .
 The pouches are very nice and exactly what I wanted -LRB- except I inadvertently ordered two black pouches and would have liked a black and a brown -RRB- . Thank you .
 My mother-in-law asked if I could help her locate a coin pouch on the internet to replace the old one my father-in-law was still using . We not only found the exact product we needed , I had it shipped directly to my father-in-law in Colorado . My mother-in-law was impressed !
 The coin pouch is well put together . The metal bands holding it closed are very tight which prevents coins or keys from falling out .
 The price was right but the customer service and shipping could n't be beat . If you are looking for something like this I would highly recommend this merchant .
 Wow ! I just got these coin pouches in the mail today and I have to tell you , I was quite surprised by the quality . Considering the inexpensive price , these are a great deal . A bit think on the materials , and stiff -LRB- should loosen up over time -RRB- , these are great not only for coins , but for iPhone/iPod earphones and any other little items you want to carry in your pocket in an organized way . My girlfriend , upon seeing them , wished they came in more color options other than black or brown .
 Some reviewers have commented that this purse is hard to open , but it is n't if you slip your finger into the opening before squeezing.This is a nice little purse which I like for keys but not for coins . For coins I prefer a spiral squeeze purse , but the spiral squeeze purse I bought recently on Amazon was of such a poor quality that I asked for a refund -- and got it .
 Yes the clip is firm and needs a little effort to open , but not enough to give it a bad review in my opinion . No , not for weak hands . Nice quality . Holds coins well . More compact than I thought . Can be used for keys , earbuds or what ever . Made well . sturdy . I bought 2 more !
 Pouch is well made and as described . My only complaint is that the spring is too strong and it is hard to open .
 I got it for my wife and she said she is very happy with it
 Good leather and quality construction . Very happy with this item that would n't be something I would really think of needing but am SO HAPPY to have . Who likes loose change ???
 ... ... ... . . . . ... . ... ... ... C c c c cc c
 I had been looking for something in which to keep my coins and this is a perfect answer for me . I always seem to accumulate a lot of change in my pockets which causes holes in my pants pockets . This little change purse is the perfect one for me and saves my pants pockets . Thanks
 I was trying to find a coin pouch to replace a worn out one.The quality on this one should last a long time .
 The coin purse arrived in speedy time and in perfect condition - very pleased with transaction !
 Coin purse of this kind are hard to find . No one has the time to run looking . I do n't like Ebay because you deal with unknowns . Some are good . Once I got caught.I have always felt safe with Amazon . The product was good , the communication great , the service fast .
 Rather than throwing your change in a coffee can and eventually giving Coinstar 7 % , use this well-made item . It will last for years , holds well over $ 5 in change and keeps coins out of the elusive nooks in your pockets .
 I bought seven of these pouches and use them for various things such as carrying a magnifying glass , carrying camera lenses , carrying the rechargeable flat batteries for my Sony SX260 camera . They are well made and should last many , many years . Do n't continue to squeeze to open and close the leather enclosure because eventually it may cause the metal to fatigue in the spring closure device . In other words it 's not a kid 's toy to be played with to release nervous energy . It 's a high quality small carrying case for expensive items you want to protect . If you need it to carry coins so they do n't damage your pockets and which is easy to retrieve when you need pocket change , this works great . The leather is high quality . The only problem I have is the high cost they charge for shipping and handling . I find that I can now buy the exact same thing at my local flea market -LRB- made in China -RRB- and the cost is only $ 4.00 -LRB- no shipping and handling -RRB- . I think you end up paying about 60 % extra just in the cost of the product due to the shipping and handling . They weigh practically nothing , therefore the high shipping cost is unwarranted . Even so , I liked them so much I bought several .
 This reminded me of a coin purse carried by my Grandpa . I had n't seen one in years . We keep it in the car for meter change .
 Nice product . It is put together very well and I am pleased with this purchase . I would definitely recommend this prodcut .
 I bought this as a gift for a family member whose coin pouch is so well-worn that that closure bracket no longer works . Pleased that this arrived even sooner than expected . Quality is reasonably good for the price.My only reason for choosing four rather than five stars is that the closure bracket is really stiff . I had to use a pen or coin edge to force it open a little , then could use the bracket itself . My elderly family member has less grip strength than I do . So may have more trouble opening it routinely . But hopefully that will ease with use .
 This was a big hit & it was a great gift for my teen . Hopefully no more coins in the washing machine !
 A basic squeeze coin pouch . I use it for my corded phone earbud headset . It makes it easy go get my headset out when I am driving and get an unexpected call . No zippers to fumble with ! It 's not hard so not as protective as one might want for a bluetooth headset but is nice to keep a basic corded headset in and tame the wild ranging cords !
 Got this as a gift . I really liked the quality . I might get myself to keep my change in . Can not beat it for the price .
 I love this shirt . Puma brand is the best . The materials and colors are just like i want it . It looks pretty good with jeans or shorts .
 now as much as i love Bleach , I 'm not quite as in love with it as my boyfriend is . And he simply LOVES his new keychain !!!!! now as much as i love anime . there is a stereotype that goes along with the AMERICAN readers . those ... strange anime kids ... you know what i mean . And this was the perfect gift , because if you have never watched bleach additively you would never even know that the keychain holder was an anime freak !
 While christmas shopping this year I came across this keychain I was a little dispointedLike what I said before I was a little dispointed do n't believe what you see in the picture the keychain is much smaller than it appearsThe design on the keychain is pretty cool and the keychain really is wired and it pretty easy to attach most keychain and other iteamsThe keychain is pretty strong and flexiable I have a naruto keychain , a light keychain , and a Leather I.d. wallet attach to it and there is not sign of weakeness to it
 This is a really nice Reebok Flex Fit hat . Just make sure that you do n't have a big head like me . The hat is very tight on my head , even though the tag says `` One sizes fits all '' . This is a very good quality hat though .
 This is the only shirt my husband will wear to the office . It is well made .
 Its a good shirt and it was delivered on time but you have to be careful where you ball it up or that wrinkle might be permanent . Have it laundered if you can because really who wants to iron .
 I went down the road of looking for higher quality shirts and what I learned along the way may help . First , the quality issue . Shirts would last me about three months and buying these and other brands -- which felt like they were made of thicker material , did n't help . I wrote the date on the tail in sharpie and three months later I noticed wear around the cuff and collar . Switching brands did not help . I was fit to be tied over this issue , I did not want to pay any price for a shirt that lasted for three months of weekly wear . Then I ran across this link -LSB- ... -RSB- and discovered that the dryer was a big part of the issue . Do n't dry your shirts longer than 10 minutes to get much better life out of them . If you are not buying permanent press , do n't have them dry-cleaned . Wash them yourself on the delicate or hand-wash cycle -- or just hand-wash them -- and have the dry cleaner press them . This is going to give you the greatest amount of life out of a shirt.That said , I feel there is a compelling quality and feel difference to these shirts . I 've gotten positive comments on these . So it all comes down to what you are willing to pay and whether what I just said matters to you . Amazon is an inexpensive place to shop for most things , but there are cheaper ways to buy these shirts . That wo n't bring the price down to what you would pay for Arrow or other off the rack brands , but if you want this quality , there are deals to be had.Now for fit . When I started down this road I could never find a shirt that fit me . I am thin and tall and that just is n't what most manufacturers make -- which says loads about what they can sell I guess . Jos A. Bank did n't make a slim fit back then and I even went so far as to have some of them tailored before I left for something less expensive , and higher quality -- which is before I learned not to dry them so long . I never approached nirvana on the quality for cost issue , but other manufacturers did have slim fit that at least removed the need to tailor . Jos A. Bank now has slim fit and they fit better than any other .
 Thought since I respect Joseph Banks brand that these would be superior quality shirts . Quality is satisfactory , but shirts were not as wrinkle-free as I had hoped .
 Was completely satisfied with quality of product and speed of shipment . Would order from J. A. Banks at any time in the future .
 Good quality fabric . Button-down collar stays neatly in place with the perfect allowance for the tie .

 Great product . Lots of my fishing friends that are full-time guides wear this product . It 's not too expensive , keeps your warm and can take a beating . The product seems to run a bit on the big size , but I would n't downsize to a smaller size .
 I have always loved High Sierra products and this one does n't fail to live up to my standards . It is exactly want I have been searching for , a quality suitcase that will hold all I will need for a 3 day trip and qualify as carry on luggage .
 This is the highest quality and best-looking suitcase I 've ever owned ! It 's sturdy and thoughtfully designed . In my opinion , it 's also beautiful -LRB- we got the green color -RRB- . I know that another reviewer said she uses it for 3-day trips , but I find it works well for trips up to 2 weeks . And I 'm not that light of a packer ! It is carry-on size , but only domestically -LRB- in the U.S. -RRB- . Also , I 've been hassled by hypervigilant U.S. airline staff who have insisted that I prove it actually is carry-on size by placing it in that metal-box-tester-thingy . I do have to admit that it looks too big to fit , but it always does !
 This item is really good for the price . The quality of this T-Shirts is also nice . The appearence also looks like some expensive T-Shirts . Thanks for dealsforthisweek website for posting this deal .
 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!
 I ca n't remember the last time I saw an item of clothing with a tag that listed the USA as the country of origin . You can not beat the price and this shirt is 100 % medium weight cotton !
 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 I bought a few of these , as well as some of the thicker ones for colder weather . Since I do a lot of hiking and backpacking , this is the best way to go as it keeps you cool and dry and provides enough insulation and to block out the sun 's rays . The material itself feels light as a feather -LRB- hence the name -RRB- and very comfortable against your skin . However , depending on the type of conditions , I suggest going for lighter colors like blue or silver -LRB- if available -RRB- and not black , as even with the lightweight fabric it will still draw too much sun . This has become an essential item for all of my hikes .
 Mirror works great , its really fog free . Radio comes in some stations , not all but we mostly purchased it just for the mirror . Great price .
 The Shower radio made by Totes very good . Good reception on both AM & FM , easy to assemble and hang in the shower . I highly recommend it
 Duofold makes excellent thermal midweight crew t-shirt styled underwear for those cold , cold days and nights . The 96 % polyester , 4 % lycra fabric is soft and extremely well made . This may be single layered fabric ; but man , how it works to keep you warm!Truthfully , this underwear thermal t-shirt lasts years with proper care . It can be worn as underwear under your outdoor clothes or you can wear it in bed with your pajamas on over it . Whatever way you choose you ca n't go wrong with Duofold thermal underwear.At first the shirt may appear flimsy and floppy before you put it on -- but after you 're wearing it you 'll notice a huge difference . You 'll be a lot warmer with it ! It also does not bunch or wrinkle easily.As for maintenance , I just put mine in the clothes washer and dryer and everything always comes out fine . If you have any concerns about the color of this undergarment `` bleeding '' onto white colored clothing , just wash this with garments that are not white . You 'll be fine . In addition , it shrinks very little . They say it 's odor resistant ; but do n't think you can skip any deodorant -- it is n't a substitute for that!Be sure to check the pricing and availability chart and the merchant sizing chart if you want to order this here.Overall , Duofold makes one awesome midweight crewneck thermal long sleeved undershirt . I have worn this many times now and I highly recommend this product .
 I 've had mine for almost a year now . I recommend it wholeheartedly . I use it for an inside layer when I ride my bike , run , or hike . It fits snug to the body and traps warm air in while allowing your skin to breathe . Sounds like a commercial , I know , but that 's exactly what it does . I do n't wear it in the sun or on warmer days . I 've found that the combination of it being black and the insulating properties can get a little too warm .
 These were thinner than I expected , but I am very glad I got these instead of what I 'd intended.They are thin so they are n't bulky at all , yet they do help keep you warm.And very comfortable .
 I usually wear thermals most the winter as an underlayment of all my clothes . I try to pick out a couple pairs of long-john type thermals a year and try them out . So far this is the second best I 've found -LRB- Terramar Thermolator 2 being # 1 -RRB- . This is very thin so it wicks fairly well -LRB- especially well when you compare to most straight cotton/polyester alternatives -RRB- . It does a fine job at keeping you warm with this and a long sleeve button down I am usually fairly comfortable down to about 55 . It does a good job of keeping the odor down too and can be worn for several days between washes , no problem .
 I ski pretty intensly , and used to sweat thru cotton based shirts . unfortuantely you 'd get pretty cold going back up on the lifts . This product dries quickly -LRB- if it gets wet -RRB- , even under ski bibe and jacket . Odor prevention claim is accurate . Shirt is very light , but keeps you warm .
 I purchased this for my grandson who is now living in the coldest state in the country . He was very pleased with the comfort and warmth provided and I was pleased that it was half the cost of a comparable make .
 Like they said was warm on the ski slopes . Size was good , maybe a little larger then needed -LRB- medium , 165 lbs . 5 ' 10 '' -RRB- . Felt great wearing all day long .
 I have always bought women 's thermals and they end up shrinking and fit poorly . The men 's thermals are generous in size and fit very comfortable and are very warm .
 The men in my life all work outside and need to be kept warm , this product does the trick .
 I bought this shirt because I saw someone else wearing one under a short sleeve shirt & it looked like his arms were tattooed . Kind of cool without actually getting tattoos . I normally wear a large , & that 's what I ordered . The fit is fine for wearing under another shirt , but to wear by itself , I 'd go with an XL .
 Have wore it a couple of times thus far and it seems to do the job but it hase n't been real cold for a true test.Because of the material it feels real cold to the skin when first put on .
 Thermal tops work as advertised . I have yet to try the bottoms , but if they are made of the same material I am sure they will be just as good .
 They are very warm . Have used them for several years . Would not use anyother product . Ready for winter to start .
 I purchased this as a baselayer for winter cycling -- so , I wanted something that would wick moisture , but help keep me warm . I 've found that this definitely does the trick . It is well made out of a comfortable material . I ordered an XL , based on the size charts . The body fits close against me without being too tight , but the arms are about 1 inch too short . Obviously this wo n't matter if you are planning on layering this with other clothes . And if you like a more loose fitting baselayer for some reason , order up .
 Bought sets -LRB- top and bottom -RRB- for both my husband and son and they use them all the time for Boy Scout outings . Great lightweight base layer . The colors look great with their scout uniforms . They have held up well under repeated washings -LRB- line dried -RRB- . Very happy with this purchase - as I have been with all my other Duofold purchases over the years - reliable , quality brand .
 Nice fit . Good for 45 deg F and warmer . For cooler weather , I would not recommend it . Academy has some thermals that work well for cooler climate for about the same price .
 I was looking for a base layer for my daily hikes out in the cold and this product definitely does the trick . I would recommend this to any outdoor enthusiast .
 I bought this a few weeks ago and wore it on a backpacking trip did what I expected whicked away moisture and kept me warm I recommend it .
 these thermals are exactly what i was wanting . they are thin , so , everything else just slides right on over them . they arent really warm i 'd say , but i just wanted a base layer for work . the only problem is i wish the pants had a fly . overall , the fit was just right in both the pants and shirts . i ordered 3 of each and will probly order more . thanks .
 Awesome product ! The thermal top is lightweight and keeps me warm . I marathon train and use this brand exclusively when running . I highly recommend to others .
 Love the shirt great fit and cut extremely comfortable indoors and outdoors . I have found it to be cool to wear in warm conditions and great as an extra layer in cooler conditions . I will be purchasing through pants as well and the camo print shirt too they 're light weight and fold down to nothing great for travelling
 Similar to the Duofold pants , these are the best long underwear I 've ever worn . They keep the heat in very well , fit me snugly and are comfortable . I would recommend to any skier . With this , a sweatshirt and my ski jacket I sweat all day long , but the moisture wicks and stays comfortable all day long . I will always use these when skiing .
 This shirt is exceptionally comfortable . I 'm sensitive to the seams in clothing , particularly shirts , and the seams used in this shirt 's construction are hardly noticeable . The polyester fabric also prevents your top layers from bunching .
 This is a great product . It is stretchy , warm and comfortable . Follow the garment care instructions and it will probably last quite a long while ! Strongly recommended .1 month later
 They keep my son very warm , they are the same wash after wash , they do n't shrink , and they are very comfortable .
 Great snug fit , breatheable balaclava . I actually bought it for part of a halloween costume -LRB- counter-terrorist , ballin -RRB- . Anyway , things of note
 nice product with good material.This Balaclava is thin , warm , soft , and does n't irritate your face.i wear it to play with my airsoft gun : D
 These nylon head covers work very well . . Mine wicked away sweat and held my hair down nicely so I could do my thing .
 This balaclava is great for the price . It works good at keeping the wind from freezing my face on cold runs . The only thing that keeps me from rating it a 5 star is the fact that the mask does n't really fit well over my nose . I would say that I have a fairly normal sized nose , but the mask kind of slips down after a little while . It would also be nice if it stretched down below my chin a little easier when I start to warm up , but I guess that would just depend on the size of your head -LRB- This really is n't a negative to me , just a preference -RRB- . I 'll continue to use this mask as long as it still holds up . I might end up getting a little thicker one for the REALLY cold runs that is designed to go over the nose with some kind of extra fabric there , and maybe vented at the mouth for easier breathing and talking when I 'm with my running group . But this mask will be great , for me , for any runs around or just below freezing temps.I 've gone on 2 REALLY cold runs with this mask that averaged in the single digit temperatures with wind chills at or below 0 * F -LRB- for a reference on my experience with this product -RRB- .
 excellent balaclava . use it when using a half - motorcycle helmet . helps warm up your exposed skin but is n't so heavy that it prevents you from hearing traffic around you .
 I got this recently for those cold mornings on my motorcycle and I must say its an amazing way to stay warm at highway speeds . The fit is a bit tight so if your head is larger than average it may not fit yours despite the one size fits all rating on it . Slips on easily and easy to clean . I wear this almost every day that I ride my motorcycle in the winter . One downside other than the possibly small fit is that the stitching goes straight down the middle of the face and can press into your nose if worn for extended periods of time . I would recommend this to anyone looking to stay warm on a motorcycle or just those cold days . Great product
 The fabric is good and the pattern is great too . But the size seems a little small for my head . I have an average size head to . So the only reason I gave it 4 out 5 is because it 's a bit small for the average person . But it still fits and for the price of 5 bucks you cant go wrong .
 this thing makes u look like a camo ninja . i would recommend this product to ninjas or hunters i guess
 Item is just what I needed . My head is usually warm and I tend to perspire . A polartec baklava -LRB- this item is spelled Balaclava -RRB- is TOO warm for me , this one was thin , light and just right . If you are looking for something to keep the wind at bay and give you light protection from the elements this is the one . Just returned from the mountains outside Dubois , WY @ approx Fahrenheit temps worn
 This was my first Balaclava and I use it for cold weather cycling and taking the dog on runs . By cold weather , I mean midwest temperatures of 25-45 degrees . As for sizing , my head is about 23 &#34; in circumference . On me , this is a good fit . Easy to put on , snug , and fits under a bike helmet . I could see how someone with a much larger head would feel this is too tight.The only reasons I do n't give this 5 stars are :1 -RRB- It 's a little overly snug on my nose -LRB- a minor annoyance , really -RRB- .2 -RRB- It 's really only a wind barrier and not very insulating . In 25-45 degree weather , it 's fine for the 10-20 minutes I 'm outside and active , but for longer stays or colder weather , this would probably not be enough .
 i work security in NYC and it is great cause it keeps me really warm and i am very pleased with it
 This is good with addition to other warm gear , but not alone.This is not a windproof or true cold weather -LRB- 0 C or lower . -RRB- However , I do think it has some potential for sandstorms as a protector . Which is what I will probably use it for the most now .
 I bought 2 of these -LRB- 1 in black and 1 urban camo -RRB- . Overall , these seem durable and well constructed , especially for the price , but they are a little tight fitting . I may just have a big head but most other headgear I wear normal sized items on . These are nylon so do n't expect them to be too warm in the winter . The white on this pattern is really white so I might dirty it up a little bit .
 I was hoping for something a little thicker -LRB- hard to shop online -RRB- but it has been protecting my face very well in this below 20 weather in Philadelphia when I bike several miles to work . I definitely would recommend this product !
 Appreciated the comfort and warmth for cold weather bicycle riding . Was happy it went through laundry well and dried quickly laying out flat .
 This is the first balaclava I have ever owned , so I have no comparison point.BUT - it keeps my head and face comfortable riding my bicycle four miles in cool weather -LRB- around 40 F -RRB- . I can breathe through it . It gets damp - I want to wash it after each wearing . And my glasses fog up - guess that goes with balaclava territory if you are a grandma.Kinda fun - I look like Miss Darling Sweetie Pie from Jacob Two-Two -LRB- the old lady who was a secret ninja -RRB- . I 'm buying two more , so that I have a clean one every day .
 I put this on during those cold winter nights when I want to run . I do n't feel any breeze or wind going through and it keeps my entire head and face warm . This allowed me to enjoy running in the cold !
 Excelent quality ! , comfortable and very affordable ! . i definitely recommend it ! . Perfect if you are an airsoft player like me !
 I love it ! Not too cold not too hot . I have tested this so far in 32deg weather and it has been just what the doctor ordered . I am using it to ride my bicycle to work .
 Used as part of a costume for Halloween . Good quality for the price . No complaints at all ... looked great .
 It is not too tight and I liked that because I have long hair and it does not smash it
 I shopped multiple stores with no luck , and was hesitant to order this online . I read reviews from others , and did n't want to spend alt of money on something I 'd only use once . It was for a Halloween costume , and it worked out great for me . I was pleasantly surprised .
 Lightweight , but warm , great for riding in cooler weather , the item was just as described and arrived in just a couple days .
 This was perfect for what we used it for . My son was a Jabbawokee for Halloween and needed to cover his hair , face and neck under his mask . It worked very well . The only thing that could have been better was that the neck cover was n't long enough . If you need it to completely cover your neck I would look elsewhere .
 This is going to keep the shape you adjust to your head when you put it on because its tight and yeah it is a line going down the middle of it but it doesnt bother me and it looks good
 Very nice and well made product . I use it with paintball to get that SWAT feel . Material is good and I would reccomend buying it
 This mask is being used for the base of my fursuit head . It is on the tight side , wish it was a little more loose .
 The fabric is thin and breathable . i wore it for a couple of hours . after i took it off i noticed it went down to its original shape . my 3 year old wore it around the house and played ninja very comfortably , i did n't have to worry about her having breathing problems . it went back to its original shape . great product over all .
 I bought this several weeks ago and it 's held up reasonably well . The sticking has come undone somewhat , the shipping was free but it took a while , and it pushes down on the bridge of your nose . If you can get past all these shortcomings then it is a great product .
 Just what I needed for the bitingly cold winds of the resorts at Lake Tahoe . Works just fine although after a couple of hours it started sweating and smelling , which is normal of course .
 This Balaclava is thin , warm , soft , and does n't irritate your face -LRB- and I have a full beard -RRB- . I wear it under my motorcycle helmet and I love it . Keeps my face , ears , and neck warm while keeping my hair evenly matted instead of taking my helmet off to have some depressions from the pads . Fits perfectly . Might buy a couple more .
 What makes the perfect balaclava?Ideally it should be elastic , silky smooth , durable and help draw sweat away from your head.Most balaclavas nowadays are made of nylon/acrylic & spandex . Why ? It is elastic and remains that way after many uses . Cotton balaclavas will stretch over time and will not retain their elasticity . Silk materials wear down very easily and the material can `` ball up '' creating those annoying lint balls . The last thing you want against your face are those things.Nylon / acrylic is more durable and feels just as silky smooth as real silk . They help you wick out the sweat and are easy to clean.I 've sold balaclavas of different materials and find my customers overwhelmingly prefer the synthetic nylon/acrylic material .
 I 've only used this a few times for snowboarding but so far it seems good . -LRB- Have n't washed it yet . -RRB- The first one I got had a mis-stiched area so I returned it and bought a second one which was better . It 's relatively thin so if you 're looking for a lightweight layer it should do the job . The main thing to be aware of is that this is sized small . It fits me fine - I 'm a woman with a small sized head . I ca n't imagine anyone with a larger head wearing it though .
 The material is thin and silky , which is exactly what I wanted.It is comfortable and not itchy . Overall I am very happy with the product , but a quick note that it is quite tight , and perhaps a bit smaller than I would expect -LRB- I wear a size Large motorcycle helmet -RRB- Also , does not cover the whole neck , a little short there .
 I looked at some of the bigger box stores for one of these and came up with nothing.Im glad i found it on trusty amazon.I use it to help me blend in when im using my hunting blind.The balaclava is nice and light , feels good when the temps are high.Good quality material , iam happy with the product .
 I ordered this product and it came to me faster than expected . The quality of the balaclava is perfect for what I am using it for . Very happy .
 I bought this to wear under my helmet while riding my bike in the winter months . It fits great -LRB- snug without being tight -RRB- , is long enough in the neck to tuck into my shirt , and is flexible so that i can easily pull it down under my chin when i did n't want it up over my nose/mouth . The material is nice and soft and relatively thin so it 's not at all annoying . Very happy with this purchase .
 I bought one of these several years ago from another company and have used it in cool to cold weather riding here in Florida . Most people think it does n't get cold here but when you are used to normal temperatures from 75 and up for the largest part of the year , those 30 's and 40 's and colder get your attention really quick . I use these under my helmet to stop the drafts that get in on my face and the back of my neck where my coat does n't fit tight . When I first saw one of these in the box , I thought that because of the thinness of it there was no way it could keep me warm . But I tried it and much to my surprise , it was plenty warm . Made a believer out of me . I was in the market for some more of them this year and saw them on Amazon for a better price so I ordered 3 of them . 2 for me and one to give to a fellow biker as we were talking one day about cold weather riding and he mentioned the same problem . He has likewise used his and is also very happy . Kudos Amazon for yet another great product . You may not make it all yourself , but you make it available for Joe Public to buy it .
 It 's thin but warm and it fits under the helmet nicely . You just have to tuck the extra material from the neck into your jacket and it will stop the wind from coming in .
 I got this to wear under my Death Skull Bone Airsoft Full Face Protection Safety Mask . makes wearing a mask more comfortable than being on bare skin .
 Nothing amazing but it does the job and you ca n't beat the price . Other reviewers complained about the stitching running right down the middle and bugging them , I 've noticed it there but it has n't bugged me . The opening is pretty big and I have a hard time keeping the bottom end up on my nose , especially if I have to do any talking . It is a bit tight to get on but it fits snug and it 's not uncomfortable once it 's on my head .
 Cons : The synthetic material wont hold the threads and will open easily.Need to patch it after a couple of uses .
 for my ninja costume for Halloween this year . It 's lightweight and easy to breath through ! Great buy , will use it again next year !
 I bought this product for my son since he 's into jerk dancing he loves this product and he enjoys them very much.No dislike on this product , the price is worth it .
 I would recommend buying this for cosplaying a ninja and such -LRB- that is the reason why I bought it -RRB- . For those wondering how far down the neck portion goes , it actually goes far , even for large heads.If you are looking for a balaclava for skiing , I would recommend purchasing a more expensive one because the fabric is thin ; it wont keep you warm.My only complaint is that you can slightly see through the balaclava once it is worn . It 's not too noticeable but it happens . However , for such a low price , this is worth it . I plan on purchasing more .
 One of the few balaclava that has enough material in the neck area to reach your collar bone . Thin enough not to change the fit of a snug fitting helmet , and not heat you up during the summer seasons . Also warm enough to use on those mild winter days . Definetly worth the $ 6 or $ 7 I payed . Should have gotten 2 as I seldom use the other shorter , or thicker balaclava I own . This IS a tight fitting product especially around the neck , noticed mainly when removing , works for me , materials and quality .
 Very small so I do not recommend older people , especially men , getting this just in case . I 'm using this as a base for my fursuit and is exactly what I needed
 Some of these by other brands have been far shorter ... this one DOES extend down into and around your neck ... with a turtleneck , etc. ... it is the best fitting i.e. the longest I 've bought ... I have immediately ordered more . The fabric quality feels like they all do when new ... this one feels maybe better ... we 'll see with heavy extended wear which I put on these bad boys ... I typically have to take black threat and needle and stitch up separated seems what with my use ALL the time on my BMW motorcycle ... . this one I 've had for only one major ski weekend . And 10 motorcycle rides ... it is THE BEST . Shipping was excellent as always ... free super shipping with $ 25 total of other stuff .
 This item is worth the few dollars it costs . Should last for a few months . Is very thin and runs tight .
 Thin and breathable , long enough in the neck and tight around the face . It 's perfect for snowboarding , the reason I bought it .
 I got this for my scooter for winter driving.It is about 35-45 degrees now , and i ride about 35 mph . It does n't seem like much when you take it out of the box , but this guy really keeps the wind off your face . Best 6 bucks i ever spent .
 Theres not much you can say about balaclavas , however it 's labeled as ONE SIZE , if you 're a larger man it will initially be tight on your face but will form over time . Again for the price and such a simple product I would say it 's a very good product . The product was delivered on time and reasonably packaged .
 I bought mine from powersport superstore , and it fulfilled the purposed I bought it for.Living in the cold midwest weather takes a toll on you whenever it gets below 0 * F , and that is not even counting the wind chill and it blowing in your face.Luckily I have n't had a chance to try it against a blizzard , but I do beware about how it is a VERY tight fit , even me being 6 foot tall , weighing around 130 -LRB- you can tell , not much fat on me -RRB- , it is very much a `` fit as is '' type of item.It does not stretch , and will most likely make your nose feel uncomfortable , if first buy on this kind of item beware.It covers my face very nicely , but if talking or needing to breathe heavily might be uncomfortable .
 It 's hard for me to find one of these that is ` nt made from too heavy of a material and thus too hot when I use it on my bike in the winter . This one was a good weight material . My only complaint was it was a little tight but I think it will strech in time .
 good , but for the first month or two it will really crush your nose , but i do n't use this one anymore . I bought a cotton one , its way more comfortable , but it isnt as silky , or breathable . but all in all this one was good for the $ 6 i paid for it .
 I needed headgear that was lighter then the conventional wool Balacalva . I jog in the winter and wanted something to protect my head from temps below 20 degress and still be able to breath . I use a wool stocking cap over the balaclava , but the nylon makes good separation . Veryy Good Product . Recommend to anyone who is out in the winter , especially against winter winds .
 I love this ! It came in extremely fast , and fits perfect . It 's a must have if you 're into airsoft or paintball . There is a seam that runs down the inside which is a little irratating but nothing to get rid of it for . It 's really soft , not rough , and the fabric does n't `` ball '' up which is really uncomfortable . And for the price it 's definetly worth it and more .
 When I received this product I wondered how it was going to keep me warm being that it was so thin . I needed something that would fit under my helmet though and this did the trick . I rode with it outside in 20 degree weather and it did the trick . Kept the wind out of my face and even knocked down the decibels of the wind a little bit . I could still breathe fairly well . Some string has come out of the bottom but other than that it has held up . I 've worn it many times and have n't washed it yet . I should probably do that . By following the instructions it looks like it will stay together fine . I usually do n't dry these types of things . I can fold it up and stick it in my pocket in-case I do n't need to wear it just yet but want to have it just in case . Great product for it 's great price !
 I ordered this bra based on the positive reviews of several women . I am a 38-40C , distance runner and gym rat . I LOVE this bra !!! It has the support and comfort that I have been looking for . I have always bought Champion bras but this is by far my favorite . I ca n't wait to try it during my next half marathon in March !!!
 Nice bra , very supportive . Velcro straps weird at first , but you get used to them . I like that is machine-washable . I 'd definitely recommend .
 Runs a little small in the chest . Very comfortable . No over-the-head because of the hooks in the back , good for those with limited range-of-motion in their arms . Good support .
 I 've always worn 2 sports bras to prevent bouncing etc. . This is the first bra I have every been able to wear on its own . I 've bought several and I love them all . The underwire is great and does n't dig in at all . I love the 3-hook adjustable closure and the overall support of the cups . I can wear this bra all day if I have to and it does n't lose support . I highly recommend it !
 This is n't the absolute best bra because it does have the uniboob thing going on , but it is fairly supportive .
 This is the greatest sports bra I have ever owned ! I love the adjustable straps and that it clasps in the back . It gives me great support and keeps the girls in place when I 'm jogging . I would highly recommend this bra to other large busted women .
 I recently started jogging and did not want the `` bounce '' factor to discourage me . I ordered three different bras -LRB- 36D -RRB- and this was the only one I kept .
 I 've had three of these sports bras -LRB- hate to admit it -RRB- for 10 years , and I 'm just now getting more !
 I have been wearing this bra for several years and it is the best . Comfortable and great support without an underwire . I would recommend this product to any women who is looking for great support for cardio exercises .
 Good service fast delivery great product , I always go to Amazon first . The bra is of good quality.I am sure I will use for a long time
 I 've been buying this particular sport bra since 1999 . I get it because it works for me . I wear a 34D in regular bras , but I get a 32 D in this one . I run on my treadmill every other day for about 3 to 5 miles . This bra is perfect because it keeps everything from bouncing around and in place . For me , my concern in a sports bra is just making sure things stay put-and this bra does it . My only negative is about the snap that keeps the flap closed . On the back , you use the hooks to close it -LRB- like a regular bra -RRB- and there 's a flap that snaps over . The snaps are cheap little plastic parts that are barely stitched into place . They immediately fall off no matter what . I wish they 'd fix this because the bra is very good .
 I have been buying these bras for over 15 yrs . I do aerobics , and I am a 34DDD . This bra is excellent for keeping you under control . I love these bras .
 Hard to find jogbras in larger sizes . Great support for high impact activities . Does what it 's supposed to do comfortably .
 It is n't the most comfortable sports bra , but it offers protection for larger breasted runners , which has been hard to find .
 Good bra for larger busted women . Gives good support without too much restriction . Careful with adjusting the straps . I made them too tight and after a long run , I rubbed the skin off of both shoulders ! Yikes ! Minor injury . All in all , good purchase .
 This is the best sports bra I have ever had . I run ALOT and I am a 34-36 D-DD . So I need alot of support . This bra is incredible . It is incredibly supportive , but does not feel tight or constricting at all . I live in the south so a big part of the year it is very hot even in the mornings so it does not take long to work up a sweat , but this really does pull the moisture away from your body . Also the straps are wide and comfortable not to mention fully adjustable , and the back is double duty with a hook AND snap closure . It is a little more expensive but it is well worth the money . I have been wearing these for almost two years now and they are still in excellent condition . You will not be disappointed !!
 I have long been on the search for an affordable , high impact sports bra for well-endowed women ... this is it!I am not a small chested woman -LRB- size DD cups -RRB- and I love high impact sports , but I have had a difficult time finding a sports bra that could keep me from painfully bouncing everytime I would run or jump . This bra keeps that from happening . I no longer feel pain when playing sports or running.I also do n't feel as self-conscious when working out which is another added bonus.The bra is comfortable and supports my chest well . There is a hook-and-eye closure with a tab cover up that snaps in the back ; which is part of the reason this bra can be so comfortable , look good , and have great support.I will continue to buy this product , as needed , in the future to keep me in my high impact sports .
 I have taken up running and needed a supportive sports bra for my C 's ! This champion max . support definately helps reduce motion and is adjustable on the back strap with hooks and snaps , as well as the shoulder straps with velcro . Felt comfortable to wear but is a little tricky to put on , unless you do the `` fasten in front and twist '' option . Ordered thru amazon from Lady grace who sent it fast and in good condition .
 I 'm a 36DD . The support of this bra is decent . But if you 're looking for rock solid support , buy the Enell sports bra . I bought a Jogbra and an Enell at the same time . Now that I 've used them both , I wo n't buy another Jogbra , its Enell from here on out .
 Very upset with CHAMPION for discontinuing this bra -LRB- style 072 -RRB- because it is definitely GO - TO sports bra for many women ! In facy , I have worn it for so long , I probably have owned 24 of them ! I use them for EVERYDAY wear under clothing on hot summer days too , because they are all cotton , comfortable and -- this is key -- supportive AND seamless.Come on Champion , bring back this perfect sports bra ... Perfect because it does n't have a racerback.Perfect , because its all cotton , perfect because its incredibly supportive to DD wearers , andPERFECT because its a seamless and minimizing style ! PERFECT for high impact aerobics ! Great for runners ! I discovered only recently , -LRB- Spring 2012 -RRB- that the ba is no longer available on Champion 's website , on JUSTMYSIZE.com and on Amazon. :--LRB- so sad , as it will be difficult , if not impossible to find a replacement with all of this bra 's great features and functions .
 I run about 25 to 30 miles a week and I am a DD . I could not find a sports bra that fit me right and did n't rub me the wrong way . This bra is it ! Go ahead and order it . It supports great but does n't feel like it is suffocating me . Fantastic !
 I have been using this sports bra for years . It is the ONLY sports bra that actually locks my girls down and lets me get on with the workout . I 'm a 36C/D and love this bra . Everything is nice and secure . If you 're worried about having mono-boob , this may not be the bra for you ; but if you want your ladies in the proper place so you can do high-impact exercise , there is no other bra that can beat this .
 I am a very active woman who also happens to have large breasts . Normal jogging bras NEVER work because they stretch out after 1-2 uses . Regular bras either make me look bigger , have straps that dig into my shoulders , or do n't support me at all . The Champion Action Sports Bra is the ONLY bra I have ever had that works . I ordered one , went jogging in it as soon as I got it , and returned home for the very first time without a sore , chafed chest . I immediately bought two more of these bras , so that I can wear them every day . It 's so wonderful to not only exercise , but just be able to walk up and down stairs without anything jiggling around . This bra lifts my bosom and keeps it firmly in place , yet at the same time the bra fits very comfortably . They are also very durable ; the first three bras have lasted me for 2 years of everyday use . I will keep buying this bra so long as they keep making them .
 I 've used this bra for several years . They are well constructed for the price point and I find them well supportive for high impact activities . Because I am bigger now after having kids -LRB- went from a 36C to 38C/D -RRB- , I find a little bit of a `` uniboob '' problem than before kids .
 This is the best sports bra that I own . If you are like me , with large boobies , then this is a great buy ! It was hard for me to find a sports bra for larger size breasts that did n't smash you and cut off your circulation . I use this bra for all of my physical activites and I do n't feel ashamed or embarassed while out excersizing . I do not have to wear a 2nd bra and I do n't have my DD 's bouncing back and trying to knock me out -LRB- cuz they are real -RRB- .
 I bought a few of these , as well as some of the thicker ones for colder weather . Since I do a lot of hiking and backpacking , this is the best way to go as it keeps you cool and dry and provides enough insulation and to block out the sun 's rays . The material itself feels light as a feather -LRB- hence the name -RRB- and very comfortable against your skin . However , depending on the type of conditions , I suggest going for lighter colors like blue or silver -LRB- if available -RRB- and not black , as even with the lightweight fabric it will still draw too much sun . This has become an essential item for all of my hikes .
 I have dealt with Lisa at Rocky Mountain Emporium for 3 years & have only good comments for her products & customer service.The first time that I ordered from Lisa , I had several questions about which of the pashmina would be appropriate for the use that I wanted it to fulfill . Lisa exhibited great patience in explaining the various types of pashminas & helped me to purchase the 80/20 Bhaju 210 . It is a lovely & practical accessory . It will dress up an outfit , fancy or jeans or just take the chill off.I have ordered 2 additional pashminas in this grade , one for a friend & another for myself . I take one of them with me to restaurants , doctors ' offices , even here on the Gulf Coast . They are also great as a scarf in the winter in Denver , CO. . I have also , ordered the Bhaju 3 Ply Grade , which is divine & snuggly in the Colorado winter.The arrival time was very quick . The one time that there was a problem it was resolved quickly & with great concern on Lisa 's part.I will definitely order from Lisa again .
 I buy shirts for my husband very often . This is definitely a very good shirt you can get for under $ 10 . I 'd guess it retails for around $ 35 . Excellent packaging and fabric quality . Note
 This is the only shirt my husband will wear to the office . It is well made .
 Its a good shirt and it was delivered on time but you have to be careful where you ball it up or that wrinkle might be permanent . Have it laundered if you can because really who wants to iron .
 I went down the road of looking for higher quality shirts and what I learned along the way may help . First , the quality issue . Shirts would last me about three months and buying these and other brands -- which felt like they were made of thicker material , did n't help . I wrote the date on the tail in sharpie and three months later I noticed wear around the cuff and collar . Switching brands did not help . I was fit to be tied over this issue , I did not want to pay any price for a shirt that lasted for three months of weekly wear . Then I ran across this link -LSB- ... -RSB- and discovered that the dryer was a big part of the issue . Do n't dry your shirts longer than 10 minutes to get much better life out of them . If you are not buying permanent press , do n't have them dry-cleaned . Wash them yourself on the delicate or hand-wash cycle -- or just hand-wash them -- and have the dry cleaner press them . This is going to give you the greatest amount of life out of a shirt.That said , I feel there is a compelling quality and feel difference to these shirts . I 've gotten positive comments on these . So it all comes down to what you are willing to pay and whether what I just said matters to you . Amazon is an inexpensive place to shop for most things , but there are cheaper ways to buy these shirts . That wo n't bring the price down to what you would pay for Arrow or other off the rack brands , but if you want this quality , there are deals to be had.Now for fit . When I started down this road I could never find a shirt that fit me . I am thin and tall and that just is n't what most manufacturers make -- which says loads about what they can sell I guess . Jos A. Bank did n't make a slim fit back then and I even went so far as to have some of them tailored before I left for something less expensive , and higher quality -- which is before I learned not to dry them so long . I never approached nirvana on the quality for cost issue , but other manufacturers did have slim fit that at least removed the need to tailor . Jos A. Bank now has slim fit and they fit better than any other .
 Thought since I respect Joseph Banks brand that these would be superior quality shirts . Quality is satisfactory , but shirts were not as wrinkle-free as I had hoped .
 Was completely satisfied with quality of product and speed of shipment . Would order from J. A. Banks at any time in the future .
 Good quality fabric . Button-down collar stays neatly in place with the perfect allowance for the tie .
 Excellent design , Ichigo seems like on tv , the material is great , details are great , i put in my backpack and looks great !!
 I 've been wearing these visors in all different colors for years , and ca n't find another visor this light weight , comfortable and inexpensive . You do n't get a headache and ca n't tell that you 're even wearing it . My husband & I wear them for all our beach sports , including beach volleyball , standup paddle boarding and kayaking . If they fall off in the ocean , they float and are waterproof . You do , however , have to replace them every couple of years , because the coiled stretchy cord -LRB- band -RRB- that keeps them on your head stretches out eventually .
 Great product . Lots of my fishing friends that are full-time guides wear this product . It 's not too expensive , keeps your warm and can take a beating . The product seems to run a bit on the big size , but I would n't downsize to a smaller size .

 This item is really good for the price . The quality of this T-Shirts is also nice . The appearence also looks like some expensive T-Shirts . Thanks for dealsforthisweek website for posting this deal .
 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!
 I ca n't remember the last time I saw an item of clothing with a tag that listed the USA as the country of origin . You can not beat the price and this shirt is 100 % medium weight cotton !
 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 the slip was to small my fault i ordered the wrong size would order again and hopefully i get it right this time
 I wear skirts and dresses often and I have always liked to wear full slips with them . These days full slips are hard to find . Vanity Fair slips have always been my favorite brand . They are comfortable and look good . They hold up quite well , too . Thank you for having them available !
 I always love to wear a full-length slip , because it hikes up when your skirt or dress hikes up when you lift your arms . However , the little plastic strap length adjustor things are not really grabbing the thin silk of the strap very well , and the strap lengthens just a little over the course of the day .
 Very pleased with merchandise.Material is high quality and generous fitting.Would be glad to recommend this item
 I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early . The package was in excellent shape . I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip . The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected . I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black . I wish there were more color options than just black and white . I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them .
 As in the past , Vanity Fair slips fit like a dream , just make sure that you check the Vanity Fair sizing chart -LRB- size on lable is not bust size -RRB- . It feels good under a dress that requires a slip . I could n't be happier with the quality of the product .
 When it comes to Valentine 's Day , I 'm not looking to get my wife one of those teddies or chemises . I just want to get her a regular , white slip , with lace at the top and bottom . Vanity Fair delivers with this product , a very sexy item .
 I 'd recommend this if you need a basic slip . The shoulder straps are adjustable and the lace lining around the neck may be layered nicely with a low cut top . The only drawback is a personal one . At 5 ' 5 , 145 lbs , size 10 and pear-shaped , this slip * just * fits my frame , and there is a tiny bit of an awkward pull at the hip area . Next time I 'll order a 36 for more give .
 This is a very nice slip . It fits well and is the right length -LRB- a little above the knee -RRB- for most of my dresses . The shoulder straps do fall down at times during the day as the plastic adjusters slip down , but can easily be re-adjusted . I have that problem with most slips so am used to it . I had an old slip just like this one and it was falling apart with age so this was a replacement . I was happy to find it on Amazon and received it quickly and for a reasonable price .
 This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious , it is just okay . I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer . One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise . At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for , especially in this case .
 This is a good old-fashioned full slip . It 's hard to find these nowadays . This was slightly too long for the dress I had bought it for , but I took it to a dry cleaners and had it hemmed a couple inches and it 's perfect . The detailing/seaming at the bust is a little bit more than I 'd hoped for -LRB- shows slightly through my dress fabric -RRB- , but is only really visible if you 're looking for it . Overall , a good purchase .
 The slip fit perfectly . The adjustable straps allowed me to play with the positioning under my dress and the length was on target .
 The cup area was just a little loose and bunchy -LRB- reason it got 4 instead of 5 -RRB- . I like the lace bottom , so if it shows a bit , it does n't look frumpy .
 I love this slip . I bought this slip to wear under my dresses that came to my knees and this works very nicely .
 Got this for my daughter for Christmas - she is delighted with it . Fits well , wears it with pride . She loves it .
 Vanity Fair slips are wonderful and made of excellent quality . They wear well and are very comfortable ... highly recommend them . Very feminine and sexy !!!!!!!
 THESE SLIPS ARE GREAT AND FUN TO WEAR !!!! AS A MALE WEARING SLIPS FOR MANY YEARS i FIND THAT THE VANITYFAIRS ARE THE BEST.THANX TO VANITY FAIR FOR STILL MAKING SLIPS WHEN MOST EVERYONE ELSE HAS DIED OUT !!!
 I am 5 ' 10 '' and purchased the long in both white and black . The reviews are accurate in saying that the long is truly a long , but I love this purchase . The material quality is high and the style is very nice . The adjustable straps allowed me to pull it up , and while the straps do slip a bit , I could easily pin them in place and adjust according to the length of whatever I have on . I am very happy with this purchase .
 Item was sent quickly & well packaged . Item fit as the size indicated , and has held up to multiple washes w / line drying . I would purchase this item again .
 I ordered this slip online because it is getting more & more difficult to find larger size lingerie items in department stores -- especially full length slips . I like the design and material . It does seem to run a little small , but that 's OK becuse I want to lose weight !
 This is a wonderful slip . The fit is perfect and exactly to specified measurements . Excellent value !
 I bought it in a size 40 and I am a 38A bra , but it is still comfortable and fits well .
 perfect fit , and wonder why I have n't had one for so long . non clinging , full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort .
 Honestly , my biggest beef with this slip is that the white looks too white . I would 've liked the nude color in my size and short enough I can wear with the dresses I need this for , otherwise , does exactly what I needed .
 Washes and dries well in the dryer . Stays true to fit and keeps its shape wash after wash . This is the best lace full slip . I will be ordering another one .
 I love it ! It fits great ! and looks awesome ! I love wearing Vanity Fair full slips ! and my wife loves the look and feel !
 This is a very nice , well made slip . I plan to order one in a longer version . Sometimes I want the ease of a full slip under my dresses/skirts . I would recommend this . The slip arrived within a couple of days of my order which surprised and pleased me . I got it just when I needed it .
 I chose this rating because the vest is exactly what I wanted!It is light-weight in feel yet keeps me warm when I need it !
 Gave this to my sister-in-law for CHristmas present . She loves it . Nice and soft , good fit . Washes up well too .
 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .
 I got this vest for my 90-year old Mom . It 's soft and a pretty pink , but most of all it keeps her nice and warm .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .
 Bought this for my Son 's friend who plans on joining the FBI program after college . He says it 's comfortable and washes well . No fading . He is 5-9-160 pounds , I bought him a large . Fits on the big side but nice .
 Really cool shirt ! Just as shown . Small FBI logo on back near neck . Size seems to run a bit small . Very pleased with this product .
 A perfect scarf with nice nubby texture in the weave ... and soft as can be ... luxurious and warm ...
 This tipi was easy to set up , and more important - easy to collapse and transport . It is lightweight but sturdy , and the fabric is substantial . One caveat
 The tee pee is really fun ! We 've had it since my son was about 8 months old . He used to sit in there with a book and all his stuffed animals . At three you can still find him playing in there . We never painted it because I think it will be a nice project for him to do when he is older . It 's very sturdy and well made . I anticipate using it for years to come . Keep in mind that it is quite large so you want a large area .
 Love it ! I love its natural materials , and I love that my son will be able to use it different ways as he gets older.We got it for him 5 months ago for his 1st birthday . It came together fairly easily . Right now he just runs in there and `` hides '' every once in a while , but I anticipate that it 'll be a part of creative play , plus just some personal space for him , as he gets older.We have n't done any painting yet - I figure that 'll be a project in a few years .
 While overall , this is a really nice product , the measurements are a bit deceiving . The 6 ' measurement is from the floor to the top of the poles that you see sticking out from the top of the tee pee . This looks a lot larger than it actually is . We bought it to decorate and auction off for my daughter 's kindergarten 's project in their silent auction , and we really wish we 'd gone for the next size up . This is fine for a small child , but hardly enough room for playing .

 The shirt is 100 % cotton and fits perfectly.The collar is a little too high , but it 's just part of it 's design , and not really a problem.The idea for the printing is quite nice and very well done . Having a `` broken image '' in a shirt can be quite entertaining among friends.But there 's one letdown
 The picture wo n't load , I ca n't see the image on the shirt.heh heh heh
 This is the only shirt my husband will wear to the office . It is well made .
 Its a good shirt and it was delivered on time but you have to be careful where you ball it up or that wrinkle might be permanent . Have it laundered if you can because really who wants to iron .
 I went down the road of looking for higher quality shirts and what I learned along the way may help . First , the quality issue . Shirts would last me about three months and buying these and other brands -- which felt like they were made of thicker material , did n't help . I wrote the date on the tail in sharpie and three months later I noticed wear around the cuff and collar . Switching brands did not help . I was fit to be tied over this issue , I did not want to pay any price for a shirt that lasted for three months of weekly wear . Then I ran across this link -LSB- ... -RSB- and discovered that the dryer was a big part of the issue . Do n't dry your shirts longer than 10 minutes to get much better life out of them . If you are not buying permanent press , do n't have them dry-cleaned . Wash them yourself on the delicate or hand-wash cycle -- or just hand-wash them -- and have the dry cleaner press them . This is going to give you the greatest amount of life out of a shirt.That said , I feel there is a compelling quality and feel difference to these shirts . I 've gotten positive comments on these . So it all comes down to what you are willing to pay and whether what I just said matters to you . Amazon is an inexpensive place to shop for most things , but there are cheaper ways to buy these shirts . That wo n't bring the price down to what you would pay for Arrow or other off the rack brands , but if you want this quality , there are deals to be had.Now for fit . When I started down this road I could never find a shirt that fit me . I am thin and tall and that just is n't what most manufacturers make -- which says loads about what they can sell I guess . Jos A. Bank did n't make a slim fit back then and I even went so far as to have some of them tailored before I left for something less expensive , and higher quality -- which is before I learned not to dry them so long . I never approached nirvana on the quality for cost issue , but other manufacturers did have slim fit that at least removed the need to tailor . Jos A. Bank now has slim fit and they fit better than any other .
 Thought since I respect Joseph Banks brand that these would be superior quality shirts . Quality is satisfactory , but shirts were not as wrinkle-free as I had hoped .
 Was completely satisfied with quality of product and speed of shipment . Would order from J. A. Banks at any time in the future .
 Good quality fabric . Button-down collar stays neatly in place with the perfect allowance for the tie .

 These shawls are very nice quality and perfect size the only problem was that they only had black , as they stated in the product description . I received them very quickly via USPS Priority Mail . Black is a very popular color so I can use them for gifts . I 'd like to ask the merchant to get some more colors . I was happy with the shawls , though , and would buy them again .
 I wish I did n't purchase any other pashminas . This was a great price and the fabric was so soft ! I was able to give 10 people a present for the price of one !
 These are very similar to the scarves we fell in love with in the London shops . Great price . I just received mine and I 'm very happy with the shipment . I hope they wash up as well as the viscose scarves I bought in London . I do n't know why they would n't . Soft and warm next to the skin . Pretty colors . I received 6 colors with only 2 of them repeated in 3 scarves each . Thank you . I 'm going to order another set to keep for last minute gifts .
 I ordered the 10 multi-color set and got a total of 14 scarves-12 viscose -LRB- 6 black , 6 colors -RRB- and 2 chiffon scarves . . great value , and they made great Christmas gifts !
 The quality of the scarfs are very good . The shipping very fast . My only issue is that the color selection was lacking . I received 5 black scarves , 2 pinks , 1 orange , 1 red , and 1 deep pink . Not a big range of colors sent that was very disappointing and having 5 of one color was even more disappointing . But for what I paid for them it was still a very good deal .
 I received 10 shawls of various colors which were selected by the dealer . This resulted in several duplicate colors . The shawls are good quality for the price .
 the pashminas arrived on time and in tact . a very nice pashmina considering the inexpensive cost . i kept two for myself and gave the rest as gifts .
 I work in a nursing facility . I needed low-cost Christmas gifts for my co-workers . I was afraid of the quality of this product , given the price . I ordered two sets and received 5 blacks per set . Each set had identical colors . The quality was wonderful . And , most people preferred black for its versatility ! Everyone LOVED them !!! I would definitely order again . Thank you .
 The product is lovely , do n't get me wrong -- just be sure to note that you can -- and probably will -- get color duplication . I made the silly silly mistake to order two sets all at once -LRB- greater chance of getting all the colors , right ? -RRB- Yeah ... no . Out of the 20 I have , I have 3 red , and 11 black . Not faulting them , because they said it could happen , just FYI ...
 I ca n't figure out how to contact the seller but I am really interested in purchasing an order of these pashminas . I see that they are unavailable right now and was wondering if they would be again before the holidays .
 I had seen people at the pool with mesh bags that had pockets on the outside and I decided I * needed * one ! My current mesh bag had no pockets and everything -LRB- sunscreen , keys , goggles , swim toys , etc -RRB- kept getting lost inside and I had to search for everything . I decided to give this bag a try and I LOVE it !!! It is a nice large bag . 4 beach towels fit inside no problem -LRB- and I could fit more if I wanted -RRB- , and the top still zips up . It has 6 large pockets around the sides which are awesome for all those swimming necessities . To give you an idea of the size of the outside pockets -- I can fit a spray sunscreen , rub on sunscreen , and sunscreen stick in one pocket with room left for more ! This bag is exactly what I was looking for , is well made , and is a great pool/beach bag !!
 This is the only shirt my husband will wear to the office . It is well made .

 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!

 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 Great Dress , as beautiful as promised . Only critisim is that it is rather tight around the bell area , make sure you double check you measurements before buying it .
 This dress was inexpensive yet classy looking . My daughters are teenagers whom are very difficult to please and we agreed on this dress . They have decided to cut the dress to a shorter length . You will be impressed with not only the price but the dress itself .

 The dresses were the perfect thing after looking in 5 major cities for red and white toddler dresses for my daughter 's wedding this summer -- it was a relief to find these and at a sale price too ! They came very fast.Thank you very much .
 I have 3 girls and they looked beautiful in their matching dresses for Christmas !! I have washed them since then and they held up wonderfully !

 I was confused by the `` Helmet Only '' listing on the website , thinking the helmet may not come with the eye protection ... but it does ! Very cute and my son loves it . Bought it to go with my son 's pilot costume . It is a little bit big for his head -LRB- 5y/o -RRB- but the adjustable chin strap keeps it in place .
 We purchased this to go with our sons Navy Pilot Flight suit and he love it ! he is still playing with it and it has held up well .
 These are by far the best socks I 've ever owned and now it seems they do n't have them or any other socks anymore . What a crock that is .

My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .

 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .

 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .

 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 This is the only shirt my husband will wear to the office . It is well made .
 Its a good shirt and it was delivered on time but you have to be careful where you ball it up or that wrinkle might be permanent . Have it laundered if you can because really who wants to iron .
 I went down the road of looking for higher quality shirts and what I learned along the way may help . First , the quality issue . Shirts would last me about three months and buying these and other brands -- which felt like they were made of thicker material , did n't help . I wrote the date on the tail in sharpie and three months later I noticed wear around the cuff and collar . Switching brands did not help . I was fit to be tied over this issue , I did not want to pay any price for a shirt that lasted for three months of weekly wear . Then I ran across this link -LSB- ... -RSB- and discovered that the dryer was a big part of the issue . Do n't dry your shirts longer than 10 minutes to get much better life out of them . If you are not buying permanent press , do n't have them dry-cleaned . Wash them yourself on the delicate or hand-wash cycle -- or just hand-wash them -- and have the dry cleaner press them . This is going to give you the greatest amount of life out of a shirt.That said , I feel there is a compelling quality and feel difference to these shirts . I 've gotten positive comments on these . So it all comes down to what you are willing to pay and whether what I just said matters to you . Amazon is an inexpensive place to shop for most things , but there are cheaper ways to buy these shirts . That wo n't bring the price down to what you would pay for Arrow or other off the rack brands , but if you want this quality , there are deals to be had.Now for fit . When I started down this road I could never find a shirt that fit me . I am thin and tall and that just is n't what most manufacturers make -- which says loads about what they can sell I guess . Jos A. Bank did n't make a slim fit back then and I even went so far as to have some of them tailored before I left for something less expensive , and higher quality -- which is before I learned not to dry them so long . I never approached nirvana on the quality for cost issue , but other manufacturers did have slim fit that at least removed the need to tailor . Jos A. Bank now has slim fit and they fit better than any other .
 Thought since I respect Joseph Banks brand that these would be superior quality shirts . Quality is satisfactory , but shirts were not as wrinkle-free as I had hoped .
 Was completely satisfied with quality of product and speed of shipment . Would order from J. A. Banks at any time in the future .
 Good quality fabric . Button-down collar stays neatly in place with the perfect allowance for the tie .

 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 It 's only been the last 7 years or so that I 've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house , I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning ! All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks , and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.I bought this becuase my last robe is falling apart . I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe , when it got here and I wore it for a couple days , I really like it.I bought the Large Black robe ; I 'm 6ft , about 200lbs , a little heavy around the middle , and the robe fits pretty well . The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist . The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs . It `` flows '' nice too , when I walk , not like the heavier terrycloth robe . And the silk lining makes me feel `` rich '' ! Overall , I like it !
 Wow I am completely impressed with this robe . I bought the silver/grey robe , and one big thing to note is that the picture just does n't do it justice . The outside fabric -LRB- mainly wool -RRB- has a pattern that is hard to explain but looks very sharp . The seams are silk and really accent the robe in the right way . The inside of the robe is smooth silk and the entire robe is not heavy or light its right in the middle . I bought the medium size and it fits perfectly . I am 5 '10 and the waist/arms were a spot on fit . Kudos on the fast shipping as well to Amazon !
 Not the lowest price robe out there , but very well priced for silk.Soft silk wraps you in luxury . It 's sooo much better than a plain cotton terry robe.Gotta go , Hugh Hefner is calling .
 This is a great robe , warm and feels great . The one negative is that the material looks like it might pill after time .

 This is the only shirt my husband will wear to the office . It is well made .
 Its a good shirt and it was delivered on time but you have to be careful where you ball it up or that wrinkle might be permanent . Have it laundered if you can because really who wants to iron .
 I went down the road of looking for higher quality shirts and what I learned along the way may help . First , the quality issue . Shirts would last me about three months and buying these and other brands -- which felt like they were made of thicker material , did n't help . I wrote the date on the tail in sharpie and three months later I noticed wear around the cuff and collar . Switching brands did not help . I was fit to be tied over this issue , I did not want to pay any price for a shirt that lasted for three months of weekly wear . Then I ran across this link -LSB- ... -RSB- and discovered that the dryer was a big part of the issue . Do n't dry your shirts longer than 10 minutes to get much better life out of them . If you are not buying permanent press , do n't have them dry-cleaned . Wash them yourself on the delicate or hand-wash cycle -- or just hand-wash them -- and have the dry cleaner press them . This is going to give you the greatest amount of life out of a shirt.That said , I feel there is a compelling quality and feel difference to these shirts . I 've gotten positive comments on these . So it all comes down to what you are willing to pay and whether what I just said matters to you . Amazon is an inexpensive place to shop for most things , but there are cheaper ways to buy these shirts . That wo n't bring the price down to what you would pay for Arrow or other off the rack brands , but if you want this quality , there are deals to be had.Now for fit . When I started down this road I could never find a shirt that fit me . I am thin and tall and that just is n't what most manufacturers make -- which says loads about what they can sell I guess . Jos A. Bank did n't make a slim fit back then and I even went so far as to have some of them tailored before I left for something less expensive , and higher quality -- which is before I learned not to dry them so long . I never approached nirvana on the quality for cost issue , but other manufacturers did have slim fit that at least removed the need to tailor . Jos A. Bank now has slim fit and they fit better than any other .
 Thought since I respect Joseph Banks brand that these would be superior quality shirts . Quality is satisfactory , but shirts were not as wrinkle-free as I had hoped .
 Was completely satisfied with quality of product and speed of shipment . Would order from J. A. Banks at any time in the future .
 Good quality fabric . Button-down collar stays neatly in place with the perfect allowance for the tie .
 I love the U.S. military , the Navy and the Marines in particular . Another reason why I got this shirt is because my family is mainly maritime . While I like the shirt very much , I wish more Large size shirts had been available . That was the only drawback . I would recommend this shirt to people who like the Navy , are in the Navy or know someone in the Navy .
 This item is really good for the price . The quality of this T-Shirts is also nice . The appearence also looks like some expensive T-Shirts . Thanks for dealsforthisweek website for posting this deal .
 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!
 I ca n't remember the last time I saw an item of clothing with a tag that listed the USA as the country of origin . You can not beat the price and this shirt is 100 % medium weight cotton !
 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 I chose this rating because the vest is exactly what I wanted!It is light-weight in feel yet keeps me warm when I need it !
 Gave this to my sister-in-law for CHristmas present . She loves it . Nice and soft , good fit . Washes up well too .
 I love my Columbia Fern Creek vest , light weightt , but warm , be perfect in the spring , Fit is perfect , true to size .
 Its not sexy but its warm and classic . Have n't washed it yet but its big enough in a small to shrink and still be ok .
 This was a gift for my running partner . She found it warm enough for cold weather runs and liked the fit and softness .
 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .
 I got this vest for my 90-year old Mom . It 's soft and a pretty pink , but most of all it keeps her nice and warm .
 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .
 I have ordered this vest for myself in a couple of different colors . It is so comfortable I wear it all the time.I also ordered one for my granddaughter . I would recommend this item.Thanks you .
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !

These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 This jacket was wonderfull I got a lot of compliments , Beautyful .
 I like this jacket because it makes you look lean and thin . The black color and design is cool . The shortened look is in now and it elongates your upper body . For the look and money good buy . I think it looks best unzipped , and it actually looks better in person than on the model in the picture .
 I found these little jewels many years ago at Stein Mart , and found they did n't carry them any more . I was happy to find them on line . They are great for those of us who have , shall we say , perky ends . Very seamless and comfortable . No sticky glue or tape and they stay put . I use them more than 6 times , as the package says . In fact , they last twice as long as that , if you do n't use lotion.I wish I could find the black ones again .
 For women with nipple issues who want to keep their nipples from being visible under clothing , then you might want this product . Gently place these petals on each nipple for that smooth , contoured look . Wash your breasts and make sure your breasts are dry before placing said petal . You do n't want to lotion the area because that will preclude the petals from adhering . Simple , light and portable , these are very useful indeed .
 I like it very much . It fits me pretty good and I think it will also fit to most people since it is stretchable for adjustment .
 Even though this outfit is for Christmas time , it 's one of my favorites out of my lingerie collection . It fits great and is sooo cute ! I paired it with some red Christmas fishnet stockings and black heels and had the ultimate sexy Christmas outfit !
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .

 This vest is well made and very warm . I only wish it had inside pockets . It is a good fit too .

 This vest is all it said it would be . Super soft , warm , and figure flattering . The length is long enough to cover the `` back side '' gaps . Great quality and style .
 Love the this color great wt to wear every day.Washed a few time inside out sill looking good .
 This is my third Columbia vest . loves them , the fit is good , everything about them . I had been looking for a pink vest and when I saw it , yes , a pink one . Sad to say it is not a true pink . I will keep it but it wo n't be my favorite one to wear .
 I love my Fern Creek vest ! I wear it all the time , around the house , to take my daughter to school and to work . It is one of my most favorite articles of clothing .
 Just what I wanted . I wanted a vest that had a little room at the hips so it just hangs instead of being bunched up when zipped ! This is as described . Plus , it 's Columbia . Good quality . Good looking casual , warming vest .
 Love the vest . It is perfect for all casual fall/winter outfits . Nice fit and well made . It 's a perfect addition to my `` vest '' wardrobe .
 I bought this vest for my Mom . I ordered it in Pink grapefruit , but the vendor contacted me saying they had it only in dark blue which was a beautiful , rich color . My Mom loved it , the fit was perfect for her , and she really liked the zippered pockets for carrying her wallet securely . The fleece is soft and thick , and it looked very attractive on her . A good buy for the price .
 Nice fleece vest . I ordered it for my girlfriend . She seems to like it . And it looks great and seems like it 's a pretty good quality fleece vest
 I have had wanted one of these for a long time but I found them to be to expensive . Then I found this on amazon for the right price . I love it .

 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 .

 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 I wear skirts and dresses often and I have always liked to wear full slips with them . These days full slips are hard to find . Vanity Fair slips have always been my favorite brand . They are comfortable and look good . They hold up quite well , too . Thank you for having them available !
 I always love to wear a full-length slip , because it hikes up when your skirt or dress hikes up when you lift your arms . However , the little plastic strap length adjustor things are not really grabbing the thin silk of the strap very well , and the strap lengthens just a little over the course of the day .
 Very pleased with merchandise.Material is high quality and generous fitting.Would be glad to recommend this item
 I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early . The package was in excellent shape . I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip . The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected . I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black . I wish there were more color options than just black and white . I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them .
 As in the past , Vanity Fair slips fit like a dream , just make sure that you check the Vanity Fair sizing chart -LRB- size on lable is not bust size -RRB- . It feels good under a dress that requires a slip . I could n't be happier with the quality of the product .
 When it comes to Valentine 's Day , I 'm not looking to get my wife one of those teddies or chemises . I just want to get her a regular , white slip , with lace at the top and bottom . Vanity Fair delivers with this product , a very sexy item .
 I 'd recommend this if you need a basic slip . The shoulder straps are adjustable and the lace lining around the neck may be layered nicely with a low cut top . The only drawback is a personal one . At 5 ' 5 , 145 lbs , size 10 and pear-shaped , this slip * just * fits my frame , and there is a tiny bit of an awkward pull at the hip area . Next time I 'll order a 36 for more give .
 This is a very nice slip . It fits well and is the right length -LRB- a little above the knee -RRB- for most of my dresses . The shoulder straps do fall down at times during the day as the plastic adjusters slip down , but can easily be re-adjusted . I have that problem with most slips so am used to it . I had an old slip just like this one and it was falling apart with age so this was a replacement . I was happy to find it on Amazon and received it quickly and for a reasonable price .
 This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious , it is just okay . I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer . One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise . At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for , especially in this case .
 This is a good old-fashioned full slip . It 's hard to find these nowadays . This was slightly too long for the dress I had bought it for , but I took it to a dry cleaners and had it hemmed a couple inches and it 's perfect . The detailing/seaming at the bust is a little bit more than I 'd hoped for -LRB- shows slightly through my dress fabric -RRB- , but is only really visible if you 're looking for it . Overall , a good purchase .
 THESE SLIPS ARE GREAT AND FUN TO WEAR !!!! AS A MALE WEARING SLIPS FOR MANY YEARS i FIND THAT THE VANITYFAIRS ARE THE BEST.THANX TO VANITY FAIR FOR STILL MAKING SLIPS WHEN MOST EVERYONE ELSE HAS DIED OUT !!!
 the slip was to small my fault i ordered the wrong size would order again and hopefully i get it right this time
 I am 5 ' 10 '' and purchased the long in both white and black . The reviews are accurate in saying that the long is truly a long , but I love this purchase . The material quality is high and the style is very nice . The adjustable straps allowed me to pull it up , and while the straps do slip a bit , I could easily pin them in place and adjust according to the length of whatever I have on . I am very happy with this purchase .
 Item was sent quickly & well packaged . Item fit as the size indicated , and has held up to multiple washes w / line drying . I would purchase this item again .
 I ordered this slip online because it is getting more & more difficult to find larger size lingerie items in department stores -- especially full length slips . I like the design and material . It does seem to run a little small , but that 's OK becuse I want to lose weight !
 This is a wonderful slip . The fit is perfect and exactly to specified measurements . Excellent value !
 I bought it in a size 40 and I am a 38A bra , but it is still comfortable and fits well .
 perfect fit , and wonder why I have n't had one for so long . non clinging , full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort .
 Honestly , my biggest beef with this slip is that the white looks too white . I would 've liked the nude color in my size and short enough I can wear with the dresses I need this for , otherwise , does exactly what I needed .
 Washes and dries well in the dryer . Stays true to fit and keeps its shape wash after wash . This is the best lace full slip . I will be ordering another one .
 I love it ! It fits great ! and looks awesome ! I love wearing Vanity Fair full slips ! and my wife loves the look and feel !
 This is a very nice , well made slip . I plan to order one in a longer version . Sometimes I want the ease of a full slip under my dresses/skirts . I would recommend this . The slip arrived within a couple of days of my order which surprised and pleased me . I got it just when I needed it .
 The slip fit perfectly . The adjustable straps allowed me to play with the positioning under my dress and the length was on target .
 The cup area was just a little loose and bunchy -LRB- reason it got 4 instead of 5 -RRB- . I like the lace bottom , so if it shows a bit , it does n't look frumpy .
 I love this slip . I bought this slip to wear under my dresses that came to my knees and this works very nicely .
 Got this for my daughter for Christmas - she is delighted with it . Fits well , wears it with pride . She loves it .
 Vanity Fair slips are wonderful and made of excellent quality . They wear well and are very comfortable ... highly recommend them . Very feminine and sexy !!!!!!!
 This jacket was wonderfull I got a lot of compliments , Beautyful .
 I like this jacket because it makes you look lean and thin . The black color and design is cool . The shortened look is in now and it elongates your upper body . For the look and money good buy . I think it looks best unzipped , and it actually looks better in person than on the model in the picture .
 This item is really good for the price . The quality of this T-Shirts is also nice . The appearence also looks like some expensive T-Shirts . Thanks for dealsforthisweek website for posting this deal .
 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!
 I ca n't remember the last time I saw an item of clothing with a tag that listed the USA as the country of origin . You can not beat the price and this shirt is 100 % medium weight cotton !
 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 The tiny picture does n't do the back design justice . Apparently , these three demons are about to rip this guy-in-a-suit 's head off . This is the best Deicide shirt design available .
 My son requested this mask to wear as part of his Halloween costume this year . He wanted to be a bloody zombie and this particular mask stood out to him . I have n't seen the mask myself because my son lives in another state I 'm going off on his thoughts about the mask . He stated that the mask was &#34; AWESOME &#34; and &#34; 10 TIMES BETTER IN PERSON THAN WHAT THE PICTURES SHOW . &#34; He especially appreciated the little details in making the mask look realistic . My son is 14 yrs old and wears his hair a bit on the longer side , but he said he had no trouble getting the mask on and off . Kudos to whoever designed the mask and Morris Costumes for providing it to buyers .
 I purchased this hat two years ago and I used it mainly for kayaking . I loved the hat . But , this summer , it got so hot that the foam inside melted and shrank and so it 's really small now with the excess outer fabric loose and wrinkled.Granted , Kavu does warn that if you leave the hat on a car or in the sun it will melt . But , why would one wear it in the shade ? I think they need to update this hat with better materials that comply with global warming ! hehehe
 People envy me at work -LRB- construction -RRB- when they have to deal with the sun on their heads and faces , hehe . I bought it mainly for the huge brim , but also because of the fun factor -LRB- I 'm Asian -RRB- . I 've had this hat for about 5 months and serves me well . The only thing I do n't like about it is that the foam inside the hat shrunk from being outside when it 's too hot -LRB- like another reviewer said -RRB- , and there 's a lot of extra fabric . I thought that it was because I popped it in the washer , and that it got damaged because of it.I really like that it can be adjusted to my small head and with the chin strap , the wind ca n't do anything to it . Sometimes I wear it with my baseball cap under it , and it fits nicely . I do n't remember I 'm wearing it sometimes because it is very light . However , I 've felt that on 100 + degree weather and under direct sun , my head gets a bit hot , so I go in the shade and take it off for a moment while I drink water . Once my head cools down , then I put it back on and keep working .
 At first i thought this hat was ugly until i recieved it . it grows on you . it keeps the sun off of you and you do not feel the heat on top of your head . Besides the band around your forehead , you can not even feel that there is a hat on your head because it is so light . I am so impressed with it , i am getting my parents these hats . They work in their yard all time and the heat in texas is hot . I would recommend this to anyone who works or just plays outside .
 Does it make you look like an idiot ? Not if you 're the only one staying cool and avoiding a sunburned face ! This thing is awesome ! The best part about it for me is that I no longer have to put sunscreen on my face or ears at all ... just my neck -LRB- especially if I 'm working in the yard/bending over -RRB- . I always joked that I wanted a hat like this , and when I told my wife I 'd ordered one , she laughed , but when it arrived , I put it on and she changed her mind immediately . Now she steals it when I 'm not using it and wants her own . : -RRB- I also found another use for it ... in my home office in the afternoon , the sun shines into my eyes from the side and makes me squint . If I put this hat on and tilt it to that side , I do n't squint at all ... problem solved ! I 've threatened to take it into my work office for the same reason , but I do n't think it 'd go over well . : -RRB- It 's WAY cooler -LRB- temp-wise ... okay , even fashion-wise ! -RRB- :-RRB- than any other hat I 've tried -LRB- my head does n't sweat wearing it -RRB- , it 's a perfect fit since it 's adjustable , it does n't blow off since it has a neck strap , and it covers a LOT more than a simple baseball cap . I ca n't wait to use it hiking !
 Bought this hat after a friend of mine bought himself one . This hat is excellent for working in the yard . I use mine for mowing the lawn and the previous post were exactly right , it is like a porch for your head .
 AFTER I LAUGHED AT MY BUDDYS FOR WEARING AT WORK . . WHERE IT IS USUALLY ABOUT 100 DEGREES . . BOUGHT THIS KAVU HAT . . HAVE HAD CHUCKLES . . BUT DONT GIVE A DAMN ... THIS HAT IS AMAZING . . SHADES YOU WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS BEADING SWEAT . . I RECOMMEND
 I read a review that said this hat `` is like a front porch for your head . '' That 's probably the best description for this hat . I took it to a music festival in Tennessee in the middle of June , and it was a life saver . It provides so much shade , and at the same time it ventilates really well ! It also is a really good hat for rain . It kept my head and most of my upper body dry during a little downpour . It 's adjustable for all sizes of heads , and it stays on your head really well -LRB- no blowing off your head when there 's a big gust of wind -RRB- . I 'd recommend this hat to people looking for the best sun hat ever . Do n't worry about how silly you look because you 'll feel cooler than everyone else !
 Great Hat ! I have been looking for a synthetic china-man hat and finally found one . Keeps the sun off my face and shoulders while riding my tractor , or kayaking down the river . If there is a breeze the design of the hat allows your head to feel it also . East to clean . I plan on getting one for my dad ; he 'll be impressed that its made in the USA . Not only will you look cool in this awesome hat you will be able to laugh at the irony of a china-man hat being made in the USA .
 I use this hat for kayaking . Does a great job keeping the sun off your face and neck . I get a lot of comments when I wear it :-RRB- It is well made and comfortable . I have the one in olive drab .
 I live in a major urban city and needed a sun hat that is practical but very fashionalble . Since I carry my purchases around the city , I have to have my hands free from `` adjusting or keeping my hat on '' whenever the wind blew ... this hat does the trick , not only does it look fabulous -LRB- light-weight too -RRB- but the stap adjusts around my head enabling it to keep from moving . Love it ...
 My son got it in his head that he had to have a `` Coolie '' Asian style hat to keep cool . He 's 11 years old , so kind of odd for his age . I convinced him to buy this Chillba hat instead of the traditional straw woven hat . I was afraid the straw would fall apart too soon for the asking prices . I figured if his interest passed then at least I could wear it for gardening ! It is cooler than hats that rest directly on your head and works very well keeping the sun out of eyes and has a wide brim for shade . I felt it was worth the money since it is washable and a nice sturdy cloth material .
 I bought it for my husband - he loves it . It insulates his head so he does n't feel the heat of the sun and it blocks the sun from all directions , protecting not only his face but his neck too .
 I bought three of these for my kids and the were terrific for sun and even better in the rain . They held up very well to lots of abuse and are very easy to keep clean although after 6 or 7 years they are little soft at the foam seam under the fabric . Everyone stops the kids on the beach and asks where they got the hat . Inside strap is adjustable to all sorts of heads and mesh lets air flow around your head . They look great on kids , but not so good on grownups , unfortunately . They were a little expensive but well worth it for the years and years of excellent sun shading we got not just on heads but necks and backs too .
 I bought this after trying on a friend 's . I LOVE the look , first of all . But immediately after putting it on -- I was stunned by the `` airy '' feel of the hat . This hat is the best ventilated hat I am aware of . Not only does it provide fantastic coverage of your face and neck , but the part touching your head is mesh -- so that even on the hottest day , you can have a nice breeze across your pate . Absolutely fantastic hot weather hat ! I have two of them .
 Great hats for keeping the sun off and they are well made and durable . Shame the daisy 's on this particular hat are cut off down the sew line . Great buy .
 I have two of these hats . The first one lasted only 10 years ! I use it for working outside -LRB- construction -RRB- , canoeing , fishing and anytime i will be shadeless for a large portion of the day . Upon putting the hat on your head you are immediately cooler . People will sometimes smirk and laugh , but that is part of the fun ! I would absolutely recommend this hat to anyone !
 This is my second Kavu Sun Hat and I absolutely love them !!! Blocks sun out perfectly yet allows the wind to blow up underneath hat to cool head and prevent sweating .
 I really like the way this hat looks , and I have gotten tons of comments from people who like it while out hiking and kayaking.It does float , so it is great for river trips . It is also very comfortable!I have found that it is a bit hot for hiking in the middle of summer . I got the black one and when the sun is beating down on top of it , it feels like an oven over your head . On a river trip , you can just dunk it in the water to cool off , but on a hike I found that it was too hot to wear . I think it will be great for hiking in cooler weather though .
 Just what I wanted . Really like the internal adjustable head band for fitting . This worked really well for a day at the lake and a recent hike up Mt. Whitney . Shipped quickly . Only downside
 Yes , the hat does look a little dorky , but at some time in your life you will decide who you are utilitarian , or a fashion diva . The Kavu sun hat gives you both . Comfortable , one size fits all adjustable inner head lining , and gives you the most shade IN THE WORLD . Thumbs up .
 This is my second Kavu Chillba hat , my first one mysteriously disappeared by either ; an envious soul , or a spouse that thought it looked ridiculous -LRB- she claims her innocence to this day and subsequently bought me this one -RRB- . I live on a lake , which makes this hat perfect when I am in my canoe . It floats , is waterproof , and keeps the sun off your face and neck . The mesh/vented `` skullcap '' headband thingy that keeps the hat secure on your head is brilliant . The simple conical design works well for coverage . The material is durable . The chin strap is nice for windy days or just letting it hang on your back when not wearing it.I 've also used this hat for mowing the grass on sunny days , gardening , backyard BBQ ` ing with friends , and in the rain -LRB- its like wearing a small umbrella on your head ! How cool is that ! -RRB- . WARNING
 Great Product , Keep the sun out of my face and it 's light , best part it 's that it 's for all wheather
 Simply the best all weather hat one can buy ! It allows the breeze to move through , keeps the rain and snow off , comes with a chin strap and it is actually made in the USA ! The sensei at the dojo I attend loved it -LRB- we may have to get him one ... -RRB- and he said something about everyone having to have one by next summer for the yard work!I 'll proably buy a second one for when the first one wears out , if ever.It 's a great hat !
 This item is really good for the price . The quality of this T-Shirts is also nice . The appearence also looks like some expensive T-Shirts . Thanks for dealsforthisweek website for posting this deal .
 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!

 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 Yes , they are expensive - but they hold up . This is one sock that I 've been able to pass along in my family . These are great for tennis , or any other sport where the kids can use extra support and padding . We love our Thorlos .
 Our 7 year old son loves these socks . They are very comfy and do n't wear like other socks . He loves running , running , running . Buy them and you wo n't be disappointed at all . They are well worth the $ .
 This shirt is awesome ; I am surprised how many people walked up and talked to me about Meshuggah ; even people who do n't know who they are like the design . Hell yah , it 's sweet .
 I 'm a recent transplant from the oppressive heat of central Texas to the snowy mountains of SW Colorado . In other words , I get cold easily . I wear this as my base layer when snow-shoveling the drive or snowshoeing for several hours when the temperature is above freezing but still cold . I work out hard and sweat a lot , yet these wick well and keep me dry and warm . The anti-microbial treatment really works on blocking the sweat odor too . These are so flattering on as well as warm , that I have also warm them as leggings underneath tunics/skirts/dresses too . Plus I could n't believe the price ! I have been used to buying performance wear through REI , and am so pleased to have found this great product at at least half the price I would have paid .
 I use these as my base layer for skiing . They are just perfect for keeping me warm and toasty all day . On warmer days I 'll wear just these and my ski pants , colder days I 'll use a mid-layer on top of these as well .
 Hot Chillys are the best at keeping you warm during the winter underneath your clothing . I have tried other products and always come back to Hot Chillys . If you are outside a lot , this product is for you . They are thin , yet they keep the warmth in . A little expensive , but worth the price .
 I can wear this in the summer time and the winter . These tights protect my skin from the sun and the cold . I accidently waste hot coffee on my lap and it did n't sink to my skin .
 I 'm using these as a base layer for riding to work . So far , so good . I wear them over my padded shorts and under my tights . They have flatlock seams and gusseted crotch so should n't cause any irritation . Length is similar to my gore cycle tights . Sizing is spot on .
 I have some hips and these fit well without being uncomfortable . I wear these out under polyester uniform pants in 20-40 degree weather . The fleece inside and smooth outside works really well with polyester .
 I really do love these pants . I think they will be great under my snowpants for skiing , which is what I actually bought them for anyway . I tried them on and they were so comfortable I wore them a few times already for running around . They are a great underlayer , but if it is really cold out , they will not keep you warm alone . I tried to wear them to take the dog for a walk/run this week and it was too cold to wear them alone , under pants they would be awesome , which is what they are intended for I 'm sure . Overall , I would recommend , they are super comfy !
 I wore these skiing in Switzerland , kept me super warm . I purchased the medium -LRB- I am 5 ' 4 , 127 lbs -RRB- , they fit perfectly . I do n't like them too tight .
 Love these ! The material is quite thick and not see-through at all , yet they are VERY stretchy and form-fitting ! I bought them with the intention of using them as warm underwear only , but because of the quality of the material I 've had no problem wearing them as casual pants on warmer days . I have big legs and a small waist , and oftentimes leggings are too loose in the waist and tend to slide down as I exercise ; these stay put ! I 'm ordering more of these .
 I live 6000 feet up in the cascades of Oregon . I am a avid hiker , down hill and XC skier . Hot Chillys are by far the best underwear I have ever owned . The fit is true to size . Believe what this company says about their products . I will be ordering a lot more of Chillys you can count on that !!!!
 Good product . They keep my wife warm , worth the money . However I do not like being told how many words I have to put in a review .
 It is a great accessory for any Naruto fan , it fits perfect and was shipped very fast and got here on time . I love it .
 The first day I wore this to school , almost 10 people said they thought it was cool ! I love this wristband a lot < 3
 I bought this for my Naruto-obsessed 9 year-old . He wears it constantly . One of the studs came loose the first night he had it , but he still wears it .
 So I actually bought one of these for my boyfriend , we both love naruto , but I have yet to give it to him xDI love this little thing so much!It is FOR SURE not cheaply made.I ordered one of these before from another company and it fell apart the first day i was at Anime Land Wasabi . It said it had a metal plate on it but it was really plasticWEEEELLLLL with this one its for sure a metal plate . this thing is AMAZINGDo n't even look anywhere else for a better one because you wont find any better.Just click `` add to cart ''
 I love this wrist band so much . The only thing I do n't like is how if you bend the metal to form your wrist , you can see bends in it and it does n't look good . I ended up just flattening it again and having it slightly bent . I have a really small wrist so since it is n't bent all the way around , my wrist looks even smaller . I originally bought this to play tennis with but my coach said he did n't know what would happen if it was a sunny day and it might not be allowed in matches . I thought I could just play with it with the metal plate on the inside of my wrist but I ended up deciding to take it off and not take my chances . I bought two for tennis but since I ca n't wear them , I 'll just wear one around school because it still looks really cool ! So if you plan on buying this to wear during a sport , you may get called on to take it off since the metal is reflective . If not , it still looks cool to wear around town and school which is what I do now . The wrist band comes in a pack of one , so if you want one for each wrist , buy 2 .
 I got this for my brother , who loves Naruto . And if you 're an anime lover , you know how awesome it feels to own something that resembles a prop from your favorite anime . -- this is perfect for that , especially since Naruto wears it himself .
 A nice little wristband to have . What more can I say ... . I will buy again when the time comes .
 This is only one wristband , so be sure to order one for each wrist.This is actually sweatband material with a metal plate attached . I had to `` bend/form '' the metal plate so that it rounded more to my son 's wrist . As long as you are applying gentle pressure , the metal wo n't make a `` crease '' . My 10 year old loves them .
 excelent product met all my expectations ... ...
 My sons 7-18 all love these items , Naruto is the latest anime craze ... hit at school and with friends !!!
 Exactly as advertised . If you 're a Naruto nut , or like wristbands , I 'd advise buying this
 I really like these pants . They are relaxed enough to wear around all day but look nice enough that you can put a nice shirt on and be good to go . They are clearly not dress pants , but look smart enough to get by . I took them to England and wore them all day in London and then changed my shirt and went to the theater that night in them . They also have an interior , zippered , pocket that I really appreciated during all my traveling . I never worried about my wallet in there .
 Perfect fit - great for casual wear & hiking . This is my second pair and my old pair is still in good condition after heavy wear this last year .
 I like these slacks . Similar to , and nearly as good as , the now discontinuedColumbia Men 's Lander Pant . I liked the double inner seams of the Lander -- it placed the outer phone pocked on the side rather than under the leg when sitting , but the leg is loose enough on the Columbia Roc Pant to move the phone out of the way . Also , now the velcro on , and the narrowness of the phone pocket makes it hard to quickly pull the phone out . But , everything else seems the same . I still love these pants , just a little bit less now though .
 I got these pants primarily for golf . They fit well and come out of the dryer wrinkle free . Time will tell if they fray around the cuff like some other brands I have worn .
 I 've had my first pair for almost 3 years , and I love them . The fabric is a very tight weave that 's much more durable than denim , and they look much better than jeans . I 've worn them to church , business meetings , ice skating , and to do service calls where I 'm on my knees on nasty basement floors . I 've put on a few pounds so now my original 32 x 30 pair is a little tight in winter when I wear long-johns underneath and need to tuck in 3 shirts , so I just ordered my 2nd pair a little bigger , 33 x 30 . My favorite pants ever !
 sporty and stylish . you can wears these pants traveling or to work . very multi purpose and comfy.notes these are different from the new `` Utlimate ROC '' pants . These are thicker and have a different pocket config over the new version of the pants . by thicker , i mean these are what most would consider a normal thickness . the new version pants are noticeably thinnerthese have a single `` cargo pocket '' on the leg , but is not zipped . the new version has a zipper there . both of the `` cargo '' pockets are not big and bulky . you can put an iphone in each.these also have a zippered front pocket plus the normal front pockets . So one side is essentially a dual front pocket with one of the pockets having a zipper . the new version of the pants do not have this.both version of the pants are great . I have the grey -LRB- tundra -RRB- in the normal ROC and flax in the utlimate ROC .
 The pants are very durable and the fit is excellent . I have purchased Columbia products in the past that were of questionable quality ; but decide to give them a try again after saying that I would never buy another pair.They seemed to have improved their quality ; the design has always been top notch .
 My husband bought the first pair at TJ Maxx and he loves it . I searched online to get him a second pair . Good quality pants . Casual / business casual .
 If you thought jeans were the goto pants in your closet because of the comfort and durability factors , these pants might evolve your opinion . I wound up buying every color they have . They 're durable and incredibly comfortable . To me cargo pants make the wearer look like he has elephantitus or leg mumps . These have just enough extra pockets to be practical and useful without the bloat . The rear pockets have Velcro at the tops to keep them trim and closed . There 's an extra right side pocket with a zipper to secure your Platinum Card or Razor-micropod-GPS thingy . Not sure why these pants are n't water cooler talk , but after trying a pair you 'll wonder why also . Not crazy about the Roc Jeans version of these pants which I ordered by mistake . But you 'll probably feel Einsteinian after buying this version .
 I thoroughly enjoy these pants . I 've been actively looking for well built pants that I can wear doing weekend activities . These pants are better built than a ton of other gear I 've been through - including 5.11 , Woolrich , etc. . I think the best feature on these pants - which is n't shown in the pictures - is the security pocket on the right hand side -LRB- for me , the strong side -RRB- . This pocket , placed directly behind the front pocket -LRB- and not lower - or mid-thigh - like so many other manufacturer 's -RRB- has a strong zipper with a small knotted rope attached . The pocket is perfectly sized to carry a large cell phone - or any other item of equal size , such as an item that may fit in a Desantis Nemesis . My search for active weekend wear pants - which fit my lifestyle - is over . These are great .
 The Columbia name is quality at fair price . I have 2 pairs of these pants and they are tough pants that look good .
 I have loved Columbia ROC Pants since I bought my first pair 5 years ago . I recently ordered my 4th and 5th pairs . The oldest ones are getting too worn out for `` dressy '' occasions and have been relegated to work pants . I wear ROC pants for everything from business casual to hiking . Good looking , tough wearing , and very comfortable . I hope they never stop making them !
 These pants are rugged and look nice . They do wrinkle more than jeans , otherwise I would give 5 stars
 Received exactly what i ordered and it was just what I was expecting . Was satisfied and was not disappointed . Item was at a fair price and it arrived on time . No complaints and hassle free ordering . Would do it again .
 It 's very good and it fit me like I was looking for so thank youvery mucho and hope to buy more ... & iexcl ; & iexcl ; & iexcl ;
 These are great pants . My husband and son love them but the 34 &#34; inseam I ordered for my son is closer to 36 &#34; or 37 &#34; and the 32 &#34; pair I ordered for my husband is at least 34 &#34; . My husband had a pair already and I got the size from his older pair and these are considerably longer . I 'm going to have to get both pair altered but otherwise , they 're good sturdy pants at a good price . Not sure why they 're so long .
 Nice pants , generously sized - I often take a 36 waist , and the days of 34 are in the past ... except at LL Bean and with these.The leg pocket is inexplicably separated into two
 These shoe covers were a perfect alternative to purchasing the ruby slippers ! They were priced reasonably and were durable enough for a few performances , and will be great to keep around for Halloween . I was happy with the accurate description and timely service . I needed them for a dance recital and was happy that amazon had all the costumes I needed at the price range I could afford to spend .
 I gave these four stars because one bow fell off when we were getting ready to go trick-or-treating , so I sewed it back on . Before we got out the door the other one fell off . They did , however , work as a great substitute for having to buy another pair of shoes to go with the costume.They arrived quickly and my shopping experience with the seller was excellent .
 Exactly what I needed . What you see is what you get . This was a great buy to complete my costume .
 Case is very well made and with the travler in mind . I was at ease knowing all my information was together and easily found . Plenty of room to keep things well organized . Awesome product , fast shipping , and great service .
 This is my favorite diaper , especially for wearing coverless or with wool pants . I prefer these to kissaluvs for newborns . I made the mistake of stocking up on the small size for my last baby and really could have gone right into the mediums -LRB- she was 8lbs -RRB- . Because they have plenty of stretch these easily fit the entire first year . I think the snap problem mentioned before was probably just a faulty batch . I 'm pretty rough on my diapers and have n't had any trouble in 4 years with these , though I 've popped all the snaps off some of my covers . The main negative is that - like pretty much any fitted diaper - these take a long time to dry and would n't do that well on a clothesline .
 For some reason I 'm a big fan of this no-frill fitted diaper . It can get a little rough after a while , but I used some e-cover fabric softener -LRB- safe for cloth diapers -RRB- and it 's as good as new . It 's not the - most - absorbant , or the cutest , but it does the job and I love them for letting my 2-year-old run around coverless for a while . The price is better than most fitteds !
 We have a soft spot for anything Chessie ! The cats a beautiful and their story from WWII is very compelling . We collect things Chessie . My husband has a custom built 12x8 ft. train shed in the back yard . We have many different Chessie items . The logo and bright yellow/gold on the shirt make it a shirt you can wear anywhere .
 I have gotten 2 of these stretch leather belts . They have been the most comfortable belts I have ever had , and also look good . They have lasted well . The only problem seems to be that they are often hard to get and when I have ordered another one they could n't fill the order . I would certainly recommend this belt to anyone .
 My husband thinks this is the best thing since sliced bread . He 's a large man and comfort is important , however , so are looks . This is a winner in both . Thx
 Unfortunately , as happened to others , the belt was not in stock even though it showed in stock when I placed my order.The 2 week wait was worth it though . The `` stretchiness '' is cleverly hidden inside a thin leather sheath . It 's comfortable , conservative and handsome . I highly recommend it .
 These belts are a fantastic product and very high quality ... . beautiful leather with a good deal of stretch and should be VERY comfortable.THIS is reason for 5 star ... . BUT !!!! The website has incorrect sizing information ... STILL even after I contacted them about the problem the wrong sizing info is still there.NOW I notice the incorrect sizing info is STILL there along with the correct information at another location which is easily missed.As a result is it easy to order the belt thinking it will be the right size ... . BUT these belts are only available in huge sizes ~ 50 and larger .
 I had had a black for several years and needed a brown . They are elegant , very well made and stretch just enough to make them comfortable . I am very happy with this item .
 Husband does a lot of sitting and bending at work and LOVES these belts . Great quality .
 The belt is indeed leather , but it is somehow altered to be able to stretch like a rubber band , though just a little . This makes these belts very comfortable and durable and a pleasure to wear.Unfortunately , they are no longer made . When these last few sell out , there will be no more.BTW , I had reason to contact the Belt Outlet -LRB- the seller -RRB- , and they went above & beyond to help me with my question -LRB- how to find a size other than the ones listed here . Short answer
 I purchased this as part of a baby shower gift for a friend that runs an equestrian center . It was a big hit with her , as well as all of the shower attendees . It 's very cute and very well made !
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 I bought this set for my husband who does a lot of business traveling . He has been very pleased with it . I would recommend it for travel as well as home .
 This jacket is a great Jacket . It 's very similar to the more famous Carhartt brand but a fraction of the price . I live in the upper peninsula of Michigan and we are home to some infamous winters but this jacket can withstand the cold . Some may not like it because it has no hood but as for myself , I prefer to wear a good hat in winter . I 've noticed that Carhartts and even my other Dickies hooded jacket tend to fade very rapidly from washing . Especially the dark tan ones , even after one wash , they lose like 15 to 20 percent of their original color but I know some people like this because they become softer and less stiff . The Eisenhower , or at least the charcoal color one has yet to do this to me after about 5 or 6 washes . Overall , this jacket is a great jacket especially when you look at how low priced it is . But a word of caution before buying
 I bought my Ike jacket seven years ago after seeing one in the window of a uniform shop . I like the clean lines , the low price , the industrial strength , and the working class vibe of my jacket and I 've gotten compliments on it . Only recently have I started to notice the fabric wearing at the corners but it still has a few years of everyday wear left in it . To keep it clean I just put it through the washer and dryer with my regular laundry . If you want a light but warm jacket with a trim silhouette that transcends class boundaries this is the one .
 I work in Afghanistan where it does get cold so it 's heavy enough for thier winters but light enough to wear during the fall and spring cold snaps . I beat this piss out of this jacket ! It gets washed in an industrial machine with a detergant that is just south of battery acid and it still looks nice and the seems have held up fine . Great jacket !
 This coat does the job . The linner makes it very warm and the style makes it good for many different occassion and situation . The only thing I didnt like were the sleaves . They are a bit short and tend to rise up with any arm movement .
 Well made jacket . Rugged , fits well , insulated without weight . My husband was very pleased with it . This was a hit .
 One word of advice.As many have warned already , it is best to order your jacket one size larger than your t-shirt size.i.e I wear a XL tee and ordered a XXL jacket . I am broad-shouldered with a wide chest . This jacket fit me nice zipped and unzipped . -LRB- I previously had this same jacket as a XL and found the sleeves too short and the jacket was snug on me when zipped up . -RRB- Order 1 size larger is the best advice I can give . Perfect for mild weather and is the choice for Spring , Fall and chilly nights.Great jacket !!!
 I bought this jacket for my boyfriend , and he absolutely loves it ! He especially loves the inside pocket , which is a new addition to this particular Dickie 's style .
 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .

 I wore this dress to the New Year 's Eve Salsa Party and it was a great hit ! The color is a rich deep red , the style is unbelievably hot . The dress looks classier than the picture here . It hides the belly and really show off your legs , at the same time very comfortable to wear . I would recomment a little generous on the size , so it would not show the imperfection of your body , because the fabric is quite stretchable and the cut is quite free flowing . Overall this is better than what I expected for a dance dress for the price .
 Used this to make a Laika costume . so we only used the tail and the ears , but that said , they were superb .
 All Black hat with logo in the shape of a coin . Different look but kinda neat .
 beautiful pink n purple fuzzy hat looks black in the pic but its a pretty purple . . i loveit : -RRB-
 Finding the `` right '' leggings is almost as difficult as finding the right bra or swimsuit or pair of jeans ! The price of my favorite leggings shot up to $ 29.95 since the last time I bought them , so this time I bought four different kinds to test . Herein , I shall review all five options . As a point of reference , I am 5 ' 7 '' and weight 137 pounds . Black leggings are a staple in my wardrobe ; I wear them all the time .1 . Athletica `` City Lights '' ***** -LRB- five stars -RRB- Hands down , my favorites . Length , cut , and fit are all absolutely perfect . But as of this writing , the price is $ 29.95 for a pair . Leggings just should n't cost $ 30 ! 2 . Moontree `` Cotton Spandex Jersey Legging '' **** The length is good . The waist is in the right place . The cut is good . But something about these leggings makes me feel like `` this is what wearing Spanx must feel like '' . They are snug , but not in a way that makes me feel like I 'm wearing the wrong size . It feels like the snugness is part of the design , like in control-top pantyhose . -LRB- Remember those ? -RRB- Only the snugness is in the entire pair of leggings , calf to waist . They look great , but frankly they are almost a relief to peel off at the end of the day . And leggings just should n't feel that way . To me , one of the huge advantages of leggings is their comfort ; it 's like wearing a second skin . Still at $ 12.99 the price is right and they do look good .3 . Anne Klein `` Women 's Cotton Leggings '' **** I expected less from these leggings because the waist band is nearly twice as wide as what I 'm used to . It turned out not to bother me at all ! The fit is perfect . Length and waist are great . But the leggings started pilling almost immediately ! Usually , if I run my hands over my leggings , everything feels smooth . Within an hour of the first wearing -LRB- I washed them first -RRB- , these leggings had pervasive pilling . Still , they look great , feel good , and they are only $ 15.4 . Doublju `` Women 's Stylish Casual Ankle Cotton Span Leggings '' * The name of these leggings makes me wonder if there 's such a thing as formal leggings ! The waist is low . No , thanks . I want my leggings to stay put . I returned this pair .5 . Spalding `` Women 's Ankle Legging '' * I returned this pair also . The waist band was about two inches wide -LRB- ! -RRB- , yet the elastic inside the waist band was only about one centimeter wide . Picture that ! Anyway , because of the thin waistband which only looked seriously oversized , as I moved around the waistband pretty much went wherever it wanted . Thanks , but I like my leggings to stay put !
 I got my order in the mail today , fast delivery . I tried them on , and found the medium size to be a tab bit long . I am 5 '11 180 pounds . They are comfortable , and imo a good buy . Rated 4 instead of 5 stars due to the length .
 I have a closet with leggings from the best makers and these out-shine all of them . I love them so much that I 've gone back three times and bought more . These go all the way to the ankle instead of 3 inches above . They 're perfect !
 Finally , full-length leggings that are actually cut long ! Material is soft but still sturdy . I really love these and plan to buy more !
 I am very pleased to have ordered this item . it is to my satisfation.Womens Cotton Spandex Leggings by Athletica in your choice of color
 Great leggings without having to go store to store looking for the longer version instead of the `` capri '' version . Fast delivery . Second time I 've order from seller and will order from them again .
 Product is good but the small leggings are a bit on the large size . The leggings are soft and have good spring to them . They are white but not see thru . I will order again .
 I purchased these to have something to wear on cold days under my skirts and dresses . They were perfect and keep me warm when I have bus duty or have to be outside with my students .
 Best leggings I have ever purchased . These are perfect thickness , easy to put on & held up to the test of puppy claws jumping up on my legs with no snags . I am purchasing another pair after this review .
 I got theses today , they are gr8 , I am almost 5 ' 8 , these go to the ankles , I ordered the large , they are the perfect length , and although I have not worn them out yet , they seemed to me to fit like a glove , I will definitely get more of them , too , thanks to all the girls who gave a review , you were absolutely correct .
 Leggings look reasonably well , and are of a reasonable quality.If you are looking for something lightweight for the summer , or towear here in South Florida , these are for you.They tend to be a little bit long and if you are not particularly tall , -LRB- I am 5 ' 5 '' and stocky right now -RRB- you might have to shorten them.But for the money , they are still a great deal , if you do n't needsomething thick and short.So far they have lasted in the wash . . but I have n't been washing them forthat long to really give a good recommendation on that.I will come back and post again , if I find them to be flimsy in thewashing department .
 Great fit & quality , and other reviews noting they run rather long in the leg , 100 % correct and I could n't be happier about it . Normally , as I am tall , the leggings end up as capris , but not THIS pair ! Perfect for my yoga and pilates as well as pole exercise .
 These legging are pretty OK . However , they are SO long it seems they are for an 8 foot woman . I am average height and I have to roll up the bottoms which is not that bad they just look kinda funny . Also , the crotch is just a plain seam - no triangle sewed in for better comfort . You get what you pay for though ! Good price and American made .
 This product is great . For the price , the product is top quality . Thick , comfortable , and they are long enough to easily cover my ankles -LRB- which many leggings do n't . Thanks for a great buy !
 Being of an age to have seen leggings regarded as high fashion for the 2nd time around now -LRB- the first time was in the early 90s -RRB- , these are truly some of the BEST I 've ever owned . I got 2 pair and am so glad I did ! This wardrobe staple is true to size and fits PERFECTLY all the way from just below the navel down to the top of the foot . They 're very stretchy with a higher lycra % than most cotton spandex leggings you 'll find , and they 're well made of a quality material that is thick enough to give terrific coverage yet light enough to stay put and remain extremely cool in all weather . But as always , leggings are NOT trousers , so pairing them with a long tunic or a dress is recommended . And eventhough they are not at all see-through , `` phantoming through '' will happen when you bend over at the gym , so you 'll probably want to choose undergarments that provide the desired amount of coverage and are of a solid flesh-tone . :-RRB- They launder nicely on the gentle cycle and with tumble drying on low or cool . It was an OUTSTANDING shopping experience with this seller , too !!! A +
 Ordered these white leggings in Large . Received promptly . Nice fabric . Fit is close but not snug , with easy stretch and no `` baggy knees '' . Would purchase again .
 Exactly what I was looking for , and made of nice strong material , very comfy . I wear them alot , and they still show now wear .
 My very persnickety teenage daughter loves these . I am going to have to buy another pair for her . She wears them around the house as comfy lounge pants , under her jeans like long-underwear -LRB- she gets cold easy ! -RRB- , and in a few weeks when a dance style PE class starts up , she 'll be wearing them for that . She 's not inclined to wear as such , but they would work well with a long sweater or tunic top . A nice mid-weight material .
 These leggings are longer than most , which I appreciate . They are softer than most , which I appreciate . Besides that they are pretty costly for what they are They are fairly thin , which I find disappointing . At $ 30 a pair I wo n't be buying more . I 'm 5 ' 5 @ 150lbs . and a large was perfect so I would say they are true to size . I would recommend them if you can afford the cost for leggings that are already nearly see thru on arrival .
 These are comfortable and what they look like . I am short so there is a bit extra length , which I expect with most pants I buy . They are easy to wash . I wear them to yoga - and they are perfect there .
 designed for a real woman - ample stretch , good fit and sturdy fabric ! will be ordering more of these soon
 Very well made and warm ! They are true to size . You do not need to order larger than you normally would .
 These are so softy and comfy ... I can wear them with my boots or as a pj bottom ! So versitile ... we also ride motorcycles in the winter and they go so well under my jeans ! Love these !!!
 Thanks for offering Prime ! The material is fairly soft and true to size . Not loose around the legs , and plenty opaque enough that your underwear does to show through ; quite thickish material . Pretty good quality material .
 Legging slightly heavier than the grey version . Wore on a cooler day , 75 degrees.This company is very user friendly .
 I bought my leggings from Lands End for years , but they recently stopped carrying them . It has been very difficult to find a replacement anywhere , until I tried these out of desperation . They are a very suitable replacement at about 1/3 the price.I wore a medium from Lands End and the medium size of this product fits perfectly . These are longer than the Lands End leggings and that 's good for me . These have 2 % less spandex , but have plenty of stretch and recovery . These are not as heavy , but look great and appear to be just as durable.I 'm giving these the top rating because the value is good . At this price I can order in large quantities and always have nice leggings at hand .
 I 've been wearing leggings for years , and am alway looking for something that 's comfortable and will withstand the test of time . Do n't know yet if these leggings will last -LRB- since I just got them -RRB- , but they appear to be well-made . As other reviewers point out , these leggings are on the thin -LRB- material -RRB- side , but I actually like that . I 'm thinking I can wear these through more seasons , not just winter . One thing that surprised me , though , was the shipping cost . While the leggings are a great deal at at less than 10 bucks each , the shipping cost -LRB- to my home in Ohio -RRB- was $ 7.95 .
 Made in America . Priced right . Perfect thickness and tight fit . Excellent for working out , yoga , pilates , around the house or even for layering . They are basic but they are not cheaply made or lacking quality.cons
 Great value for the price
 The last reviewer is right . I searched and searched for leggings that were long enough for my 5 ' 10 '' frame . These are perfect . The legs are plenty long enough . I am very happy with these .
 I just bought these , have worn and washed once . So far so good . they are a little light weight , but I got them to wear under long tops , sweaters and skirts , so that is fine . they fit very nice . I have a problem with things being too short from waist to crotch , these fit . They are also long enough in the leg . I am happy with them and hope they hold up for a long time !
 Excellent product , delivered in record time . Thank you ! Will order some of these leggings for my sister .
 Though these pants are n't the warmest for cold weather by themselves , they are great for layering and hopefully summer wear . The material is not too thick and not too thin , and it fits comfortably - not tight at all . The waistband is very snug , and the shipping was very fast ... most likely the reason for the high shipping and handling costs .
 My order arrived 2 days early and it is worth the purchase ! They fit perfectly and the material feels comfortable !! I will order another very soon .
 Finally a great legging ... These leggings fit so well , they have the best &#34; coverage &#34; , as far as covering up winter pale , ugly veins , etc. . I 'm only 5 ' 3 &#34; , so I can bring them down under my heel if I want ... or leave them at my ankle ... they are designed so well and are have such a great fit , you can do that and they still feel wonderful and look the same . They have a wonderful silky texture , so clothing does n't hang up on them as you move .
 I will order more . They keep their shape , they fit true to size , they are soft and comfortabole . they are not sheer at all , oi ordered them in heather but will be ordering more olors . mine ripped in the crotch but i have washed them at least 100 times and also i 'm basically sure that they ripped because i was rough housing with my toddler and tried to be funny and do the splits . i dont think it was a defect in the pants .
 GREAT ... FITS ME VERY WELL ... I HAVE THIN LEGS BUT THE PRODUCT ADAPTS TO THAT . LIKE THE WEIGHT TOO . WISH I HAD MORE COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM . LAUNDERS WELL TOO .
 These leggings are just as described . The delivery was very quick and the leggings are so comfy . I put them on right away and have been loving them all day ! They feel soft and have n't sagged on the knees or butt after a whole day 's wear . Would definitely recommend .
 I 've had these leggings for about 2 months now . I wash on gentle and hang dry -LRB- like I do all these types of things as it makes them last so much longer -RRB- . They do sit a little below the waist , but that seems to be the current style and it 's not too low . The legs are long which is great for me because most leggings are too short and then my ankles get cold . Not with these ! I do n't wear them barefoot , so do n't know if the long length would be a problem . I really like the price , and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition . I wish I 'd bought two of them as I sleep in them as well . Recommended .
 These are some of the most comfortable leggings I 've had in a very long time . They are long enough so that when you sit or bend over - they do n't feel like they are riding up . They fit comfortably and do n't sag at the knees after wearing all day . Love these to just lounge around and work around the house in .
 7/2/12I am a plus size lady and I needed to find some leggings that fit me . I had found some at Layne Bryant for around $ 30 but after one use it had a hole in it . So I returned it because the quality was absolutely ridiculous . I was not going to spend $ 30 on cheap material that wont even last a day of use.So I came on amazon because lets face it , they have everything on here . Looked up some XL Leggings and what do you know they had it for HALF the price . I bought it and when I received the leggings they fit fine . Longer than I would have liked to have them but hey I 'm only 5 ' 5 '' . I have been wearing them for weeks and no sign of wear or tear yet . Much better quality for a much better price . The plus size stores are a rip off and just take your money for poor quality goods.These will do you just fine and they are great once you break them in . : -RRB- 11/9/12Follow up : I still have the leggings they have not torn or shrunk . Minor fading but nothing major . They wash just fine and the seams are still in tacked . I wear my leggings very often like maybe 4 days out of the week and sometimes I sleep in them . They are still working just fine and I am having no issues with them whatsoever.I am surprised however to see that the price doubled . I do not approve of people increasing the price of a product just because they can . We have enough inflation as is on thing that we cant not live without . : / I wish I had bought a few pairs cause now the price is to high for my taste . I think around $ 16 was a fair price $ 30 is a steep price for leggings . I suppose if you desperately need a pair that fit then it may be worth it . However , the importance of leggings varies depending on the person . If you have the money go for it . If you are poor like me look around for a more affordable pair lol . Just being honest . : P
 These leggings are nice and pretty good quality . They are not see-through unless you buy them too small . Mine fit perfectly . The legs are a little long -LRB- and I 'm 5 ' 8 -RRB- but I like them that way . Good quality . Really like them .
 The leggings are well made and fit well -- actually , perfectly . I ordered them about a week ago and am wearing them now . They match the quality of leggings sold at twice the price . They 're comfortable and look great . I 'm very pleased with the quality and speed of delivery -- and will doubtless order another pair before the really cold weather arrives.They must be great if they make me look forward to winter with pleasure !
 After a couple of failed attempts with other brands , I found this one . An Amazon notice popped up saying I 'd ordered this product from them years ago and sure enough they are the same product . I still have several of the older ones but after years of daily use , the occasional mishap with bleach and eventual fading , I wanted fresh new leggings that fit the same way . I had found another brand I liked but when I went to order more , they were sized differently , short in length and I the crotch , very uncomfortable , sent back 10 pairs at $ 20 each , Spiegel claimed they never got them . $ 200 gone forever . I 'll never shop with Spiegel again . These , on the other hand , fit beautifully , just the way they made them years ago . Long , thin , high waisted . Beautiful ! Sexy around the house with a tank top or under a skirt in public . A great extra layer under pants for those of us who get cold easily . I ordered 10 and may order 10 more . I love them !
 I bought several pairs of these leggins nearly 2 years ago . Even with weekly washing and drying , they are in great shape . The keep me warm , as I 'm the cold blooded type . They do n't sag or creep . Will be ordering more.Update
 I really like these pants . I use them as long johns so it is important that they fit tight without a bulky waistband . I 'm about to order several more pair and toss my old ones from the 90 's that are full of holes . -LRB- Until I found these , they were the best I could do ! -RRB-
 Perfect thickness and tight fit . Excellent for working out . They are of good quality and look good as well !
 These leggins are good quality and hard to find where I live . I will order more .
 These are nice leggings...light-to-medium thickness ... perfect for Spring and Summer in areas with moderate to hot climates . I have thicker thighs and , even though these are n't the thickest leggings , the coverage is adequate . I have n't had them long enough to comment about their durability , but they appear to be well-made , so my fingers are crossed for them to last a while . So I 'd consider these leggings a good value .
 These Cotton Spandex Leggings are comfortable and seem to hold up well after washing . Overall , I am satisfied with this purchase .
 solid color , a little show through on the butt area however they are thick enough to not be mistaken for stockings .
 leggings , boots and long shirts are my winter uniform , so i have several pair . These are my favorite because they are LONG enough - legs and crotch , NOT TOO BIG IN THE WAIST like several other -LRB- cheaper and more expensive -RRB- pair that i seem always to be `` pulling up '' , NICE LOOKING , WELL MADE , and the most COMFORTABLE . i bought the black ones and am ordering dark gray . sure wish they had more -LSB- dark -RSB- colors !
 These are terrific leggings because of the cotton/spandex combination . I am living in them this winter .
 Great product . Lots of my fishing friends that are full-time guides wear this product . It 's not too expensive , keeps your warm and can take a beating . The product seems to run a bit on the big size , but I would n't downsize to a smaller size .
 My husband has been wearing carpenter jeans for over 30 years & Ive tried every brand over the yrs ! He loves the fit , the feel & tough feel -LRB- durability -RRB- ! True to fit buy them for your carpenter
 I have come to count on Dickies for work pants , that are comfortable , but more importantly , dependable . I have worn other pantsand either the belt loops break or they wear out quickly . I also have found that I can depend upon Amazon for great prices , products , and service.Donald
 When I recieved these pants I was surprised because a couple reviews said they were stiff I did n't think so they fit good I like the thrid stitching in them makes my know they will or should last awhile .
 They are what they are . Great work pants . Just wash them a few times to soften them up . And they will be comfortable .
 I 'm a regular size of guy but am hard on jeans with my daily work . These jeans have been real good in the past ; they fit well with flexing space and have held up as well as top name brands . These pants this time are not as heavy a cloth weight as I thought it would be compared to past . I got what I paid for a little cheaper some place in the manufacturing . Time will tell if they hold in there but with winter coming in now I will have over pants over them all winter and will not see the wear and tear that summer does . I did see that the stock number of the pant was different then the last ones I bought so ... I was thinking something had to be different other then the savings of $ 7 a pair . But I did enjoy the free shipping !
 And it 's good jean to work and play . I wore it to the mountain when it snowed and hiked wearing this pants and just slide down the snow covered hill on my bums . It 's tough and stain resistant , too .
 I bought these for my husband and he loves them !!! It is hard to find basic REAL carpenter jeans these days . These are really nice and the cost is more in line with work jeans rather than the ` fashion ' version of carpenter pants .
 The new , indigo denim material wears much better than the stone washed , more stylish `` faded '' denim . Comfortable , great pockets , straight legs , not tapered . Stylish in a casual way .
 I buy these for my husband 's work pants . He works for a local gas utility , is on his knees a lot . They are rugged , wash pretty well and the pockets are deeper than most jeans of this type . I just wish they would hold their color longer . I get him 5 pair a year and with the frequent washing , they do n't seem to hold the deep indigo color for long . But , for work pants , the price is right and the material is sturdy .
 These jeans fit very comfortably . They are soft , not stiff and heavy like most . Good for summer wear . The additional pockets are a definite plus . I would highly recommend trying them .
 I PURCHASED FIVE DICKIES MEN 'S RIGID CARPENTERS JEANS TO WORK IN AND I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH WHAT I GOT . THE PANTS ARE COMFORTABLE AND STRONG .
 Bought these for my son and they fit right first try which is hard to do with my son and they were good looking quality overall and at the right price as well and he is still wearig them today withuot problems though not as dark blue as they once were of course . Would recommend fro buyinig for anyone needing some good work jeans .
 Working environment for a long time can not be replaced , there is no time to clean , this is very suitable , cheap , good workmanship , beautiful , all this takes less than $ 20
 I 've been wearing these jeans for a month and have no complains . Their are well made . If you 're looking for a soft kind of jeans than these are not for you .
 I bought these for my husband , who LOVES his flannel-lined denim Dickies . These are nice but they do n't wash up as well as I 'd like ... they are very wrinkled when they come out of the dryer . I actually have ironed these ... and it seems pretty silly to iron work jeans -LRB- or ANY jeans !! -RRB- .
 I did n't notice they were relaxed fit , but that was my mistake . Product was okay . I need to pay more attention on next order .
 These jeans are triple sown and are made of heavy denim . They fit well and are , for now , my favorite pair of jeans .
 Not much to say about pants , other than if they fit , they fit , which these do , for me , a tall thin guy.The material is thin , which i like in hot climate.They 're around 20 bucks , so the price is goodThey 've got 7 belt loops , long thin pockets running on the sides u can drop a tool or cell phone in , and a cloth ` hook ' that u could conceivably drop a hammer or stg in if you 're a carpenter or whatever . i 'm not , and i 've never used it.The indigo color is dark , but fades pretty quickly.For normal use , these 'll last a long time before they tear in the knees .
 I took these on a 4 week trip , where I could only take one pair of pants . They held up marvelously . I 've been wearing them for a year after that too , and they 're showing very few signs of wear . The only thing I 'd say , is that they were pretty stiff when I first got them . I put them through the wash twice , which softened them up !
 They are a little stiff at first but after a few washes , it 's perfect . Very durable , and looks good too .
 you ca n't go wrong with a brand name like dickies . good fit nice jeans yes i would buy these again .
 Great jeans , I bought two pair about a year ago , and just logged on to buy a couple more pair . I work construction , and they 've held up great . The little pockets near the right knee wore out on mine , that 's why I 'm ordering more . I do n't blame the design \ dickies , I keep a screwdriver in there most the time , pointed down , so I can grab the handle quickly , and the point has worn through the fabric and now falls through . I recommend .
 these are the classic style jeans . white stitching , deep indigo color.great pants , even if they did come a little stiff . wash a few times and they soften right up . good pants .
 Dickies manufactures a variety of utility pants with different fabric & texture ranging from what feels like hard canvas to very soft denim.These jeans are comfortable blue 100 % cotton denim that soften up with use and hold up well in tough conditions . They fit well in the waist & gluts with a relaxed fit in the legs & groin allowing freedom of movement . I have worn Dickies carpenter & Painters pants for years & these pants are true to size unlike some other brands.I bought these jeans for working and they serve that purpose very well . They are not a pair of jeans I would wear for a night out but I have no problem wearing them for general running around . For me the color has only lightened up a little , the way I would expect from cotton after many washes . I do only wash them in cold water and I 'm sure that helps . They do as one review mentioned , come out of the dryer wrinkled more that my Levi or Eddie Bauer jeans for the first 5 or so washed but then smooth out about the same.For this price , I do n't think you can buy a better pair of utility jeans . If your looking for designer pants with utility pockets , this is n't for you !
 I bought a pair for working in our manufacturing site , now all the girls want them ! Extremly comfortable , and kind-a cute .
 they 're a bit stiff when you first get them so you might want to wash them twice . But I love the cell phone pocket -LRB- s -RRB- on the leg it frees up another pocket for day to day stuff and they 're comfortable and look nice . They have a nice rich color that makes them look stylish . I like them a lot .
 The heavy denim material seems to wear really well and the workmanship is excellent . For a working man or for someone hard on pants , these are the jeans to buy , for they may last for many years . There are plenty of pockets , but the legs are a little baggy for the average-built person , still they look really nice.Hard-core denim wearers , here are the jeans for you !
 My husband loves these jeans . They look great on , they 're a great fit , and they come in handy when working on projects . Just an overall great pair of jeans .
 These are great work jeans being very rugged . They are not terribly stylish , though , with the tapered leg and the color of the blue . So do n't buy them with the expectation that they will be your cool , going-out carpenter jeans . Also , they are a bit stiff at first but are still comfortable and do loosen up after a few washes .
 This is what i needed for working around the house with room to bend over and get things out of the pockets .
 Hubby was unsure when I told him to check Amazon when he needed new jeans . So he went to the site and found what he thought would work and was amazed after he wore them several times . He loves them and so far no tears etc. and believe me most of his other jeans did get torn .
 I own about seven of these!Great all weather hats , very cool in the summer , and I like the fact that they can be washed on a gentle cycle .
 When I was a beginner to belly dance , I wanted a hip scarf that would n't break the bank -LRB- just in case I did n't like it , and would never need to wear my scarf again ! -RRB- This was a great option ... it 's so cheap ! They 're simple , but nice and the coins stay on pretty well -LRB- even the expensive ones fall off when you shake around a lot -RRB- . My biggest complaint was that the styles and sizes are very inconsistant . I ordered three and the are all differently styled and sized . Overall , though , this is a great option for the starter not willing to make a huge investment.Enjoy the dance !
 I recently started belly dancing , and I did n't want to have to borrow my friends hip scarves anymore , so I found this and thought it was an awesome price.Well after trying it out I 'm not 100 % impressed , because the coins do n't reach around completely so it does n't make as cool of a jingly sound as I wanted.But other than that it works great and the coins are n't threating to fall off .
 I wanted a scarf to practice with and this is perfect .
 Just got my hip scarf in the mail today . It is very pretty , I love the way the coins sounds . Tho , the scarf looks cheaply made , -LRB- what do expect for only 9.99 -RRB- It is a bargin . Most scarfs are 30 dollars are more . I think it should be okay if you keep it in good shape . I just started belly dancing , having the scarf makes it even more fun .
 Great for beginners , priced well , unless you have very wide hips . I suggest that you also buy some spare coins as all coin skirts lose a few here and there . All those shimmy 's shake them loose . Hungry Lion Imports , where these hip scarves come from sells spares .
 If you are a belly dancer , this is a terrific scarf for lessons/practice sessions . Sturdy fabric , coins sewn on well , attractive . You can definitely tell when I 'm doing a ` hard ' hip shake !!
 This scarf is ok for practice scarf . The one I rec 'd was slightly shorter than advertised so if your looking for a longer scarf , these are probably not the best choice . But the color was nice , and so far the coins have held up under the stress of dance practice.Good purchase for an `` economy price '' .
 I had to look closely to find the flaws in the scarves that I ordered . The price is excellent and the service is prompt ! I will not hesitate to order from this company again .
 Prettier than I thought it would be from picture.Haven ' t used it yet . I bought the Belly Dance for Beginners DVDand will wear it then .
 These scarves are good quality and very reasonably priced I will be buying more!I would recommend these scarves !
 I am so please with this product !!! It came really fast and was perfect for my needs , Ive recommended it to several people in my beginners belly dancing class and I 'll be ordering a few more in different colors . This is a great deal !
 In general , a pretty good product . I did n't lose any beads the first time I danced with it and I liked the choices of colors . It does look inexpensive and the beads do n't add a lot of weight -LRB- which can be helpful with dancing -RRB- . It 's a great option for beginners who are n't ready to commit to more expensives scarves .
 For the price , this is great . It is much nicer than I expected to it be .
 I absolutely love these hip scarves ! Yes , they are great for belly dancing -- especially for practice . I also love to use them in erotic dance and strip-tease routines . They are great for hiding a sexy g-string or sheer panties . They also make good bikini cover-ups at the beach or the pool . Buy them in several colors and experiment with using them in different ways !
 I 'm taking a beginner 's belly dance class and do n't want to invest in an expensive hip scarf for an 8 week class . These inexpensive hip scarves are just what I needed .
 These are great for beginners . Yes , they are irregular and some make more noise than others , but for beginners and for practicing they are great . It is a good purchase for the price . If you do not mind the irregularities , you will be happy with these scarves !
 Great scarf , great price ! It has three rows of coins that really jingle ! None of the coins have fallen off yet , I 've used a little bit doing a video and practicing shimmies.The scarf is WAY better in person ! Very pretty !!! No complaints !
 My teenaged daughter and I just started belly dancing classes and after paying for the classes , I could n't also afford two of the thirty dollar scarves our teacher was selling ... I found these and they are just perfect !! Beautiful bright colors and ca n't beat the price .
 Obviously for $ 10 it 's not a performance scarf , but it is exceptional quality . I 've already worn it about 5 times , and no coins are falling off , no thread is ripping , and it is very durable . Very good buy -LRB- I 've bought more than one -RRB- .
 Nice pc for the money . Note if your over a size 16 this will not work for you . Its cool for the money good to practice in .
 The product is exactly what was advertised and came quickly . I had no problems and will certainly order again .
 I read the other reviews and was a little scared to order these scarfs . However , I am glad I did . Eventhough the package came stating that these were lower than seconds ... . I did not think so . They were absolutely fine . No missing coins ... no missing beads . They were absolutely great . I ordered the pack of five . They immediately shipped out too . I recieved them in less than a week using standard shipping . That was great . I am just getting in to belly dancing so these scarfs will do well for me . I was not disappointed at all . These scarfs were a great value . Also they are large enough for just about any hip size . I am a size 14 and my daughter is a size 26 . Both of us can wear them with no problem .
 I bought 6 of these for the students in my class to use and they loved them . They are very nice and actually look better in person than online . Coins jingle very well and add to the fun of bellydancing . I would definately recommend these and may be purchasing more in the future .
 The scarves are absolutely beautiful . If there are imperfections , I am at a loss to find them . This has been an exceptional experience with seller and I hope to shop again . Thank you .
 I take this on all my trips -LRB- and I do travel often -RRB- and it has come quite in handy . I like the interior and exterior leather smoothness and there is plenty of space for all my toiletry needs . Fits into my bag well and it looks nice too so its a wonderful piece of luggage
 This item is really good for the price . The quality of this T-Shirts is also nice . The appearence also looks like some expensive T-Shirts . Thanks for dealsforthisweek website for posting this deal .
 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!
 I ca n't remember the last time I saw an item of clothing with a tag that listed the USA as the country of origin . You can not beat the price and this shirt is 100 % medium weight cotton !
 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 Good looking tie . Holds shape well . I bought it and am glad I did . Get a red one with it .
 Bought these for my daughter-in-law and she told me they fit and feel great on her . She rides her horse and loves the way the jeans feel as she rides .
 I love these jeans ! They are my new favorites . They are true to size and just the right length !

 These sunglasses are the best fit for my face that I could find . I had owned this exact pair previously and lost them kyaking . Ray Bans are always quality . They are easy on the eyes and the polarization of the lenses makes all the difference in color and clarity . The style is very cool and not so trendy that they will need to be replaced for next season . I would highly reccommend these sunglasses . FYI I ordered the `` small '' size and they fit perfectly on a woman 's face .
 i just bought this for my little brother , and he is in love with his new Ray Ban ! . This is the complete set
 I really love these glasses and am kicking myself for waiting so long to buy them.I am somewhat petite so size I chose was small and they fit my heart shaped face perfectly!One of the things I love most , beside the awesome optics , is the lightweight feel of these glasses.Cannot stand tight or heavy sunglasses as they always give me headaches , so these are perfect !!
 El producto era lo que yo esperaba . Cien por ciento originales en excelentes condiciones . Muchas gracias por el env&iacute;o hasta Guatemala
 Entrega en tiempo establecido por el vendedor , producto nuevo y en perfecto estado y correctamente embalado . Compre con toda confianza
 My daughter-in-law asked for these sunglasses for Christmas . They look great , and she was very pleased with them . The color is true to description .
 This sunglases are very nice and they looks very well on mi !!! I like it ! like them a lot.the model is modern .
 Hubby absolutely loved them , he 's had this same model in the past but were too scratched so i got them for him in a different color . !!
 I absolutely love these sunglasses . These were a replacement for a pair I lost while swimming in a lake . The originals were actually a little too big . This is why I lost them . Ordering through Amazon , I was able to get a pair just like the originals that fit and at a better price . Ca n't beat that !

 I recently started belly dancing , and I did n't want to have to borrow my friends hip scarves anymore , so I found this and thought it was an awesome price.Well after trying it out I 'm not 100 % impressed , because the coins do n't reach around completely so it does n't make as cool of a jingly sound as I wanted.But other than that it works great and the coins are n't threating to fall off .
 I wanted a scarf to practice with and this is perfect .
 Just got my hip scarf in the mail today . It is very pretty , I love the way the coins sounds . Tho , the scarf looks cheaply made , -LRB- what do expect for only 9.99 -RRB- It is a bargin . Most scarfs are 30 dollars are more . I think it should be okay if you keep it in good shape . I just started belly dancing , having the scarf makes it even more fun .
 Great for beginners , priced well , unless you have very wide hips . I suggest that you also buy some spare coins as all coin skirts lose a few here and there . All those shimmy 's shake them loose . Hungry Lion Imports , where these hip scarves come from sells spares .
 If you are a belly dancer , this is a terrific scarf for lessons/practice sessions . Sturdy fabric , coins sewn on well , attractive . You can definitely tell when I 'm doing a ` hard ' hip shake !!
 This scarf is ok for practice scarf . The one I rec 'd was slightly shorter than advertised so if your looking for a longer scarf , these are probably not the best choice . But the color was nice , and so far the coins have held up under the stress of dance practice.Good purchase for an `` economy price '' .
 I had to look closely to find the flaws in the scarves that I ordered . The price is excellent and the service is prompt ! I will not hesitate to order from this company again .
 Duck , the right length etc. . I 'm sixty five and have settled on these as the default garment for my young ass . Over .
 These shorts are great due to a few reasons :1 . They are not blue denim . After wearing blue denim for 30 years , I opted for solids in other colors . They are easier on the eye and appear more adult-like than denim .2 . The cotton is very heavy duty . I wore these extensively in both desert and tropical climates and they held up very well . Nearly indestructible . This is why the material is so popular with the building and construction trades .3 . You ca n't beat the value .4 . The right-side pockets are great for cell phones , pocket combs , ink pens , etc. . . I did n't want cargo shorts , but I did need a little more utility than standard , four-pocket shorts . I could never go back to four-pockets shorts , due to the utility offered by the side pockets.The only drawback to these shorts is the chafing they can cause to the back of the knee . The cut falls precisely to the back of my knee and the material really chafes the skin quite badly . I would suggest Dickies raise the inseam two inches , especially since the cut is a little long for the generation graduating past denim . The comfort zone for 45 + crowd is above the knee , but Dickies seems to be moving more toward the ever-increasing length as with Tom Brady 's Capri pants . Dickies should take two inches of these and market them to the older crowd , while still offering the longer versions to the urban youth market . Just by having two different lengths they can market to the young and `` mature '' alike.Thanks for reading .
 These shorts are made of quality material very comfortable , good length just short of the knees . The front pockets are deep but a little tight to access quicklly to retrive your phone
 I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it -- it is a staple of my business wardrobe . Well made , quality fabric , nicely tailored , classic lines , appropriate for a professional woman . -LRB- something that can be hard to find at times -RRB- It should be noted , however , that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely , but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the `` classic '' colors -LRB- lighter -RRB- and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown , navy , camel , red and ivory . It 's still a good value , particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates , but I was a bit surprised .
 This is so cute , very pretty fabric . they 're about 1.50 inch and its a alligator clip . I got it in a three diffrenet colors
 too big for a 2 year old spiderman , but he wears them anyway
 This little backpack was exactly what I was looking for ; a casual piece that goes well with jeans , etc that I can use when shopping or any time that I need both hands free . It fits a wallet , keys , blackberry with room for a few other small items . I 'm really happy with it .
 When I was a beginner to belly dance , I wanted a hip scarf that would n't break the bank -LRB- just in case I did n't like it , and would never need to wear my scarf again ! -RRB- This was a great option ... it 's so cheap ! They 're simple , but nice and the coins stay on pretty well -LRB- even the expensive ones fall off when you shake around a lot -RRB- . My biggest complaint was that the styles and sizes are very inconsistant . I ordered three and the are all differently styled and sized . Overall , though , this is a great option for the starter not willing to make a huge investment.Enjoy the dance !

 Prettier than I thought it would be from picture.Haven ' t used it yet . I bought the Belly Dance for Beginners DVDand will wear it then .
 These scarves are good quality and very reasonably priced I will be buying more!I would recommend these scarves !
 I am so please with this product !!! It came really fast and was perfect for my needs , Ive recommended it to several people in my beginners belly dancing class and I 'll be ordering a few more in different colors . This is a great deal !
 In general , a pretty good product . I did n't lose any beads the first time I danced with it and I liked the choices of colors . It does look inexpensive and the beads do n't add a lot of weight -LRB- which can be helpful with dancing -RRB- . It 's a great option for beginners who are n't ready to commit to more expensives scarves .
 For the price , this is great . It is much nicer than I expected to it be .
 I absolutely love these hip scarves ! Yes , they are great for belly dancing -- especially for practice . I also love to use them in erotic dance and strip-tease routines . They are great for hiding a sexy g-string or sheer panties . They also make good bikini cover-ups at the beach or the pool . Buy them in several colors and experiment with using them in different ways !
 I 'm taking a beginner 's belly dance class and do n't want to invest in an expensive hip scarf for an 8 week class . These inexpensive hip scarves are just what I needed .
 These are great for beginners . Yes , they are irregular and some make more noise than others , but for beginners and for practicing they are great . It is a good purchase for the price . If you do not mind the irregularities , you will be happy with these scarves !
 Great scarf , great price ! It has three rows of coins that really jingle ! None of the coins have fallen off yet , I 've used a little bit doing a video and practicing shimmies.The scarf is WAY better in person ! Very pretty !!! No complaints !
 My teenaged daughter and I just started belly dancing classes and after paying for the classes , I could n't also afford two of the thirty dollar scarves our teacher was selling ... I found these and they are just perfect !! Beautiful bright colors and ca n't beat the price .
 Obviously for $ 10 it 's not a performance scarf , but it is exceptional quality . I 've already worn it about 5 times , and no coins are falling off , no thread is ripping , and it is very durable . Very good buy -LRB- I 've bought more than one -RRB- .
 Nice pc for the money . Note if your over a size 16 this will not work for you . Its cool for the money good to practice in .
 The product is exactly what was advertised and came quickly . I had no problems and will certainly order again .
 I read the other reviews and was a little scared to order these scarfs . However , I am glad I did . Eventhough the package came stating that these were lower than seconds ... . I did not think so . They were absolutely fine . No missing coins ... no missing beads . They were absolutely great . I ordered the pack of five . They immediately shipped out too . I recieved them in less than a week using standard shipping . That was great . I am just getting in to belly dancing so these scarfs will do well for me . I was not disappointed at all . These scarfs were a great value . Also they are large enough for just about any hip size . I am a size 14 and my daughter is a size 26 . Both of us can wear them with no problem .
 I bought 6 of these for the students in my class to use and they loved them . They are very nice and actually look better in person than online . Coins jingle very well and add to the fun of bellydancing . I would definately recommend these and may be purchasing more in the future .
 The scarves are absolutely beautiful . If there are imperfections , I am at a loss to find them . This has been an exceptional experience with seller and I hope to shop again . Thank you .
 This was my first purchase of a thong and I 'm so impressed with how comfortable it is to wear . The fit is great too .
 This thong is perfect !! I was a little skeptical about thongs because it seems like they would be uncomfortable . But its exactly the opposite . They provide lots of support where needed and you do n't have to worry about having lots of extra material . You feel like ur not even wearing anything underneath at all . Plus these underwear are super sexy and u wont stop looking @ how huge ur cock looks in the mirror . Dont worry about the string in the back its very comfortable and u dont get the feeling like u have a wedgy . The package is plenty big and it stretches well . Even for us guys who have cocks like stallions , it perfectly fit my 10 + inch erect dick in the pouch . So i would def suggest this to men who have a monster cock and huge balls . Im not sure why men wearing thongs in our society is so weird because they def feel better than briefs and boxer briefs . Wearing a thong makes u feel horny all the time , it brightens ur day !! This thong if def for those who are in shape . This is the most comfortable thong ever . Plus Im not gay , i just like the feeling of having nothing on under my clothes .
 Great feel and support . Fantastic on the tennis court or ocean swimming . They are so comfortable , I often forget I have them on .
 I buoght this thong out just to try it ... I am a big fan of underwear and want to try on every style . I was vey skeptical of this at first , I mean it is a thong . I got it , in a nice little package too . Tried it on . WOW ! I didnt know thongs were this comfortable , much better than jockstraps . I might even by more . The only thing I dont like is that the pouch is a little small , but this is a problem with alot of underwear . Especially if you happen to get a little too excited , your member seems to peek outside the top , and theats when it becomes unfortable . It is a must try for ALL guys ... yes , us straight ones too .
 These are my single favorite pair of underwear . Not your typical jock but much more comfortable and stylish . I 'm in the military so at first I thought `` thongs are not for `` real men '' but after wearing these I found they are , and a lot more guys wear thongs and jocks than you realize . I wear these for every day activivties , sports , work , and leisure . There is n't much fabric so they 're great under jeans and my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy . After wearing them for a while it 's like nothing is there because they support you only where you need it . If you 've never owned a thong , I think you should give these a shot.I definately recomend the - IN2 Y-back thong .
 Great product . Lots of my fishing friends that are full-time guides wear this product . It 's not too expensive , keeps your warm and can take a beating . The product seems to run a bit on the big size , but I would n't downsize to a smaller size .

 I bought this for my 2 yr old niece . She liked it , it was a pretty costume . I did not see any one else with this costume .
 This item is really good for the price . The quality of this T-Shirts is also nice . The appearence also looks like some expensive T-Shirts . Thanks for dealsforthisweek website for posting this deal .
 They are great quality-thanks Amazon !!! I bought 5 and plan to get more !!!
 I ca n't remember the last time I saw an item of clothing with a tag that listed the USA as the country of origin . You can not beat the price and this shirt is 100 % medium weight cotton !
 I found this shirt on sale with free shipping . I have not been disappointed at all . It has not faded much at all
 I bought 6 and found them to be one of the greatest buys I 've ever made on the internet.The fit was perfect and the fabric so luxurious to wear.Thank you Amazon foroffering such quality and value .
 When the color says Mint , it really is Mint . The picture makes it look much lighter . Its still a very cute set though !
 My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out . I was very skeptical of the `` no ironing '' claim . I could n't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen . The material is truly miraculous . We both love this product and plan to buy more . Thank you , Jos. Banks !
 I own three of these shirts and they are great . I get my shirts cleaned and pressed and here is an example of what great shirts they are
 I own two of these Traveler non-wrinkle shirts and they are absolutely the best shirts I have ever owned . They are of high quality material and the size I bought was right on the money . The colors offered are very versatile with just about anything a person would own and can be worn formally or casually . I am going to stick with buying more of these shirts .
 I bought 2 to begin with and now own seven and I ca n't see myself buying other dress shirts
 I received this shirt as a gift over Christmas . Since then I have bought two more . The fit is outstanding and I have never felt a finer material in a dress shirt - it is soft yet sturdy and always appears pressed . The iron free is for real . I hate ironing and will pay the extra 20 dollars per shirt to never have to dry clean or iron again . I will never buy another shirt and I almost want to throw away my non-iron free dress shirts . I highly recommend this shirt . You will enjoy it and probably buy more of them .
 These dress shirts are the best ! Wrinkle-Free , Breathable , Durable Material , Plus lots of styles , sizes and color options . Compare side-by-side to other dress shirts and you 'll see and feel the difference .
 I love the U.S. military , the Navy and the Marines in particular . Another reason why I got this shirt is because my family is mainly maritime . While I like the shirt very much , I wish more Large size shirts had been available . That was the only drawback . I would recommend this shirt to people who like the Navy , are in the Navy or know someone in the Navy .
 Incredible deal on this soft , nicely made jacket that goes with just about everything in my closet . I took the suede ties off and it `` hangs '' just right without them . Equally nice with jeans or skirts . This one works , ladies ! The large fits me fine , I 'm 5 ' 9 '' and weigh about 130 .
 A fun , lightweight suede jacket . It is 100 % leather and requires professional cleaning . I bought the peridou which is not as vibrant as pictured but is still a versatile , multi-seasonal color . I usually wear an 8 and ordered a Medium which fit perfectly in length and width , even through the arms . At just under twenty dollars , this jacket adds color and flair to a variety of outfits .
 You can not go wrong at this price ! I agree with the other reviewers who wrote that the sleeves/arm holes/shoulders were a bit snug . I own a few other Brandon Thomas suede tops in size Small , so that 's what I had ordered but I ended up returning it for a Medium . In this particular jacket I preferred the fit and ease of the Medium . FYI the suede ties are just looped through the grommets so you can adjust or remove as you wish .
 I love this jacket ! I 've gotten lots of compliments when I wear it . The leather is very soft and the jacket is warm . You could wear this in the fall when it starts getting chilly . The color cayenne is kind of rust or burnt orange . Very pretty .
 Truly a classy , well made jacket . Absolutely great value for the price !! The only downside is the `` chemical-like '' smell left over from processing the suede ??? I am hopeful the smell will disipate in time ??? Nevertheless , truly a steal of a deal !!! Lucky me .
 I was very pleased with this jacket . The style is wonderful ! I found it to be true to size , but the arms were a little snug . It was a fabulous price ! It is a definite keeper !
 I am thrilled with this lined , suede jacket with oversized , decorative grommets ! The fit was perfect - I got a `` small '' and I usually wear size 6-8 Petite . Looks great with jeans or dress pants .
 Lovely jacket . As described . However , fits snugly around the shoulders and sleeves . Would be best if worn with a sleeveless tee underneath .
 From the time I pulled it out of the box , I absolutely loved it . It smelled great , and fit perfectly . Lots of compliments !
 I got this , and the Brandon Thomas skirt that matches.Great outfit!I love it !
 I took a chance on this jacket - the price seemed too good to be true . It 's a lovely , soft lightweight suede , very well made and fully lined . It fit well , and the color , peridou , is a very nice mossy green . I 'm very happy with this purchase .
 This jacket is so cute and I 'd like to give it 5 stars at the great price-point it is at -LRB- $ 29.99 -RRB- but the arms do run tight and short which brings down my rating for it . I am not a heavy person , on the slimmer side -LRB- 5 ' 9 '' and 135 pounds -RRB- but the arms are slightly tight and uncomfortable and a wee bit short , which I do not normally find in clothes -LRB- meaning I do not have unusually long arms . -RRB- I got in Cayenne and it is n't as bright as pictured , but it is an adorable jacket to wear with jeans and a great price !
 My husband bought me this jacket for Christmas . I love it . It fits great , is comfortable and I always get compliments on it .
