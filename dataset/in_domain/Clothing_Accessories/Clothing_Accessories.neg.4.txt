 I ordered the biggest size and yet the shirt was so short the sleeves barely made it past my elbows . The bottoms were a different story they were long enough to pull up almost to my arm-pits . If you regularly need a `` long '' size then defiantly pass on these !
 And on the Amazon website , the product description says can be machine washed , but the label says hand wash only .
 Bought these for my husband last year . He 's worn them a few times , likes the feel . Unfortunatly I got him red -LRB- go Rutgers ! -RRB- and when he wears them he ends up with a nice pink pair of underwear . I 'd think for the money they would n't bleed .
 I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their customer service , and the quality of their product . I received a pair of gloves as a Christmas gift , and after light wear for about a week - the gloves looked weeks old . They were discolored and the leather had begun to crack . After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period . Their reason for refusing to exchange the gloves is the exact reason for my wish to exchange them!Leather Gloves Online has officially lost a customer .
 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them . I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves -LRB- great color choices -RRB- Now I 'm glad I only lost money on one pair . Regretfully , I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini .
 I have been buying Hanes underwear for years and have never had a quality issue . However , these underpants are so poorly made that 3 out of the 6 pair ripped within 21 days , all from flimsy sewing and insufficient seam size . They appeared insubstantial when I opened the package , so I did n't expect they would last more than a few months , but 3 weeks is inexcusable . Bottom line
 I ordered white . I wanted white cotton underwear in bikini . The description says colors may vary , but I ordered white , not colored , so I really did n't think that the colors would vary in the white panties I ordered . I could have gotten colored bikini underwear at WalMart . Uncool that I had to pay $ 6 shipping . Now to get my money back I would have to lose $ 6 shipping . Uncool .
 Shorts seemed OK initially , but on the 2nd wearing the zipper pull tab fell off . Unfortunately for me , I did n't get around to wearing them until just outside the return window .
 I purchases 6 items for my first Amazon purchase all other items perfect . My dickie 36 inch short are not 36 inch . I think they are 38 inch . I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same . It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off .

 I personally like the concept . Easy to clean , catches food , bright color . Unfortunately , my daughter hates this bib and complains every time I put it on her . It 's hard plastic , so I guess it 's uncomfortable around her neck . Quite the shame , really ...
 This bib was so small around the neck it immediately went to my 3 year old as a play bib for her dolls . No chance at all it would get around my average size 7 month old 's neck . Looked nice , but was too small !
 I bought this for my 1 yr old son . He screamed every time I put it on him . I think he hated it because it is a firm plastic and he knew he had it on and it bothered him . I finally had to just put it away and give up . He loves the `` Take-out '' baby bibs . He does n't seem to notice he has it on and it protects well . Also the `` Take-out '' bib fits nicely in the diaper bag .
 This bib is too small for my 2 1/2 year old . The closure is very inconvenient and she does not like to wear it .
 this shirts quality is absolutly horrible , just like the yankees , this shirt is a total piece of junk .

 Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful . However , the quality of the material leaves much to be desired , making it appear cheap . Regretfully , I can not recommend .
 The slacks I viewed online were not the described product . The material was so thin , you could virtually see through the dark blue material . I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price . This resulted in approximately $ 5 to ship each pair and then $ 6 to return each pair . Total of $ 22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks .
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall 's in Florida . However , when the mailman took it from my mailbox -LRB- I am 83 and no car -RRB- he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . There was $ l. 71 due . So , I put -LRB- 5 -RRB- 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . However , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it . I called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed I was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . He was n't a happy camper , but I did send it back , and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... they were okay , but by that time , I had changed my mind about them , too.Also , I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.Jeanne Allen

 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .

 I was not happy with seller item states scrubs were size 4 they seemed more like size 2t they were really small and my daughter is really petit so I figured they would fit a little big but NO and to top it off the scrubs were plain light pink they did n't say big sister . Was very upset due to my due date being around the . Corner I was not sure I would have enough time to order other ones and get them on time .

 Did n't hold up like i thought it would lost its shape afer only two hand washings will not buy this product again
 I 've been buying these bras for years . This bra looked nothing like a playtex posture bra . It was a cheap imitation , even the box looked fake . Tried to wear it one time but it was so uncomfortable had to throw it away . Would never trust this seller again . This is the first negative review i have written concerning a product I bought through amazon .
 I have bought a lot of bras and this is the worst.Notflattering and it was the right size but just a lousy style and comfort .
 Did n't hold up like i thought , and do n't fit Narrow at the bottom , although it appears that support excellent but it is not .
 This bra will not help your posture . I tried three different sizes and they did not fit . All were returned to Amazon . Playtex should be required to take `` posture bra '' out of the name of this product , because it 's false advertising .

After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period .

 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them . I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves -LRB- great color choices -RRB- Now I 'm glad I only lost money on one pair . Regretfully , I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini .
 Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful . However , the quality of the material leaves much to be desired , making it appear cheap . Regretfully , I can not recommend .
 The slacks I viewed online were not the described product . The material was so thin , you could virtually see through the dark blue material . I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price . This resulted in approximately $ 5 to ship each pair and then $ 6 to return each pair . Total of $ 22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks .
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall 's in Florida . However , when the mailman took it from my mailbox -LRB- I am 83 and no car -RRB- he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . There was $ l. 71 due . So , I put -LRB- 5 -RRB- 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . However , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it . I called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed I was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . He was n't a happy camper , but I did send it back , and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... they were okay , but by that time , I had changed my mind about them , too.Also , I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.Jeanne Allen

 Before buying this wallet , I had a two-tone red and black Taxi Wallet that I used for many years without any trouble . The stitching around the coin pocket eventually started to come apart and I decided it would be easier to order a new wallet rather than trying to find a way to repair my old one . I was excited to have a `` pretty '' Taxi Wallet this time around but , upon receiving it , was unimpressed with the quality of the leather . It seemed much thinner than my old wallet . But I transferred all my stuff to the new model and tossed it in my purse . After just a few months of use , the snap that holds the coin flap down broke off , rendering the pocket useless . Unfortunately , it was too late to return the item but it was definitely too * soon * for this item to fall apart . Needless to say , I am very disappointed with this wallet ...
 This is an interesting , imaginative design . -LRB- Yes , the front face is a bit scary ! -RRB- . I downgraded it because I was disappointed in the colors of the product . They are weak , and appear `` spotty '' -LRB- think pixelated -RRB- , and faded . I returned the wallet , owing to this . If you can live with that , then this is a cute , unusual design.The taxi wallets are great if you need a small , secure wallet . I use mine daily ... . please see my review under the Nancy Drew image wallet -LRB- where you 'll find lots of comments about the wallet design , etc. -RRB- . That has very strong , bright colors , and I receive comments on it almost daily.Enjoy !
 I have owned a Taxi Wallet for 12 years and I loved it . It was perfect and its small size kept me from carrying around too many coins and too many charge cards ; in short , it kept my purse from getting too heavy with extra stuff in my wallet . It was beautiful and well-crafted . Made of leather , it was red and had two tasteful embossed green aspen leaves on it , and it often caused others to admire it . Despite its diminutive size , it was a little powerhouse , it withstood the test of 12-years of daily use , including oversees trips , and it was just starting to show signs of needing replacement . It was my daily companion until I had the misfortune of losing it in my local airport , jet-lagged , returning from a trip late one night after I 'd taken it out to buy a bag of potato chips from a vending machine ; I 'm fairly certain it slipped out of my pocket or bag , as the airport was almost empty at the time . Too bad for me that the spineless dweeb that obviously found it , took the $ 20 cash I had left in it and lacked the fortitude to turn the wallet in , minus the cash , so that I could at least have my wallet back.However , let 's talk about this Taxi Wallet , available for purchase on Amazon.com . I bought this wallet as a replacement , thinking that at least I would have the same type of wallet , same size , same pockets , and it was cute , to boot . I waited for this one to arrive , using a plastic zip bag as my interim wallet , now containing my temporary replacement driver license . The new one with the cute cats arrived and I immediately set about putting what few cards I had left in it , only to find that my credit cards did n't fit in it like they did in my old one . My old one took a surprising amount of stuff

 For all of you that got exactly what you wanted , there was no need to contact PapaShoe . For those of us who needto return something , forget about it ! They do n't respond on the phone and they do n't email you back . I hope American Express can do something about this . I have never dealt with a company like this before . I also hope Amazon stops offering their products . It will shed a bad light on them.If you have any question in what your ordering , it will not be easy to return or get credit , maybe never , unless your credit card company gets involved.I will repost if something spectular happens ! I think I may be out of a lot of money .
 I purchased the Carhartt Bib Overalls as a gift . Unfortunately , I purchased the wrong size and am in the process of retuning this item . The item itself is great . Carhartt makes an excellent product and I would give this item as a gift again . However , the company that sold this item to me through Amazon , Papa Shoe , has been challenging to deal with . Their customer service lacks service . There is no toll free number to call , their customer service department works via voicemail , -LRB- you are prompted to leave a voicemail and someone will email you back -RRB- , the options for returns on the return / exchange form are limited and cash / credit back is not available . You must exchange the item or receive a gift certificate . One last thing , noted on the return form is that the item you are returning must be returned in the original box the item came in when it was sent to you . Had I known this piece of information I would have kept the white mailing envelope it came in for my return . If the item is not in it 's original `` box '' the item is not returnable , `` no exceptions '' according to Papa Shoe.This is a frustrating situation that I am trying to rectify with their `` customer service '' department . There are too many other companies out there that sell Carhartt products , so do n't make the mistake I made by ordering through Papa Shoe . Now I am left with bib overall 's that do not fit , and my time spent trying to contact a customer service department that does n't perform customer service .
 They took my money , lied about it and wo n't answer the phone or e-mail . These people are crooks .
 I have to return an item from them and there is no customer support . I have now resorted to having Amex investigate and I am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau . They are not up to the same standards that I have usually experienced with an Amazon 3rd party seller . Amazon should drop them .
 I purchased this belt to go with a new dress I purchased . It was exactly the color and style I wanted . The problem is - when I put the belt on and clasped it the clasp would slip out of the hole . It did n't matter which hole in the belt I used , the clasp would always slip right out . I was very disappointed . We tried using a pliers to bend the clasp , but that did n't help . I threw the belt away .

 The silver material the Ninja Cyclone Child Halloween Costume is made of caused my grandson to itch very badly . He can not and will not wear the costume again because of this problem . The very first time he had it on he started itching very badly and we had to give him Benadryl , shower and wash him off before he was comfortable again .

 I ordered matching scrubs for my kids for Christmas - one pink and one blue - I got the blue one but never the pink one . Then I got an email saying the pink is no longer available . So I 'm stuck with only the blue , and I 'd rather have none than just one , when it was supposed to be a gift for the both of them . So angry !
 I was excited to try this out as I had seen mediocre reviews of this product on QVC . It was quite expensive but I needed a strapless slip with slimming features . But as with other reviews , this does slim you somewhat as it is a slip not a bodysuit BUT the top rolls down below your breasts . There is no way to keep it in place . Little body movement , and it is down . I was constantly in the bathroom fixing it . But it did give me the tummy and rear firmness that I was looking for in a form-fitting strapless dress that one can easily get in and out of for the bathroom that the other products really limit you . For the price it is not worth it .
 Did not fit like other Lee one-true-fit pants I had bought -LRB- much tighter -RRB- and were so low-cut I would have never worn them even if they did fit . I returned them and , of course , lost my shipping costs .

 The leather and the silk lining were of good quality ; however , I was disappointed with the quality of construction .
 I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats . I 'm very disappointed . This is supposed to be a reversible coat . However , the hem of the black side is too long . Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed . And , it does not look good at all . The company needs to revise this pattern .

However , when the mailman took it from my mailbox -LRB- I am 83 and no car -RRB- he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . There was $ l. 71 due . So , I put -LRB- 5 -RRB- 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . However , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it . I called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed I was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . He was n't a happy camper , but I did send it back , and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... they were okay , but by that time , I had changed my mind about them , too.Also , I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.Jeanne Allen
 I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their customer service , and the quality of their product . I received a pair of gloves as a Christmas gift , and after light wear for about a week - the gloves looked weeks old . They were discolored and the leather had begun to crack . After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period . Their reason for refusing to exchange the gloves is the exact reason for my wish to exchange them!Leather Gloves Online has officially lost a customer .
 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them . I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves -LRB- great color choices -RRB- Now I 'm glad I only lost money on one pair . Regretfully , I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini .
 I have had what I thought were the same running socks that have lasted me years . I ordered these online sight unseen thinking they were the same as I have . These are so thin and cheaply made that one pair is already tearing at the toe seam after running in them only once . God forbid you try any trail running as I did with the next pair because any snag on any vegetation and it is an immediate hole . I 'll never buy these socks again !
 I 've been running in these socks -LRB- not the same pair . You know what i mean -RRB- since high school x-country over 15 years ago . In fact , I have n't been able to fined any sock that can compare . Unfortunately , the socks have changed and I will have to look harder . They are far thinner and one had developed a hole after 1 or 2 uses . In the past they have lasted 3 or 4 years of weekly use . I am very disappointed in the current quality of the sock . I ca n't believe they have the same product name .
 Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful . However , the quality of the material leaves much to be desired , making it appear cheap . Regretfully , I can not recommend .
 The slacks I viewed online were not the described product . The material was so thin , you could virtually see through the dark blue material . I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price . This resulted in approximately $ 5 to ship each pair and then $ 6 to return each pair . Total of $ 22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks .

 The quality of this hat is poor . a huge rubber inner band which was uncomfortable . The hat felt crumbly the wrinkled texture felt of poor quality . Would not recommend this hat .

 This belt wa smade of very cheap , inferior materials . I wore it once , and the grommet separated from the belt hole after sitting down in my suit . I was very unhappy with the quality and workmanship .
 This item for the price was great , but this particular one is not a size D cup as stated . It is much smaller , so keep that in mind if you order it .
 The leather and the silk lining were of good quality ; however , I was disappointed with the quality of construction .
 I ordered these glasses and other glasses I received . I do not understand how it is possible to order a product and receive another ...
 One of the lenses fell out of the frame as soon as I carefully took it out of the package . On top of that , after a half of a day 's gentle use , one side snaped at the henge and became very flemsy while normally opening the glasses for about the third time . The next day that side actually fell off while trying to open them up again . The only thing nice about these is that the lens was completely mirrored and you ca n't really see through them from the front like others . Other than this , these glasses are a horrible buy , and you get what you pay for . I just bought a pair that is way more sturdy and durable enough so you can open them up without them falling into pieces . I got them at a stand in my local mall for a price of 2 for $ 25 , I suggest you do the same and I absolutely do not recommend these .
 For $ 5.99 , I was n't expecting a lot . As a matter of fact , I was expecting very little . Kudos to the manufacturer/seller then , for disappointing me DESPITE my pragmatic attitude.These are so flimsy , that I was afraid of breaking them simply by holding them in my hands . What 's more , the promised `` case '' -LRB- which would have been nothing but a pouch made of cheap fabric -RRB- was missing from the package . Very disappointing , because after taking one look at this lemon , I knew that the pouch would be the only thing of value in this order . I contacted Amazon , arranged a return , and I 'm happy for it.I 'll be fulfilling all my optometry needs at the gas station , thank you very much .
 These glasses came on time , but , when I opened them , I soon realized why they were priced so low ; They 're complete garbage . The arch in the middle was n't centered , and the mirror was part chipped upon arrival . Also , the frames are so flimsy anything would risk breaking them . Even though they are cheap , I would not suggest buying them .
 Save your money ! Sunglass lens are substantially smaller than true Aviator . You can get these or better at your local drugstore .
 I 've only had these sunglasses for a week , and already the nose rest has fallen off of the glasses and the frame is beginning to bend more than an acceptable amount .
 Looks very cheep and the one that I got has lot of scratches . Thought of returning , but felt wasting time on returning this $ 1.20 item .
 i got these in the mail and i opened the box . I almost broke the arms on them because there so thin ! but they are dark
 well at first they looked nice but further inspection proved that the glasses are poorly constructed . A few months passed and the lenses fell off . DONT BOTHER .
 Please do not buy these . The frame was bent when I opened the package and they never sat quite right on my face . Terrible quality and a waste of 5 bucks . I accidentally sat on them a couple days later and let 's say I was glad to throw them away ha !
 Made for small/narrow heads . I need wider ones , these were not worth my money but if you have a small head they may work for you .

 Did n't hold up like i thought it would lost its shape afer only two hand washings will not buy this product again
 I 've been buying these bras for years . This bra looked nothing like a playtex posture bra . It was a cheap imitation , even the box looked fake . Tried to wear it one time but it was so uncomfortable had to throw it away . Would never trust this seller again . This is the first negative review i have written concerning a product I bought through amazon .
 I have bought a lot of bras and this is the worst.Notflattering and it was the right size but just a lousy style and comfort .
 Did n't hold up like i thought , and do n't fit Narrow at the bottom , although it appears that support excellent but it is not .
 This bra will not help your posture . I tried three different sizes and they did not fit . All were returned to Amazon . Playtex should be required to take `` posture bra '' out of the name of this product , because it 's false advertising .
 I am a college students who purchased this book bag to protect my laptop in and to be able to carry books around . Well lets just say that if you just wanted to carry your laptop around then you would be fine , but other than that you would not be able to carry anything else in it except for maybe a notebook . Though it is well padded . Also . I have a 15.4 '' wide screen Sony Vaio and it fits perfectly well with a sleeve around it in the backpack itself .

 CAUTION
 If you 're looking for a shaper specifically to smooth your back , then this will work . However , if you 're expecting much in the way of support for your bust , it may prove to be disappointing.For the most part these body shapers are on the pricey side . Because of this I went and did as much research on the internet as possible to make sure I was going to be happy with my purchase . A few reviews said that one of the advantages of this shaper was that you did n't need to wear a bra as well and somebody even said that it made her bust look `` perky '' . Well , I experienced totally the opposite - it completely flattened my boobs . I normally wear a 38B and would 've been lucky to look like I had an A cup after putting this on . I ended up looking like a boy . : - -LRB- If your main concern is to use this to smooth those unflattering bulges then you 'll be okay . It does works well for that . But beware that it may `` smooth '' other areas that you 'd rather not have smoothed out .

 Shorts seemed OK initially , but on the 2nd wearing the zipper pull tab fell off . Unfortunately for me , I did n't get around to wearing them until just outside the return window .
 I purchases 6 items for my first Amazon purchase all other items perfect . My dickie 36 inch short are not 36 inch . I think they are 38 inch . I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same . It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off .

 I had a glitch and ordered two of these items , and noted it immediately after purchase . Instantly I wrote Amazon and the seller that night-Saturday-and first thing on Monday morning again emailed the seller who told me the item had shipped-what ! . Because I wanted this item for a trip the coming week , I had placed another order for one just after the mistake on Saturday night , thinking since I had cancelled the two I had accidentally ordered I would only get the one poncho . Wrong . . and when it arrived the neck opening was so small I cut it open and had the neighborhood cleaners/alteration spot finish the edges , not pretty but it will work for everyday . I figured since the price was so cheap , what could it hurt . But alas ... seller charged me a restocking fee - yet I had never taken the two items from the box , just opened it up to put in a copy of the invoice for identification purposes-plus it cost me shipping to send back this mistake nor did they refund the original shipping to me for the items they orginally sent , plus the fee to have it altered - I took quite a loss on this purchase . Should have just bought a cashmere one , like I wanted with the total cost of my mistake . I thought the product was unsatisfactory , but once I finished dealing with the seller , I knew the weakness of this deal . Internet sales should not be a gamble for the buyer-small print and hoop jumping .
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .

 First , I have been running in Thorlos for 4 years and can say that I believe their claim that their socks reduce blisters and provide shock absorption - in fact I would say they do this very effectively ! However , the mini-lite product is not as effective as the regular thickness version , in both blister prevention or shock absorption . In fact , they pretty much feel like any other sock . In my view , they are not worth the extra price over any other fitted running sock , many of which you can buy for about half the price as the Thorlos .
 Shorts seemed OK initially , but on the 2nd wearing the zipper pull tab fell off . Unfortunately for me , I did n't get around to wearing them until just outside the return window .
 I purchases 6 items for my first Amazon purchase all other items perfect . My dickie 36 inch short are not 36 inch . I think they are 38 inch . I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same . It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off .

 I placed my order April 30 and its now June 14thI bought four items and only one made it . The one that made it was a baby doll but they forgot to send the panties that came with it.I have emailed them but no response ! I also have tried to call but they never pick up !
 The gown is fine in workmanship . However the cup size seems small compared to the actual size . I wanted to return it , but could n't get a response from the company . So , I 'm stuck with it .
 Two pair shipped at the same time . One arrived with sharp edges on one temple and one arrived with the right lens out of the frame . Makes me believe that these are a cheap copy of the original or factory seconds.If not then Eagle Eye needs to inspect their products and correct their assembly methods .
 Dunno what happened . This shirt pilled up and wrinkled on the first wash . It 's a lot bigger than a regular large , so if you do buy it , go a size smaller .
 I had to return the swim suit . It did not fit . Kathy Crisp
 I want to be very clear that the issue I had was with the 3rd party seller and the item they sent me NOT Amazon 's shipping . I 'm tired of Amazon negating less-than-positive reviews claiming it was their shipping fulfillment that was the issue.It was n't . The packaging was fine ; it was the item that was misrepresented . Sold as new , CLEARLY USED.The original packaging was torn up , the glasses were in a ziplock bag inside the case , and the lenses had fingerprints all over them . I had ordered these to take on a summer trip and was very disappointed that I had to send them back . I have since ordered another pair from another website altogether . I would have preferred to order them through Amazon with Prime shipping , but I could n't take that chance a second time with such an expensive item.The glasses themselves are great ; I live in Seattle , and the HCL brown lenses are perfect for the bright , but overcast , weather in the summer months .
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .
 The leather and the silk lining were of good quality ; however , I was disappointed with the quality of construction .
 To match my much loved seatbeltbag , I later bought this wallet . It was a great disappointment as it is very stiff and does n't open wide enough to easily reach in . The `` piping '' trim flares out making it look cheap . I gave up trying to make it work and it 's sitting on my closet shelf . I can use it as a clutch , in a pinch .
 When I opened the package , excited about a Neck Warmer that I was giving as a gift , it was a FURMINATOR !!! I am in the process if trying to remedy this issue .
 The skirt I received does n't look like the one on the picture . My 9 year old daughter wanted it pink as we saw in the picture here and on the package and we received another color . It was a light yellow color . She did n't want to wear it and went to school wearing leggings in the bottom part . Her friends asked if it was a Harry Potter costume . On the Halloween day she did n't wear it at all .

 Very pretty and nice , but zipper broke before the school year was over , so I was n't able to use it for the entire school year . For the price I paid , I was hoping it would last at least a whole school year .
 Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful . However , the quality of the material leaves much to be desired , making it appear cheap . Regretfully , I can not recommend .
 The slacks I viewed online were not the described product . The material was so thin , you could virtually see through the dark blue material . I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price . This resulted in approximately $ 5 to ship each pair and then $ 6 to return each pair . Total of $ 22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks .
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall 's in Florida . However , when the mailman took it from my mailbox -LRB- I am 83 and no car -RRB- he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . There was $ l. 71 due . So , I put -LRB- 5 -RRB- 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . However , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it . I called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed I was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . He was n't a happy camper , but I did send it back , and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... they were okay , but by that time , I had changed my mind about them , too.Also , I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.Jeanne Allen
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 Well , they do not send you `` handkerchiefS '' , they send you ONE handkerchief , for the wonderful price of $ 4.00 + $ 6.99 shipping and handling . $ 10.99 for one handkerchief . Need I say more ?
 They began to dis-sew on the first wear . . also , they stank of cheap plastic , it was gross . They fit to large on my hands . So disappointing .
 Way small on anyone 's hands and they tore almost immediately . I 'm happy I only had to use these once since they literally fell apart when I took them off .
 I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me . I wish I had not have gotten it .
 A red star !?!? I bet this wo n't sell well in eastern Europe . Communist governments use the red star symbol . More than 100,000 million people have been killed in the `` rise of the proletariat '' ... so let 's celebrate this with a HAT !?
 I think this hat was sized by elves . I have a fairly large head , 24 inches circumference , so I ordered an extra large . It was tiny , it fit my very small-headed wife perfectly . I thought they sent me the wrong size but the factory tag does say XL . It makes me think these are meant to be kid hats or something .
 when pulled down , it could cover your head all the way from back of your skull to front of your eyes .
 I have written 8 product reviews for this one hat just so I can let people know the truth . However my review keeps getting blocked . I am just trying to tell the truth so people do not get taken . 7 1/4 is listed twice as large and medium . I went with large . It is to big . Company said if I purchase three more caps/hats they would replace the first one for free . Other than that they said it was my fault for ordering the wrong size . I did not order wrong size ! Please let people know the truth .

 Hi . I was very excited about getting some shirts for my daughter , but when I received the ten shirts I ordered I was a little upset that they had no tags on them and the second tag on the inside of the shirt was cut from all the shirts . The invoice stated that to return any items they had to be new , but how could they be returned if they did not come with tags ? Also , the fact that one of the inside tags was cut makes me think that these shirts are not Babyluxe brand , but some other brand that you , as the seller , acquired and jacked up the price.I will be posting this same comment as a review of your item because I think buyers need to be aware of what they are really getting.The shirts are cute , but it makes me wonder if I received what I really bought .
 You are showing , at least in a 46 reg. , a picture of a plaid coat and the only choices are herring bone . There is a big difference . This is very misleading . Jos. A. Bank Web site is doing the same thing . Needs to be fixed .
 fit was fine , but fabric was very rough . It was like wearing a burlap sack , just tougher .

 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .

 I had a SwissGear backpack already but those things are built to last forever and consequently weigh nearly 4 pounds unloaded . I wanted something light for school , so after much searching ended up on this bag . However when it came in , I was quite disappointed at the general build quality and just poor design . It didnt remotely feel like it would last for long ! Ended up packaging it for return within 30 mins of receiving the package!I got the Ogio Clutch backpack instead from amazon 's sister site that runs one deal a day -LRB- you know which one !! -RRB- so in the end it worked out ok . That bag is simply amazing and light years ahead of this bag -LRB- although it does cost more , so will not compare two directly -RRB- . That bag is also on amazon at

 I had a smooth transaction and fast shipment from the seller.The belt itself , however , is of the LOWEST quality !! There is NOTHING `` genuine '' about the construction of this belt . It is made of some cheap fiber material that allowed my buckle to rip the hole out of the belt within the first HOUR that I wore it !! After I realized that the belt was worthless , I ripped it in half with my bare hands!Also , the snaps that make this belt interchangeable are painted black , however , the paint has chipped/rubbed off during the ONE time that I wore it to reveal the brass color of the snaps.Awful , awful , awful !!

 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .

 I got 2 of these bras , and only one shipped . I was really disappointed . Even after correstponding with the seller , I 'm still left with just one bra . I 'm pretty irritated . The bra is okay ... it 's a little weird cause the back has 5 of six clasps .
 The bra was uncomfortable . The bottom lace curled up constantly .
 Although the company was great to work with , but the bra leaves a lot to be desired . the bottom band is tighter than other bras of the same size , and the bra itself has no support at all . might as well not be wearing anything at all
 Very disappointed with this bra . Wanted a truly comfortable pull-on bra -LRB- no hooks -RRB- in a satiny fabric . This one was the wrong fabric and has hooks in back . Also , I ordered B cup but cup was big . Does n't somebody make a pull-on , no-hook elastic bra that a large , meddle aged small-breasted woman can wear ?
 This is not a binding bra , true , but everything shows through ! Only good for bedtime if you like that .
 `` Vic '' in L'artisana customer serivce department identified himself as the owner and President of the company . He verbally abused me on the telephone , not only screaming at me but using foul language . NO product is worth being abused when a customer calls about an order being wrong - when I called about my latest order that was shorted on the number of items ordered as well as items that I did not order . Absolutely the WORST customer service I have ever experienced in my life .
 This handkerchief is quite pretty . But I wanted to use it to blow my nose , and the handkerchief is too sheer . Even after washing , it is also too coarse .

 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order .

I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 I do n't know of any other company that sells such a variety of opaque , colorful tights . I bought a large number of them and did n't discover that some were damaged before the return date had expired . When they are good , they are very , very good and when they are bad ... it 's a waste.I hope they will step up their quality control .
 I have a ton of HUE tights and I love them
 Not a whole lot of support . Wish it had a tad more lycra . They get a bit saggy by the afternoon . I do n't recommend .
 Unfortunately ordered these a couple of months ago and just got them out to put them on . Great big hole where one of the big toes should be . Open and inspect in detail immediately if you buy these , I have missed the return cut off - so it 's a complete rip off .
 The tights are great but Amazon is charging $ 12.50 a pair even if you buy two pairs . The packaging says they are 2 for $ 20 . Amazon will charge you $ 25 for 2 pairs . Better off going to the mall . Customer service reps would not honor the price on the package .
 Buyer beware , these tights might fit an extremely tall and thin cucumber , but not a human being.I 'm a plus size - but not all that plus - I ordered size 4 because my body , in addition to being overweight and tall , is quite mature and as other mature consumers know , we need to shop for bigger sizes . These tights are a waste of $ .

 These are the same brand , style , and size pants that were already in my closet and purchased at a Kenneth Cole store about 2 years ago , however they are tight . The pair in my closet fits with room to spare . The size and UPC codes are identical .
 After about 4-5 uses , the right leg hem on one and the left leg hem on the other fell apart . I only wash on delicate -LRB- label says permanent press -RRB- , and I 'm certainly not rough on them . I had 2 pair of the same type of pants -LRB- diff size -RRB- for about 4 years and loved them which is why I bought these . Trying to work with Amazon.com now to exchange as I 'm looking at $ 15 each to go to an alteration place.Other than the hem issue the pants are nice .

 This handkerchief is quite pretty . But I wanted to use it to blow my nose , and the handkerchief is too sheer . Even after washing , it is also too coarse .
 I selected this one over the others here because it was n't labeled as small like some others . But it also is too small for an adult head . Wasted my money .

 The shipping for this Item is $ 9.09 for a patch . I am sorry but that is way to much for something you can just mail in a letter for less than a dollar .
 I think this hat was sized by elves . I have a fairly large head , 24 inches circumference , so I ordered an extra large . It was tiny , it fit my very small-headed wife perfectly . I thought they sent me the wrong size but the factory tag does say XL . It makes me think these are meant to be kid hats or something .
 when pulled down , it could cover your head all the way from back of your skull to front of your eyes .
 I have written 8 product reviews for this one hat just so I can let people know the truth . However my review keeps getting blocked . I am just trying to tell the truth so people do not get taken . 7 1/4 is listed twice as large and medium . I went with large . It is to big . Company said if I purchase three more caps/hats they would replace the first one for free . Other than that they said it was my fault for ordering the wrong size . I did not order wrong size ! Please let people know the truth .
 I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me . I wish I had not have gotten it .
 A red star !?!? I bet this wo n't sell well in eastern Europe . Communist governments use the red star symbol . More than 100,000 million people have been killed in the `` rise of the proletariat '' ... so let 's celebrate this with a HAT !?

 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .

 I love this camo trend , does this shirt run big ? Or is it true to size ?? Thaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnkkss I just need more words on this review to send so I 'm rambling
 Listen - a $ 97 and a half dollar pair of khakis ought to blow you away . These khakis are decent , but the workmanship is no better than Dickie 's . I bought 2 pairs of the button fly authentics . Authentic what ? Authentic Dickies repros ? If Bill thinks they 're authentic repros of WWII khakis , he 's full of it . Where to start ? Ok , let 's talk about the seams on the inside of the legs . WWII khakis and all truly outstanding khakis have double-stitched and wrap folded inside leg seams . Do Bill 's khakis ? Nope . Ok , but that 's a pretty high standard , I admit . But any half way decent pair will at least have the outside seam double-stitched and folded -LRB- like the outside seam of Levi 's , so you know what I 'm talking about -RRB- . Does Bill even make this nod to `` authenticism '' or quality ? Oh hell no ! Let 's talk about the back pockets . Loose threads everywhere . Front pockets are sewn on in some weird way that leaves an irritating lump along the seam at the top of the pocket , like a wrinkle in the pocket that ca n't be ironed out . The cloth ? Fashion khakis like Tommy Hilfiger and Polo are just as good , it 's definitely not up to being called `` authentic . '' Bill 's might have used to make good stuff , I ca n't say . But he 's churning out pure crap these days . Why do they get 2 stars then ? Well , they do at least fit right . But go ahead and buy a pair if you think I 'm full of it , and see for yourself . I 'd save the receipt though .
 The trousers I wore , when the US Army still wore khakis , were of a much higher quality than these -LRB- but so were civilian clothes -RRB- . More care was taken in the assembly of my khaki uniforms than I can find in anything available these days , and the fit was better . And that includes Bills Khakis , which cost twice as much as they should , at a hundred dollars a pop . I did buy a used pair , and they have met my needs after a visit to a tailor . But brand new , without cuffs or hemming ? Not at the price they 're asking . On the other hand , they 're probably better than the other crap that 's being offered by other retailers . If nothing else , they have better fabric -- IF AND ONLY IF you stick to the original khaki fabric , The other fabrics they offer are crap , just like the others offer .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 Listen - a $ 97 and a half dollar pair of khakis ought to blow you away . These khakis are decent , but the workmanship is no better than Dickie 's . I bought 2 pairs of the button fly authentics . Authentic what ? Authentic Dickies repros ? If Bill thinks they 're authentic repros of WWII khakis , he 's full of it . Where to start ? Ok , let 's talk about the seams on the inside of the legs . WWII khakis and all truly outstanding khakis have double-stitched and wrap folded inside leg seams . Do Bill 's khakis ? Nope . Ok , but that 's a pretty high standard , I admit . But any half way decent pair will at least have the outside seam double-stitched and folded -LRB- like the outside seam of Levi 's , so you know what I 'm talking about -RRB- . Does Bill even make this nod to `` authenticism '' or quality ? Oh hell no ! Let 's talk about the back pockets . Loose threads everywhere . Front pockets are sewn on in some weird way that leaves an irritating lump along the seam at the top of the pocket , like a wrinkle in the pocket that ca n't be ironed out . The cloth ? Fashion khakis like Tommy Hilfiger and Polo are just as good , it 's definitely not up to being called `` authentic . '' Bill 's might have used to make good stuff , I ca n't say . But he 's churning out pure crap these days . Why do they get 2 stars then ? Well , they do at least fit right . But go ahead and buy a pair if you think I 'm full of it , and see for yourself . I 'd save the receipt though .

 So frustrating , the sizes on this page are NOT what you get ! You will wind up getting shipped a PLUS SIZE bra , even though it does not say that anywhere on this page.Shame on the seller for doing this - its so annoying . I see now that other have written reviews and had the same experience.FYI - the bra , if you get it in the CORRECT size , is AWESOME . I have 1 and therefore thought it would be so simple to just order another one in the same size . Instead i 'm wasting my time returning it , grrr .
 This bra is terribly uncomfortable . The elastic band at the bottom rolls up and digs into your skin . It requires 2 hands to get it snapped after you are finished nursing , which is next to impossible when you 're holding a baby . I use this bra as my last resort if my other 2 are unavailable -LRB- i.e. they got spit up on or milk leaked on them -RRB- . I got the other 2 at Wal-Mart for $ 10 each and I love them ! They are very comfortable . This bra was $ 35 and I ca n't stand it !
 I can not honestly review this costume because I was send something entirely different in the mail . I was sent a girl 's doll backpack set , which could n't be further from a halloween costume . When I called customer service , they had to investigate the shipment and get back to me within 48 hours , they did not , when I called Amazon again , they finally told me that they do not have the original costume I ordered . The whole process from start to finish took about a week and a half . I did much research on what would be the cutest costume for my 9 month old son and spent alot of time waiting for this issue to be resolved ... in the end , I ran to my local disney store and picked up a costume . I will not likely order from Amazon in the future since this was such a disapointment .
 I would love to know what this product is like , but the company future memories has still not sent it . they got my money right away , but do n't have time to take care of sending my child her costume . good learning lesson for a 9 yr old that companies like future memories do n't do what they say they will and have absolutely NO customer service . Amazon should not associate themselves with this company .
 The costume is a fun idea , but not worth the money . It 's pretty poor quality . I would n't recommend it unless it 's 20 dollars or less .
 I really like this belt , but it 's too thick to fit through the belt loops on any of my pants , jeans , etc. . I have to wear it on my hips if I wear it at all . I actually wish I had n't bought it .
 After reading over a thousand reviews I made the informed decision to order this shirt . Shortly after clicking the `` BUY '' button I noticed that the shirt had not only already arrived , but that I was wearing it with gusto . All seemed well until I took it out for a test spin.The awesome power of the wolves promptly drained me of my seed and clogged the kitchen sink . Any attempt I make to unclog the sink or contact a plumber causes the wolves to growl in such a way that I dare not continue . Although I was confident that I could control the power bestowed upon me , it was only a matter of days before I had shaved the tails of all the neighborhood cats and eaten all the first-born children in a ten mile radius.The wolves do not respond to logic or reason . I tried to remove the shirt , but the alpha male bit me and my flesh has since healed to the garment itself . I now have magnificent chest hair and engage in involuntary chanting which causes acid rain.I still feel that the pros outweigh the cons , but I now spend so much time carrying out the wishes of the Norse god king , Odin , that I can not in good conscious recommend this product .
 I purchased the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt with the sole purpose of warding off the town bullies -LRB- almost everyone in my town in Jefferson , West Virginia , including girls , have either hit me , pushed me , thrown something at me , tripped me , laughed at me , or just verbally attacked me -RRB- . After reading all the reviews saying how this shirt will help me not only in attaining some kind of extra strength to fight people with but also how it will force women to be attracted to me , I decided to take the plunge and buy it . I splurged and ordered it Next Day Air so I could wear it immediately.The next day the box was delivered . Although I was extremely excited as I opened the box -LRB- I was visibly shaking and could hear my own teeth chatter -RRB- , I was also skeptical like FBI Agent Dana Scully from the X-Files . Slightly trembling I slid the shirt on . It fit snugly against me . Though it looked Awesome -LRB- amazing details on the wolves and the moon -RRB- , I felt nothing exceptional until I looked closely at the faces of the wolves , howling . I saw an intensity I had never before experienced , along with raw animal emotion and a oneness with the natural world , especially a oneness with the moon . I could start to feel something , a sense of self esteem I 'd never felt before in my life . I felt the spirit of not one but all three wolves enter my heart . I felt like a lone wolf . But with the power of three -LRB- which makes it three times better than the `` Breakthrough Wolf T-Shirt '' which I was about to buy before seeing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt . -RRB- I felt like an animal.Now it was time to take the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt for a `` test drive '' around town.Immediately upon leaving the front door to mother 's barn some of the usual bullies I deal with on a daily basis were upon me -LRB- some of the neighborhood kids who use mother 's field as a baseball diamond after school -RRB- . One of them punched me in the stomach - hard . I toppled to the ground , out of breath , wheezing , then , finding the spirit of the three wolves within me I stood up , placed my forearms together in front of my face in standard spell incantation technique , breathing hard , and screamed with all of my might

 I ordered this tie thinking I was going to get 100 % silk . When it came - the label reads 100 % polyester !! Do n't buy it !
 I purchased a 100 % silk tie , but the merchant sent a 100 % microfiber tie . When I contacted the merchant , he apologized and said to keep the tie that he had sent and he would mail me the correct tie immediately . This never happened and when I contacted him again about the problem , he simple referred me to the original postal tracking that said that I had received the merchandise . Of course , I would never do business with this merchant again . By the way , the microfiber tie is OK , but it is not what I ordered .
 These shirts were not what I expected . As soon as I washed them , they shrunk and did not hold their original shape . The end of the sleeves began to roll up ... and that was only after one wash straight out of the package . Will wait until I get back to the US to buy the correct type .
 Well I purchased this shirt about a week ago for and airsoft operation i was attending . When the package arrived it looked good so I did n't assume anything was wrong at that point ... Then I opened it and to my surprise the shirt was terrible . The quality of the material was horrible and the seams had been sown wrong causing the entire shirt to twist and be unwearable . I was very disappointed in the quality of this product and would suggest to pay a little more to get something that would actually be functional .
 I received these shirts to wear under my flight suit but they are more of an Air Force greenish tan than brown tan . Not what I expected from the picture . Also I ordered large and the necks are huge and look like crap . I can not wear these in a military uniform . They may be good if you work as a mechanic and need a grease rag that is why I will give two stars .
 The product did NOT FIT as displayed . -LRB- I am a sz 6 ; purchased Lg . -RRB- Does not go to the waist , therefore no tummy flattening help . Cut at leg is much higher . Product shrinks . I would not award any stars as rating.DO NOT USE MY REAL NAME !!!

 This is not a t-shirt suitable for outer wear.It comes out of the wash wrinkled , a bit shrunken and with misshapen collar and sleeves.Care directions followed to the letter with the newest digital laundry equipmentokay for sleepwear and as a hidden under layer . I wo n't buy again .

 The item had two slices in the left front pocket.We returned it to Fogdog and requested a replacement be shipped and that we did not want a credit.when I next heard from them they said they were issuing a Credit . We sent a e-mail and again said we did not want a credit . The next thing we knew we received a e-mail saying that a credit had been issued . We are NOT HAPPY!Mary Maskill
 I purchased a pair of these shorts at a local dept. store and they fit great ! but of course , when i went back to get another pair they did n't have any more , hence , my buying them online . the pair i ordered online did not fit the same way ... they fit , but are not as comfortable and i do n't understand why ... also , would like to mention i also purchased a pair of docker shorts the same day i got the first pair , fit fine , ordered a pair of dockers online at the same time i ordered the lee 's and they too did not fit like the first pair ... now that this has happened with 2 different brands of shorts , i 'll NOT buy them online anymore ...
 First , let me start with the most important thing ... . my son LOVED this costume ! He 's four and any four year-old boy with a Green Lantern costume is going to be happier than a pig in slop . He was thrilled and put it on immediately after he got it . I , however , was thouroughly disappointed in the costume , in that the green is more of a lime green then a hunter green and what makes the green lantern THE GREEN LANTERN is his power ring , it 's a travesty that you have to purchase the ring seperately . At any rate he already has `` Flash '' , `` Batman '' and now `` the Green Lantern '' , so we 'll get him a Superman and Aqua Man to round out the masculine portion of the justice league !
 not happy , It looks like it has enough room for ones junk ... . If you 5 years old but not for an adult .
 It is `` made in honduras '' , it 's the badest quality I have ever seen . DO N'T BUY IT .

 These are seconds . I did not realize this as I can buy these bags in perfect condition at my local sports store for about the same price . I only realized that this was a second when I took it out of the package and saw a label saying second ... I still ca n't see where it says ` second ' on the original advert ... Also , as they do not follow the Amazon ` easy ' return policy I did not bother , for the price , to jump through hoops to get my money back .
 Would be interested in purchasing one of these but the product description gives the same demensions for each size ???? Give sizing information plese .
 Was this dress really originally $ 47 ? I thought $ 15 was a little on the high side . Do n't buy it . Unfortunately the company does not offer returns , so once you buy it , it 's yours.Update - I need to make a correction . If you contact the 15 Dollar Store directly , they do not offer returns , however if you purchase an item through Amazon , there is a return policy . You do need to pay a 25 % restocking fee , but they will take the item back .

 TERRIBLE -- the cotton band chafes my skin and leaves red rashes every time I wear this .
 Item received does not match picture contained in ad . The cow design on the received item is much smaller -LRB- only 2 `` x2 '' -RRB- than the one that covers the entire top of the wrap in the picture . The cow is almost cartoonish in quality on the actual item . Also , the beads around the headband and the feathers on the rear flap are non-existent on the actual item . Instead , you get a cartoonish series of symbols on the sides and headband . I say cartoonish because they look like something an elementary schooler doodled in class . There is no design at all on the back flap ... which judging by the poor quality of the other designs might not be a bad thing .
 Pros-very comfortable , cheap price.cons-does not block out enough light or shade very well . These shades do not work well at all in very bright sun . On the the product tag it says something to the effect of `` does not distort colors '' etc. , but in doing that you will still find yourself squinting in bright sun . There is really hardly any tint at all with these shades .
 The lenses are not very good . . distort the vision . . the frame itself seems to be made well but it is the lenses that give it a poor product review
 No padding inside box . Just the sunglasses and a lot of box to tumble against Asinine packaging ! Sunglasses were very warped and could not be bent back into shape .
 Like another reviewer , these glasses were a little too big for my average sized head . I ended up returning these .
 Well , it was just a little annoying that practically every time I cleaned the lenses the lenses came off . They are pretty easy to put back in place . After only using these glasses for a few weeks my son had them around his neck in front hanging from a sunglasses strap . As the boat approached the dock he threw a rope over the dock cleat and knocked both lenses off into the water at the same time . Both lenses were lost.Other than that the glasses were pretty good for the price . However I will not be buying any others of this make .
 I received 50 % refund on returning the product in original condition since I did not like what I received . Why such a high deduction ? You should require merchant to post the refund amount when ordering . I also paid for shipping the product back thus resulting in only 25 % refund of what I paid originally .
 TERRIBLE -- the cotton band chafes my skin and leaves red rashes every time I wear this .
 With so many phone models and sizes I was concerned about the size of the case and its ability to hold the LG VX9900 . I was very pleased when this case arrived and it was exactly as advertised . However , I am very disappointed in the quality of this product . After one month of normal use the case has significantly frayed around the seams and I ca n't imagine it lasting for more than another month or so . But given the price I paid , I really ca n't complain too much as it did serve the purpose for which I bought it .
 I bought this last Halloween . I was very disappointed in the quality of the costume . The eye patch is not included as was implied . The costume looked stretched out of shape fresh out of the package . The neck was over sized as well and it caused the costume to not look right at all .
 I bought this costume at a local store , so do n't let this review reflect on the seller , as I have n't dealt with them.I tried on the dress and the robe at the store to make sure it fit . They were extremely cheap looking and feeling , but I kind of expected that , so whatever - I figured I could fancy it up with the spider webs and some other accessories . I made the mistake of not checking the wig before purchasing it . I got home , took the wig out ... and it is PITIFUL ! I did n't expect it to look perfect like in the picture , sure , but it was PATHETIC . First of all , it 's paper-thin and straight so you 're not going to get anything like the volume and curls seen in the picture . Second of all , IT 'S ONLY THE BANGS ! It 's not even a full wig ! You get a mesh cap with cheap , long , paper-thin bangs attached . So if you were to take the hood off at any point it would look incredibly stupid . So not worth $ 20 , would n't have even felt right paying $ 5 . I recommend buying an actual , nice wig and just getting some spooky , old clothes from a thrift store . It will look significantly better .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 I usually like champion sports bras but this one is very large between the shoulders so when I put one on my shoulder blades rub a blister into my skin because the material is too wide in between my shoulders . Other than that I love the reversible feature and the actual feel of the material itself . .
 I ordered a Medium in this Sports Bra , I 'm 5 ' 4 '' weighing 124 lbs . with a 32B bra size . It was so small I could n't get it on . I sent it back for a refund because I do n't think even a large would have fit .
 I 'm puzzled reading the reviews for this product -- do they make two different bras under the same description ? I wear small/medium in clothes and am very small in the bust -LRB- A maximum -RRB- . I ordered this sports bra in medium for cycling -LRB- All my other sports bras are mediums and fit nicely -RRB- . It looks great/high quality -- 2 stars . When I put it on I could n't believe it . I have absolutely no idea how anyone who is not completely flat-chested can comfortably wear it . Even I with the small amount I have was mashed completely flat and felt like I was being suffocated . Now that 's a SUPPORT bra ! And , like one other reviewer stated , the armholes are very high and cut into my underarm . I wondered if ordering a size large might help and it might a little , but it 's hard to believe there would be enough give even then to accomodate me , small as I am , in the bust area.Anyway , for what it 's worth ...
 Based on other reviews , I bought the next larger size and STILL had a problem . To make the bra work for me , I took off the binding around the neckline and arm holes and removed a heavy strip of rubber from each . I then resewed the bindings and the bra is more comfortable , but still is not the size I ordered . I would recommend a different bra if possible .

 Guess you get what you pay for . I found the material to feel like cheap plastic I would put over my plants in the winter time . The lining is ok but the fill and texture of the rain/windbreaker is cheaply made . Just not impressed . Going to try a different brand and probably donate this one to a homeless shelter .
 I have at home quite a few large t-shirts bought over the years from different manufacturers including Beefy-T -LRB- Hanes -RRB- . They 're all great t-shirts . I just bought 5 of these large t-shirts from this vendor but I can tell you these are not large . They seem to be a half a size smaller , like in-between medium & large . So all 5 shirts do not fit me . Also , the weight of the fabric is not heavy by any means . These are light weight fabric . My advice is , if you must buy them , buy one size larger than you normally get , but as for me , if Hanes is gon na try & increase their profit margin by giving me a substandard product , they are n't going to ever get my business again . And I have to add that my employer buys us Beefy-T 's every year , and they are n't cheezie like these are , so I do n't know what 's going on except to say I 'm really unhappy with my purchase . If you want to know which t-shirt I ended up with that is a fantastically good buy , check out my other reviews .
 I bought this shirt at walmart years ago , fits great , my favorite t-shirt . i still have it actually with holes in the arm pits and all over it . fits perfect , so i wanted to replace it with the exact same hanes beefy t in the same size thinking it would fit the same . Wrong , the new shirt i ordered was tiny and when i washed it it got even tinier . next time ill just go to walmart its cheaper anyways .
 Long time wearer of Beefy-T 's . The last set I bought were at least 2 inches shorter for the same size -LRB- XXL -RRB- ... C'mon Hanes ...
 They came in great colors but they seem to lose body quickly.They came in great colors but they seem to lose body quickly .
 These shirts run small ; I had to return them.Also , they give the impression that they are heavy weight . They are not .
 Be advised that you can probably get the beefy tees for less directly from Hanes , as I did.Also -LRB- a big bummer -RRB- over the last few years , I have received a tee shirt that is notas thick a material as it used to be . I have worn beefy tees ever since I had asign company that also did silk screening on just about anything , and we used to order only the beefy tees as they were a better T shirt than any other , but this wasthirty years ago , and the product has definitely changed no matter what Hanes or anybody else says . I do n't have a problem with the sizing as others do , and at $ 9.00 each with pocket directly from Hanes , it is still a good deal.Addendum : Contacted Hanes and gave them all the sorted details they ask for in hopes youwill not E-mail them back -LRB- Color , where they were made , price , etc. etc. -RRB- . All a bunch of bunk when they have my order number.This is nothing more than Corporate greed , just like Levi , Maytag and so many others .
 i did n't know the word &#34; beefy &#34; was a size issue . i thought it was more of a discriptive quality issue , so when it arrived and my whole family could wear it together i was n't happy
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .

 Do n't be misled , this is NOT a low profile cap ! I have a standard cap just like it so was excited to find a low profile cap in the same design . Pictures can be misleading but if you look closely you can see that the had is standard not low profile . Robert is disapointed !
 These shirts were not what I expected . As soon as I washed them , they shrunk and did not hold their original shape . The end of the sleeves began to roll up ... and that was only after one wash straight out of the package . Will wait until I get back to the US to buy the correct type .
 This is not a t-shirt suitable for outer wear.It comes out of the wash wrinkled , a bit shrunken and with misshapen collar and sleeves.Care directions followed to the letter with the newest digital laundry equipmentokay for sleepwear and as a hidden under layer . I wo n't buy again .
 I received these shirts to wear under my flight suit but they are more of an Air Force greenish tan than brown tan . Not what I expected from the picture . Also I ordered large and the necks are huge and look like crap . I can not wear these in a military uniform . They may be good if you work as a mechanic and need a grease rag that is why I will give two stars .

 Well I purchased this shirt about a week ago for and airsoft operation i was attending . When the package arrived it looked good so I did n't assume anything was wrong at that point ... Then I opened it and to my surprise the shirt was terrible . The quality of the material was horrible and the seams had been sown wrong causing the entire shirt to twist and be unwearable . I was very disappointed in the quality of this product and would suggest to pay a little more to get something that would actually be functional .

 Had to return this , it was n't what I was hoping for . Not great quality and did n't look flattering.The front piece was weird .
 The product did NOT FIT as displayed . -LRB- I am a sz 6 ; purchased Lg . -RRB- Does not go to the waist , therefore no tummy flattening help . Cut at leg is much higher . Product shrinks . I would not award any stars as rating.DO NOT USE MY REAL NAME !!!
 I 'm 5 ' 6 '' and ordered this supposed one size fits all and was disappointed to fInd out that it was several inches too short . I ended up having to wear them because I did n't have enough time to find another pair .
 This costume looks nothing like the item description/photo . The face mask was poorly constructed , and my son immediately asked to send it back . We were very disappointed .
 It seems that I ca n't review this as a no stars item , but that is my real number . It was shipped on time , but the product looks like something I would walk by in a Dollar Store . The sweater is not . It 's a very thin material that you could n't even use as a rag . The mask looks more like a hobo than Freddie Kruger . The mask will fall apart in a short time because it 's made out of som sort of compressed paper scrap . I could have left off the s in scrap . Do n't buy this for your kid , he is better than that .
 Mask broke same day I bought it . . shirt was filmy and cheap . I was very upset . It was on time but that 's all .
 The shirt was horrible ... and so was the mask !!! I went and purchased a shirt and did it myself it was 10x better !!
 im barley getting my costume can someone send me a picture of how the costume will look at my email christianlopez369@yahoo.com
 I purchased this after reading all the bad reviews so i was nervous . I do believe that it is very cheaply made , and without the other accessories the costume would not work . After all is said and done the costume is going to work for us this year but the picture i posted is a more accurate photo of actual costume .
 We saw the picture of the custome in the computer , even in the box when we received and it is not the same ... different quality ... . I feel like they cheat me .
 The mask is very poorly made out of super cheap material . The costume is okay . The mask tore away from the elastic band behind my grandson 's head the first day he played with it . There is no educational value to this toy which is what we expected .
 The mask claims to be adult size . However unless your a child , do n't plan to have much us with it . It wo n't fit .
 Quality was fine but the sizing was way off . This was more of a child 's size mask than an adults .
 I bought three shirts for my son-in-law . Each shirt had a Walls logo embroidered on the upper center back in a very obvious place . Anywhere else would have been more appropriate . As it is , I think he will trade them for another size and a different brand .
 This was exactly what I had been looking for . Long enough , light weight , attractive , and very comfortable . However the zipper broke the first time I wore it . The zipper will not stay closed . Pops apart in several locations every time I zip it . I had thrown away the packaging , etc so I did not return it.So right now the robe is pretty much useless unless I want to pay to have another zipper put in .
 This product came with a broken zipper . I did n't realize it until a few week after purchase when I first wore it . Very disappointing .
 The zipper does not work well . It opens up as soon as you try to zip it closed . I have to discard this item as a result .
 When I ordered this it said it was in stock and would ship within 24 hours . I also ordered a t-shirt at the same time . I received the t-shirt 2 weeks later -LRB- do n't understand the `` ships within 24 hrs . '' if it took me 2 weeks to receive the shirt -RRB- and the packing slip said the sweatshirt was backorder cancelled . I called customer service at Old Glory which is were the shirts were coming from and they said the delay from when i placed my order with Amazon until the time they got it from Amazon , the sweatshirt was no longer available . I am still waiting for somebody to put the money back into my account . I 'll not order anything this way again .
 I am very disappointed -- the product description above indicates that this jacket is 100 % cotton . It is NOT . The tag on the jacket shows 80 % cotton and 20 % polyester .

 Its been about 2 months since purchasing this boot . The 3rd party vendor had a great price and delivered on time , so 5 stars there.The shoe however get mixed reviews . Being a long time Columbia customer , I was n't surprised by the out of the box quality except that I remember thinking how flimsy the plastic speed lace clips looked ... sure enough one has already broke and I no longer use the speed clip feature , always keeping them laced with fingers crossed on the remaining three . -LRB- As an aside , Columbia customer service also gets a mixed review on this . While the clip would be covered under warranty I still will need to cover the freight one way . While this is the industry standard as pointed out to me by the on line customer rep , I do n't feel I should pay one more cent for an under-engineered fault of Columbia 's . And really , do you want to buy something from a just average company ? -RRB- Otherwise the boots do what I had expected , relatively light weight , waterproof , and comfortable , with just enough flex in the uppers to not chafe yet provide support . Grip is good too on varying surfaces except glare ice . I agree with other reviewers that this is an active wear boot , and would not recommend it for sub zero Fahrenheit temps and long periods of inactivity . And , if you overnight with them , plan on sleeping with them to prevent freezing since the liners are not removable . For my 45 minutes a day walking commute to work and day hikes in the upper Midwest the boot works well.Would I buy them again ? Not without a lot more research for an alternative -LRB- preferably with a metal speed lace clip ! -RRB- .
 The seams between the rubber and the leather started failing the first year . I sewed them up and patched them with ShoeGoo , but then the rubber started cracking in several other places . In total I have three major separations at the seams , and 6 other large cracks in the rubber .
 After wearing only a couple dozen times the rubber started to come apart on these where they are stiched together at the seam between the upper and lower sections . I expect that from a 19 dollar mart-mart boot , not something from Columbia . Disappointing.Columbia also wo n't respond to inquiries about their product . Buy something else made by someone else .
 Worked OK for a few outings , but seams fell apart at the seams after approximately 10 wearings . -LRB- See other reviews for confirmation that this is not an abberation . -RRB- Ridiculous . Will * never * buy a Columbia product again . Period .
 As with others I have had the same problem with the bottom plastic/rubber coming undone from the upper fake leather . Also the plastic/rubber gets stiff in the cold and then cracks in multiple places . Worthless boot made in China for a few dollars and then marked up by Columbia to 75 dollars . Avoid at all costs . Columbia will not fix or replace .
 Purchased in late 2006 to replace a pair of Sorels that I had worn for 8 years for snowplowing , showshoeing and winter hiking . Did not start wearing the Bugabootoos until winter 2007 and was surprised that the seam between leather uppers and rubber boot separated within a few weeks . In 2008 , the seam pulled apart entirely , allowing moisture through . Although I like the boot styling , I expected better from Columbia . This year , I will go back to Sorel for the long term .
 So I spend 75 bucks thinking I 'll get a quality boot . The false security of thinking big bucks means quality . Not so . The boot as designed has a major flaw where the rubber -LRB- plastic -RRB- is stitched to the leather uppers . Just wo n't hold . Also the plastic -LRB- rubber -RRB- cracks and splits . Once that happens the waterproof boot becomes a disaster . Here 's the fact , Jack . If you want a waterproof boot , buy a complete rubberized boot . The galoshes of old . The bastardized approach of leather and rubber means problems down the road , say in 5 weeks.Also I notice they are made in China , probably some big factory that turns out the same bugaboot that costs 20 bucks . Save your bucks and buy the pull on galoshes . Or stay out of the water and wear Timberland leathers .
 I 've given up on Columbia 's boots ... I 've had 3 pairs over the past few years and the rubber part over top of the foot has cracked open on all 3 letting snow/water in . It 's too bad really because otherwise I liked them ... they were warm and comfortable for long winter walks and snowshoeing . Anyway , they get a 2-star rating from me .
 I bought a pair of Bugaboots about 6 years ago and have worn them maybe 10 to 15 times . The boots are barely broke in and when I went to use them recently I pulled the lace right through the D Ring . Upon further examination I noticed that more than half of the D Rings are nearly corroded through , and these boots are barely broken in . Columbia 's warranty department informed that this would be considered normal wear and that they would not be willing to compensate me for the inferior product . I have owned many lower priced boots and have never had an issue even close to this happen to them . I used to think that Columbia was a premium product , and they have always been priced to reflect that , but this situation has completely changed my mind . I would strongly suggest not wasting your money on an overpriced inferior product .
 Third time wearing my Bugabootoo boots , no more than 6miles walked , and already a 3 '' separation between the leather & rubber sections . A tear , really , since this is a split in the rubber along the seam connecting to the uppers
 Used these boots only a few times and stored them properly . Rubber disintegrated during a winter hike when I was 4 miles and 2500 vertical feet from the nearest trail head . Thank goodness I had duct tape ! Could have been a realy bad situation . Columbia unwilling to help . Brand reliability and service is important to me so I guess I will never purchase from them again . Bean and REI are in my future . Their items are quality and service can not be outdone .
 I had owned these boots for about 3 years and wore them in the winter and a couple of times a year when working at work camps in the summer . I had been pretty happy with the boots because they are comfortable and held up pretty well.This past summer , however , one of the seams on the front part of the boot -LRB- just below the bottom left lace -RRB- tore apart . The rest of the boot is in great shape , but I am obviously very disappointed in the workmanship of this boot . That being said , I can not recommend these boots to anyone who intends to keep them for more than 2 years.I sent an email to Columbia customer service with photos of the broken seam to see if they would replace the boot . Stay tuned .
 I purchased these boots to last through Chicago winters . They are relatively light and comfortable , but the contact point between the rubber and leather begins cracking , letting in moisture and hurting one 's foot . For the price , these boots should be durable -- instead they are defective .
 The boot is comfortable in the foot and is warm and waterproof with good traction . However , the upper chafes my legs just above the ankle . I have noticeable abrasions and extreme discomfort . I do n't normally have this problem with boots . I believe that the upper is too rigid . In any event , I can not wear this boot anymore because it is so uncomfortable .

 I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand , price , and product description . This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners . The seams chafe and it does not `` wick away moisture . '' The slow shipping did n't help my opinion either . It is a nice bra for less active endeavors .

 This visor is square in shape instead of oval , I have never seen a square visor before . It looks very strange . Also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . I will not be wearing mine .
 This visor is unbelievably bad . Most visors are actually curved to fit around your forehead and have soft terry cloth against your skin . Not this visor . This visor has the thin nylon fabric that covers the brim against your forehead , and under that , right in the middle of your forehead , is a raised hard block about 2 '' long by 1 '' high -LRB- with no curve what-so-ever to this 2 '' block -RRB- which is positioned and pushed right into the middle of your forehead . I have no idea what the purpose or reason for this block of hard plastic is . You really have to see it to believe it . It is absolutely the most uncomfortable visor , hat or other item that I have ever worn on my head . It is a total waste of money . How they can possibly call this a `` no headache '' visor is totally beyond me . It gives me an instant headache and is way more uncomfortable than the cheap visors from Target or Walmart that often feel too tight and uncomfortable after an hour or so . I ca n't wear this for more than 15 minutes without being in real , actual pain . It even leaves a clearly visible red indentation in the middle of my forehead . I would return this instantly if I bought it from a store . But having to pay for the shipping both ways makes it not worth returning . I 'm going to just through it in the trash . At least I got a few laughs when I showed it to friends on a recent cruise and let them try on my `` no headache '' visor . Would give it 0 stars if I could .
 The satiny fabric covering the visor is nice , but it is basically inexpensive plastic underneath and breaks easily . Additionally , under the fabric in the upper middle of the visor , there is a `` ledge '' of sorts , which leaves a very visible DENT in your forehead when you take the visor off . I do not recommend this product .
 It 's un comfortable and hurt my forehead . It 's stiff and unpleasant to wear . I would not buy it again . In fact , i had to buy another visor to repplace it .
 Bought a new one . It arrived falling apart at the seams and definitely causes headaches . Hurts to wear for more than 5 minutes .

 Not happy with the product . It wants to slip off my foot . I really had high hopes because this is the second clog sock I have purchased and I ca n't seem to find one that wo n't slip off my foot .
 The product states that it is made with 70 % cotton28 % nylon and 2 % spandex . I thought with all the cotton , -LRB- the reason why I ordered it -RRB- that these socks would be soft . They are very scratchy , so I wo n't be ordering more of them .

 I have a hard time buying things online because I am a very visual person ! This item was very poor quality . I wore it 3 times and washed it 4 times and the threads were so thin in places you could see through it . I was also 2x bigger than a normal sized medium . I do not recomend this Company `` Hice ''
 Material is paper thin . Colors are not near as vibrant as in picture . Very disappointing , but also very cheap . Good example of you get what you pay for .
 I didnt try this on my son right away , I assumed 2T would fit since all other regular 2T clothes do . Well the shirt was too tight , and the stitching around the buttons was gathered and didnt look good . The pants and the hat were cute , but we ended up just spending more and getting him an adorable tuxedo elsewhere . If your spendng a lot of money on your wedding , go the extra mile to make sure your little guys look good its so worth it . He looked awesome in the tux we got him .
 on the computer the outfit looks good however the material is looks cheap and is of poor quality . The size is inaccurate , very disappointing .
 This outfit is absolutely adorable !! But I 'm giving it 2 stars because the sizing is way off and the fabric seems plow quality . We ordered a 9-month outfit for our 7-month old -LRB- who is of average to just-below-average size -RRB- , and it does n't fit . We will have to buy a separate shirt , and the pants may still fit when we need it next week , but they 'll be a little tight ... and his legs are normally still fitting into 3-6 months pants !! Sigh . The hat completely did n't fit , even when it arrived when he was 5.5 months . Sort of expected that , because his head circumfrance is on the larger size , but was a little surprised , given that it 's supposed to fit a 9-month old . So we had to buy a new hat . All in all , I would probably suggest buying the knickers/suspenders/tie separately -LRB- if that 's an option -RRB- and trying to find a shirt/hat elsewhere . The other thing about the shirt ... it 's a tuck in , not a onesie . So on a baby , you can imagine it wo n't stay put for long .

 This is a beautiful product , just not the one pictured . The mantilla in the picture is MUCH larger than the ones I received . Bought two -LRB- one for favorite aunt 's birthday -RRB- and was disappointed .
 I bought this bra because the ad says 100 % cotton . There is no cotton in this bra . It is 86 % nylon and 14 % elastane . If you want a cotton bra , this is not for you .
 Product was shipped out promptly , but unfortunately it never showed up to MY SHIPPING ADDRESS . The item was shipped USPS first class mail , when I checked the tracking number , all it said was the zip code and town it was shipped to . There was no address or even a signature of who signed for the package . Basically , I was told to call the Post Office myself and find it .
 I wanted these specifically because they state you can not see panty lines on even the clingiest of clothes . It 's not true -- I had panty lines . I do not wear skin tight clothes , but most clothes have spandex in them so they are fitted .
 It 's un comfortable and hurt my forehead . It 's stiff and unpleasant to wear . I would not buy it again . In fact , i had to buy another visor to repplace it .
 Bought a new one . It arrived falling apart at the seams and definitely causes headaches . Hurts to wear for more than 5 minutes .
 This visor is square in shape instead of oval , I have never seen a square visor before . It looks very strange . Also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . I will not be wearing mine .
 This visor is unbelievably bad . Most visors are actually curved to fit around your forehead and have soft terry cloth against your skin . Not this visor . This visor has the thin nylon fabric that covers the brim against your forehead , and under that , right in the middle of your forehead , is a raised hard block about 2 '' long by 1 '' high -LRB- with no curve what-so-ever to this 2 '' block -RRB- which is positioned and pushed right into the middle of your forehead . I have no idea what the purpose or reason for this block of hard plastic is . You really have to see it to believe it . It is absolutely the most uncomfortable visor , hat or other item that I have ever worn on my head . It is a total waste of money . How they can possibly call this a `` no headache '' visor is totally beyond me . It gives me an instant headache and is way more uncomfortable than the cheap visors from Target or Walmart that often feel too tight and uncomfortable after an hour or so . I ca n't wear this for more than 15 minutes without being in real , actual pain . It even leaves a clearly visible red indentation in the middle of my forehead . I would return this instantly if I bought it from a store . But having to pay for the shipping both ways makes it not worth returning . I 'm going to just through it in the trash . At least I got a few laughs when I showed it to friends on a recent cruise and let them try on my `` no headache '' visor . Would give it 0 stars if I could .
 The satiny fabric covering the visor is nice , but it is basically inexpensive plastic underneath and breaks easily . Additionally , under the fabric in the upper middle of the visor , there is a `` ledge '' of sorts , which leaves a very visible DENT in your forehead when you take the visor off . I do not recommend this product .
 TSHIRTS ARE PURPLE NOT BLUE!I ORDERED THE BLUE CAMO TSHIRTS FOR MY CHEERLEADING SQUAD . THEY WERE GREAT IN SENDING THEM ON TIME FOR OUR CHEER CAMP , BUT THE SHIRTS WERE PURPLE !!! IT IS MIDNIGHT BEFORE CAMP AND I AM TRYING TO DYE THEM BLUE -LRB- LIKE THE PICTURE AND THE NAME `` ELECTRIC BLUE '' -RRB- WITH RITZ DYE . THEIR SHORTS ARE BLUE AND THE PURPLE , BESIDES BEING TACKY , NOT WHAT WE ORDERED , DOES N'T MATCH !!!! VERY DISATISFIED AND I FEEL LIKE I 'VE BEEN CHEATED .

 this bra is very itchy , uncomfortable and a bad buy all around . i am a 48 F and ca n't find a bra that will support me comfortably . wish someone could make a bra for us bigger breasted women ...
 Would not recommend runs small ... stick uncomfortable pointy ... everything you do n't want in a bra ... it is not something I would ever buy again ! ~
 This bra may work for those of us with bullet or more pointy-shaped breats , but if your rounded , like me , this bra is ENTIRELY UNSUITABLE . Even ordering a cup size down , I would have had to stuff something in the nipple area just to fill out the pointed front of the cup . Weirdness ! And even if it had fit , the front seams are so obvious and unsightly that tee shirts are out of the question ! Let the Madonna jokes fly . This one went promptly back .
 The lining falls apart too fast . The ` uplift ' band crumbles over time . I ended up cutting the material under the arm and trying to empty it out . The straps are too short for a tall person , so the back keeps riding up and the gel shoulder pads position in front of the shoulder , not on top . A lot of money for such a poor fit .
 I was pleasantly surprised at how well this bra fit when it arrived ... great coverage in all the right places and very comfortable . However , after having worn it for a few weeks now , it really has `` let me down '' in the support department . It feels more like a sleep bra . I agree with other posters that for larger cup sizes , they should be using non-stretch straps for support . Also , the mesh netting on the back feels very thin and cheaply made , not offering the support it could . I would not buy this product again .
 Cup size not as generous as others I have had by glamorise . Returned another that was similar to brand slam . Looks pointy under garments .
 Would not reccomend ! No uplift ! No support ! Uncomfortable ! I am so sorry I ordered it . Will not be wearing it !
 My fellow large-chested women know the drill
 This is a pretty bra , and I will say it is comfortable however I will not leave the house with this thing on . Talk about Torpedoes !! My husband , being his ever humorous self actually had the nerve to say `` burn that thing before you put an eye out '' ... great . I spent more than I should have on it without knowing how pointy the thing would be . This bra reminds me of that bra Madonna used to wear in her videos . I ca n't return it now that I 've tried it on and I am stuck with something I would n't be caught dead in . I 'm a 36DD so maybe this thing would be OK for a bigger gal but for me , I made a very expensive mistake . Ugh .
 I am a 40F and this bra although it is pretty does not hold or lift the girls up . I will be sticking with Goddess . This bra is good for night-time lounging around the house .
 Okay , before purchasing I ALWAYS look at the reviews and wonder if they are real or fabricated to sell the product . I am 33yrs old , have been top heavy since I was 12 and the girls did n't stop growing until my mid-20 's . Finding a bra that fit properly has always been a challenge and through the years I acquired tons of bras . I could never find the one that simply fit properly and did n't cost me tons of money . So , I bought this bra thinking it was the one and when I received it I WAS ECSTATIC , YAYY ! Until ... less than ten washes and the bra came apart . The material did n't hold together for anything , the material also pulls away from the exposed chest area making the bra seem loose.I am once again disappointed . If you would like a bra that gives a nice lift , not too expensive , but do n't mind replacing it several times and make your breasts look like the bra is too big for you , then this bra is for you ! Ladies who are top heavy do n't waste your time or money making this purchase .
 This product has no support at all . Very flimsy design . I hate it and would n't recommend it to anyone . After wearing a few times the back of the bra rides up . Very uncomfortable .
 It just fits weird . I thought it looked strange on the model in the white bra -LRB- see color selection photos -RRB- and assumed it was just that they had a full figure item on a not so full figure model . No , it actually fits this full figured -LRB- 44H -RRB- woman like that . That extra bit of fabric on the underside does not seem to be part of the cup or the band and causes an odd lumpy look.The side panel fabric is way too flimsy to offer any side support.Also , the bottom elastic band somehow manages to fit snug in the back and loose in the front . How is that even possible ? I mean snug and very loose . My engineer husband spent way too much time trying to figure this out last night .
 I think I would really like this bra if the seller decided to send me my correct size ! They do make boobies a tad pointy , but I like the way it lifts ! Good support .
 Not strong enough to hold up this size cup . Need stronger material.The woman said &#34; no support . &#34; Woman said bust not held up .
 I need a wire-free bra right now due to costochondritis . This definitely has the support , but turns the girls into a cone shape . It looked absurd under a shirt , so had to end it back .
 Not worth the 25 plus s & h paid for this . Bra is very uncomfortable !!! The cups are very separated making your breast very far apart . Also very pointy making breast look like cones . Did not like one bit
 Within the first hour that I had this bag , one of the snaps broke off the pockets . The bag looks like a khaki color in the photo but its really an ugly green color . The fabric is thin , and the inside pockets are very flimsy . Do not buy this bag .

 I really liked the design of this buckle , but found the dimensions are just too big . Like , cowboy belt buckle BIG . Plus it 's not nearly as shinny as the picture makes it out to be . This belt buckle would be much better if it was sized 33 % to 50 % smaller . Bottom line
 I bought this bra because the ad says 100 % cotton . There is no cotton in this bra . It is 86 % nylon and 14 % elastane . If you want a cotton bra , this is not for you .

 Not sure what 's going on with Luggagepoint 's Amazon account , but I 'm sadly not the only person with items they ordered and never got . These bags are great , I 've had 2 already but I ca n't really give a positive review to a company that keeps promising me tracking info and then never gives me anything.I will likely be ordering the same bag from their competitor at a higher price because a low price is n't worth it if you never get any merchandise.Oh well ...
 These tights are basically a t-shirt material and useless if your purpose is to keep warm . Opt for the Mec Ankle tights instead , which are more like spandex performance wear material .

 Described as one size fits all . Well ... no ! Not a chance for me to wear it . Not an adult size . Fits my 3-year-old grandson tough .
 I got a large and it does n't fit at all . If I force my head in there I would probably cut circulation off to my brain and pass out . Does not look good either . On another note , item delivered on time .
 Buyer beware , these tights might fit an extremely tall and thin cucumber , but not a human being.I 'm a plus size - but not all that plus - I ordered size 4 because my body , in addition to being overweight and tall , is quite mature and as other mature consumers know , we need to shop for bigger sizes . These tights are a waste of $ .
 Not a whole lot of support . Wish it had a tad more lycra . They get a bit saggy by the afternoon . I do n't recommend .
 Unfortunately ordered these a couple of months ago and just got them out to put them on . Great big hole where one of the big toes should be . Open and inspect in detail immediately if you buy these , I have missed the return cut off - so it 's a complete rip off .
 The tights are great but Amazon is charging $ 12.50 a pair even if you buy two pairs . The packaging says they are 2 for $ 20 . Amazon will charge you $ 25 for 2 pairs . Better off going to the mall . Customer service reps would not honor the price on the package .
 I do n't know of any other company that sells such a variety of opaque , colorful tights . I bought a large number of them and did n't discover that some were damaged before the return date had expired . When they are good , they are very , very good and when they are bad ... it 's a waste.I hope they will step up their quality control .
 I have a ton of HUE tights and I love them
 I ordered this bra and the Moving Comfort Juno at the same time . I already had one of the Juno model , and really liked it . This was a first try for the ISIS , and I do n't like it as well . It 's not as supportive , and the lower band rides up under the bust during workout activity . I might recommend it to someone looking for a little less support -LRB- or someone who needs less than a D-cup -RRB- , but it is n't working for me as well as the Juno .
 The Tank Top 's straps that go over your shorders are uneven -LRB- one side wider than the other -RRB- , made in Chuna , seconds
 Ordered a 38D for someone who has always been a 38D and it was too small . The tags were already off so it can not be returned . Wo n't be doing business with these folks again soon .
 This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable . The lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material .
 I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this bra . It does n't just run on the small side , the sizes are completely off . Believe us , the cup size is about 2 sizes smaller than should be . If you order a `` D '' cup in this bra , you will get the equivalent of a `` B '' cup , I went so far as to measure it against a `` B '' cup and they were approximately the same size . Save you money , time , and return postage .
 The sizing is seriously off on this item . I am on the small side of a 36D and prefer minimizer bras . Although I always wearing bras on the tightest hook , on even on the loosest hook , this bra was too tight . The D cup fit like a B cup .
 The outer lace on this bra began ripping on the first wear and now there are little rips 1-2 inches all over the cups of the bra . Disappointing to say the least
 ALL OLGA BRAS RUN SMALL ... FOR SOME REASON , OLGA BRAS ARE MADE SMALL ON THE SIDES OF THE CUP . . I AM A 36 DD , NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BALI , ETC. . . I HAVE TRIED MANY OLGA BRAS ON AND HAVE ALSO TRIED ON A NEXT LARGER CUP SIZE , I HAVE TRIED GOING DOWN A BAND SIZE AND UP THE CUP SIZE , OR WHATEVER , STILL USELESS FOR ME ANYWAY . . IT 'S JUST NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR ME . . I WAS TOLD BY 2 FITTERS , IF YOU ARE A 36 DD , YOU ARE A 36 DD , THAT IS THAT . SOME BRANDS ARE JUST NOT RIGHT FOR YOU , SO DO N'T TRY CHANGING THE SIZES ... I AGREE ... THANK YOU , GOOD LUCK
 The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin . There should be a warning on the tag but there is n't . If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this . In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic . This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout .

 I have a very small frame and wear a 32D . I have a number of underwire Wacoal bras with foam cups that work very well for my size , but this bra is painful to wear . When I first tried it on , I thought I would like it . By the end of the day , I was regretting the purchase . The wires are sized for a much larger framed person than would be able to wear a 32 , so the wires dig up into the flesh under my armpits . The bra is very pretty and the band size is consistent with my other Wacoal 32D bras . The disproportionate length of the wires makes the bra too uncomfortable to wear . I may try to return it , but I do n't think I will be able to now that I have worn it .
 I was extremely dissappointed with this bra and consequently had to return it . The size was way off -LRB- very small -RRB- The quality was not what I am used to in a Wacoal bra .

 Nice stockings , but not if you are overweight.I purchased these for my mother who weighed about 110 pounds , at 4 ' 10 '' . She did have a problem with leg swelling . The tops of these stockings were too tight for her , cutting off her circulation , and she could n't wear them . Therefore , I would n't recommend them for anyone whose legs are stocky or that has a circulation problem .
 I ordered a 38x32 , and this was like a 42x36 : SBeware of the size !!!!! BAD PRODUCT ! Totally different in description and pictureMaterials are poor ... looks cheap !
 The fit and finish of this jeans is not what it looks like in the product image . Returned the item immediately .
 For loose fit jeans , these are below standard . Everything about them signals very low quality including fit , appearance and construction.First , what I got is more flared out at the bottom of the leg than the picture . It has 5 beltloops , instead of the standard 7 . The material is quite thin and looks cheap in the blue color I selected , contrary to the product photo . The stiching is poor and obviously so.The maker , Nautica , brands itself to reflect the adventure and tradition of exploration of the world by sailboats of a bygone era . These jeans are a bit wide at the bottom of the leg and do slightly suggest the wide pants ending in a bell that the U.S. Navy began to wear in the early nineteenth century . However , the material and overall fit betray the branding idea.I can not recommend these jeans for the above reasons .
 I 'm so disappointed with Nautica jeans . I find that they are getting worn out too quickly , even when they are being worn in an office setting .
 The darker color of these and new style are horrible compared to the original faded blue . This new version looks like crap ! a black pair of Levis would be better .
 I bought a 38x32 -LRB- the same jeans I buy at the Nautica outlet -RRB- . The jeans came in as a 38x32 but the legs are REALLY long.Materials appear to be a bit cheaper than the average Nautica jeans I have bought in the past .
 A very nice Jacket , what I was looking for , but the sizing was not correct . When I buy that size in a store it fits ... from JR Stone it was at least two sizes too small.had to return it .
 The title kind of says it all . If you 're going to wear linen , it should be comfortable and these were not . If you are going to buy them , get them in white because the stone is hideous
 The zipper is sewn at an angle such that it wo n't stay zipped no matter what . I had to sew it closed . -LRB- I promise I have the right size and am definitely not popping out of it or `` busty '' . -RRB- Also , it is important to note that it ties in a bow behind your neck . I had guessed that , since there was a zipper , it would just slip over your head . On a positive note , my husband thinks it 's gorgeous , but I kind of think it accentuates my hips in a big way .
 This bra was unattractive in the picture , but i thought if it held me up and was comfortable , it would be worth it . What a shame . It is horribly uncomfortable -LRB- the underwire comes up unnecessarily high in the front middle , poking into my rib -RRB- and it makes me freakishly misshapen -LRB- the top pinches down so much that it flattens me and causes my skin next to my armpits to bulge over the top . -RRB- What a huge waste of money .
 I took a chance on this bra even though the description does n't say what kind of lining/padding it has -LRB- at least not as of the date I ordered it or the date of this review -RRB- . It has the thinnest lining . I poked straight through it -LRB- and this is supposed to be a bra for fuller figures ? who would n't poke through this thing ? -RRB- . The company said they wo n't give me my money back , they only do exchanges . No thanks .
 Because I am well-endowed , I have never been able to wear one . I have been big up top since I was 11 . I do have a long-line corset by goddess which I used for my wedding but it is uncomfortable and now since I have lost a little weight it is way too big . I have it on now and am just trying to get used to it . Hopefully it wo n't take that long . I have a few outfits , I want to try it with . I will wear it for the remainder of the day to see how it goes.I used the measurements and it said for me to order a 40DDD . I probably should may have gotten a 38 because it giggles when I walk a little at the top maybe that 's the key.UPDATE
 This strapless is a nice bra but I needed it for a bridesmaid dress and it flattened me out . It also is cut straight across the top so if you are wearing a shirt or dress with cleavage , you can see the bra .
 IT SUCKS ! IT IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH TO FIND A BRA THAT FITS AND THIS ONE WAS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT . . THE PLASTIC ON THE INSIDE STARTED FALLING OFF WITHIN THE FIRST FEW TIMES OF WEARING IT . . WHICH MADE ME ITCH . .
 I read all the reviews and thought that I had a good product . I ordered my size 34DD and it 's does n't even come close to supporting or , in fact , covering my breasts , much less staying in place . And it is so expensive to be that far off the mark .
 I gave this review two stars only because the material and workmanship of this product is really beautiful . Unfortunately , wearing this is very , very uncomfortable . Would not buy again .
 wore them once and a hole formed at the tip of my left big toe . I have short toe nails , so that was n't a problem . Very thin . In all honesty , this is really just a dress sock . A cheap dress sock . Do n't believe me ? Just buy it . The packaging looks like it was done it a back room where they just slapped gi sock stickers on it .
 At $ 3 bucks a pair not worth the sock the foot came in ... send it back to CHINA . I walk outside for a living and demand to right equipment to complete my daily task . These socks will not get the job done .
 This item is very thin and is not made well . The hat torn instantly once my son put it on . I would not purchase this item again .

 I am disappointed with this bag . The purse is not firm sided , it is floppy and has no body to it . The picture makes it look like it would stand up on its own . However this bag is like a wrinkly old 70 's purse . I do not like the thick strap which is wooly and hot . The zipper is too large and very hard to zip .
 Apparently the designer of this shirt expected a pregnant woman who wears an extra large to also wear an A cup bra !
 Let 's face it , ladies , if we 're well-endowed , then no strapless will save us ! I love Wacoal because it 's the only product line with high-quality size 32D -LRB- big - and now post-pregnancy - boobs on a small frame -RRB- wireless bras . I ended up having to retun this because like EVERY strapless I 've tried , it just did n't hold 'em up . Sigh ...
 I wish I could give a better review of this item , but unfortunately , Amazon interpreted a black , 32DD , as a nude 36 DD ! So needless to say it 's on it 's way back home . I was able to find an alternative -- also Wacoal , black , and in my size ! Did I mention I paid over 60 percent LESS than this bra ? It 's not the same style , but the Wacaol quality and fit is there . You would be surprised at the deals you will find when you 're willing to step outside of your house and do some bargain hunting .
 I never received this item . I got two notices from UPS and was never able to pick it up before it left the post office . I 'm not even sure if the money was refunded into my account yet.Thanks for any help on where this item might be . I would like to send it back at this point because I already ordered and received another one .

 Item looks more durable in the image but its actually pretty thin like a nylon windbreaker material . It is pack able but somewhat pricey for what you get .
 the product was fine & shipped very quickly . But i was sent the wrong size . I could n't get in touch with the company by phone . Instead they e-mailed me a few days later & said that I could mail the product back & when they recieved it they would mail out the replacement , but i did explain that I needed the costume sooner than that . I was also told that I would have to pay for return shipping again & then shipping for my new product . I do n't think that 's right when I was sent the wrong size !!
 This product is made of very thin nylon . The quality is poor . The shipper charged me $ 22.90 for shipping when the website clearly states that it should have been $ 7.90 , extra for added weight . This is a very light product . I will not order from this shipper again .
 they sent me the wrong product . bad labeling . just bad everything . no wonder it was so cheap . do n't waste your money here .
 this item is cheap cheap cheap and when it showed up it was cheap cheap cheap . it was never represented as otherwise though and it arrived at my home quite quickly . extremely satisfied overall despite the little use i will get from it .
 According to the information on the website , these socks were listed as being 79 % cotton , 20 % stretch nylon , and 1 % spandex . When I received them , the label on them says they are 67 % cotton , 17 % acrylic , 15 % nylon , and 1 % spandex ... this is not what I wanted . Also , they are very thin and run small . I am disappointed and will not buy socks again online .
 Gold Toe Women 's Classic Crew SockThe socks are thin and instead of elastic to hold them up , have one tight thread around the top . They might do the job if you always wear socks down and need thin . The name `` gold toe '' lead me to believe it would be a quality , thick walking sock .
 BUYCOSTUMES sent the wrong item . Rather than sending out the correct product or a substitution , their response was `` too bad , return it to Amazon . ''
 Wash it once and it fades , snags , and buttons fall off . Also this color looks like the draperies in a cheap 1950s motel . Get the Izods instead .
 This is a great concept , but was poorly executed . The boning and elastic work great at smoothing out that muffin top and spare tire , but your excess fat is squeezed up to the top of the garment -- creating the effect of an extra pair of breasts below the natural ones , as well as giving you back cleavage.The same company makes a similar product that looks like a modern corset -LRB- Flexees Women 's Instant Slimmer Firm Control Waistnipper # 6868 -RRB- . This control garment works much better , except it has a tendency to ride up or down . However , it extends to the underside of the bust , creating a much more pleasing silhouette . Unfortunately it is too short to be worn with low-rise pants , but may be more suited toward wear with a dress or higher pants . When sitting down , however , the boning bends out unattractively.If you have a short torso , the product on this page just may work for you . Maybe . Otherwise look at the other product I mentioned in my review if you plan to be standing all night .
 ... could n't get the hooks hooked ! The panty part was easy to put on , i.e. , no calisthenics were necessary . When I was halfway thru the hook/corset part , I had a whopper hot flash , my hands and arms were cramping ... I had to sit and rest for a moment ... -LRB- I 'm kidding - it was n't that bad , but I honestly could not get the hooks hooked . -RRB- I 'm an out-of-shape/flabby size 12 and bought size large ; did n't think the XL would be ` controlling ' -LRB- tight -RRB- enough . Purchased 2 and they both went back . If you have this problem , try Flexees # 3918 . It 's not as ` pretty , ' has no ` hooks ' but it did tighten the flab and I do n't break into a sweat when I put it on . And it made almost TWO INCHES disappear !
 I ordered an XL , after seeing a review that said to get a smaller size than you would normally . I wear a size 20 jeans -LRB- loose fitting -RRB- , and wanted to try this to get my `` square butt '' hips under control ... . I wore it for about 30 minutes , and it was all I could stand . It hurt ! It rolled down from the top -LRB- in the back -RRB- and pinched on the front ... If you can stand the pain , it really does squeeze you in :-RRB- But for me - it would be less painful to diet and exercise regularly ... : -RRB-
 Ok , so this is good concept but the problem arises when you wear it and when you are big and have fat it does not work because it really is not big enough . What i mean is that it does work on the areas it covers but when it does it squeezes the fat and bulges fat into other areas . although my lower tummy was tucked in but alot of the fat was than squeezed up and bulged out from the upper ab . the thing needs to cover the area under the breast too !
 I was not able to use this item since it was much too small for a medium the size I always use . Item returned .
 I was deceived by the title , thought this was a Cinderella name brand dress . Cinderella is actually a better quality and could have gotten it at JC Penny for about the same price . I was not pleased with the material , it is very thin and can see right through to her legs . It does not come with a build in slip -LRB- like Cinderella dresses -RRB- to give it more body so now I will have to purchase that too . Not a very smart buy .
 I was very disappointed when this dress came . Very see through and shear , not at all the quality I expected .
 I was so excited when I ordered this dress , and was shocked when it arrived . The construction of the dress was horrible-the little white flowers on the skirt were hot glued on , sequins and beads were loose and falling off the bodice , and it was not fluffy and full like the picture-rather the skirt was skimpy on layers . The sizes were also odd . I measured both girls very carefully , as these are flower girl dresses , and while the length was fine , the bodices were enormously too wide . I am very disappointed in the dresses , but in my excitement to get them took off the tags , so I ca n't even get my money back . I will not be ordering from this company again .
 We ordered a toddler dress , the quality is awful , it is falling apart , the belt fell off on the first day , the buttons constantly unbutton , the tulle skirt is falling apart , we are afraid to wash the dress . I would not recommend it to anyone
 First time I 've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it 'll probably be my last ! I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 `` runs '' in one of the legs before I even tried them on . What a waste of money ... and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I 've already put way too much money into , what should be , an inexpensive product !
 These nylons ran as I was putting them on for the first time . Very poor quality . When I took them off -LRB- immediately , obvoiusly -RRB- I noticed many pinholes that would have eventually become runs as well . Worthless at any price .
 I ordered plus size pantyhose and it stated that it fits most plus size women . I am 190 pounds , so it is n't like I am extrememly overweight , and they did n't fit me . I even double checked that the pantyhose said plus size because I could n't believe that they would n't fit me . The price was right , but make sure that you are n't overweight or tall . I did n't return them because my sister could fit in them , so I will just have to look elsewhere for good crotchless pantyhose .
 These pantyhose were n't anything like the picture . The hole was much larger thanthe picture . As a matter of fact there was n't any material that connected the legs at all . The material above the hole was only about a 2 inches wide and it did n't even get over the hip area once you got them on
 I am extremely disappointed in the quality of these hose because they run easily and get holes in the toes . I purchased several pairs but have been able to wear each pair only once because of the poor quality . I realize they are not very expensive , but I would rather pay more for something that will last longer .
 These stockings are made of inferior quality and craftsmanship.Unfortunately , there is n't anything we can say positively about them . Truly sad.When my wife tried them on for the first time - they ran!The nylon is so horribly thin they do n't put up with much handling at all.Don ' t Waste Your Hard Earned Cash.Very Poor QualityBuy Another ProductSave Your Money For Something Better
 My girlfriend asked me to buy a pair of these for her to wear during our date night because ... Well , let 's just say `` because . '' She is n't huge or anything , but we ordered a larger pair just to be safe , and they barely fit her . The sizing information for these seems to be completely wrong . The hole did n't really line up well with her because they were a lot smaller than she thought they would be and they ripped a little the first time she put them on . I know they 're cheap , but come on - ripping the first time ? In addition , she said they felt a bit uncomfortable . She did n't have as much fun as she thought she would have with these . I thought they were kinda sexy looking , although they felt cheap to the touch . Especially once they were on , she asked me to feel how they felt on her leg , and they felt like they were going to come apart -LRB- in a bad way -RRB- to the touch . If you or your girlfriend/wife want a pair , go for something more expensive .
 I did not get this item , i got some thing differentwas not worth sending back , it was a gift
 These pantyhose were not what was pictured . I thought I was getting a hose that would have some coverage on my lower stomach , but that area is only about an inch wide .
 These panties are nylon/spandex -- not cotton . They 're as sheer as pantyhose ! They 're entirely see through . They 're horrible . Save your money . You might as well wear a pair of stockings without panties , because you 'll be covered just as well , which is to say not at all . I am shocked at how horrible these panties are . Shocked ! Do no waste your money on these .
 I have not received the product , so I can not give any comments about him . Best Regards for you . Good Afternoon .
 Do n't buy this costume unless you 're under 5 feet tall -LRB- product description of one size fits most adults is hilarious -RRB- . I 'm a smaller than average woman who 's only 5 ft. 6in . and the costume was a foot too short . Would have looked completely obscene on a man if you know what I mean ! The man in the picture must be 4 feet tall . I was also extemely dissapointed to find out that it did n't include the headpiece -LRB- said nothing about that on the website -RRB- . In fact the description was deceiving because I thought I 'd be receiving a decent costume with headpiece since the description states and charges for a 5 pound shipment when in fact the actual package I recieve did n't even weigh 1 pound . The color was n't close to what was pictured ; instead of the crushed brown velvet look of the costume I recieved an orange felt cheap quality jumpsuit . Then when I called to say there must be some kind of mistake because the costume was a foot too short , they argued insisting that they only promise it fits `` most '' people and they would n't let me return it . I had to inform them multiple times that I would not be keeping or paying for the defective item and they finally relented saying they 'd let me return it but would not refund the shipping . Nice !
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product . It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry . That 's what happens in dry weather . The fit is comfortable and it 's otherwise conveniently designed . The fabric in white is quite see-through . Later I purchased Turfer 's `` Womens 's Light Weight Endurance Jacket '' for $ 14.95 and that 's been the perfect windbreaker . It 's now up to $ 19.95 and I 'm ordering another color .
 $ 15.33 for 1 pair ??? I was shure stupid not to check the number of pairs of socks I was getting . it will not happen again !
 These socks are warm and comfortable . Unfortunately , a hole was worn on the toe by the second time I wore them .
 Never available in Large , the single most popular size ? What kind of marketing madness is that ? Makes no sense at all .
 I gave it 1 star because there 's to many 5 stars.The socks are real thick on the bottom half like these lovers say , but they did n't say that the top half , ankles , are made like CHEAP DISCOUNT STORE GRADE SOCKs . They FIT TIGHT & CUT YOUR CIRCULATION . They are fold over and stitched at the top cutting off circulation to your feet . I do n't care if they are so thick you do n't need to wear shoes . If you have a deep groove around your ankles you are cutting of blood flow to your feet.I am keeping the one pair I bought to see if I have some use for them but I wo n't buy more . The bottoms are so thick you could n't wear with the shoes you have . You would need a size larger shoe .
 One pair of crew socks was included in the sale . This was n't made clear in the product description , especially since most others come in multiple pairs . This item is very expensive and not much better in quality or comfort compared to the less expensive crew socks I 've tried .
 Product description did not say that pants were 18Long . Since I am 5 ' 1 '' , they are unwearable and will have to be sent back .
 This costume is made of extremely cheap materials . Ours was already torn , straight out of the packaging . I regret the purchase . Save your money and find a better quality product .
 I ordered this for my daughter , she loves wizard of oz . I ordered this for her birthday , First of all I ordered a small and got a meduim . Then when I got it the shoulder straps were all twisted , I think I am gon na have to cut the straps off and re sew them . Too much money for this costume , its not worth it .
 This is an adorable but flimsy costume . Do n't expect it to last a long time . Also , the sizing is a little different . I bought a size 4-6 only to find out thatit fits ages 3-4 . My 4-year-old loves the costume , but a sturdier version would have been preferable .
 Got the dress and was excited for our 6 year old to be dorthy this year , but the dress reeked so badly of pot we had to return it , even washing and fabrezeing the dress did n't help with the smell . DONT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE !!
 This dress was very cute , however it was poorly made . The straps were sown on all twisted and so we had to try and stitch them at the shoulders so they would seem straight . The shoulders at the seam were coming apart after only one hour of wear . Seveal of the seams at the arms and skirts were unraveling before putting on and had to be re-sewn . I had to put a lot of work into fixing the dress so she could wear it and at the price I paid should not have had too .
 My six year old daughter would have been heart broken if she could n't have been Dorothy this Halloween that is the only reason the costume was not sent back . I know these things are produced as quickly as possible , but the company the costume came from should really pay attention to quality control . If anyone -LRB- who cared -RRB- had checked the costume before packaging , they should have tossed it and sent another . I will not order from them again . With all the sewing I had to do to repair the costume , I could have started from scratch . VERY disappointed .
 My daughters costume tore when she first tried it on , we sewed it and halfway thru trick-or-treating the hemline was torn and hanging down to her knee .
 I ordered the `` deluxe '' Dorothy Costume , size Small . The sizing chart says 4-6 , so I figured my tall five year old would get one year of use out of it.The costume just arrived ... . and I literally laughed out loud when I pulled it out of the packaging . It looks so different than the picture and description . The quality is actually hysterical . If you turn the dress inside out , it looks like a drunk person was given a serger . The hem is uneven , the skirt underneath has holes in it , the neckline has an unfinished blue gingham collar instead of the white mock collar pictured ... . AND the BOW ! The bow is blue with gray insulation backing and is HALF-FINISHED ON THE EDGES WITH WHITE STITCHING only part of the way down the sides of the bow!I tried it on my daughter and the fit was terrible . Not only is it very short , despite the waist falling at her natural waist , but the straps are not even finished off on the side facing the body to lay flat.This costume is a disgrace and it 's right back today .
 I ordered this for my 4 year old granddaughter , since she loves to watch Wizard of Oz so much and dress like Dorthy . however , she will not even wear it . The dress has a petty coat inside and itches her so much she wants to give it away ... . waste of money in item and shipping charges ... I do not recommend for any child . .
 Okay , so the photo on-line shows that the costume looks a little short . My daughter is still five years old , and the other reviews seemed to indicate that the fit is fine , so I ordered the small . As soon as I took it out of the box , I could see that it would be too short for my daughter . Comparing the costume to dresses in her closet quickly confirmed my fears . The other thing I noticed quickly was that the collar did not lay right . The facing is shorter that the outer material , yet stitched to the collar as though it had been cut to shape along the collarbone . I can not imagine that this collar would be comfortable for anyone and it would probably require a few snips to make it lay flat along the base of the neck/throat . If your child is even average height for their age , size UP ! I ended up returning this costume and buying a reversible Dorothy/Glinda pinafore that is much more durable and beautifully made . It was over twice the price , but it is standing up to the rigors of dress-up and washing in this house .
 The pants come in time , but it is a defective pants and boots that one of his crooked this defect sewing and was sent to Venezuela.thanks !
 Everything about this shirt is great except for one thing , the wrinkles . I 've never owned a shirt that was this hard to iron the wrinkles out . When I wear it to work it gets so full of wrinkles that by noon it looks like I 've slept in the shirt.The sizing is excellent , the shirt is well made and will last a long time . I 'd give the shirt five stars is it were not for the wrinkles .
 I purchased this belt for my husband for Christmas . He wore it 3-4 times ... and the belt is coming apart at the seems . NEVER have we had a problem like this with a belt . We have ALWAYS been very happy with Geoffrey Beene items , and this is the first disappointment we have had with something.Don ' t purchase this belt . It will be returned .
 Description says belt is black/burgundy , but the packaging the belt comes in says black/brown . -LRB- And the belt clearly is black/brown . -RRB- It is time consuming to deal with a return !
 This is the second one of these I 've owned . I have to say that the reversible buckle is extremely fragile . I owned the first belt about 4-5 months before the buckle snapped off and I 've now owned the second for less than a day . The problem is that the reversible buckle is held by a very small metal clip and it breaks with any type of force applied . I 'm not even sure how the second one snapped . I must have accidentally stepped over the buckle when it was on the ground . I make it sound as though I 'm careless but how many times do you leave your belt lying on the floor or take extra precautions to insure that it wo n't snap in half just because you accidentally step on it . I 'm not even a heavy guy only at only 170 lbs and I actually have n't the faintest memory of stepping on the belt . Only that the buckle had been snapped off when I awoke the next morning . I like the look of the belt but I 'm just going to get a proper leather strap and buckle rather than purchase another one of these cheap belts again .

 I purchased this as a Halloween costume . As other reviews note , sizing chart is way off . Adult small is REALLY small . The sewing comes out really easily too . Good thing I only needed it for one night . Not worth the price I paid .
 I got this shirt in an extra large , and it is so snug around my mid section that I feel like The Comic Book guy from The Simpsons . However , there is no larger size available for this costume , so unless you are a die hard TNG fan , leave this alone and get the plus size shirts from Costume Craze , they look good without making you look like a fat boy . As far as authentic goes , these costumes are spot on , but that being said , fat boys need not wear spandex . Ever . Go with the plus size costumes for the new movie offered by Costume Craze , you will not be disappointed chubby people !
 I got this for a Halloween party and while it does have a good design and look it suffers from poor construction material and planning by the manufactures . The rank pips and Starfleet insignia that comes with the shirt are not metal but cloth that needs to be cut out of paper then glued on to the shirt . The fact that both Amazon , and the manufactures do n't provide a sizing chart I bet causes many people myself included to be conned out of a costume that is too big or too small.For all of you Star Trek fans out there I would look for another costume that is made with better quality .
 Please do not buy from this sell . The stuff they sell is absolute JUNK . The SIZING IS WAY OFF and they do not give refunds . And they will charge you $ 5.00 plus a 15 % restocking fee because their sizing charts are a joke . Please Amazon , do not let shady businesses like this do business on your site . COSTUME CRAZE GIVES AMAZON A BAD NAME .
 This is the item being shipped out instead of the better , higher quality item you see when searching for this costume . This has no black cloth under the arms -LRB- on the sides -RRB- and has no badge or pips . It is just junk . The problem is , you ca n't tell what you 're getting because someone at Amazon seems to not know the difference .
 I bought this as a gift for a star trek fan , and I couldnt have been more dissapointed . The only thing in the package -LRB- which was really wrinkled and yellowed with age -RRB- was the shirt - there were no rank insignias or anything of the sort . Just an empty packet that said it contained the badges.DON ' T BUY FROM THIS SELLER IT 'S A SHODDY PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!
 I returned it . The quality is super thin and cheap . Get the deluxe one . Also the sizing is off as well . a small size is extra small .
 Listen up HANES ! I do n't wear size 36-38 ! I WEAR SIZE 36 ! I 've been wearing your brand for decades ! No more ! I 'll find another brand in exact sizes ! Signed
 In the 4X size , the manufacturer did not allow enough material overlap in the fly area and consequently the fly is always hanging open . Unacceptable !!!
 Retailer sent product to credit card address from which I had moved . Anticipating the move , I specifically requested the package to the new address . After being told the package was delivered to the old address I visited the still vacant home and there was no package left on premises .
 Hanes redesigned these since i purchased my last briefs . There does not seem to be enough material in the front to keep you from `` hanging out '' of the fly.I would not purchase these again and threw out all that i just bought , what total junk !
 Instead of having correct sizes , they just lump two or more sizes together and assume they will fit . Well , THEY DO N'T . I wear a size 36 and the so-called 36-38 size is WAY too big . I will never buy this brand again .

 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 The word mini should have been a hint to me , but it said it would fit up to a 14.1 size laptop . My Sony laptop did not fit , it was sticking out of the bag about a half a inch .
 i love the bag except that i 've had it for a little over two months and the zipper broke . the zipper is completely off track and i am unable to close the back of the bag . too late to exchange it . : - -LRB-
 The strap is too short -LRB- i am 5 ' 7 '' and it hangs around 8 inches from my armpit going across my chest.maybe it is a pros though as it prevents too mush swaying of the bag while walkingNo shoulder pads to lessen the weight on the shoulderMain zipper pouch.the tablet slot is too narrow so i end up putting the tablet on the other sideFlap area.the mesh pouch -LRB- other side no zipper -RRB- is flimsy and uselessMain zipper is flimsy , please do not use rubber tabs.use hard plasticPlease have a longer shoulder strapUse removable shoulder strap with snap on linkWider tablet slotPlease add a rain cover that can be tucked in the bottom -LRB- tethered -RRB- . i want to keep all my gadgets inside from rainFor the flap area , make it a bit wider so more items can fit insideAdd hard foam at the back of bag to prevent tablet breakage
 ... if I was under 5 feet tall . It fit okay , but the top was so short , the costume 's waist was about 6 inches higher than my waist . How they got it to be anywhere near her natural waist in the picture is beyond me .
 Its a nice one , but it says the wrong size , I bought it as medium , but ist so big that is almost an extra large .
 Everything about this shirt is great except for one thing , the wrinkles . I 've never owned a shirt that was this hard to iron the wrinkles out . When I wear it to work it gets so full of wrinkles that by noon it looks like I 've slept in the shirt.The sizing is excellent , the shirt is well made and will last a long time . I 'd give the shirt five stars is it were not for the wrinkles .
 I ordered the Extra Small , based on the online size chart it should have fit . I was drowning it it . X-small is really a men 's small to medium . I 'm a 5 ' ,2 '' 140lb woman .
 I actually bought this item from another site after reading all the other reviews telling me to go to X-Small which is suppose to equal medium -LRB- assuming I would get the right one -RRB- . Wrong
 I purchased this jacket from Army Universe -LRB- in case multiple sellers are available -RRB- . I chose size medium based on the sizing chart that can be found on the sellers website . When the item arrived it was clearly far larger than indicated -LRB- though the tag still said medium -RRB- . Furthermore the zippers and fastenings are indeed brass / gold colored , not black as shown in the photo . Huge disappointment , costly to ship to me and costly to ship back . Seller refunded the incorrect amount . Based on this experience I have not purchased this jacket from other sellers .
 I 've got ta say that i was really looking forward to receiving this item , to my surprise when it arrived all those expectations went to the graveyard , let me tell you the item that I received is nothing like the one showed in the picture , let me start with the description .1 . Item was supposed to be size M , and what I received is more like size L , no fit at all . .2 . from the picture zippers and snap on pins are supposed to be black , even though it says they are brass made there 's no reason for them to be gold colored when they look black on the jacket .3 . Seller did not provide a tracking number so i would n't know what was happening with my purchase till the moment it arrived.I feel very disappointed with this item I received , I do n't mind labeling this as the worst purchase I 've ever made on amazon ... this is for me a minus 5 star product ... a costumer should get what he sees ...
 I wish we had read these reviews before I purchased the same bag from an eBay vendor . The zipper to the main compartment came off the track during the first morning the bag was used by our kindergartener son . He was so upset that one of the adults tried to fix it , but the zipper pull -LRB- and the loop on the zipper slider that holds the zipper pull -RRB- broke off , making matters worse . We are trying to find someone who can replace the slider . I would not recommend this bag to anyone .
 my son was heart broken when the zipper broke 2 days after we bought it . After 2 days of taking it to school the other zipper broke and the logo started to peel . the zippers are very cheap thin plastic and the overall quality is horrible .
 There is no other way to put it , this thing is pure junk . Very poor quality . Look elsewhere .
 My kindergartner was so excited when we saw this backpack online and we could n't wait for it 's arrival . Visually , it 's stunning - I was contemplating using it myself if he decided not to keep it ! However , on DAY 1 when I picked him up from school , BOTH of the zippers had broken -LRB- the clasp thingy had fallen off -RRB- rendering it useless and now I have to return it . My son was really upset , as was I. . . and I also wish I had the reviews on here before I bought it since apparently this has happened more than once before ! Beware this backpack , fellow superman fans - it brings heartbreak !

 I just received this organic bib and burp cloth in the mail today and I must say that I am not impressed . Upon opening up the bag , I noticed that it was not sealed shut but rather taped shut . Secondly , the product is made in China and I am very weary of their organic standards . The description states that the product is soft but I have to differ . I traced the cloth on my face and was not pleased . It felt scratchy and course . Lastly , I have NO IDEA what the embroidered picture is . I 've been studying the picture and I have no clue.Hopefully the softness will appear after I wash it . Overall , the price is very good but I wish It was n't made in China ! I could have gone to Walmart or somewhere easier to return .

 The shawl is very thin , not good quality , I suspect it is not cashmere at all , but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools . The color was supposed to be expresso , not even that promise was fulfilled , it is a much lighter brown . I do not recommend this shawl at all .
 The bargain was too good to be true . The shawl was very lightweight , and the silk was poor quality . It actually gave me a slight rash -LRB- and I do n't have sensitive skin -RRB- . One thing to note if you decide to order from this company is the return policy . When I returned the package , I sent a copy of the confirmation of delivery from the post office to show that I had received the product less than 10 days before . They refunded the full value , but said this was an exception because their policy is that the return has to happen within 10 days of shipment , not receipt . I did n't even get the package within 10 days of shipment .

 According to the information on the website , these socks were listed as being 79 % cotton , 20 % stretch nylon , and 1 % spandex . When I received them , the label on them says they are 67 % cotton , 17 % acrylic , 15 % nylon , and 1 % spandex ... this is not what I wanted . Also , they are very thin and run small . I am disappointed and will not buy socks again online .
 Gold Toe Women 's Classic Crew SockThe socks are thin and instead of elastic to hold them up , have one tight thread around the top . They might do the job if you always wear socks down and need thin . The name `` gold toe '' lead me to believe it would be a quality , thick walking sock .

 My son wears between a 2-3T in regular clothes , and the 2-3T size -LRB- the largest it came in -RRB- was way too small for him . Would not recommend it .
 I ordered this costume for my 2yr old , but when it arrived , the costume in the bag did not even resemble the picture . For starters , the 2-3 size toddler was so small , you would be lucky to get it on a 1 yr old . The `` so-called red thick sash '' turned out to be a very small piece of black string . And they do not take returns , so it just will end up in the garbage . What a waste ... I will never order fromt this seller again !!!
 This is SO small and tight and it is awful . Do NOT purchase this product - you will be disappointed .

 This arrived quick and was a nice looking shirt ... . but it fits more like a large than the XL I ordered .
 I would not buy this bag again . I just got back from 3 weeks in Italy with the bag on my shoulder every day and it is a pickpocket 's nightmare . That 's great unless you 're the pickpocket . The main compartment is a royal pain to get into because a -RRB- the material at the top of the bag sags tautly across the opening and b -RRB- once you get past that there is a padded divider inside that also gets in the way and does n't want to cooperate.My second complaint concerns the netted pouch at the bottom of the front flap . It 's a great place to store kleenex and reading glasses but even with the flap snapped shut the pouch can turn upside down and dump its contents . Fortunately my wife also brought reading glasses so I was able to make do.My third complaint concerns the secondary compartment under the flap . It zips down the side , so if you forget to zip it back up you 're liable to spill something.Before I bought this bag I read a review like this from a guy who complained about the main compartment divider . If , like me , you decide to buy the bag anyway and you intend to store your camera in the main compartment , then make sure that you check the camera settings every time you yank it out of the bag . The mode selector wheel on my Sony DSC-9 was always getting spun coming out of the bag . And once on the way in , the plastic battery door cover snagged and came off . Fortunately it fell into the bottom of the bag and it easily snapped back into place .
 My daughter was going to need an overnight backpack for her semester in Rome . The description for this product sounded ideal because she needed something that could be used for many weekend trips . When it arrived we were so surprised that it was n't as spacious as a school backpack . In fact we thought we could get a more spacious school pack which is just what we did . This product is all talk .
 I was very disappointed in this helmet . When I removed it from the box I notice how distorted the visor was - it is made of a vinyl plastic , rather than an ABS which would make it ridged . This flexibility also allowed for the face section to distort , flatten out , looking nothing like it does in the photo . The lens shield was of poor quality and framed with material to secure it , but this also restricted the view . However , if this is your only option , as it was mine , for a reasonably priced collectible than go for it .
 THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE SOOOOOOOOOOO RIPPED OFF . i will never by another rubies product again . im so disapointed ! i wont even try to reseel this it is that bad . the people who made this should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of online shoppers . THe face on this thing is flat and looks like a bad art project .
 Please ! please ! do not buy this one ! it 's complete waste of money ! Do not deceived by its photo !! it is a completely different product ! Cheap material ! Very very poor quality ! looks like somebody made this one for practice ! just big junk of cheap plastic ! I can not understand why Lucas Film allow this company to produce such a embarrassing product ! All star wars fans ! Please !! DO NOT BUY ! even for one year old baby !
 Item states it is a helmet for adults . Will not fit an adult . So sorry a better comment could not be made .
 I was really disappointed with this helmet , the picture sure was different to what actually arrived . There was a massive dent in the side which is not repairable , the shape is oblong and , if this is aimed at kids , the size is way too big . The Storm Trooper , TIE pilot and Vader were excellent and I always enjoy looking at them and get great comments when friends see them on display . The Scout helmet looks like i tried to build it myself.Don ' t bother
 I am disappointed . For the cost on this item , it is a complete rip off . The paint is a mess , the helmet is very cheaply made , and it runs incredibly small.Don ' t waste your money on this thing.I am adding pictures to show people what you wo n't see from the manufacturer .
 The helmet is too small , it looks as if your head shrunk , maybe for kids but definitely not for adults .
 It 's not as advertised the paint is horrible and it , s not even correct size and the visibility is so bad you ca n't even walk around with it on . DO N'T BUY !!!!!!!
 Cheap helment and not what we were expecting so it was returned . Great seller just bad product !
 Three words , warped , cracked , junk ! The Rubies products are terrible ! Check out the eFX helmets ! I 'm a huge fan of the original trilogy but not an overly discerning authority on collectibles . That being said , I was overwhelming happy and satisfied with my eFX `` ANH '' Storm Trooper Helmet ! It came with a certificate of authenticity and was very securely packaged . DONT BUY THE RUBIES ...
 It 's 70 + dollars but the quality is rubbish.the `` helmet '' reeks heavily of additives to the point where I wonder is it safe for anyone to wear it/display it without getting brain damage.the paint job is horrible , even my 10 year old nephew can paint better . Sloppy is 1 word that aptly describes the paint job.I 'm returning it .
 I found these jeans to be -LRB- at first -RRB- to be the ultimate pant for someone that works on their knees all day . I am in the flooring business and for years used-up pants really fast . I tried the upland pants and found the nylon part of the pants to hold up very well , however the denim part is the same old thin material that wears and tears so easily with the regular wrangler pants . The top corners of the back pockets started to show wear after only 6 wash cycles and after 15 cycles the crotch ripped beyond my comfort level for the rest of the day on the job .
 Purchased 3 Large 42 '' -44 '' for my husband 's Christmas Gift . He wears a Large `` dry fit '' shirt , in a variety of brands , every night at the gym and on weekends for yard work . He was delighted with the gift , so I promptly detagged , washed them and put one in his gym bag . It fit him like a super hero costume . I rechecked the size , compared it to the other 2 , which were the same size . Then I compared it to his other shirts , including a Champion Brand Large Dry Crew Neck T-Shirt in gray , all 3 of the new shirts were smaller . They look like a women 's large.I have not returned them because I took all the tags off & washed them . I 'm out $ 15/shirt + shipping , plus the cost of replacing the gift . I guess I can wear them as night shirts.If they had fit properly , we could have given a better recommendation . His other Champion shirt fits & performs just fine.But since you asked , we thought you should know .
 I was disappointed with this costume because of the design , it bunched in the crotch and the butt and made it look like it was too small even though it wasnt . The only thing the costume had going for it is that it did make you look like Scooby Doo
 I was pleased with the way this jacket looked , no problem there . But , after wearing it for 3 hours -LRB- & never even washing it -RRB- , most of the fake white jewels all fell off . I would not recommend it , POOR quality ...
 I liked the idea of the corduroy jacket , but the trim on the placket was strange . There were some nice beads in the red and earthtone families , but then there were really big `` crystal '' beads in the wrong color families for the jacket . Things like pink and lavender . Really strange . I decided to return it .
 I PURCHASED THIS ITEM THINKING I WOULD USE IT TO SHIELD MY BODY AND CLOTHING FROM THE ELEMENTS -LRB- NOTABLY RAIN -RRB- FOR THE LITTLE TIME I SPEND OUTDOORS . THE PRICE WAS RIGHT , -LRB- $ 8.88 FOR BOTH PANTS AND JACKET ? SURE !! -RRB- AND I KNOW A GOOD DEAL WHEN I SEE ONE . THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I DIDNT SEE THIS ITEM IN PERSON SO I DIDNT REALIZE IT WAS MADE OUT OF THE CHEAPEST , THINNEST PVC LINING POSSIBLE . THE FIRST DAY I GOT TO TRY OUT THIS RAIN OUTFIT , THE PANTS RIPPED IN 2 PLACES !!!!! HOW EMBARASSING !! THE HOLE IN MY PANTS BECAME BIGGER WITH EACH STEP I TOOK AND I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT - I LOOKED LIKE A D@&% FOOL !! SEEING THE LOOKS ON PEOPLES FACES WHEN THEY SAW THE STATE OF MY RAINGEAR MADE ME DIE SEVERAL TIMES INSIDE , AND I WILL * NEVER * GET THAT PART OF ME BACK , EVEN WITH AMAZON 'S AMAZING RETURN POLICY !!! I AM 100 % AGAINST THIS PRODUCT , UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO BE STATIONARY . IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT ATTEMPT MOVEMENT WITHIN THIS PRODUCT - YOU ARE WRONG !! DONT EVEN BOTHER !! IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS ITEM TO POTENTIALLY PURCAHSE , PLZ REMOVE IT FROM YOUR SHOPPING CART OR WISH LIST AND PLACE IT IN THE `` THINGS TO NEVER BUY '' TAB !! XOXO-LOUISE
 I bought this rain gear for a hiking trip for my son . Shortly after he put it on it tore in 3 different places and did n't do a good job keeping him dry ! I bought him an XL so it was plenty big to go over his clothes so although I thought it was a good buy it ended up being a big disappointment .
 Bought this for a vacation with rain likely . My son used a couple of times on the trip with no problem . The next time he used it , a couple of months later , it tore all the way up the jacket next to the zipper . I guess it 's good for an emergency , but does n't last .
 I live in the desert so this is not something I was likely ever going to use for it 's intended purpose . I had purchased this to use as a halloween costume and for that it served it 's purpose . However , if I had intended to use it as a rain suit I would have been beyond upset . There is a seam on the inside of the pant legs and on one of the seams there was about a 6 '' tear along the inside of that seam . Needless to say , if keeping dry was my intention , it would not have worked . I think I remember reading a similar review before I purchased the product , however I was looking for a cheap outfit for halloween so it was n't a deal breaker for me .

 I requested verification of delivery three times via email . None of my emails were responded to forcing me to file a claim with Amazon.com . I will NEVER order anything from Old Glory again .
 MY ORDER NEVER ARRIVED . I EMAILED OLD GLORY THREE TIMES REQUESTING TRACKING INFORMATION AND NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE . I FINALLY CONTACTED AMAZON.COM AND REQUESTED A REFUND . I WILL ORDER FROM OLD GLORY AGAIN .
 The costume was not of any quality whatsoever . If I had known I would be receiving what I did , I would have gone out and bought actual clothes to serve as the costume instead . The costume 's shirt is a very rough feeling fabric that is n't soft at all . The pants are terrible and have the most ridiculous wasteband . The wig does n't look anything like what the model sports in the descriptive picture . Steer clear , you could easily put together a costume from a second hand store that would be much more satisfying than this one -LRB- and probably at a quarter of the price -RRB- .
 I ca n't believe this is marketed as a sports bra . It does nothing to prevent bounce . It 's being returned right away ! Really disappointed .
 ordered a 34DD like i usually wear and it was too tight . replaced it with a 36DD and the cups were too big . returned it for credit .
 I have this bra in nude ... LOVE it !! Comfy , cool , etc. , etc. . I ordered it in black for a special weekend occasion ... when I went to wear it , the sizing was at least 3 inches off & I had no choice but to wear an extender ... it worked , but not well . The following day -LRB- Sunday -RRB- , I sent an email explaining the situation to HerRoom ... 3 days later I finally get a response saying that I wore the bra , so I 'm stuck with it & sometimes bras just come in different sizes . Really ?!!? We 're talking 3 INCHES -LRB- at least !! -RRB- !! This is n't the first time I 've gotten a raw deal with this company -LRB- prior I bought undies ... took them out of bag to find a hole & never wore them ... they would n't accept them back , since they were out of the bag !? -RRB- . So again , I love the bra , but would NEVER buy from HerRoom again .
 I wear a 34DD and always wear minimizers . I need an athletic bra for the summer to wear with tank tops as i am running around with my 4 year old constantly . I ordered two different bras as they had similar reviews . This one makes your boobs very pointy ... like I said ... like torpedo boobs ... it also did not squeeze them in like I would have hoped . The other bra I bought is the Natori medium control underwire sportsbra . It was a bit more expensive , however it gives you the support and the comfort you need ... as well as a very flattering back line which is hard to come by when you have a larger chest weighing them down . I would pass on this one and buy the Natori !!!
 This `` Lunaire Coolmax Sports bra '' is actually a good bra as far as support and a nice smooth fit , and is also pretty effective at keeping the moisture -LRB- sweat -RRB- under control.Hence my two star rating instead of one . But I will never get to use it again as the underwires are torturous ! At 57 I am not new to underwires , I 've been making use of them for a few decades now , and I have never been so uncomfortable unless the bra was getting really old and thin from so many washings to the point where the underwire started poking through the seam.This bra 's underwire started digging into me right from the start . I know the size was okay , as I mentioned the fit was perfect -LRB- in both cup and width -RRB- . It was already washed and worn , so I did n't return it and because of the price I did n't want to throw it away . So I put it away and tried it again on one of those days where everything else was in the laundry . Same thing - although it did get me to do my laundry immediately , as I could n't stand being in the darn thing for more then an hour.I see mixed reactions to this bra from the reviews - but for me it was just a torture chamber and it 's not something I would recommend.The best sport bras I have found that have the same features are by Champion -LRB- with or without underwire -RRB- . Even the ones that do n't have underwires are quite supportive even in larger sizes and absorb sweat nicely as well . And they are very comfortable too.Have a great workout and Happy Shopping ... Laurie
 Not sure what the problem was , but this suit was about 4 sizes too small . We buy this size suit often for both my kids so I know the size was correct from my end . Other than the size , the suit looked nice . Good stitching and good quality fabric .
 I bought two pair of these swim jammers for my son for swim team . Both pair had the same problem within two months of purchase - both started to shred or run at the seam in the back . These were only worn 2 times per week on average , and I made sure to wash per the instructions . Very disappointed , and will nto be purchasing this brand again - switched to TYR comparable and these are much sturdier .
 Very disappointed ! Bought a new one in Aug. for my Son , after 3 months ' use -LRB- about 3 wears/week -RRB- , it is completely worn out !
 Our son is a size 4T ... the size `` 8 '' would n't even fit on our daughter 's baby doll - way too small .
 The material looked a little worn , as if it had already been through the washer a few times . It was a little rough to the touch , too . I would not have bought it had I seen it personally first .
 I didnt like this item ... the back is open & you cant tell from the picture shown If you are big `` up top '' you are not fitting into this ... I guess I just didnt like it the girl in the picture looks way hotter in this I will just let her wear it :-RRB- O plus I recieved the item a week late ...
 Gold Toe makes good dress socks but falls short on athletic socks . These socks lack the padding and comfort of Wigwam and are just not as well made as Gold Toe dress socks
 I have been buying gold-toe socks for years . Until about three years ago , I was very pleased with gold-toe . However , in the past few years I have found that the socks stretch out of shape after only a few washings . To claim to make a sock that fits sizes 6-12 shoe is patently impossible . Oh , at first it may . But I wear size 7 1/2 shoe and guess what ? You got it ! After a while it is at least an inch too long and the heal comes up on the Achilles-tendon . These socks are clearly not made for the smaller foot size.Unless you start making a sock that fits a lower range of sizes , you have lost a long-time customer .
 OMG ! I purhcased a Robin , size small 4-6 and i swear I can just about fit in it as well !! There is no way this is a small , we are now altering it to fit my son age 5 !!! This is what I get for trying out PRIME MEMBERSHIP !
 Even though they show 7 in stock , at a great price of $ 5 , you get what you pay for . They just send you an email telling you that they do n't have it in stock after all.I have a very disappointed 6 year old now ... Thanks , Party America !
 Jockey changed the shape of their crew neck T . Now it is n't as good . Before the collar did n't stick out the back of sweaters as much as it does now . Booooo .
 I usually like Jockey crew neck t-shirts for the fit , especially around the neck and these t-shirts fit great right out of the bag . However , after the first washing , the t-shirts shrank so that they are now too tight . We always wash clothes in cold water so it must have been the dryer that shrunk the shirts , which has not been a problem in the past . So I can only surmise that the quality of the shirt has changed . In the future I will be trying another brand of t-shirt .
 Something is amiss . I bought three packs -LRB- of three each in Aug 2012 -RRB- at a discount on eBay , shipped direct from Jockey . These supposedly all cotton shirts are thin , filmy , extremely stretchy and shapeless . This is not the same cloth that has been used on Jockey products in the past . It does n't feel like all cotton . I washed all the shirts before using -LRB- they smelled strongly , presumably of the plastic wrappings/shipping materials -RRB- and did not see any shrinkage as mentioned in other reviews . Not recommended .
 Man these shirts shrink at least 2 sizes smaller in the cold wash . The quality of these shirts has really gone down hill , bad ! Wo n't buy em any more .
 I 'm a pretty big , thick guy . I 'm about six foot two and weigh 250 . I can fit in this tshirt once then , one wash and it is too small . Its frustrating ... the 2XL is simply an XL , it seems . Good material , nice tshirt but , like almost every other tshirt , the size issue stinks .
 This Buxton replaced a 10 year old Buxton that is better quality than this new one.The new Buxton leather is much more thin and the clasp on the coin purse does not work correctly , difficult to open and close .
 February 9th was the first time my son wore this outfit for Chinese New Year ... not even 2 minutes of wearing it , one of the buttons came off ... then 5 minutes later another button came off . The seams was coming loose at the bottom of the pants . In 2 hours , 2 more buttons came off . Definitely requesting my money back !!!!
 They were authentic , but seller forgot to mention that they were refurbished . I brought them to a RayBan distributor and they fixed my crooked glasses for an additional $ 80 !!!! I wo n't make the same mistake and try to get a deal on sunglasses ever again !
 This product description says `` Suede Cap , Get the sophisticated look of a sueded cap with the ultra softness of Tactel nylon fabric . '' . On receipt of the item not only it did not give me sophisticated look of a suede cap , but it made me think I am buying a suede cap . Thankfully they promised to send me pre posted return label and hopefully they would refund me full charges including shipping and handling charges .
 I always enjoy purchasing from Amazon . However , the navy blue gold toes socks I purchased for $ 10.00 for one pair -LRB- which I thought were more expensive than I usually pay -RRB- would be of better quality . I wore them once and there was a hole in the toe that evening . -LRB- no long or rough toe nails -RRB- . I wrote to amazon and they were kind enough to send me another pair at no charge . I do wear them but I feel the quality is not as good as the gold toe socks I usually buy for myself , my husband and son . That is why I gave it a poor review . I would not purchase them again .

 I would not buy this sweater . It is flimsy , and not very quality feeling . The price was too good to be true !

 My wife spent hours searching online for a nice looking Elizabeth Swann Pirate costume for our 11 year old daughter 's program . She finally settled on this one because the picture shows a nicely finished , tastefully done item made from sturdy materials . The item that arrived inside the package looks only like the photo in basic `` design '' . The quality is n't the same . The actual fabric is very , very thin -LRB- which might be great in warmer areas of the country -RRB- . The edges on the vest -LRB- including pockets -RRB- are not finished off nicely like in the photo . The buttons are n't as nice either -LRB- brassy color and pop open easily -RRB- . The belt , vest and pants are n't the same color pictured -LRB- the vest is more purple than red -RRB- . The buckle is different too and is made from flimsy plastic so it would n't last long I 'm sure . The boot covers are about the only things that look like what we thought we were getting . The `` belt '' is basically a strip of brown plastic-type material that goes from the left hip to the right shoulder where it Velcros in place . Do n't even get me started on that hat . The hat came as a smashed mess that we do n't know how to form to look like something a pirate might wear . My kids started laughing when they saw it -LRB- they will enjoy playing with it though as we did n't buy the costume for the hat -RRB- . Fortunately , we did n't pay full price . My wife found it on sale . It cost her about the cost of a sewing pattern , which is exactly what she plans to use it for now.If the costume had been advertised accurately , I would n't be writing a negative review . I would have gotten exactly what I expected . As it is , we were disappointed . I just want others to be aware that the picture is n't an accurate description . I 'm sure my girls will have fun with the costume once my wife is finished using it but it is n't going to serve the purpose we originally bought it for . If you 're looking for something for your daughter to play dress-up in , this might be a fun one to get -LRB- but do n't pay full price -RRB- . Just be aware that it may not last very long and it is thinner than it looks -LRB- if warmth is a concern -RRB- .
 The service was prompt but we were very disappointed in the quality of the costume . The material is extremely flimsy and the costume is poorly made.Due to the cost of return S&H ; , we unfortunately will have to keep it .
 I have $ 10 costumes that came from Walmart that are much better quality . The material is thin . I am afraid to wash it for fear it will fall apart . If it wasnt for the fact that we leave for Walt Disney World in a few days and my daughter intends to wear it to the pirate and princess party , I would return it . The costume looks vaguely like the picture but nowhere near as tailored and nice .
 This item 's size runs small . I wish they would warn you about sizes running small . Seller is not being very cooperative in the returning process .
 Although the costume is stylish , more so than most pirate costumes , it is of very poor quality . The seams ripped and the buttons fell off after being worn twice . Also , the shirt is a half shirt and only covers the chest .
 I ordered this costume for my daughter for her lead role in the school play and thought it would be outstanding for her part . The item was nothing like what was pictured on the package . The materials were very thin and flimsy and were n't the color pictured . It looked like the fabric pieces were cut and attached carelessly . The belt was the same way . The boot covers did n't cover the pants properly . The hat looked like it was made from construction paper . Also , when we opened the item , it looked like it was used and sent back by another customer . The seller shipped the item quickly and offered the item at a better price than others . I was pleased with that . However , the item was very disappointing , especially for being a Disney costume . I expected much better from Disney . I 'm not rating the seller here , just the item . When the return is complete , I will give accurate feedback for the seller .
 I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers on this product , but my 8 year old really wanted this costume . The costume is SO cheap , thin , and poorly made . It does not look like the photo , but sloppy and cheap when we tried it on . Not to mention the hat . It arrives flat , and you have to bend it into shape . We were able to bend it into a correct shape , but it just did not look good . For the price , it should not look this cheap ! We sent it right back . Thankfully this was a prime purchase , so we have an easy return !
 Quality of product is very poor for the price . Boot covers do not fit over shoes at all . Would have never bought product had i seen it in person .
 I bought the 2XL of these . They rise up over my hips ! Seriously , I have to roll them down every morning . I roll the waistband down , then two more times . Never again , Hanes . Did they even do any research as to how these should fit ?
 Boots must be really bad because they never shipped them . When I asked for UPS tracking # and a re-ship I was told no more size 12 . I checked the ad again -LRB- now weeks later -RRB- and size 12 still available . I shall be canceling Amazon credit card and just go to a store - I needed the boots . My feets is cold !
 For $ 26 -LRB- that includes taxes and shipping -RRB- this is a pretty decent pair of camo capris for anyone whos looking for something to wear on lazy days lounging around the house and doing chores , or maybe even for a Halloween costume . However , the material is much too thin and delicate for long-term wear . Also , I followed the size chart according to my measurements and ordered a size 7/8 - it was more like a size 4 . So if you 're planning on ordering these make sure to order two sizes up from what you would normally wear . The size chart is totally off . I 'm returning these and spending an extra $ 20 for a more comfortable and durable pair of camo shorts elsewhere . The shipping was pretty fast and the customer service was great , but these just were n't what I was looking for .
 I received these capri 's as a gift and even though they were the correct size they were about 3 sizes to small . I have been trying to exchange them for the past two weeks and have had no response from my emails . Whatever you do , do n't do business with this company . They are very unprofessional and thier website is impossible to navigate . They also have no listed phone number .
 Product run very very small . I would not recommend ordering this product if you wear a size 12 or up if you do please be aware it will not go pass your thigh . I was very disappoointed , did n't bother sending it back because of shipping cost . I found someone to give it to as a gift .
 I dont know who sized these or said they were for women . But I agree with a previous review , they are sized for a CHILD ! I had to laugh when I opened the package !!
 I ordered these pants for an upcoming event . I ordered a size up and they just did n't fit all of my booty . I 'm either going to return them or sale them to a friend at my event .
 The size was suppose to be a size 14 woman . I couldnt put one leg in it . My daughter wears a 9 and it fits her .
 For something with the Harley Davidson name on it , and how much it cost , I expected better quality.Not a bad tie , but worth no more than about $ 10 .
 I appreciated the sellers promptness in getting me the order but once I received the item it had completely different accesories -LRB- that were of Dollar store value -RRB- than the pictures online and it seemed very obvious the item had been used though this was never noted . I paid over $ 100 for this crappy costume !!! If you feel you need to deceive ppl in order to make your money then that 's on you but I will NEVER buy a costume from the site again !!!
 Not what I was expecting . It felt great but not the finish I was looking for.It was very ` old ladyish '' . Good service from this company .
 These were pricey & I would have expected more for the price I paid . They are warm , they are soft , they are a little thin but no thinner than other brands of mid weight wool thermal underwear . My problem with them is that they have developed what appears to be moth holes in the tops & bottoms . The top was worse than the bottoms ; the holes began appearing after the first wash & every time I wash them -LRB- hand wash -RRB- they have more holes.If they had been manufactured with better quality control & were thicker I would definitely be in love . But alas the hole issue is too much to bear with a product of this price . Too bad but I 'll try a different brand next time .
 Just tried this on . Normally , I wear an extra large . Ordering a 1X-2X seemed safe , knowing that most costumes seem to run small . This was way too tight . I 'm so disappointed !
 Shin pads broke while putting them on the first time even with an adult gently sliding them on to assist the child . Gloves were sturdier and visually the product is very nice if only you did n't have to make repairs the first day !
 Very poor quality materials . Unfortunately the market is overwhelmed with Chinese-made crap that lacks quality and craftsmanship . Ok for a small child who wo n't notice the poor quality .
 I guess you get what you pay for , very cheap looking . If you 're looking for a real latex appliance try mostlydead.com or screamteam.com
 I 've ordered quite a few things from Amazon and never been disappointed even once until ordering this skirt . I ordered it June 30 and after not hearing a word 2 weeks later I contacted the company and they had not even attempted to ship it . I will never order from this company again .
 I PURCHASED THIS ITEM THINKING I WOULD USE IT TO SHIELD MY BODY AND CLOTHING FROM THE ELEMENTS -LRB- NOTABLY RAIN -RRB- FOR THE LITTLE TIME I SPEND OUTDOORS . THE PRICE WAS RIGHT , -LRB- $ 8.88 FOR BOTH PANTS AND JACKET ? SURE !! -RRB- AND I KNOW A GOOD DEAL WHEN I SEE ONE . THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I DIDNT SEE THIS ITEM IN PERSON SO I DIDNT REALIZE IT WAS MADE OUT OF THE CHEAPEST , THINNEST PVC LINING POSSIBLE . THE FIRST DAY I GOT TO TRY OUT THIS RAIN OUTFIT , THE PANTS RIPPED IN 2 PLACES !!!!! HOW EMBARASSING !! THE HOLE IN MY PANTS BECAME BIGGER WITH EACH STEP I TOOK AND I 'LL TELL YOU WHAT - I LOOKED LIKE A D@&% FOOL !! SEEING THE LOOKS ON PEOPLES FACES WHEN THEY SAW THE STATE OF MY RAINGEAR MADE ME DIE SEVERAL TIMES INSIDE , AND I WILL * NEVER * GET THAT PART OF ME BACK , EVEN WITH AMAZON 'S AMAZING RETURN POLICY !!! I AM 100 % AGAINST THIS PRODUCT , UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO BE STATIONARY . IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT ATTEMPT MOVEMENT WITHIN THIS PRODUCT - YOU ARE WRONG !! DONT EVEN BOTHER !! IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS ITEM TO POTENTIALLY PURCAHSE , PLZ REMOVE IT FROM YOUR SHOPPING CART OR WISH LIST AND PLACE IT IN THE `` THINGS TO NEVER BUY '' TAB !! XOXO-LOUISE
 I bought this rain gear for a hiking trip for my son . Shortly after he put it on it tore in 3 different places and did n't do a good job keeping him dry ! I bought him an XL so it was plenty big to go over his clothes so although I thought it was a good buy it ended up being a big disappointment .
 Bought this for a vacation with rain likely . My son used a couple of times on the trip with no problem . The next time he used it , a couple of months later , it tore all the way up the jacket next to the zipper . I guess it 's good for an emergency , but does n't last .
 I live in the desert so this is not something I was likely ever going to use for it 's intended purpose . I had purchased this to use as a halloween costume and for that it served it 's purpose . However , if I had intended to use it as a rain suit I would have been beyond upset . There is a seam on the inside of the pant legs and on one of the seams there was about a 6 '' tear along the inside of that seam . Needless to say , if keeping dry was my intention , it would not have worked . I think I remember reading a similar review before I purchased the product , however I was looking for a cheap outfit for halloween so it was n't a deal breaker for me .
 The shorts are a nice fit and wear well , however as a warning , the color of the shorts are actually army green , not brown .
 Despite the title of the advertisement and the seller 's adamant description these are indeed olive drab and NOT brown . My department specifies we use brown slacks/bdus/shorts and I thought I had finally found some brown shorts that looked decent -LRB- the shorts themselves are worth more than the price just realize , they ai n't brown , no not at all and do NOT look like the item advertised herein -RRB- but alas they are Olive Drab and looks like I have to use Amazon 's A-Z return as no response back from seller : -LRB-
 The pajamas are way to long . They look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall .
 Ordered the Hanes ultra sheer lace thigh highs in a size medium and was totally disappointed that the length was barely above the knees . I am 5 ' 7 '' and 135 pounds and the size medium purchased from the department stores size medium fits perfect . These were obviously irregular .
 The consistency of rice paper ; be prepared to wear a new pair once if you 're lucky ; Ironically they tear to bits on the 1st try yet are not silky either ; Ladies beware .
 This is definitely not Army standard . Buyer beware if you 're looking for an extra pair of ACU pants ; these are n't the ones you 're looking for for Army use .

 I really wanted this bra to work , but I just tried it on , and I am promptly returning it . It was very uncomfortable and just did n't fit me right . Too big in some places , too small in others . The fabric seems like it would keep you dry , but it feels funny on my skin . I am a 40DD and I was hoping I could use this for running , but I put it to the up and down the stairs test and did not feel at all supported . Maybe there 's no such thing for big girls like me ! As someone else mentioned , it does come up really high in the front too . My biggest complaint though is the way it made me look ! Seriously pointed cone boobs going on . My search for the perfect sports bra continues ...
 I ca n't believe this is marketed as a sports bra . It does nothing to prevent bounce . It 's being returned right away ! Really disappointed .
 ordered a 34DD like i usually wear and it was too tight . replaced it with a 36DD and the cups were too big . returned it for credit .
 I have this bra in nude ... LOVE it !! Comfy , cool , etc. , etc. . I ordered it in black for a special weekend occasion ... when I went to wear it , the sizing was at least 3 inches off & I had no choice but to wear an extender ... it worked , but not well . The following day -LRB- Sunday -RRB- , I sent an email explaining the situation to HerRoom ... 3 days later I finally get a response saying that I wore the bra , so I 'm stuck with it & sometimes bras just come in different sizes . Really ?!!? We 're talking 3 INCHES -LRB- at least !! -RRB- !! This is n't the first time I 've gotten a raw deal with this company -LRB- prior I bought undies ... took them out of bag to find a hole & never wore them ... they would n't accept them back , since they were out of the bag !? -RRB- . So again , I love the bra , but would NEVER buy from HerRoom again .
 I wear a 34DD and always wear minimizers . I need an athletic bra for the summer to wear with tank tops as i am running around with my 4 year old constantly . I ordered two different bras as they had similar reviews . This one makes your boobs very pointy ... like I said ... like torpedo boobs ... it also did not squeeze them in like I would have hoped . The other bra I bought is the Natori medium control underwire sportsbra . It was a bit more expensive , however it gives you the support and the comfort you need ... as well as a very flattering back line which is hard to come by when you have a larger chest weighing them down . I would pass on this one and buy the Natori !!!
 This `` Lunaire Coolmax Sports bra '' is actually a good bra as far as support and a nice smooth fit , and is also pretty effective at keeping the moisture -LRB- sweat -RRB- under control.Hence my two star rating instead of one . But I will never get to use it again as the underwires are torturous ! At 57 I am not new to underwires , I 've been making use of them for a few decades now , and I have never been so uncomfortable unless the bra was getting really old and thin from so many washings to the point where the underwire started poking through the seam.This bra 's underwire started digging into me right from the start . I know the size was okay , as I mentioned the fit was perfect -LRB- in both cup and width -RRB- . It was already washed and worn , so I did n't return it and because of the price I did n't want to throw it away . So I put it away and tried it again on one of those days where everything else was in the laundry . Same thing - although it did get me to do my laundry immediately , as I could n't stand being in the darn thing for more then an hour.I see mixed reactions to this bra from the reviews - but for me it was just a torture chamber and it 's not something I would recommend.The best sport bras I have found that have the same features are by Champion -LRB- with or without underwire -RRB- . Even the ones that do n't have underwires are quite supportive even in larger sizes and absorb sweat nicely as well . And they are very comfortable too.Have a great workout and Happy Shopping ...

 The first time I wore this busiter the plastic support wire popped right out in the middle of dinner sticking out under my underarm . Not good .
 I read some of the reviews about this product and most of them were positive and only one was negative so I thought I 'd go ahead and order this product . The product arrived quickly . I tried the QT bustiere on and found not only was it extremely uncomfortable but it did n't look the product pictured on the site . I doubt I will order from HerRoom , again !
 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge . And for the record , I do not have a very small waist compared to the rest of me , in fact , I 'd say I am pretty square shaped.I exchanged the bra , -LRB- and had to pay the shipping myself and wait 4 weeks to receive the next size down -RRB- for a 32b hoping that the 2 inches would do the trick . The bust is now rather tight , but hey , push up is the goal here , so I can live with that part . And the waist mostly fits - at least it does n't fold over itself now . I 'm not sure it 's making my waist any smaller either though , which I presumed was half the point of the long line bra . The padding is rather thick in the front , so I am hoping it does n't actually add inches to my waist . I have yet to try it on with my wedding dress . I am not really thrilled with the final product , but I do n't have time to wait 4 + more weeks for a different one or pay for more return shipping . I would stay away from this product if you are at all petite .
 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly . When I returned it I was told they would not take it because it had been worn or washed . It had not ! I am appalled that I am now I have paid and have nothing to show for it ! This vendo is not reliable .
 This is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had . The side panels look like they are very thin , as others I have worn , but this one is not.It is sized down so I suggest buying at least the next size up to get a good feel . I would n't recommend this item if you are looking for something to wear , other than very special occasions.QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra -LRB- 1100 -RRB- 38B/Nude QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra -LRB- 1100 -RRB-

 I was expecting the Insides Flaps to be also made of leather , but to my disappointment it was Plastic . The picture was deceiving as they were not showing the inside flap clearly . I sent an email to the seller and I got an acknowledgment saying that they received my email and will get back to me . Until today I never got any email . I will not recommend this product to anyone .
 I ordered these cute little socks and was so excited that I finnally broke down and ordered them . But they are not as pictured ! These ones have actual bows on the back of them . and they do n't even look like balarina socks . Very disappointed . I am returning . Now i 'm sceptical to order again from seller .

The side panels look like they are very thin , as others I have worn , but this one is not.It is sized down so I suggest buying at least the next size up to get a good feel . I would n't recommend this item if you are looking for something to wear , other than very special occasions.QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra -LRB- 1100 -RRB- 38B/Nude QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra -LRB- 1100 -RRB-
 The first time I wore this busiter the plastic support wire popped right out in the middle of dinner sticking out under my underarm . Not good .
 I read some of the reviews about this product and most of them were positive and only one was negative so I thought I 'd go ahead and order this product . The product arrived quickly . I tried the QT bustiere on and found not only was it extremely uncomfortable but it did n't look the product pictured on the site . I doubt I will order from HerRoom , again !
 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge . And for the record , I do not have a very small waist compared to the rest of me , in fact , I 'd say I am pretty square shaped.I exchanged the bra , -LRB- and had to pay the shipping myself and wait 4 weeks to receive the next size down -RRB- for a 32b hoping that the 2 inches would do the trick . The bust is now rather tight , but hey , push up is the goal here , so I can live with that part . And the waist mostly fits - at least it does n't fold over itself now . I 'm not sure it 's making my waist any smaller either though , which I presumed was half the point of the long line bra . The padding is rather thick in the front , so I am hoping it does n't actually add inches to my waist . I have yet to try it on with my wedding dress . I am not really thrilled with the final product , but I do n't have time to wait 4 + more weeks for a different one or pay for more return shipping . I would stay away from this product if you are at all petite .
 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly . When I returned it I was told they would not take it because it had been worn or washed . It had not ! I am appalled that I am now I have paid and have nothing to show for it !

 Horrible item . Material really really thin . Small sizes . It never even came close to fitting . Bad purchase !!
 My daughter is an extreme Teen Titan fan . I was so excited to find a Raven costume . The costume itself looked justed as featured in the pictures but the only thing I am upset to report is the sizing is not as described . My daughter has not been able to wear it as of yet so we are waiting as patiently as a Teen Titan fan can wait until she grows into it . To her returning it is not an option .

 I had shampoo leak while in this bag . It soaked one side of the bag , and the red dye on the bag leaked through onto my clothes . We were on a trip and we had to buy replacement clothes . When we got home we soaked the garments for almost two days and the red dye finally disappeared . I of course , stopped using the bag

 This is way too big for any infant . It does not even fit my 11 month year old son . POOR QUALITY !!!! the fabric tears very easily and is not designed for any baby .
 This bra was great looking and fit nicely when it was new . But I washed it in the washing machine on delicate to get the sizing out -LRB- like I do with all my bras -RRB- and then do n't put it in the dryer just let it air dry . For some reason , the foam padding transforms upon washing and the cup of the bra looks like a it is crazed or cracked all over the place . If you are wearing a thick shirt , it wo n't shoe through , but I 've never had this happen before . If you have to hand wash to prevent it , -LRB- because it gets ruined with machine washing -RRB- , then it should stress that in a big bold warning . I was disappointed too , since I liked the fit and look of the new , unwashed bra .
 I ordered this costume in a size 4 - 6 , but it is more like a 3T . Did not fit my child who wears a size 4 ! Company would not issue credit stating that the costume was clear to THIER sizing . I do not recommend buying this because it likely wo n't fit your child ! Also , very poor customer service ; buy somewhere else !
 As with any costume you order online for kids , there 's a good chance it wo n't fit . This company specifies that the size is 2T to 4T , but it is definitely no larger than 2T . When I followed their instructions to return the costume , I never received any reply or authorization , something required to get a refund . While the costume was fine , I 'd recommend buying it from someone else .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Just going to list the issues
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;

Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful .

 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . .

 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ...

 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My 4 year old son was thrilled to see that I bought him `` Ka Chow '' underwear -LRB- Lightning McQueen -RRB- underwear.The waistband quickly unraveled within the first few washings . I returned them to the store explaining what happened and refused to buy anymore from the manufacturer .
 This is the second package of underwear from Disney that unravels at the waistband . VERY FRUSTRATED !! They were purchased at the W * Big box store . Will definitely not buy again .
 I bought these underwear and my son loves having Lightning McQueen underwear , but I wo n't buy any more . It 's frustrating to pay this amount of money for a few pairs of underwear and then have the waistband unravel after 1 or 2 washings ! We have some Hanes undies that are great quality and have lasted many , many washings ! Spend a little more for the higher quality !
 I too , am not happy ! We bought them and they have unraveled only I thought it was a fluke and bought more , and they too unraveled . I did buy another , from another store and they seem to be OK so far .
 I ordered these underwear for my son so we could start potty training him . I though it would make it easier saying do n't pee pee on Lightning McQueen or Mater . First of all , the ones that I was sent from Cookies Kids does n't even have Lightning McQueen on them , they have Frightening McMean and then on the other two pair there is a space ship looking thing and under it , it says `` Mator , '' no I am not misspelling how it is spelled on the underwear . I am so disappointed in this and then to go to their website to have them returned and they say that they do n't return underwear . I spent $ 10.00 on this and am very mad ! Do n't buy these !!!
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 While it is not clear from the product description , this cardigan has sparkling metallic thread woven through it and has a stiff scratchy artificial feel . I returned it .
 ... then definitely buy this shirt . It not only will make you look like a fashion blind douche , it will also convince anyone you work with that you 're going nowhere fast ! It 'll also tell them , `` hey , stick around a while , you might just see a project of mine go down in flames ! `` Fantastic shirt for the very effeminate and the socially awkward !
 a terrible purchase.Was smaller than normal and on the cheap side would not recommend this product . i didnt even wear it but gave it to a friend < , who in turn gav it away
 Just plain not comfortable ! I am a 38E . I was n't looking for serious support necessarily , but comfort would be nice . I find myself itching and rearranging a lot . No separation of the girls . No moisture-wicking -LRB- I live in SW FL -RRB- . For a high priced bra , I had hoped for more . Oh well , another lesson !
 I got this to replace an old sports bra . It was not firm enough for running up and down our steps much less any cardio exercise . Maybe if your sport is speed walking this would be good for you .
 Definitely not a sports bra . Very comfortable except that the straps slip down so quite useless for me.Not suited for larger than a B cup .
 The fabric on the dress was cheap , and I had to sew parts of the skirt on to the top . It was VERY wrinkled , and could not be ironed . I had a little success using a dry cleaning sheet in the dryer . Regarding the wings ... what a challenge ! The ugly white elastic straps that hold them on are not visible in the photo . The top portion of the wings would not stay up even for a second , and just flopped over onto the bottom portion . I took me an entire day to sew reinforcing velcro onto both the wings and dress straps to hold the wings up .
 I thought this costume looked really cute on the model but the wings have a white elastic band that goes over the front of each shoulder . It would not look so bad if the elasic bands were black or beige but white really shows up and just does not look right . The only way you can hide the elastic is to cut them off - they will not tuck under the dress.Also , this costume is about a size three even though it says it will fit up to a size 12 .
 This is my first shapewear experience and I was excited . I just wanted to smooth out my stomach and give a little lift to my butt . I 'm young and I 'm not particularly big , so this was more insurance for more form-fitting dresses , because I 've always had a lower belly bump . There is no way this product would not leave pantylines unless you are made of pure muscle in your thigh/butt area . You can tell as soon as you open it up and see these pronounced elastic bands . It flattens out the stomach somewhat , but not flawlessly . I was not impressed with that aspect . I am returning it immediately so I have nothing to contribute as far as how it wears throughout the day . The fabric is comfortable , though .
 The picture shown it 's on a side because it does n't want to show you that the product divides your hips and thighs . When you put your clothes on you can see the division . . not attractive !
 First of all the product divides your butt cheeks in two like other reviewers have mentioned . It looks ridiculous ! You can constantly feel the top moving around , so maybe it would be better to go with the one with the attached bra ? Idk.Anyway I wore this for the second time yesterday for about 4 hours and it was kind of uncomfortable , not horrible . I woke up this morning at 5 am with pain in my back which was identical to pain I have experienced in the past with a kidney infection . It persisted for several hours and coincidentally I experienced another symptom so I went to the emergency room fully expecting a full-blown infection diagnosis . It was n't . I confessed my wearing of `` Lipo In A Box '' to the doctor , and he explained to me -LRB- embarrassed as I was -RRB- how unhealthy shape wear is for your body , nerves , internal organs , etc. because of the level of constriction . It really hurt and scared me . I threw the piece of junk in the trash and will never consider buying anything like this again . I think in the future people will discover the negative health impacts this kind of garment has on the human body . Let 's wait and see .
 This is not a review of the Fossil bag - it is a review of Macys-Amazon and their customer service . I can not believe I 'm being asked to give a review for a product purchased when they never delivered the bag ! Their customer service could not be any more lame !!! I ordered the bag , but Macy 's / Amazon did not deliver the bag ! I received notice FIVE DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS that the bag was no longer in stock . This was after I was initially told the bag was in stock and would ship within a few days . This bag was one of two Christmas gifts requested by my teenage daughter . I was incredibly angry and frustrated upon receiving word the bag would not be sent - understandably , I believe.AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!!!!!!!!!
 The hand warmer works but only for a short time -LRB- maybe a half hour -RRB- . And , shipping took much too long . It was during Christmas time which always slows the mail , but it still took longer than it should , in my opinion .
 When I received this I was so disappointed that it only stays warm for 1 hour -LRB- and not very warm at that -RRB- . The liquid crystallizes , so to rewarm it , you have to wrap it in a towel and boil it for 8-10 minutes . Neat idea , but completely impractical . I am returning it .
 This mask is very difficult to wear for more than a minute as it is a very tight fit , you feel like you 're suffocating and you ca n't really see well through the eye openings .
 Uhhh ... This is zee uhhgliest thing ive EVER seen ... Imagine this thing walking down your neighbourhood street on Halloween ... It would be the scariest costume !! It 's uhhgly and yeah that 's all there is to it !
 Only one wear out of this shirt . After one wash this shirt became a belly shirt . I now have around the house rags .
 I can not comment since I have not received my order since I purchased it on Oct 31 , 2006 . Still trying to find out where it is .
 I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE THIS ITEM IT 'S BEEN 4 DAYS PAST THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE AND I PAID FOR 1 DAY SHIPPING . I WANTED TO WEAR IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY YESTURDAY AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO GO OUT THE DAY OF AND BUY MY OWN AT A STORE NEARBY . I 'M VERY DISSAPOINTED AND I PLAN TO RETURN IT AS SOON AS I GET IT ! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD BRA BUT IT 'S WORTHLESS IF IT IS N'T DELIVERED ON TIME !!!!
 I purchased this item to wear with my halloween costume and I have to say I was very disappointed . This product got great reviews but it did not hold my chest . I am a 38 DD and the bra kept falling down I ended up using the detachable strap as a halter and it cut through the back of my neck because my chest needed that much more support . I was very disappointed .
 As has happened several times before when ordering off Amazon , I received the wrong product . It was n't even a strapless bra ! And from a different company ! I did go buy this product at the mall after returning my purchase from Amazon and I love the bra .
 Heard such great things , but how can you not offer a 34DD . Disappointed . My review is strictly concerning the offering which is lacking for what many have stated is a must own for big busted girls in need of a strapless bra ... yet there are not DD offerings below 36 .
 This does not stretch much . Could not get it on my head . It is so tight . I ca n't use the one I opened and will return the second one .
 These shirts are a great price . My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically . Mostly shrunk in length . While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time . . they have now become too short for him . I followed the instructions for washing also ...
 You do not see that the head part of custome ties around the chin in this picture . OR I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT IT . MY BABY WILL NOT KEEP ANYTHING TIED UNDER HIS CHIN ON . This is misleading how you MUST HAVE tucked the string into the costume for the picture shown . Shame on you
 This item states size 6-18 months but would not fit my average sized 8 month baby . It looks like it might fit a newborn ... would reconsider before ordering anything from this site again
 I have bought this L size jacket on 4/15/07 , on picture it 's looks fine . I have supposed to present it to my son.Jacket 's description is very short and not clear.But I was disappointed when I got it . $ 292 price and so tricky1 . It is not `` Heavy duty antique brass zipper '' - zipper looks like for children jacket.Just small size zipper and working very tight . Looks like it will works for 2-3 months only . And after that the jacket could be wasted .2 . The real jacket -LRB- L -RRB- chest size is 52 '' - and there is disproportion , a man looks like balloon .3 . Made in India.I have returned this jacket to seller , and spend $ 44.00 for that . $ 15 - postage and insurance ; $ 29 - restocking charges -LRB- 10 % -RRB- - on Amazon there is no info about 10 % restocking charges.I have discussed these issues with seller - by his opinion all of them are not defects !!! Do not buy this jacket .
 I have been buying Jerzee T shirts at retail stores for years . I have never been disappointed . They wear well and launder well . I had not been able to find long sleeve shirts in local retail stores , so I went online.The quality is just not there . There is no warmth to the shirts . The material is very thin . I put one shirt on the bathroom door while showering . When I got out of the shower , I was able to see the doorknob through the shirt . I think you call this THIN . I have also noticed that the hooded sweatshirts in retail stores share this same quality ... or lack of it . Looks like I need to find a new brand of long sleeve T shirt . I think a call is in order to the company .
 I 'd heard good things about Lilyette , but was very disappointed . This bra has extra fabric on the outer lining of the cups creating wrinkles even though the inner liner fits . Also , it is very oddly shaped , giving the chest an outward pointed appearance . Horrible .
 I found this bra to be pretty compared to other minimizers out there . I liked the support and shape that it gave , but the bra is so scratchy and uncomfortable that I only wear it when all my other bras are dirty ! I would rather pay more for the Wacoal minimizers to have all day comfort and support .
 The straps are definitely NOT non-slip . The design is no different from conventional bras . Very dsappointing , I would not buy again .
 Simply do n't bother with this hat . The quality is atrocious - you could buy a better coolie hat used at a thrift store or garage sale for less than a dollar -LRB- in fact , I have -RRB- . Even the strap is of horrendous quality . I 'd return it , but it simply is n't worth the time or postage . Stay away , and save your money .
 I ordered a neutral color , gray , but these are more of a rosy tan -LRB- probably taupe , actually -RRB- . The band across the top has no elastic -LRB- none , zero -RRB- , so they fall to your ankles by the time you 've walked into another room . The other thing is they did n't even get around to shipping for a week , so the person bringing them to Guatemala for me almost did n't receive them on time . And because I live out of the country , returning them is n't an option . = \
 These trouser socks fell down to my ankles after just a few minutes of walking with them on . That is no exaggeration , I had only walked about 10-15 feet . This is no reflection on the seller .
 I bought these socks to wear with boots , but they do not stay up well and bunch at the ankles after a few hours .
 This product and price is terrific . . until you try to get something in it . The zipper opening does not permit even a hand to slide in withoutgetting scratched from the zipper . Putting in and removing something bulky like , say , a can of shaving cream is nearly impossible . I have struggled with it to the point of not giving these as a gifts anymore . It 's certainly otherwise well-made , very attractive and at an unbelievable price and for anyone who needs to travel with a lot of items it would appear to be perfect but it is not .

 So disappointed when I received it . The coler is dim and the cloth is lack of dynamic . It is heavy , and warm . But do n't hope to wear it when you want to be stylish .
 This must have been a used item . No tag and after removing it from the cheap ziploc bag sandwich bag , i planned to throw it right in the washer , and then noticed that upon taking another look , the seam at the crotch looked like it was torn , probably from previous wear and tear . Disgusting , especially after considering the cost for the item plus s & h.

 I purchased this item hoping for the best , but what I got was something worse . The material feels really nice , and that was the only thing nice about it . Once I got it in place I noticed while just standing there that the legs rolled right up to the crotch . For this reason I think the brief sells better . It is meant to be in the crotch .
 Got the correct size and everything , just felt a little too snug for me . Might try a size bigger than normal if you do decide to order a pair .

 As the product description said.On the other hand , this slutty nurse is probably not a statistician , nor the first woman inducted into the Royal Statistical Society in the UK . She probably can not reduce hospital mortality from 42 to 2 % , I 'm guessing . Nor revolutionize education for the world 's most numerous health care provider group.I 'm merely speculating , of course . The sexy slutty naughty nurse vixen in the pic may have done all of those things . Yeah .
 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced
 I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $ 30 for it . It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it . When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle . The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew . Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings , which looks pretty girly . For a $ 30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Nice shirt but runs really small . I understand they are to be worn tight , but my 14 year old could n't get it over his head . Have to return it .
 The picture and description is of a shirt , what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top , open at the arm pits . Do n't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .

I had not been able to find long sleeve shirts in local retail stores , so I went online.The quality is just not there . There is no warmth to the shirts . The material is very thin . I put one shirt on the bathroom door while showering . When I got out of the shower , I was able to see the doorknob through the shirt . I think you call this THIN . I have also noticed that the hooded sweatshirts in retail stores share this same quality ... or lack of it . Looks like I need to find a new brand of long sleeve T shirt . I think a call is in order to the company .

 I have been out and about this winter and was looking for comfortable inner wear to keep me warm in the sub zero temperatures . This particular product claimed it does all that and more . Two words - It does n't !! It just couldnt keep out the cold on a day that wasnt even windy . I now have to look for ones that are better than this .
 I bought this as a corset but I received just a top . I 'm not saying the thingie is not nice , it fits and I agree with previous review . But pls do take into account that it is not a corset . If you need some nice top for special occasion , it can work for u. . .
 I received the wrong item in the mail . Instead of a nurse costume , I received a lacy halter top , skirt and g-string . Even though it said nurse costume on the invoice . Very disappointed in this .
 I purchased two of these body suits and ballet slippers for my 3 and 5 year old daughters . The slippers were too tight for the 5 year old -LRB- she wears size 12 -RRB- and the body suit is fairly cheaply made . The 3 year old loves the slippers , but , in two days , we 've already lost two sequin hearts from two different slippers . Bottom line - bad present for a 5 year old , OK present for a 3 year old .
 I ordered a Medium and I consider myself pretty slim , I usually wear small t-shirts and all but I ordered it a medium because I do realize that it is a COMPRESSION shirt but this is ridiculous . When I did FINALLY get it on , I seriously considered cutting it off because actually taking it off was my workout for the day . My girlfriend it petite and ever she had a hard time getting it on and off .

 Hat said size 8 but , it had to be at least a 9-10 . This hat swam on my head , maybe the manufacturing country of origin was the problem . Definitely not a size 8 .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 Just going to list the issues
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .

 this is not something that I bought second-hand toys and spoiled and I want to return it in the picture was a photo toys that let web , but it sent water pours and does not work
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 I ORDERED 3 ROBES - 1 HOODED AND 2 NONE HOODED FROM ANOTHER VENDOR - ALL 3 WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 16 % TERRY CLOTH - THE HOODED ROBE WAS NOT COMPARIBLE TO THE OTHERS - NOT AS THICK OR FLUFFY - SEEMED MORE LIKE A VELORE THEN A TERRY CLOTH - I PLAN TO USE THESE GETTING IN AND OUT OF A WINTERY HOT TUB AND WANT MAXIMUM ABSORBENCY AND WARMTH - THIS ROBE DIDNT GIVE ME THE IMPRESSION IT WOULD FIT THE BILL - SO I RETURNED IT .
 I ordered this bib as a gift for my granddaughter . It arrived , finally , after a overly long journey from Canada . It was not as I expected it to be ; it was very small and the fabric was not good quality .

 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 Just going to list the issues
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...

 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .

 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear .

 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 Considering the cost of this product , I did n't have very high expectations but still found myself disappointed . The chest plate , shin guards , and cod piece are all made out of flimsy foam and were completely bent out of shape from the way they were packaged . I thought they would at least be cheap solid plastic . I ended up hacking/modifying this costume with other accessories that I 've bought and personally fabricated to make it slightly usable.Another design flaw is the sizing . The belt seems to be made for someone with a 60 '' waist while the suit itself is so tight I felt like I was getting a wedgie the whole time I wore it.The only higher quality suit i can find is the $ 800 version . I really wish there was something in-between . I would recommend avoiding this item if you have even a casual interest in quality .
 the boot tops for this costume are made of sheap flimsy foam . the shoulder pieces are also made of cheap foam . the helmut is only a mask . and the hardware on the belt and the chest piece are of very low quality construction -LRB- horrible paint job and crushed to the point of almost being flat . save your self the meny . seriouslt you would look just as good in a black robe . this is far from what i would expect from a `` deluxe '' costume . jsut is n't worth the 50 bucks .
 This is a delayed review , however I feel obligated to warn people before buying this ... I ordered this product for a Halloween costume , the shipping was fast , and I got it a few days before Halloween ... However , it was n't what I ordered . I ordered the Deluxe Darth Vader - Standard - Chest Size 36-40 , and I received a regular Darth Vader costume . I will say that the price was surprisingly low compared to the other `` Deluxe '' costumes , which is why I bought it , but little did I know , it was n't even the costume I wanted , and nor did it match the picture ... In addition some of the product that did come , came ripped , and torn ! I 'm very dissatisfied , and annoyed that I had to settle with this incorrectly labeled product for my costume , since it was not what I ordered . I will now avoid buying from Fox Martin Corp. since I can no longer trust their product labels .
 The mask is a half mask , no back , leaving the back of your head exposed . The costume is an all in one jumpsuit . The black material of the jumpsuit is very very cheap and flimsy . All the armor pieces are very very cheap flimsy foam that have all been bent out of shape through the packaging . Even the color of the armor is all dull and drab and looks nothing like the picture on the cover.Here is my advice if you want this costume to look better . Go and purchase a roll of plastic like in the link . You may need about 3 of them.http : / / www.amazon.com/Paricon-Flying-Carpet-Sled/dp/B004GF150Y/ref=pd_sim_sg_1Cut all the foam sections from the costume using a sewing stitch remover . Place them on the plastic and cut around them . Buy some Loctite spray adhesive and glue them to the plastic . You can lightly sand the plastic to make them stick better.Buy some lashing straps , see link . Then velcro the lashing straps to the foam pieces now backed with plastic.http : / / www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Products-8056P-Lashing-Strap/dp/B00194BPU0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1330148344&sr;=8-1This should work fairly easy for the shin guards and cod piece . The chest armor , you can buy some used football pads and velcro the chest piece to the front of it . If the football pads are to bulky , just take out the padding leaving just the plastic armor.For the pants , just wear some regular black pants , they will be better quality than the costume material . The black top , just buy a black turtle neck , again it will be better quality than the costume . The cape and side garment , you can then just detatch from the rest of the costume by using a sewing stitch remover and then use velcro to attach it to your shoulders etc.In my honest opinion , no way is this costume worth $ 70 plus . It 's worth about $ 20 at the most . This costume is pretty much useless unless your going to modify it.If you want all the foam armor to look better , you can spray them the correct color , -LRB- use about 2 or 3 coats -RRB- , then coat them with acrylic to give them a real shine.Hope this helps a little .
 Thought this costume was gon na be better qualityt then it was it was just a oversized kid costume I paid alot for this cheap fabric rubber and foam and just gon na end up putting it together myself using some of the add ons plus it was rolled up into the package as if it was tried on by ppl in a store then stuck in a box and mailed to me and im not even gon na get started on the mask lol so glad I already own a electronic vader mask and helmet
 Like hte long sleeved version of this shirt the sizing is way off . I wear a medium shirt and this felt more like an extra small . I would not recommend it .
 I bought these same shirts about ten years ago and liked them . Ordered two shirts this time and they have changed for the worst . The fabric is not smooth , but almost denim like and coarse . The fabric wrinkles easily while being worn . The cut is far too large , even though the size is the same as my originals . One of the shirts has a sleeve that was not sewn correctly , leaving a hole between the sleeve & the body of the shirt ... it is not wearable without repair . The shirt should not have made it through even a cursory inspection process . I am contacting the Dickies company , requesting a replacement shirt at their cost . Would not buy this shirt again .
 This is a tough shirt , but a bit of a nipple-chafer if you work hard for a living . It also changes color drastically when wet , and pools sweat in the pocket stitching to make weird patterns . Not really a &#34; work &#34; shirt unless your work is paperwork . :-RRB- Sizes do run large . I wear an XL shirt normally , but this XL is now the largest shirt I own . : -RRB-

 This was a nice bra but the sizing was off , If I hadnt have removed the tags before trying it on I would have returned them so I donated them to salavage army . If ordered order a cup size smaller than normal
 I did not receive the correct belt buckle but was instead sent a different buckle with the same band . I returned the item and was refunded my money without any trouble .
 this was a `` sailor '' hat . It got wet . It shrank three sizes . I gave it to my grandson .
 I put two of these on a 70 # Pelican 1650 case . One the third trip through the highly mechanized world of air transport , one looked fairly bent up . On its immediate return trip back home , it disappeared off the case . The case is intact -LRB- other than a constant addition of new scars -RRB- , but the lock 's gone.I 've lost two other similar cable locks - off a much smaller/lighter case - and have come to the opinion that such cable locks are n't made robustly enough for actual TSA-based passage . I 'm waiting on delivery of two larger , solid shackle models that , I hope , will stay put.I 'm sure Godzilla 's gastro-intestinal tract is less demanding than the conveyors & gorillas at the airports . TSA padlocks should be made to survive either . Either that or they should sell these in packs of a dozen ...
 I say $ 5.95 to ship a $ 10 item is a bit steep for my wallet . I 'd suggest Amazon carry this item themselves so that buyers do n't get ripped off by this kind of thing .
 Pelican would include an order form inside of new Pelican Cases for silica gel and for Pelilocks with the same catalogue number of 1506TSA . I bought a number of the locks which were black , 4 combo locks with a solid hasp ... they have substituted these cable 3 combo locks which are much easier for someone to access . The cables can be easily cut with a leatherman or wire cutters and a 3 digit combo is significantly less effective than the prior 4 digit . Better off buying a 4 digit lock but make sure the hasp is long enough if you are buying for a pelican case ... the original 1506TSA locks Pelican sold were perfect ... no wonder they stopped selling them .
 I travel with expensive camera equipment and I use only Pelican hard cases.Poor protection
 Wow . I had a couple of TSA-access Pelilocks for years that were pretty sturdy . Unfortunately , one of them did n't make the last flight home with me -LRB- hey , thanks TSA ! -RRB- . Those original locks seem to be unavailable now - I searched everywhere including ebay . So I thought I 'd try these . Obviously , any TSA accessible locks are going to provide only marginal security , but these seem to me to be exceptionally flimsy . I do n't know what the alternative is , but you 'd probably find a better lock at Walmart .
 I ordered a Medium and I consider myself pretty slim , I usually wear small t-shirts and all but I ordered it a medium because I do realize that it is a COMPRESSION shirt but this is ridiculous . When I did FINALLY get it on , I seriously considered cutting it off because actually taking it off was my workout for the day . My girlfriend it petite and ever she had a hard time getting it on and off .
 because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening . Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable .
 This bag is very Different in design . Thankfully there are n't many bags with the likes of this one.I was thinking of getting it for my mother who is very , very old . It is of a style which I think she could appreciate -LRB- she is very eccentric -RRB- I decided Not to Purchase this bag when I saw The Price on it !

 So these took a long time for me to commit to . They look great online.However , i just received the 3 sets of these for upcoming wedding
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 Ok and somewhat comfortable but they ride up and because of this you can see pantylines .
 These shirts are a great price . My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically . Mostly shrunk in length . While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time . . they have now become too short for him . I followed the instructions for washing also ...

 This dress arrived in a used like condition , it has no tags , the thread on the sides were broken and there was a small hole under the arm area of the dress . The seller only refunds the amount of the dress - not the shipping , so I just wasted $ 20 for shipping this used dress to me and back ! Do your self a favor and buy from a legitimate company that stands behind their product !
 Cheap looking , with poor tailoring.I was really stunned cos it looked nothing near what it didon-line .
 Vanity Fair makes some great bras . I wear Vanity Fair bras for 95 % of my outfits -LRB- except when I need a push-up or strapless -RRB- . This particular bra is great because it shapes and lifts , and is extremely comfortable.However , the reason why I gave this product a 2-star rating is because the underwire broke . And I 've had several bras of this style by Vanity Fair that have all done the same thing . It usually happens at the worst time too , and then you feel out of place all day until you can go home and take it off . Something needs to be done so that the underwire lasts longer , but is n't too stiff .
 When I first ordered the hood , it said it would take 3 weeks to get here . Surprisingly however , I got it in about 4 days.The color matched perfectly , and the hood is comfortable to wear , except the black velcrochin strap that is supposed to go under the chin and attach to the velcro on the other side istoo short , by about an inch . Perhaps mine is defective because if it 's not , then I 'll have to changemy opinion of the carhartt brand.I have contacted the seller to check the other hoods . We 'll see if they get back to me and can makethis right without any expense on my part . However , probably not worth the expense and hassle ofreturning it . It 's too bad though , because if not for the short chin strap , it 's a 5 star product.Update
 Snaps worked perfectly when hood first arrived i then removed hood as it was n't needed . Then when i needed hood I went to snap on to jacket and snaps would not stay on . Had to return item .
 I 'm a size 6 and I should have purchased a small -LRB- I purchased a medium . -RRB- They are too long on the inseem and too loose . The length is good .
 The title kind of says it all . If you 're going to wear linen , it should be comfortable and these were not . If you are going to buy them , get them in white because the stone is hideous

 I bought these for my husband , he wore them twice when the bit of plastic holding the sweatband broke off so the whole purpose of these was defeated . He works outdoors and wanted to keep the sweat out of his eyes ... no sweatband , nothing but sweat .
 I had to send this item back because it was to small . The sizes run small , so beware .
 I 'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased -- I will admit that I have n't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time -- I had no idea how low the quality has gotten . First , the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily , 2 . The canvas material is not what it used to be either , my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same . 3 . The sizes are so different , I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear , but when they were delivered and I tried them on , it was as if they were two sizes smaller . The material is thin , and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be . I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product , to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases . The quality is very low , but the prices are way too high for the quality .
 the size is smaller than actual . I bought two other 9 months bumpkins and when compared side to side it was twice larger . Beware this looks like a slim fit !!

 I was delighted to find these wide boot blousers on Amazon . I heard great things about them in the past and was inspired to try them out . I ordered 2 sets of blousers . Unfortunately they were not at all what I expected . Although they provide excellent &#34; blousing &#34; quality , they are not long enough , were very uncomfortable to wear and cut off my blood circulation more than anything , even at the widest setting . I am a female and do n't have large calves/legs , which is why I was particularly surprised that these blousers had such a &#34; snug &#34; fit . Although they are made from elastic material , they barley stretch . I was disappointed with this product and have since then returned to the &#34; old school &#34; boot blousers.Great concept , just not &#34; perfected &#34; yet .
 I tried it on , fits well , good support and tummy control , great under clothes ... BUT HOW DO I GO TO BATHROOM WITH THIS ON ??? I would have to take off my top and remove it all the way to go to the bathroom . If I knew it did n't have a snap on off bottom , I would n't of bought it . My fault and waste of money .
 These leggings shrink even when following garment care instructions.For this money the fabric should be of much better quality , they are see through.I doubt these will last.There are better choices .
 I have been loyal to Danskin for a few decades , even though I 've occasionally tried other brands . The truth is that Danskin outshines them all
 So I found a great deal on these and purchased two pairs ... however , I will only be wearing these with a long shirt or dress . I do n't know how many ladies who bought these have turned around , bent over , and taken a good look in the mirror . I have and got a great look at my ass ! I suggest not buying these if you plan on wearing them to yoga and doing some forward folds !
 I did n't try these on after purchasing for a couple months , and during the first wearing , the center seam busted and that was it . Needle holes had expanded and split along one side . Not a good quality fabric .
 I did n't find that these legging gave support . They were thin and I really could n't feel the spandex . They just were not what I wanted .
 The label on the back says `` City Lights '' -LSB- ... -RSB- Not really sure if it 's Athletica unless they do n't put that label on them . The pants are nice . But not what I was expecting . I 've used them for yoga and biking . They are comfortable and durable .
 I returned these - too loose ... Have a hard time finding tall , slim sizes . Fabric seemed to be an ok weight , though I do n't know how they would have worn since I did n't keep them . Had to wait a few weeks for the return credit .
 These leggings were great out of the package . They fit perfectly and were very soft . However , after the first washing they shrunk quite a bit and the softness was lost . I would n't buy them again .
 I bought these because of the reviews . I usually buy the $ 5 leggings at forever21 and wanted to invest in a nicer pair but cant afford lululemons . . So I thought maybe it would be a similar but knockoff type brand . OMG these leggings are the EXACT same quality as forever21 's except the only difference is that these are $ 30 vs $ 5 ... I am returning them , reason being , is that they are see through and not worth the money . I also bought `` capezio '' leggings which I added the link below , and they are a little bit cheaper but more importantly NOT see through.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XZMCQK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00
 My wife wore them once and the seam in the seat began to unravel . I also got her pair from Newport News that were of much sturdier construction . I would recommend going with those instead of these .
 5 ' 5 '' 140 lbs . I ordered these in large . They are great ; made in USA , nice fabric ; great price . So I ordered three more pair but sized up to XL so I could freely launder without them becoming too small . The XL are same as L. . . so I guess anyone larger than 140 should look elsewhere . They actually told me they add 1/8th inch to the XL . Now that is just ridiculous !!! I do notice that washing them makes the legs longer . Too bad because they are terrific tights .
 These leggings sit low on the waist , nothing like the pictures . Pitbull and American Apparel are both using this brand now called In Touch . The materical is thin but comfortable but the lowrise fit ruins them . I am a real woman and I need a little more material for my waist and back side .
 I bought a pair of these leggins based on the reviews I read here . I literally wore them twice before the ripped at the seam . They also pilled extremely fast . Was n't worth the money
 I 'm 5 ' 3 '' 112 lbs . The small size is sluggish and 1 1/2 inches longer than I would like them to be . It 's well made and material is ok for the price-not too thick nor thin . I 'm afraid that they do n't have x-small size .
 I did n't care for these leggings . They are very thin and not at all substantial . I should have returned them , but kept them for warmer weather wear .
 These look good from far away . Close up , they look like a mass of trimmed pubic hair . They shed those little hairs , too . Kinda gross .
 I bought a larger pashmina than this item but made of the same fabric , 30 % silk , 70 % wool , from this company , Cashmere Pashmina Group -- and it was the WORST QUALITY ever . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!The last pashmina I owned , which I bought in London -LRB- NOT from Cashmere Pashmina Group -RRB- , lasted beautifully for over ten years . Finally I decided it was time for a new one , so I purchased a large pashmina shawl from Cashmere Pashmina Group at the Hilton Hotel in New York last year . I thought it was wonderful until after a few months of wear it started `` pilling , '' that is , making small fuzzballs all over itself . The pilling got so bad that I took it back to the Hilton , where I was told to purchase a `` sweater shaver '' and shave the pills off . I tried this and it still looked terrible , so I took it back again . THey refused to take it back , continually telling me they 'd take it back after a week but never after several months . I kept explaining that high quality pashminas should last years , not months , but it was like banging my head against a wall . I do n't believe this was a `` real '' pashmina . I think it is made of a lower-grade wool.Moral of story

 much too small , not happy with this purchase . my calvin kliens fit so much better . there is just not enough room in these !
 I bought what was listed as `` medium '' 6X-8 from my son who usually wears Medium boys clothes . The costume was too small . Furthermore , the link to view seller 's size information only tells you to contact the seller directly . I 'm very disappointed .
 I had to send this item back because it was to small . The sizes run small , so beware .
 I 'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased -- I will admit that I have n't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time -- I had no idea how low the quality has gotten . First , the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily , 2 . The canvas material is not what it used to be either , my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same . 3 . The sizes are so different , I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear , but when they were delivered and I tried them on , it was as if they were two sizes smaller . The material is thin , and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be . I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product , to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases . The quality is very low , but the prices are way too high for the quality .
 I bought a larger pashmina than this item but made of the same fabric , 30 % silk , 70 % wool , from this company , Cashmere Pashmina Group -- and it was the WORST QUALITY ever . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!The last pashmina I owned , which I bought in London -LRB- NOT from Cashmere Pashmina Group -RRB- , lasted beautifully for over ten years . Finally I decided it was time for a new one , so I purchased a large pashmina shawl from Cashmere Pashmina Group at the Hilton Hotel in New York last year . I thought it was wonderful until after a few months of wear it started `` pilling , '' that is , making small fuzzballs all over itself . The pilling got so bad that I took it back to the Hilton , where I was told to purchase a `` sweater shaver '' and shave the pills off . I tried this and it still looked terrible , so I took it back again . THey refused to take it back , continually telling me they 'd take it back after a week but never after several months . I kept explaining that high quality pashminas should last years , not months , but it was like banging my head against a wall . I do n't believe this was a `` real '' pashmina . I think it is made of a lower-grade wool.Moral of story

 This bra has an akward fit . I had to return it . A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria 's secret .

 This bag is made in China with very cheap quality materials . It is NOT leather . It 's made out of a very thin , easily tearable manmade fabric that REEKED of chemicals when I took it out of the packaging.Since it 's so poorly made , I do n't expect it to withstand much use . It definitely would not withstand the riggors of airline baggage handling for very long so if a travel bag is what you 're looking for , bypass this one at all costs otherwise you 'll be wasting your money.I would return mine , but it 's not worth going through the hassle . Let 's just say it was a lesson learned to stay away from Embassy brand products .
 This is n't the exquisite form bra I wanted but the picture of it is blurry so could n't see it well . I wanted the one that has a lace covered top of the cup.There is no &#34; give &#34; in the all cotton bra I received and it 's very uncomfortable to wear .
 Wow , first time buying a bra online . This one was a big mistake but I guess you get what you pay for . Tape , cone molds and notepaper would have done the same job . My bad though , should have paid attention to the description and reviews more .
 I agree . Cup had too much left at the end and all I can say is pointy !
 extremely dissapointing dont buy it ... !!!!!! this bra is made of some cheap material very irritating dont fits properly even though i ordered the right size . . very uncomfortable feeling i had when wear . . i didnt return it but i use it for like 4/5 times and then i through it away.i would never recommend this to anyone .
 The website shows this to cost $ 4.99 . When I selected the size and color , the price jumped to $ 11.99 . Why this switch in price . The change in price is the ONLY reason I did not buy this bra . I was planning on ordering at least 3 of them . Thanks for your time .
 This bra derives all it 's support from the straps . There is no support in the band as there should be . I guess this is why the large felt pads are on the straps . This is 100 % cotton ? The straps were so rigid and light it felt more like cardboard . Bra seemed to run true to size .
 So , unless you 're into `` torpedo titties '' where it looks like you are mimicking Madonna 's infamous cone bra , this bra is not recommended !!! If I had known before I purchased this item , that it would make my chest look like I was wearing two traffic cones on my front , I would n't have bothered . The frontal photo is very deceiving ! If you saw this from the side , it would scare you . I will never wear this item ; I was even embarressed just to show it to my husband after trying it on -LRB- and he definitely made fun of me during the three minutes I was wearing it . -RRB- This bra = not even for Halloween .
 the bra cup itself is too big for my chest . and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30 's and 40 's it is not at all comfortable . blah ! and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure .

 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .

 This bag is very large . I ordered it for carrying my laptop and other work related items . The leather on the side of the handle puckers up and does not look even . When the bag is closed and hanging on my sholder the leather is not even . I returned the bag . I took three stars -LRB- 1 for the size , 1 for the leather folding and the other for the markings on the leather -RRB-

 I did n't want to even give this one star because I never even saw the item . Apparently there was some error at the shipper 's end . We never got it , and then there were none to be sent . Was offered a discount on some other replacement item but I did n't find anything to replace what I was ordering in the first place . If it was so popular , you 'd think they would have gotten more . But , no such luck .

 I could just dye my hair blonde and put it in pigtails to make it look like this wig ! Look - it has red paint on it for the odangos ! Like we 're going to fall for that !
 Hey kids ! Let 's pay 60 bucks for something that can be obtained by dying your hair and putting meatballs in it ! ; -RRB-

 I too hoped this product would rein in my tummy , but alas , all it did was smoothen my existing pooch . Not helping . Also panty lines in the back .
 These are cheep shorts so I am keeping them to workout at home in when my husband is gone ! . I would not be caught dead in public in these shorts - the pockets wad-up an create the illusion of thunder thighs . Yuck .
 I bought this because I have another Maidenform bra which I absolutly love , but when I got this one , in the same size as my other one it did n't fit right , it was too small and even if it would have been the correct size it seems like it did n't give me enough support .
 We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length -LRB- the 36 was more like a 34 or 32 -RRB- , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .
 This bra is not comfortable . It makes a bizarre creaking noise and the underwire really hurts . I wear it , but I 'm not happy about it . The lace is pretty .

 These hose looked great . However , they got a giant snag within one hour of wearing them . Not worth the price .
 I opened mine this morning and within hours , there were several tiny but visible holes - on the upper thigh , not even any place where it could have touched anything .
 Comfortable but ran the first time I wore them . Covered the run in nail polish and wore them again . They got a run in them the second and third time I wore them as well . I had to throw them away after wearing them three times .
 I bought these because my favorite department-store brand hose was discontinued . The material here feels too opaque for the high price . The cheaper discontinued Bloomingdales-brand hose had a finer thread fabric . I wo n't buy these again .
 I only gave it one star because I ca n't give zero - I ordered two pairs of these , and both had runs immediately , despite that I am very very careful about putting on pantyhose . Total waste of money .

 This bra was great looking and fit nicely when it was new . But I washed it in the washing machine on delicate to get the sizing out -LRB- like I do with all my bras -RRB- and then do n't put it in the dryer just let it air dry . For some reason , the foam padding transforms upon washing and the cup of the bra looks like a it is crazed or cracked all over the place . If you are wearing a thick shirt , it wo n't shoe through , but I 've never had this happen before . If you have to hand wash to prevent it , -LRB- because it gets ruined with machine washing -RRB- , then it should stress that in a big bold warning . I was disappointed too , since I liked the fit and look of the new , unwashed bra .

 I am a medium framed person , but I ordered the large just in case they ran small . I thought , then , I 'd just have to wash it to shrink it down . That was n't the case at all This shirt is pretty flimsy and the large is more like a medium/small . That said , it looks decent and if you layer other shirts under it , you wo n't notice the wind coming through.I have received compliments about how it looks and so forth , but I do not wear the shirts often -LRB- I bought the grey and the blue ones -RRB- . For the price I paid , I suppose I should not complain . I recommend buying these to wear in the early fall or during the mild spring months .

 I have at home quite a few large t-shirts bought over the years from different manufacturers including Beefy-T -LRB- Hanes -RRB- . They 're all great t-shirts . I just bought 5 of these large t-shirts from this vendor but I can tell you these are not large . They seem to be a half a size smaller , like in-between medium & large . So all 5 shirts do not fit me . Also , the weight of the fabric is not heavy by any means . These are light weight fabric . My advice is , if you must buy them , buy one size larger than you normally get , but as for me , if Hanes is gon na try & increase their profit margin by giving me a substandard product , they are n't going to ever get my business again . And I have to add that my employer buys us Beefy-T 's every year , and they are n't cheezie like these are , so I do n't know what 's going on except to say I 'm really unhappy with my purchase . If you want to know which t-shirt I ended up with that is a fantastically good buy , check out my other reviews .
 I bought this shirt at walmart years ago , fits great , my favorite t-shirt . i still have it actually with holes in the arm pits and all over it . fits perfect , so i wanted to replace it with the exact same hanes beefy t in the same size thinking it would fit the same . Wrong , the new shirt i ordered was tiny and when i washed it it got even tinier . next time ill just go to walmart its cheaper anyways .
 Long time wearer of Beefy-T 's . The last set I bought were at least 2 inches shorter for the same size -LRB- XXL -RRB- ... C'mon Hanes ...
 Be advised that you can probably get the beefy tees for less directly from Hanes , as I did.Also -LRB- a big bummer -RRB- over the last few years , I have received a tee shirt that is notas thick a material as it used to be . I have worn beefy tees ever since I had asign company that also did silk screening on just about anything , and we used to order only the beefy tees as they were a better T shirt than any other , but this wasthirty years ago , and the product has definitely changed no matter what Hanes or anybody else says . I do n't have a problem with the sizing as others do , and at $ 9.00 each with pocket directly from Hanes , it is still a good deal.Addendum : Contacted Hanes and gave them all the sorted details they ask for in hopes youwill not E-mail them back -LRB- Color , where they were made , price , etc. etc. -RRB- . All a bunch of bunk when they have my order number.This is nothing more than Corporate greed , just like Levi , Maytag and so many others .
 i did n't know the word &#34; beefy &#34; was a size issue . i thought it was more of a discriptive quality issue , so when it arrived and my whole family could wear it together i was n't happy
 They came in great colors but they seem to lose body quickly.They came in great colors but they seem to lose body quickly .
 These shirts run small ; I had to return them.Also , they give the impression that they are heavy weight . They are not .

 This top looks very nice on the photo but is very poor quality in real life . Its thin and stretches like chewing gum.After two washes the color of the fabric is fading , the thread is breaking and the shape is deforming ... Not happy !

 Okay so I wanted that really fashionably chic look with this thick , glossy belt and was preety excited when I got it on but even tho I got the smallest one its still preety loose to the point it doesnt enhance my waist but rather makes me look chunky in that area and im a fit person ! somehow when I put it on I feel uncomfortable , like if it was n't designed for normal people only to look preety on display ... or maybe all wide belts have that quality ... I dunno . I plan on heating something to punch one extra hole in it lol , lets see how that turns out since i dont want to deal with returns ! and hopefully use it at least once outside of my home .
 Its ok . i dont hate it . i have a short torso so it looks really big on me , its more rectangle . if you are tall and skinny it will look really great on you . im hippy so it just made me look more hippy . lol its a nice belt though .

 Inseam length was 2x reported in product description . Husband tried shorts on to see how they fit and the crotch was down to the knees almost . Had to return them . Very disappointed .
 I have purchased several pair of Russell athletic shorts in the past , and felt comfortable ordering another pair . I was surprised that the length of these shorts was well below my knee , about 4 inches longer than I prefer . If the ad had stated a 8 '' or 10 '' inseam , I never would have bough them
 These things are huge . They hang half way between your knee and your ankle and are very uncomfortable . The material is poor quality . Definitely a big disappointment for a product from Russell Athletic .
 The first pair was a perfect fit in the 4X size I wear , but the 2nd is a 3x when I ordered a 4X again ... the little insignia `` n `` can be felt but not seen also on my 2nd pair . Unfortunately I live in Thailand and it 's been too long for me to try to send back to USA ... shame this happens because a garment worker puts a wrong size label on their companies products , never saw that happen when the work was done here in the USA by our Garment Workers !
 I bought the same product at Kmart/Sears for half the price and no waiting on US snail mail .
 I like to wear these as pj bottoms . The drawstring is great , as are the pockets . The length is perfect . However , every pair I 've owned -LRB- in excess of 10 pair -RRB- has had a problem with the seams tearing at the pockets . Maybe I 'm putting too much stuff in the pocket and stressing the seam ? It 's just annoying to have holes in the shorts after only washing them a time or 2 . The shorts are also too expensive here . More so depending on the color you choose , as some are not shipped Prime.I 'll be looking for another brand of similar shorts .
 Same review as for the jersey pants . light enough to workout in and not get overheated.biggest problem . lousy manufacturing and qualilty control . very poor stitching . seams ripped inside of four weeks . otherwise workable .
 THE PICTURE OF THE RUSSELS SHORTS APPEAR TO BE ABOVE THE KNEE IN LENGTH . THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEY ARE TO THE KNEE AND SOME WHAT BELOW . NOT WHAT THE PICTURES SHOWS .
 The shorts I received crotch length from waist to crotch is sized as regular not big . If you are trying to buy shorts with a longer length from waist to crotch these shorts will not fit .
 The item looks like a pair of shorts - thats why I bought it . what got delivered was an oversize pair of long track pants - at least the color was the same as the picture . I have returned it and asked for a refund .
 i have been sucker twice , and i do not blame u but , i have learn my lesson i will never again buy this product again . wrong size sent , poor manufacturing , just plain suck this item I . A . P. O. S.
 These were the long pull on sweat pants ... since I am in Iraq ... nothing a pair of scissors ca n't fix ...
 Did not care for these shorts , elastic wait band not totally covered , so it rips at you skin after wearing for awhile . The more active you are the worse it feels . Also these are the only mens large I have ordered that are smaller then other large sizes alredy owned .
 I bought 3 of these shorts size 1X between mid-2008 and late-2010 . The 2 black color fit well and the single grey color was a bit larger but still useful . I liked these items . They were made in Pakistan and all were labelled 1X . Recently I ordered 3 more size 1X shorts - 2 black and 1 blue . The blue I received was labelled 1X made in Pakistan and fit like expected.The 2 black shorts were labelled XL and had a much smaller waist . Made in China . I figured different patterns so I ordered the next size up -LRB- 2X -RRB- . The new shorts were HUGE , reaching below the knee . Also made in China . I have n't seen anyone in person who could wear that size.Anyway I gave up and returned the items for credit . No more Russell orders for me . These days the Russell sizing seems to be more based on the color than the size label.Thank you Amazon for the great return policy .
 The pockets are too shallow , the length of the pant is too long , the material is not very thick , and my husband wore them for two hours and said , &#34; Send them back ! &#34;

 Do not buy this hat for sun protection.The shape is great , and just what I was looking for to protect myself from the sun . The clip visor style allows my hair to not be crushed down by the hat.But the bill lets light through , and the `` UV coating '' is so ineffective that I doubt there is any coating at all . You will note that there is no attempt to disclose any SPF rating for this hat in the description.After wearing the visor for one hour outside , my face became covered in light freckles . Ugh ! I called and tried to tell the representative that this was a problem , and got indifference.Ineffective at protecting your face from the sun - do not buy this unless you are looking for it as a fashion statement only.e4hats - listen to your customers and improve this hat!I note that e4hats deleted my negative reviews of this hat off of their own website . Apparently , they only allow positive reviews to remain on their site . Shame on you , e4hats .

 Thanks to the USPO my package mailed June 18 arrived July 9 . The long awaited item seemed to be good quality and well made but was smaller than any other bra I have in the same size , too small to wear . This meant rewrapping , a trip to the post office and mailing cost . Since the Visa bill arrived before the order , it has been paid and now I am waiting to receive credit for the returned item and I hope , the original $ 5.95 shipping and processing charge ... Oh well !
 I was so disappointed in this bra ! It has a border around it that feels scratchy and uncomfortable . I do n't recommend this product .

 I bought this about 8 months ago and used it for 3 trips within the US on different major airlines . The storage aspect of it is great and it 's really easy to move around . But , after two trips that plastic buckles on the sides broke . After my 3rd trip the lining on the outside broke away -LRB- the green outside lining -RRB- . So now it looks like a shredded piece of garbage after 3 trips . I wo n't buy anything from High Sierra again . : - -LRB-
 After reading the reviews here on Amazon , I purchased this bag in late March last year -LRB- 11 months ago -RRB- . I especially chose it because of the reviews which stated that it was a hard-wearing bag , as I do a lot of travelling . Since purchasing it , I 've taken this bag from the US to Brazil , back to the US and back to Brazil , then to New Zealand and back , as well as on a lot of internal travel within Brazil , from the southern states to the Amazon.However , I can only imagine that the production quality of the bag has declined significantly since some of the more glowing reviews posted here on Amazon . Less than one year after purchase , I have had to send this bag for repair twice and it 's about to go back again . The stiching on both the front and the back of the bag has just simply worn out . Both plastic buckles have cracked . One wheel is now tilted , and some of the zipper pullers and the High Sierra logo have simply disappeared . The black fabric on the bottom of the bag is frayed and showing signs that it may soon give out . The velco fastner which is supposed to hold both carrying handles together never worked and I 've had to wind a velcro strip around it.As far as its design goes , I 'd give this bag five stars . It 's great to be able to wear it , wheel it or simply lug it around , and it has a good amount of pockets and dividers , and very useful carry handles at both ends . It also expands to give an amazing amount of storage capacity.It 's just a pity that the quality of this product is now so awful that I personally would n't recommend this to anybody who is looking for a rugged go-anywhere travel solution .
 I really wanted a large wheeled travel duffel -LRB- but not too large to qualify for airplane use -RRB- . I have seen a number of my friends with some that are basically tanks of storage , but flexible so they can really squish stuff in . This one is as large as you can get to qualify for airline use -LRB- checked -RRB- and had mostly great reviews and popularity and looked decent . Results are so-so . First , per something mentioned in other reviews , mine is as pictured , technically . It has two tones of grey and some green trim . I think the problem is in-person the darker grey is only very slightly darker whereas in the picture on Amazon the darker grey looks almost black or charcoal , which looks very striking . The reality is much more subtle and not quite as nice.Second , on paper the feature which allows you to separate the main storage into two compartments or combine as one is nice . In practice , much less so . As two compartments the problem is neither is that large and it makes it a hassle to access the stuff on a trip -LRB- or even pack it -RRB- since you constantly have to zipper shut the top half to access the bottom half without spilling everything out of the top , and it makes the top awkwardly thick and heavy . As one big compartment it is compromised in a couple fundamental ways - 1 -RRB- That it unzips from the middle so you ca n't stack and pack as well as you should ; 2 -RRB- That the flap that zips shut between the two compartment has a substantial permanent border so even with just one compartment about 40 % of the bag has this layer blocking the middle.The net result is we could n't pack any more in this duffel than our existing large conventional wheeled suitcase that overall is n't as large in dimensions . In other words , this duffel was less efficient than an old fashioned suitcase which is the opposite of what it should have been.The wheels and handle were fine . The material was okay , but I would have preferred canvas which would have been more pliable and looked better . And the gimmicky hidden backpack straps were just that , a gimmick . I did try using them with a full back but it 's a huge , awkward shape that is holding almost 50 lbs . of stuff - I would have preferred the traditional messenger bag single shoulder strap my old fashioned duffel bags have.UPDATE 9/1/2012
 The zippers on this bag are a pain to use and they put a pull tab on the expanding zipper instead of the main compartment . When closing the main compartment the zipper hangs on every corner even when it 's not full . After one international trip , the stitching coming undone on one of the handles . All in all this bag is ok , but I wish I purchased a Travel Pro bag instead .
 I purchased this bag last year and have been extrememly disaapointed with it not lasting long . On my second trip the plastic strap holder on the back broke . I have had High Sierra already send replacements for the zipper tabs and the locking front plastic straps . The velcro strap holder for the carrying straps is already coming apart as well . The zipper is now breaking . I have had the bag since November of 2011 . Not a good bag for extensive travel.The best feature is the dual compartments which is great as I can keep soiled garments in one side and clean in the other .
 I ca n't see where else to put my complaint , so here goes ... I was really looking forward to receiving this item and did a lot of research into different bags and this one seemed to fit the bill.When I received my package it is quite obvious that this item has been used . There is significant wear on the wheels , what I think is grass in one of the pockets and some of the studs have been scratched and/or worn away.Also , the interior lining is also very creased and scratched and marked.If any other Amazonians can tell me how I can take this further , please let me know ... unfortunately returning is not an option , as I bought this as a gift for myself for my birthday holiday I am taking next week and I need a bag to travel with.A really deflating and disappointing shopping experience .
 My wife and I went to Amsterdam a few months ago , i searched the internet for the best rolling duffle bag i could find , i bought two of these for the trip.My wife 's wheel broke off on the street day one and on day two the back of mine shattered , yes shattered and that made the wheels cave in . We searched all day for a luggage cart to bunge our new broken bags to and spent the next 10 days traveling europe wrestling with this shattered back , wheel draging crap!Dont bother with this brand if you need a strong pull bag !!!
 I purchased this bag for international travel . It is so much easier to wheel this bag around rather than the large rectangular monsters I usually carried . I have several bruises and scars on my shins from the old luggage . This bag was a easy to pack , practical , and lighter in weight when empty than most large luggage . This is a huge benefit when attempting to pack gifts to bring back home from travel.After only one trip , I was sad to see that the fabric stitching had torn away from the zipper . One pocket on the edge was almost fully exposed -LRB- and now completely useless -RRB- . Baggage handlers today are obviously not expected to handle newborn babies , but it takes a monumental effort to rip a bag in such a way to rip 20-30 stitches ! I am going to try and complain to High Sierra and see if they can fix it for free . I will post an updates as the situation progresses . Hopefully the entire bag does not tear away at the seams in the same way .

 This bra is not comfortable . It makes a bizarre creaking noise and the underwire really hurts . I wear it , but I 'm not happy about it . The lace is pretty .
 I bought this because I have another Maidenform bra which I absolutly love , but when I got this one , in the same size as my other one it did n't fit right , it was too small and even if it would have been the correct size it seems like it did n't give me enough support .
 We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length -LRB- the 36 was more like a 34 or 32 -RRB- , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .

 There is no such thing as `` Genuine NYPD Physical Training T-Shirt '' since the only shirts that are worn and officially recognized by the department are academy shirts with last name and company number on front and rear . There are NYC Licensed NYPD Shirts , but none designated as Genuine PT shirts - merchant needs to revamp description since it is misleading.Retired NYPD9/11 Recovery Team

 I remember when Danskin products wore like iron and looked as good a year later as the day they were purchased . The quality has suffered tremendously in recent years . The material does n't last and worse , of five pairs I 've bought , two had multiple open seams with gaps as long as five inches that I had to sew shut myself . Terrible .
 As far as leggings go these are just fine , like every other pair I own . What earns them the low rating is lack of value.I paid a third for leggings that own that are just as good . Not happy about that .

 Ordered this , although not from Amazon , from another company . I was disappointed in what I got . The picture made it look like the actual mask worn in the 2005 movie , which is what I was after . But alas it is only a mask with a rubber band strap to go behind the head , it does n't cover the whole top of the head like I expected and the eye holes are small . The gloves are just handless slip ons and the nails you get are glue on but come with some kind of stick on stuff . You can probably do better buying the fake nails in a department store . I guess it just goes to show if you want the real thing , you may just have to learn to sew and make your own .

 The underwear was tempting to buy only for its price . I liked how it looked , but wasnt all too impressed . When i wore it , the first thing i noticed was how uncomfortable the sling system was . I got rid of it , and that aside , the underwear was perfect . . comfortable , fitted really well and looked good . But after what seemed like one wash , the ends started giving away and it now looks more like a skirt than a trunk . the lower edges have flared up -LRB- dunno why -RRB- . The 2 stars are for the initial fit -LRB- looked super hot -RRB- . . I ordered 5 pieces , so I got 5 days of awesome sex ! Lol . .
 Uncomfortable ! Poor quality ! Bad Customer Service ! Nice box/advertising ! I purchased 3 of these -LRB- different colors -RRB- , never having owned this brand . I purchased from another online retailer , not Amazon . One had a tag that read `` Medium '' which did n't match the size on the box or the size ordered , which was `` Large '' . Upon calling the online retailer all of their stock in the color `` gray '' was the same situation . Returned it and received a replacement pair , size `` Large '' , which was significantly bigger than either of the other 2 pair which were supposed to be size `` Large '' . I called C-in2 to express my dissatisfaction with the initial stock mix-up of all gray pair , received no response.Lastly , the `` sling '' advertised , sounds better in theory than it is . After a couple of minutes the sling gets uncomfortable , feels like a paper cut .

 Probably a great product , so if your a child , woman or man under 5 ' 7 and/or weigh less than 200lbs . . these probably work for you.I 've got quite normal legs , but for some bizarro reason , the XL size of these things is about 1.5-2 '' too small to close around my calf . Its not like I have Schwarzeneggeresque calf muscles . Seems to me OR is targeting the small folks for its products.I guess the rest of us do n't get to snowshoe . I 'd look for another make or try on a local product in person if you are over 5 ' 7 '' and/or over 200lbs . Crazy but true .

 I imagine this suit is fine for some . Like a lot of the reviewers note , these suits run very small , so make sure you have a sense of your size . I had to return mine , which was frustrating because not only did I get charged for return shipping , but the other items in my order no longer qualified for free shipping . The other issue with this model is that the back straps are pretty flimsy . The entire back is basically naked , so there 's not a lot of support or rather I would probably keep pulling my suit up and adjusting it with the straps being that flimsy .
 I swim 5 days a week and chlorinated water has eaten this suit up in less than a month . Because it is not fully lined , the backside is practically worn bare ! I want to return it but I no longer have the labels.This is a suit for sitting by the pool but not for swimming or wateraerobics on a regular basis .
 How dare this company sell such crap at such ridiculous prices ! If you want quality like this I suggest you take a trip to the Wal-mart lingerie section . This cami is poorly made , with messy seams and loose threads , as well as being sized incorrectly , with the small being small in the cups but far too wide around . The same goes for all the other items I recently purchased from this company . I assure you , you will be far happier with another brand .
 The style and design are unicque , very well done , I would like to order two more but medium please . The material did not do very well after washing .

 These guys make such a bewildering array of products that when you find one that meets your needs , you can never find more of the same kind . They should number their socks or something - &#34; Style Number 314683 &#34; or the like , if they even make the same kind of sock , with the same texture and material and weight , for more than two months in a row . It 's a pain , because if I do n't wear wool socks my feet hurt , and they used to be very reliable .

 Looks like a real nice jacket and I probably would have bought two . But once you put the size in it is suppose to prompt you for a color . Does not . I guess you really did not want to sell any of these .

 Poor quality and a bad fit . The picture does not represent the product well at all . It has a `` sweat band '' type material inside that I was unaware of and find uncomfortable . I would suggest shopping for one in person .

 I had to send this item back because it was to small . The sizes run small , so beware .
 I 'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased -- I will admit that I have n't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time -- I had no idea how low the quality has gotten . First , the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily , 2 . The canvas material is not what it used to be either , my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same . 3 . The sizes are so different , I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear , but when they were delivered and I tried them on , it was as if they were two sizes smaller . The material is thin , and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be . I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product , to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases . The quality is very low , but the prices are way too high for the quality .

 I imagine this suit is fine for some . Like a lot of the reviewers note , these suits run very small , so make sure you have a sense of your size . I had to return mine , which was frustrating because not only did I get charged for return shipping , but the other items in my order no longer qualified for free shipping . The other issue with this model is that the back straps are pretty flimsy . The entire back is basically naked , so there 's not a lot of support or rather I would probably keep pulling my suit up and adjusting it with the straps being that flimsy .
 I swim 5 days a week and chlorinated water has eaten this suit up in less than a month . Because it is not fully lined , the backside is practically worn bare ! I want to return it but I no longer have the labels.This is a suit for sitting by the pool but not for swimming or wateraerobics on a regular basis .
 Looks like a real nice jacket and I probably would have bought two . But once you put the size in it is suppose to prompt you for a color . Does not . I guess you really did not want to sell any of these .
 Had only 4 wks ... poss . washed 2x -LRB- and hung dry -RRB- and underwire is coming out of side and poking me !
 Very uncomfortable because the wires were longer than the cup . Left marks each time I wore it so it has been replaced . Waste of money .

 I bought 2 of these due to the reviews , wear a 38 J cup . IT is too big , and there is a TON of material . I HATE underwires . Under the arm pits is dreadful , it makes me sweat like a pig and I dislike the feel of the whole thing . It runs way big and does not offer much in the way of support . Not comfortable and the straps are not very comfy either.I must echo all other large breasted womens comments . What is wrong with bra makers ? I tried making my own bra in desperation , that was a bust . Apparently unless you wear a 34 b or c cup we are doomed to crummy over priced , ugly colors and ugly pieces of junk . If I were not so large breasted I would just give up.I just wear my old glamorise that have muffin tops because they do not go over an I cup .
 I bought this hoping it would fit -LRB- impossible to find my size and suitable style -RRB- and be an easy wear . The straps do not shorten enough for any support at all . The band material is not soft enough to prevent chafing -LRB- a problem for me with very thin skin -RRB- - so I would not get another , and have it to wear on occasion , but fit for support and comfort are not suitable for me situation . I have no complaint about the quality and such for others , but straps that wo n't shorten more is a big drawback for me .

 I own both the Feelmax toes socks and the Injinji Toes socks , the Feelmax have serious quality issues compared to the Injinji ... They do n't have the reinforced stitching , they dont fit `` true to size '' like the Injinji do , i should have known better than to buy a size 10-14 sock with size 14 feet , these barely fit , they are difficult to get on , I am overall very disapointed , and i am stuck with $ 40.00 worth of them , do yourself a fave spend the extre 2-4 and get the injinji ...
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Just going to list the issues
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;

 Soon as i took it out the bag , the fur started falling off . very cheap material . By the time you finish using it , you 'll be left with just metal .
 it is very week doessnt actually restrain partner the rud fuz falls off very easily ...
 Fur falls off instantly !!! I feel like i waste \ d my time and my money . Definitely do not recommend this to anyone !
 Not even very functional but I guess it works if all you are looking for is a presentation .

 This outfit was darling . My grandson wore it to see Thomas the Train . Came home and notice that the buttons were all lose . Went to take outfit off and the buttons for the overalls fell out of the stretched out fabric ! Sad to pay this much for one wearing .
 I bought this for my son for Halloween . He is 27 months , and average in height/weight . I purchased the `` 2T-3T '' which is advertised for children 33 '' -36 '' in height . When it arrived , the item is ridiculously too big . The label reads `` Size 2-3 '' immediately adjacent to a graphic stating `` Ages 3 + '' . I measured the length of the overalls themselves to be 33 '' . What I received is more appropriate for a 4-5 year old . I almost never buy clothes on Amazon because I do n't trust sizing , but I mistakenly thought a children 's costume would be safe . I guess it 's off to the Halloween store ...

 Being so inexpensive I knew not to expect much but these glasses arrived bent and twisted wrapped in plastic , unwearable with cracked lenses . Awful .

 It looks really cool ... my son fell in love with it ... but here it is the end of September ... just over 3 weeks into school , and the zipper is completely busted . No way to fix it . I have never had to replace a backpack during a school year before , let alone within the first month ! This is a very cheap backpack . Do not buy ... its not worth the money .
 So excited to receive this . It does run a LITTLE small . The sewing craftsmanship is not good ... looks like it will rip easily , and looks like they forgot to sew part of it -LRB- around the collar -RRB- . The slip is HORRIBLE . Could n't get the hoop insert to stay in a hoop form , and as soon as we put the hoop insert into the bottom of the slip , the slip ripped .
 After only using the case several times one of the locks became stuck in the locked position . The only way to get it open was to break the lock . Low quality construction . I would not recommend this case .
 I can not get the Telescoping handle to go all the way down , therefore , making it impossible to retreive docutments , files and catalogs from the top since the handle prevents the top from opening fully to do so . Also , when pulling the handle up , the handle will not stay in the upright position in order to roll the case . I wish the manufacturer will repair or replace the case . I really need it and for it to work properly.Paul
 Our company ordered 6 of these bags ... the handles sticks on ALL the bags ... you have to struggle with the handle to get it to go up and down ... horrible

 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .

 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .

 Look , it 's on sale ! Usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00 . And you wo n't find anyone else wearing this original . Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy . Spill anything on this shirt , it already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill . Worth every penny . As a bonus , you can also wear this shirt while hunting .
 Does not iron well at all . Will try the cleaners to see how it will look after that i may have to get another one in a different material

 I actually had to send this back cause of the size . They run really small .
 A great jacket when it was made in the USA . All of Carhartt 's products are no longer union made in the USA . This warm jacket , now leaves U.S. worker 's out in the cold . I love Carhartt but how can we support a company that does not support us , like so many others . Fewer jobs here = 's high unemployment and low wages . Do not buy Carhartt .
 Given the price , I should n't be disappointed I guess , but the material was really cheap feeling . Running my hand across it , the material did not feel smooth and silky at all . It almost felt like plastic .
 Before I bought this product , I read all the reveiws about how everyone hated the gown , how it was uncomfortable , and how confusing it was to tie in the back but I figured that everyone was being too picky for the price . That is , until I recieved it and now I understand what everyone else was talking about . The dress feels like you 're wearing a highschool graduation gown that is too small on you , and I even ordered a size larger than my actual size and it was still tight . The fabric is unattractive , and is just mess of wrinkles . The only positive thing I would say is that the robe is alright , but if you 're looking for a cheap sexy sleep outfit , I would n't recommend purchasing this one .
 This is a classic case of getting what you pay for . Item has a stiff plasticky feel instead of feeling like silk as described . Also arrived very wrinkled . Item returned and would not recommend others purchase it .
 I ordered this robe set in size large -LRB- which is my size -RRB- and I could n't even get the night gown dress over my head and shoulders . The robe fit , but barely , and was very snug . I intended to buy this robe set with included night gown because I 've been in need of one and so I decided to go with this one for my choice but it was not what I expected at all . Also , on both the robe and gown had pieces of thread hanging off different parts like it was quickly made or was made decent but started to fall apart due to bad craftmanship .
 The product was to small . I wear a size 3X and that is what I ordered but when I put it on it was to small and tight so I sent it right back and never heard anything from you -LRB- the company -RRB- again . I do n't think that there is anything you can do now since it has been some time ago . I think you should know and be kind enough to make me the consumer happy I feel I was done wrong and overlooked . I never received my refund or credit to my CC account . I paid alot for that outfit for my account not to be credited.Thank you sincerly , The Forgetten Consumer
 The fit is all wrong around the shoulders . The robe is pretty unshapely . Material quality and stitching quality is ok .
 I love the robe ... but HOW THE HECK DO YOU WORK THE NIGHTY ??? I was so confused ... I will prob wear it only once and then use just the robe because it feels nice . All I can say is ... uuuuuuuuuh wtf .
 the nightgown was odd , so odd wasnt even sure how to put it on , however i did like the robe so i kept that and threw away the nightgown , th e shipping was good
 Cheap material . The night-gown is very odd shaped and doesnt fit well . The robe is huge ! I ordered the plus size and I wear 14-16 shirts and 13 pants . Its not very comfortable either .
 THis looks great but i was really disapointed in the general quality.and the roughness of the cloth ... it seems that this is more ofa costume than an actual item you would wear daily ... kinda like fredricks of hollywood quality vs victoria 's Secret quality .
 I got this for my girlfriend . It was priced cheaply , and Iknow why . It 's made of flimsy nylon like a halloween costume . The seller allowed me a return , but I could n't find packaging to send it back and figured I was n't really out that much . I 'd recommend spending a little more on something nicer .
 The item was sold as a `` Robe set '' . When item was recieved it was under garmet only with out robe . there was no info on how to contact seller . WILL NOT BE BUYING FROM SELLER AGAIN .
 It did n't look great on my body type , which is a longer torso I guess ; it did n't go down long enough to cover the goods . The robe is good though .
 I originally ordered two of these one red one white , I got the white one first and decided to return the red one before I received it . The ties in back are confusing and it still doesnt fit right and the fabric is cheap . Plus I didnt ' think about it before hand but would n't you rather have matching panties than a padded hanger . I should have spent more , you pay for quality I guess . Would n't recommend
 DO NOT BUY ! The babydoll itself is made of a cheap , terrible material and has ties in the back that are awkward and you would need your lover to help you put it on to begin with . Not flattering and not sexy . I threw that part away and have the robe , which is slightly better , hanging in my closet . I got some lingerie as a gift recently from Pamida and that was of way better quality than this and it was cheaper . Just do n't waste your money .
 My first impression was how bold the color was , so far so good . But upon touching the material my positive impression ended . The material feels horrible . I guess you get what you pay for ? I could n't imagine that material against my skin . Secondly , the back of the nighty has this weird cross around tie thing -LRB- notice there are no pictures of the back here on Amazon ? -RRB- , which does make it adjustable but I thought it looked odd . In addition to that in the middle of the back on the lower back there 's another tie which seems might be nice for fuller figured women but it just looks so odd . I returned it , I supposed I 'll need to scout local stores so I can feel the material and see the whole thing before I buy .
 I 'm 5 ' 5 '' and 150lbs , and ordered a large . way too short it did n't even cover my butt , I had plenty of room to wrap it around and the dress fit pretty well other than too short . If your 5 ' 2 '' or shorter this would be a nice set . I just wish they had a size chart with the length on it .
 I do n't really like it , but hey I decided to get the cheapest one I saw so u get what pay for
 This robe is extremely short . So much so that it 's not much of a cover-up . However , it is pretty , and the satin quilted hanger that it comes on is almost as exciting as the garment itself . I would have liked it to be longer . The chemise or babydoll fit me very strangely , and I will not be wearing it . I 've worn the robe once or twice , but would get more use out of a longer one . However , it was n't worth returning because it was so cheap that return shipping would eat up most of the refund .
 The robe is ok , but the inside outfit was absolutely cheap . The string is hard to figure out and it 's so cheap that the string broke the first time I try to put them on . It was not even sewn on properly and then later on , the second string broke . I never even get to wear them and too lazy to fix a new broken item . Unless you ABSOLUTELY love the satin robe , DO N'T GET IT .
 I was very excited about this item and I was happy to see that it arrived quickly . However , the product is less than satidfactory . The robe is oversized , and i mean HUGE . I ordered this in a large and the robe is at least a 2x . It sags and hangs everywhere on me . Plus the fabric is so wrinkly that not even the iron would press out the large wrinkles . The material is thin and flimsy and is only one sided , so while the outside has a nice , soft satin appearance , the inside feels like sandpaper against my skin . The little tea-towel that came with it is impossible to wear . I 'm a smaller woman with large breasts -LRB- 36DD -RRB- and I ordered a large to accomodate for that , however , this thing squishes my boobs and gaps bigtime at the underarm area . Then there are two awkward sets of ties on the back . Overall , I 'm very dissatisfied with the product .
 Would not purchase again the sizing chart is off . The size 40 hip is more like a 35 . The ties in the back are poorly placed causing awkward bulging in the gown .
 did not fulfill my expectations , came across arruagada seems used , is disjointed and pasted.the piece is not the quality expected hope this answer detail thanks
 So I ignored all the previous reviews , thinking somehow I would know better . The robe is nice , no complaints with that , which is the only reason why I did n't give it one star . The babydoll on the other hand ... I still have not figured out how to tie it in the back . I have purchased plenty of such items in the past , so I assumed the previous posters just did not have a clue . Wow , I was wrong and the one without a clue . This item is confusing and still sitting unused in my drawer . It would have been nice if there was atleast a picture posted somewhere so that I can try to figure this out , but there is not . I bought this as a Valentines nighty , but gave up on it and bought another item from the store that I used the black robe with instead . It is a shame that so far , it has been wasted . Maybe one day I will figure it out .
 when I opened the packaging there was a rip down the side of the night gown . the robe was fine but still disappointing .
 The material is really unpleasant and somewhat stiff , and hangs awkwardly . Also the shape is very awkward . AND the straps of the thing are difficult to handle and create unflattering lines . And you ca n't really sleep in it -LRB- which I know is n't the intended purpose , but , you know . . -RRB- because the straps sort of pull at your back and arms . I would n't recommend it .
 It is sized at least 2 sizes too small and the material is thin . Definitely for show not for sleeping .
 Uncomfortable and odd shaped . sleeves are too long and the ties in the back are a pain in the butt . : \
 This robe made me look really boxy . its very very VERY short . I ordered a large , which was too large for me in the shoulders but not large enough in the waist ... really strange . The material is very thin , but if the fit was good I would have kept it but it was not flattering for me at all .
 This item had ripped the night I wore it , So dont waer it to bed . I was hoping that the rob would have been longer . But atleast that didnt rip .

 Instead of hangers to hold this up they use velcro . This puts strain at the top and eventually cracks the thin peice of wood holding it straight . Great for holding air , not great for holding items .
 I expected sturdy , canvas covered shelves and what I got were slippery , saggy plastic shelves and sent it back .
 If you have the kind of closet where the hangers only fit one way , the only way you can use this is to put it on a hanger and use it that way . It 's okay for sweaters , but not strong enough for shoes . Would n't buy again .
 This review is to let potential buyers know that this product has changed from its original design , and yet at the time of this review neither the picture , nor the Product Features , nor the Amazon.com review have been updated to reflect the change.I bought one of these in Dec. 2004 and it is exactly as pictured with canvas shelves . When you feel the shelves , you can tell that they have hardboard sandwiched between them making a durable surface that does not sag . I just purchased a second one and opened it today -LRB- May 2008 -RRB- and while the top is still canvas-covered hardboard , the shelves are now plastic.I came back here to see if I 'd accidentally ordered a cheaper version , but the model number is the same . Whitney has indeed changed their design , and to be fair I see now that if you scroll all the way down to the Product Description under the Amazon.com review , it 's been updated to `` 6 Shelf , Sweater Organizer With Plastic Shelves ... '' . But keeping the original picture and Product Features , which only show and mention canvas , is highly misleading.I tested out the plastic shelves and they do not compare to the original that I own which is still going strong -LRB- no sagging -RRB- . Plus of course , it does n't match . I will be returning this . Hope this helps others make a more informed buying decision .
 I bought this organizer because of so many raving reviews about it , but was disappointed with the item I received . It is PVC shelves not canvas ! It 's only good for storing t-shirt and light clothes .8 / 2/2010 Update
 I bought the shoe/shelf unit that comes covered in nice canvas and I was very impressed with the design so I did n't bother to check the reviews on this companion product . New unit is terrible and ca n't bear more than light rags .

 I purchased several of these to use and give as gifts . The ones I kept had zippers that went off track within the first couple of uses . If this is something you 'd like to use on a regular basis , dont waste your money . I did not end up giving the others as gifts because of the poor quality . Nice concept , but did not perform as expected .
 Quality is cheap ! I wo n't be wearing it . Waste of money . Do n't purchase ! Hair us matted together . You can see the net .

 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 Just going to list the issues
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 This is an attractive bag and well priced , but the canvas and frame are both flimsy and light weight . When I first received it and was hanging my things , the canvas tore -LRB- 3-4 '' hole by one of the hanging hooks -RRB- . Whitney customer service was VERY nice and sent me a replacement . When I put my things on the 2nd one , the frame bent and one of the hooks popped off the frame -LRB- the metal opened up and let go of the frame -RRB- and the canvas was already frayed around the holes where the frame hooks come out of the canvas . In the end I had to use the frame from the 1st one and the canvas bag from the 2nd one -LRB- which had the metal rings torn off but otherwise did n't have a big tear -RRB- ... I used pliers to attach 2 of the hooks from the disgarded frame to reinforce the 1st frame ... so hopefully it will be sturdy enough . You should know that I am hanging off-season summer clothes -LRB- dresses , a few pairs of jeans , 1 heavy terry robe -- nothing majorly heavy -- no coats , etc. -RRB- . So I would only recommend this bag if you are hanging light-weight party frocks or something that 's bulky but very light . Otherwise , it 's not sturdy enough .
 This bag looked great out of the box , but it is really flimsy and the fabric ripped around the hanging holes almost immediately . I would not recommend it .

 I bought 2 of these due to the reviews , wear a 38 J cup . IT is too big , and there is a TON of material . I HATE underwires . Under the arm pits is dreadful , it makes me sweat like a pig and I dislike the feel of the whole thing . It runs way big and does not offer much in the way of support . Not comfortable and the straps are not very comfy either.I must echo all other large breasted womens comments . What is wrong with bra makers ? I tried making my own bra in desperation , that was a bust . Apparently unless you wear a 34 b or c cup we are doomed to crummy over priced , ugly colors and ugly pieces of junk . If I were not so large breasted I would just give up.I just wear my old glamorise that have muffin tops because they do not go over an I cup .
 I bought this hoping it would fit -LRB- impossible to find my size and suitable style -RRB- and be an easy wear . The straps do not shorten enough for any support at all . The band material is not soft enough to prevent chafing -LRB- a problem for me with very thin skin -RRB- - so I would not get another , and have it to wear on occasion , but fit for support and comfort are not suitable for me situation . I have no complaint about the quality and such for others , but straps that wo n't shorten more is a big drawback for me .

 I actually had to send this back cause of the size . They run really small .
 A great jacket when it was made in the USA . All of Carhartt 's products are no longer union made in the USA . This warm jacket , now leaves U.S. worker 's out in the cold . I love Carhartt but how can we support a company that does not support us , like so many others . Fewer jobs here = 's high unemployment and low wages . Do not buy Carhartt .

 These were horrible . Straps did n't stay in place , hard to walk in . I threw them away and could n't even use them .
 I would not recommend this product . It splintered after one use , not exactly a safe product for a toddler . In addition , the tines of the fork are far too sharp . It 's a shame but I would stay away form this product .
 I want blue Levis with no fake creasing and wear . It is SO cheesy and sloppy - my kid will break them in just fine on his own .
 Purchased this for my son . Too stiff of a denim even after washing . May return ... not happy with this pair of jeans .

 Thank goodness I received this as a gift from someone because it 's a complete waste of money . This is n't a blanket ... it 's a handkerchief ! It 's thin , way too small to swaddle a normal sized baby , and cheap flannel . You could use it as a burp cloth , but that 's about it . DO NOT BUY THIS if you want to use it for the purpose of what it claims it 's made for . Very dissatisfied .
 These are supposed to be extra-large sizing , 30x40 . I just measured one that has n't been washed or dried yet , and it measures 27x28 . They are n't large enough to wrap my daughter 's newborn in . In addition , they are not soft . Maybe that would change after washing , but then they 'll probably be smaller yet after going through washer/dryer . It is truly a shame for anyone to be selling these as soft , warm , 30x40 receiving blankets .
 These receiving blankets have been of very little use to us , as they are much to small to even wrap baby in - let alone swaddle . The fabric is also very thin and not durable .
 This product is a piece of junk . They are too small to cover the baby . The quality is so bad some of them broken apart the first time they were washed even before the baby could used it !! .
 they are adorable , but useless . too small to swaddle or even bundle , and not warm enough to cover baby .
 These blankets are way too small to swaddle . What the hell are they designed for ? It was a waste of money -- recommend not to buy them .
 I should 've paid more attention to the dimensions . I was hoping to use these blankets for swaddling but they 're too small and too thin . The fabric is a little cheap . . but hey , this is a cheap buy . I ended up using the blankets to tuck the baby 's arms underneath her , and then use something else for swaddling .
 On the plus side , these blankies are very soft and light ... . BUT ... . they are sooo small ! Did n't get much practical use for them as a receiving blankie so they were turned into changing mats !

 I was not happy with the material of this product . I like the robe , tho , so for the price I kept both colrs , -LRB- red and black -RRB- I am not a `` return '' type person .
 I know that pics are n't always accurate to color , but I ordered the pink set and it is not a nice shade of pink . It is much brighter than the picture . I hate the laces in the back , they were n't mentioned in the item description , it said low in the back . I think the biggest thing I was disappointed in was the material . It felt cheap and looked poorly sewn . I was just not happy at all with the quality of it . The company that sent it had fast service which is a plus for them but they need to work on their description and pics .
 Cute , but the description doesnt tell you that the back is made into little criss-cross strappy annoying things . Need better photos . Also , if you dont return it ... to be in their hands ... within 10 days of them shipping it to you , you dont get your money back !!
 Loved the robe but the chemise was cut so as not to fit as it should of in a plus size . Very dissatisfied with the product due to this . I will not `` risk '' ordering any more clothing thru Amazon due to this fact . The size indicated was the size my wife wears for everything else she buys but this item appeared to be poorly sized.Sincerely , Larry Buck
 So I bought this for a special occasion a few weeks ago . I had read the reviews and thought that maybe people were just being overly sensitive or critical - that would be a negative , ghostrider . This material is as cheap as it comes , I mean CHEAP , FLIMSY , and UNCOMFORTABLE . I bought the 3x and I 'm NOT a 3x . I 'm a 1x at best and only in the hips and breast area . So I bought the 3x thinking , `` Oh , I 'll have plenty of room and wo n't feel constricted or anything . '' The whole point of wearing something like this is to feel sexy and attractive , right ? Nope . I got this puppy home , pulled it out and instantly regretted my purchase . I thought to myself , `` okay , it 's not the most amazing material but it will do for one-night '' and I proceed to put it on.I kid you not , this thing was skin-tight on me . It was super tight around my chest and breasts , something I wanted to AVOID in a satin chemise as there is NO GIVE at all with material like this . Of course , it was super loose in the waist area and I looked no where near attractive in it . So I took the chemise off , thinking I could pull off a pair of sexy matching underwear under the robe , right ? Wrong again . The robe barely closed around my hips again.At this point I was in tears - I mean , I wanted to look pretty for my boyfriend on our special occasion and was stressing over what I would wear because I was running out of time -LRB- Victoria Secret is a joke if you are a curvy woman and a size 14/16 and I did n't want to spend $ 100 on lingerie from Nordstroms or something akin it -RRB- . I told my mom about my plight , crying because I felt hideous and fat -LRB- you know how us girls can get -RRB- and she did n't understand what I was talking about -LRB- again , she did n't understand because I had bought something two sizes larger than I am and did n't believe it was that bad -RRB- so I had her try on the robe.Now my mom , who is about a size 12/14 , put the robe on and was blown away by how small it was . At most , we estimate it to be an XL -LRB- a normal sized XL -RRB- as sizing goes.So , be warned
 Nice robe , but the gown is just silly . Strappy gown requiring an engineering degree to wear If it were shown in the picture ; I would have passed right on by . Very uncomfortable to wear , and I would not suggest this to anyone .
 The short night gown was poorly cut and badly misshaping ; it 's like a puzzle trying to figure out how to put it on . Then when you do get it on , you 're in a rush to take it off before somebody sees you in that hideous monstrosity . The robe is kind of nice so trash the gown and keep the robe .
 The straps in the back are long and are somehow supposed to go through various eye holes to look like they are laced up or something . This is IMPOSSIBLE to do by yourself and it 's also IMPOSSIBLE to figure out its supposed to look in the end . What on earth were they thinking ? The robe is fine but the babydoll thing is a joke , they dont include instructions on how it 's supposed to go together or look or anything . Very Strange
 I knew this was gon na be cheap and I just wanted the robe , but it was waaaay crappy . I also found it to be poorly sized as according to their size chart I needed a 2X/3X and it just swallowed me . This just sits in my drawer and never gets used .
 The gown seems to run small . I tryed it on and the top was aqward . It did not fit properly on the top no matter how I tried to adjust it .

 Looks like a real nice jacket and I probably would have bought two . But once you put the size in it is suppose to prompt you for a color . Does not . I guess you really did not want to sell any of these .

 I was not pleased when I received this item . Granted , the seller got the item to me quickly and effortlessly , but the product did not look anything like the picture . The shirt was not even the team colors . The lettering looked cheaply done . I do not want to bury this seller , just the item . I just wish there was more of a close up on the shirt .

 Nothing like what I expected . Hate the open back which ties . The material is much rougher and does not have the soft silky feel that charmeus usually has . I did n't like anything about this purchase .
 It is sized at least 2 sizes too small and the material is thin . Definitely for show not for sleeping .
 Uncomfortable and odd shaped . sleeves are too long and the ties in the back are a pain in the butt . : \
 This robe made me look really boxy . its very very VERY short . I ordered a large , which was too large for me in the shoulders but not large enough in the waist ... really strange . The material is very thin , but if the fit was good I would have kept it but it was not flattering for me at all .
 This item had ripped the night I wore it , So dont waer it to bed . I was hoping that the rob would have been longer . But atleast that didnt rip .
 I do n't really like it , but hey I decided to get the cheapest one I saw so u get what pay for
 This robe is extremely short . So much so that it 's not much of a cover-up . However , it is pretty , and the satin quilted hanger that it comes on is almost as exciting as the garment itself . I would have liked it to be longer . The chemise or babydoll fit me very strangely , and I will not be wearing it . I 've worn the robe once or twice , but would get more use out of a longer one . However , it was n't worth returning because it was so cheap that return shipping would eat up most of the refund .
 Would not purchase again the sizing chart is off . The size 40 hip is more like a 35 . The ties in the back are poorly placed causing awkward bulging in the gown .
 did not fulfill my expectations , came across arruagada seems used , is disjointed and pasted.the piece is not the quality expected hope this answer detail thanks
 I love the robe ... but HOW THE HECK DO YOU WORK THE NIGHTY ??? I was so confused ... I will prob wear it only once and then use just the robe because it feels nice . All I can say is ... uuuuuuuuuh wtf .
 the nightgown was odd , so odd wasnt even sure how to put it on , however i did like the robe so i kept that and threw away the nightgown , th e shipping was good
 Cheap material . The night-gown is very odd shaped and doesnt fit well . The robe is huge ! I ordered the plus size and I wear 14-16 shirts and 13 pants . Its not very comfortable either .
 THis looks great but i was really disapointed in the general quality.and the roughness of the cloth ... it seems that this is more ofa costume than an actual item you would wear daily ... kinda like fredricks of hollywood quality vs victoria 's Secret quality .
 I got this for my girlfriend . It was priced cheaply , and Iknow why . It 's made of flimsy nylon like a halloween costume . The seller allowed me a return , but I could n't find packaging to send it back and figured I was n't really out that much . I 'd recommend spending a little more on something nicer .
 The item was sold as a `` Robe set '' . When item was recieved it was under garmet only with out robe . there was no info on how to contact seller . WILL NOT BE BUYING FROM SELLER AGAIN .
 I ordered this robe set in size large -LRB- which is my size -RRB- and I could n't even get the night gown dress over my head and shoulders . The robe fit , but barely , and was very snug . I intended to buy this robe set with included night gown because I 've been in need of one and so I decided to go with this one for my choice but it was not what I expected at all . Also , on both the robe and gown had pieces of thread hanging off different parts like it was quickly made or was made decent but started to fall apart due to bad craftmanship .
 The product was to small . I wear a size 3X and that is what I ordered but when I put it on it was to small and tight so I sent it right back and never heard anything from you -LRB- the company -RRB- again . I do n't think that there is anything you can do now since it has been some time ago . I think you should know and be kind enough to make me the consumer happy I feel I was done wrong and overlooked . I never received my refund or credit to my CC account . I paid alot for that outfit for my account not to be credited.Thank you sincerly , The Forgetten Consumer
 It did n't look great on my body type , which is a longer torso I guess ; it did n't go down long enough to cover the goods . The robe is good though .
 I originally ordered two of these one red one white , I got the white one first and decided to return the red one before I received it . The ties in back are confusing and it still doesnt fit right and the fabric is cheap . Plus I didnt ' think about it before hand but would n't you rather have matching panties than a padded hanger . I should have spent more , you pay for quality I guess . Would n't recommend
 DO NOT BUY ! The babydoll itself is made of a cheap , terrible material and has ties in the back that are awkward and you would need your lover to help you put it on to begin with . Not flattering and not sexy . I threw that part away and have the robe , which is slightly better , hanging in my closet . I got some lingerie as a gift recently from Pamida and that was of way better quality than this and it was cheaper . Just do n't waste your money .
 My first impression was how bold the color was , so far so good . But upon touching the material my positive impression ended . The material feels horrible . I guess you get what you pay for ? I could n't imagine that material against my skin . Secondly , the back of the nighty has this weird cross around tie thing -LRB- notice there are no pictures of the back here on Amazon ? -RRB- , which does make it adjustable but I thought it looked odd . In addition to that in the middle of the back on the lower back there 's another tie which seems might be nice for fuller figured women but it just looks so odd . I returned it , I supposed I 'll need to scout local stores so I can feel the material and see the whole thing before I buy .
 I 'm 5 ' 5 '' and 150lbs , and ordered a large . way too short it did n't even cover my butt , I had plenty of room to wrap it around and the dress fit pretty well other than too short . If your 5 ' 2 '' or shorter this would be a nice set . I just wish they had a size chart with the length on it .
 The fit is all wrong around the shoulders . The robe is pretty unshapely . Material quality and stitching quality is ok .
 So I ignored all the previous reviews , thinking somehow I would know better . The robe is nice , no complaints with that , which is the only reason why I did n't give it one star . The babydoll on the other hand ... I still have not figured out how to tie it in the back . I have purchased plenty of such items in the past , so I assumed the previous posters just did not have a clue . Wow , I was wrong and the one without a clue . This item is confusing and still sitting unused in my drawer . It would have been nice if there was atleast a picture posted somewhere so that I can try to figure this out , but there is not . I bought this as a Valentines nighty , but gave up on it and bought another item from the store that I used the black robe with instead . It is a shame that so far , it has been wasted . Maybe one day I will figure it out .
 when I opened the packaging there was a rip down the side of the night gown . the robe was fine but still disappointing .
 The material is really unpleasant and somewhat stiff , and hangs awkwardly . Also the shape is very awkward . AND the straps of the thing are difficult to handle and create unflattering lines . And you ca n't really sleep in it -LRB- which I know is n't the intended purpose , but , you know . . -RRB- because the straps sort of pull at your back and arms . I would n't recommend it .
 The robe is ok , but the inside outfit was absolutely cheap . The string is hard to figure out and it 's so cheap that the string broke the first time I try to put them on . It was not even sewn on properly and then later on , the second string broke . I never even get to wear them and too lazy to fix a new broken item . Unless you ABSOLUTELY love the satin robe , DO N'T GET IT .
 I was very excited about this item and I was happy to see that it arrived quickly . However , the product is less than satidfactory . The robe is oversized , and i mean HUGE . I ordered this in a large and the robe is at least a 2x . It sags and hangs everywhere on me . Plus the fabric is so wrinkly that not even the iron would press out the large wrinkles . The material is thin and flimsy and is only one sided , so while the outside has a nice , soft satin appearance , the inside feels like sandpaper against my skin . The little tea-towel that came with it is impossible to wear . I 'm a smaller woman with large breasts -LRB- 36DD -RRB- and I ordered a large to accomodate for that , however , this thing squishes my boobs and gaps bigtime at the underarm area . Then there are two awkward sets of ties on the back . Overall , I 'm very dissatisfied with the product .
 Given the price , I should n't be disappointed I guess , but the material was really cheap feeling . Running my hand across it , the material did not feel smooth and silky at all . It almost felt like plastic .
 Before I bought this product , I read all the reveiws about how everyone hated the gown , how it was uncomfortable , and how confusing it was to tie in the back but I figured that everyone was being too picky for the price . That is , until I recieved it and now I understand what everyone else was talking about . The dress feels like you 're wearing a highschool graduation gown that is too small on you , and I even ordered a size larger than my actual size and it was still tight . The fabric is unattractive , and is just mess of wrinkles . The only positive thing I would say is that the robe is alright , but if you 're looking for a cheap sexy sleep outfit , I would n't recommend purchasing this one .
 This is a classic case of getting what you pay for . Item has a stiff plasticky feel instead of feeling like silk as described . Also arrived very wrinkled . Item returned and would not recommend others purchase it .
 Does not iron well at all . Will try the cleaners to see how it will look after that i may have to get another one in a different material
 This is a case with wonderful storage capacity , but poor craftsmanship.I purchased this case back in 99 or so , I loaded it to the gills . Cleaners and patches in the bottom along with a cleaning rod case -LRB- breakdown style -RRB- with all my other cleaning parts . Meanwhile a host of spare parts , and other things went into the top.Within 6 months one of the cheap plastic latches broke . Fortunately none of the other hardware did . However , the cheap plastic that the bottom and top of the case are made of doesnt hold its shape well . The weight of the contents of the case have resulted in bowing of the case in the middle.I can not recommend this product for heavy duty usage . I filled it to the brim and expected it to take it . But if you need something for leisure duty , it will work . If you want a workhorse , keep looking.I gave it 2 stars for the organizational abilities of the top/lid And you can order a mating tray for cleaning -LRB- the red item people are whining about because they didnt realize it wasnt the lower case -RRB- , which is very useful .
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .

 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Just going to list the issues
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 Looks like a real nice jacket and I probably would have bought two . But once you put the size in it is suppose to prompt you for a color . Does not . I guess you really did not want to sell any of these .
 Does not iron well at all . Will try the cleaners to see how it will look after that i may have to get another one in a different material

 I want blue Levis with no fake creasing and wear . It is SO cheesy and sloppy - my kid will break them in just fine on his own .
 Purchased this for my son . Too stiff of a denim even after washing . May return ... not happy with this pair of jeans .
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .
 Do n't buy this ! 2 items broke within minutes of opening the package ! The orange gun and handcuffs , the most essential police tools ! I returned item through amazon prime and was imediately refunded ! Within 3 hours ! Thanks Amazon !
 I was n't expecting super quality but these are below par . The &#34; belt &#34; is too flimsy , I took the accessories off and put them on one of my child 's dress belts just so it 'd be more stable . Overall he is having fun with it but I do n't expect that it will last long .
 This belt , which is way too big for any toddler , is of very poor quality and has fallen apart after 2 months of use . The plastic handcuffs did not survive one day , and the belt itself has separated at the seams numerous times . I have stapled -LRB- ! -RRB- it back in place repeatedly but even the stapled pieces continue to simply fall apart . My four year old son kindly overlooks the cruddy quality , but even he has given up on this item . Problem is , I ca n't find any other police belt online - these morons seem to have a monopoly on the police belt business ! Order this only if you want a disposable belt and/or you have a toddler with a 46 '' waist .
 If I could give minus stars I would . This cost over $ 20 and was worthless . Cheap plastic pieces broke within minutes of being unwrapped . Good news is I found a better one at a DollarTree for $ 1 and the children are still playing with it .
 Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up . He could not wait to get this belt . We had purchased the police uniform earlier . The first time I ordered the belt , it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it . When it finally arrived , he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long . It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it . It is less than 4 weeks old and probably wo n't make it through the rest of the month .
 We ordered this Policeman Belt for our grandsons Halloween costume . He was so excited but when we finally got it in the mail ... WHAT A LETDOWN ! For starters it was missing everything ! There was NO belt , NO flashlight , and NO gun ! All the main goods ... how disappointing . It is not the fact that we wasted $ 14 on this non-sense but now there is not much time to find a replacement . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! I 'm sure you can find better quality somewhere else .
 This product caused nothing but aggrevation for my nephew . It was poorly made and did n't last a day . The belt is much too big for a child and the product design and funtion was poorly conceived . He loves everything `` police '' so this was big disappointment for all of us .
 Good selection of toys included , but not very durable . One of the handcuffs broke the very first day my son started playing with this item . On the other hand , the belt is way too soft to hold all those accessories and does not look like it 's going to last for a very long time . Expected much better quality for the price .
 I purchased this item for my 6-year-old grandson , who wants to be a policeman when he grows up . While the hard plastic items -LRB- baton , fake radio , flashlight and handgun -RRB- were about as you 'd expect , the belt and handcuffs are definitely poor quality . Within an hour , the handcuffs were broken and the belt was falling apart . The holster and the loops for the light & baton were the first to fail . Then the belt itself began to unravel . I 'd gladly pay more for a well-made product . I recommend against purchasing this item .
 The quality of this toy is something I would expect to find at the dollar store , cheap material , cheap plastic . Too expensive for the quality .
 My grandson wants to be a police officer for Halloween . He asked to play with this since it came before his costume and the cheapness and bad quality of this belt did not hold up to a 6 year old for 5 hours . Within that time , it started coming apart . The gromets pulled out and the tabs that held the walkie talkie and flashlight broke . This was not worth the price if your child is going to play with it all the time .
 We purchased this police belt for my son for Christmas - I have to say he loves it , But it is so poorly made . The actual belt is the thinnest fabric . The belt holes have now broken off . The part where you hang the flashlight and truncheon have come apart . All in all it was a complete waste of money . I have now made a new belt for him
 Not mentioned in the description of this product is how it only fits children .

 I like the shirt and it 's design , but unfortunately the latex print is starting to seperate after only a few washes . I would recommend finding one that has a better quality print .
 This bra was great looking and fit nicely when it was new . But I washed it in the washing machine on delicate to get the sizing out -LRB- like I do with all my bras -RRB- and then do n't put it in the dryer just let it air dry . For some reason , the foam padding transforms upon washing and the cup of the bra looks like a it is crazed or cracked all over the place . If you are wearing a thick shirt , it wo n't shoe through , but I 've never had this happen before . If you have to hand wash to prevent it , -LRB- because it gets ruined with machine washing -RRB- , then it should stress that in a big bold warning . I was disappointed too , since I liked the fit and look of the new , unwashed bra .

 The shirt was much larger than I thought it 'd be , which may be my fault for not checking a sizing chart . The image on the back is splitting . Like it gets those cracks that cheap ink produces . I just wanted a sublime shirt . I should 've looked around more
 I actually had to send this back cause of the size . They run really small .
 A great jacket when it was made in the USA . All of Carhartt 's products are no longer union made in the USA . This warm jacket , now leaves U.S. worker 's out in the cold . I love Carhartt but how can we support a company that does not support us , like so many others . Fewer jobs here = 's high unemployment and low wages . Do not buy Carhartt .
 I was enticed by the cute pattern and my love of pink . But this fabric is thinner than toilet paper and it feels so rough and uncomfortable , I ca n't even wear it . It would not be a bargain if it were free , Amazon would be smart to discontinue working with this vendor .

 Julbo makes some great products , some of which I also own , but the Nomad is n't one of them . In this case , Julbo 's engineers designed sunglasses which actually scratch themselves , a flaw which is utterly inexcusable.When the temples are folded inward , as we always do when we put them in the case or our pockets , the temple tips make contact with the inside of the lenses , and as they move slightly up and down , you soon have a line of vertical scratches on the inside of both lenses.This design flaw aside , the Zebra lens is probably the most scratch prone lens that I have ever used.A terrible product !
 It is not long enough for me . Maybe it would work for someone very petit , but I 've used better

 I had a smooth transaction and fast shipment from the seller.The belt itself , however , is of the LOWEST quality !! There is NOTHING `` genuine '' about the construction of this belt . It is made of some cheap fiber material that allowed my buckle to rip the hole out of the belt within the first HOUR that I wore it !! After I realized that the belt was worthless , I ripped it in half with my bare hands!Also , the snaps that make this belt interchangeable are painted black , however , the paint has chipped/rubbed off during the ONE time that I wore it to reveal the brass color of the snaps.Awful , awful , awful !!

 The back and side pieces fit and snap on beautifully . The swivel screen piece , in my opinion the most important piece , keeps popping off . If it does n't fit my Sidekick 3 , it probably wo n't fit yours , either .

 I wear a 7 3/8 PC , this thing does not cover my years completly , pretty much the same as every other negative review.The main problem I have with this is that it looks exactly like the polar fleece they issue you at basic training , and it is , in fact its made by the same company , but the major difference is , IT DOES NOT STRETCH compare to the olive drap that you get from basic .
 The hat is so small that it wo n't even fit my 8 year old daughters head . I was searching for the real thing , but this was n't it . Do n't buy this hat .
 I bought this item but unfortunately it was too big , therefore the &#34; one size fits all &#34; included people with oversized head the shipment was quick .
 When I went shopping for a fleece watch cap I was looking for the same type of cold weather headgear the military issues . The name and images would suggest this item is the same quality as military issued fleece caps , however that is incorrect . This cap fits awkwardly on the head in sort of a square shape due to how it 's stitched , and does n't cover the ears . I guess you get what you pay for . Definitely not worth it .
 these dont fit like in the picture they arent elastic so if your head isnt the right size your head wont look right
 Overall a very poor fit . The hat was far too small and did not extend past the middle of my ear .
 Yes , it was only $ 4 or so , but the hat that came was one of those standard wool knit beanies that are super long and you have to fold up the sides . Funny thing is the outside package label said Rothco Polar Fleece , but right on the inside , through the clear plastic bag , was a huge label tag that said 100 % WOOL.It was n't what I ordered , but I 've decided to keep it as a backup hat for winter use .
 not GI ... this thing covers half of my ears and sits very loose on the head ... spend the extra 6 bucks and get something mil-spec
 The issue with this product is that it does n't cover my ears . I thought it was just the size of my head which in hats I wear a 7 , so I let about five other people try them on and each had the same issue with it not covering their ears .
 As others have mentioned this cap does n't fit average size heads . I wear a 7 1/4 hat and this cap barely goes halfway over my ears .
 Doesnt fit right and my ears are left uncovered . Next time i 'll pay a little more to get better quality .
 Received the cap today and when I put the cap on it did n't even cover my ears all the way .
 If you have a huge head this might fit . I wear a 7.25 hat , and this is ridiculously big on my head . Because it is so big , it allows the cold air to whip right on in , defeating the purpose of wearing something to keep you warm . Nt only that , you look ridiculous . Material is fine , sizing is terrible . One size does not fit all .
 It Is a very small Watch cap . Buying for a child then its a good choice . Not for adults at all !!!!!
 I bought this for the wife and a few black ones for me . They are way to small !! For the money , the material is fine . But they are not even long enough for my 8 year old . Good luck finding something else and I hope this stopped you from wasting money . I am giving them 2 stars because of the prompt shipment . Not worth the hassle of returning .
 The bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all , but either I have a big head or something becuase it does n't cover my ears all the way . As for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine . So I guess if you have a big head do n't get it becuase it will not cover your ears .
 This is like a kids hat , it fits the circumference of my head OK -LRB- 7 3/8 hat size -RRB- , but it does not at all cover my ears . That and the fleece it is made with is very lightweight , similar to what a series 100 would be from Polartec , do n't waste your money IMO .
 I had lost my army issue foliage green PT cap and had bought this as a a replacement . It may look just like the one that the military issued , but it is nothing at all like it . This hat was TINY . It did n't even cover half of my ears , and it was extremely thin . Wind passed through it without even dampening the force . It did nothing to keep my head warmed . Not at all what it is advertised to be and NOT a satisfactory replacement .
 This is hands down the worst beenie I have ever worn . I need to spend more time reading reviews because everyone 's right about them being way too small . Extreme cold weather ? I wore it outside and my head was just as cold as if I was n't wearing anything at all . It 's too thin , it does n't cover the ears , and it does n't really conform to the shape of your head at all . Total , total piece of garbage . I 'm infuriated by the lack of quality in this product .
 This is NOT you 're standard issued GI polar fleece hat . It does not match the issued watch cap you get from the military . It is a different design . The tag on it says one size fits all . It 's a LARGE sized hat .
 Like many other reviewers have stated , avoid this product if you would like it to cover your ears and you are older than 10 . It seems to be a quality stiched product and thats why it receives two stars . Additionaly , like previously stated it is thinner than other fleece caps I have had in the past . Save your money and find one that fits correctly !
 If you have a head three times the size of a normal person , then you 'd be happy with this watch cap . But if you 're like every other average individual , this watch cap is so big it 's pointless to even wear . The Rothco brand fleece cap misinterprets the idea of &#34; one size fits all &#34; by making the biggest size possible . Do n't spend your money on this -- return shipping costs as much as the product so you 'll just swallow the purchase and throw the thing away . Find another brand .
 I give one star , because the hat is completely unusable to me.Doesn ' t cover the ears well and with little movement it starts to lift up . I did n't think i had to read the reviews on a winter hat , but I learned my lesson.I think Most Normal sized Men , will have the same problem , so save your money and keep looking!God Bless
 Seller was fabulous , had item within a couple days of order , cant beat the service . Item itself is fairly shoddy problem with seem at waistband not being well sown and have had to re-sew three rips at seem in two wearings ...
 Looks like a real nice jacket and I probably would have bought two . But once you put the size in it is suppose to prompt you for a color . Does not . I guess you really did not want to sell any of these .
 I would think twice before ordering this scarf . I received mine with a good amount of the beaded fringe missing . very poor workmanship . I also noticed dirt colored blotches in various areas . Perhaps they will wash out perhaps not . Also take notice of the shipping charges . The company is located in Canada and it costs a lot to ship even light things from there .
 I like the shirt and it 's design , but unfortunately the latex print is starting to seperate after only a few washes . I would recommend finding one that has a better quality print .
 The description may say one size fits most but this hat was giant ! Not even with the velcro strap does it fit an average adult 's head . Now I have to pay a ridiculous amout to return it . Not a happy customer ...
 Quality is not what I was expecting from a Quicksilver product . The shirt was thin and cheap , makes a good shirt to work around the house in , just not something I would wear in public .
 I 'm a size 11 . These socks fit great when new . After 1-2 washes , they were snug . After 3-4 washes , I think they might fit my 3-yr-old nephew . I 'd call these a size 5-6 , not 6-12 .
 The three black bands under the ball of the foot wear out really fast and the sock has to go in the trash . I like all my socks to be the same so I buy in bulk and usually just toss all the old socks out . This time I never got around to throwing away the old socks and it 's a good thing , because 12 pair of Adidas purchased while I was buying Halloween stuff -LRB- six months ago -RRB- has become two pair and they 're not long for this world either . I 'm on Amazon to buy replacements , these popped up in the search and I felt compelled to leave a rating .
 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .
 Great product if you like exposure to toxic chemicals ! Why would i keep a product that uses checmicals that cause cancer ? They also do n't say this in the product description but upon arrival i noticed it came with a warning tag !
 Got billed for this product , supposedly got a refund because they realized they were out of stock very much later on -LRB- after assuring me the product had been mailed out ! -RRB- . And now I 'm being asked for a review ? I really do hope I got that refund . Will never order anything from this vendor again . Messed up my Christmas wrapping plans !
 This is a disgraceful garment . I am not kidding when I say that the `` sweater '' is less than 1 MM thick . The best description that I could give you is tracing paper . It is virtually see-through . When I put it on for the first time , all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed . There is also an obnoxious `` Z '' on the left chest area . Very tacky . This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away . Miserable , Miserable purchase .
 the only size i see is 17 - 36/37 . There is nothing said about the availability of smaller sizes . The rating is really not on the quality of the shirt ...
 I like the shirt and it 's design , but unfortunately the latex print is starting to seperate after only a few washes . I would recommend finding one that has a better quality print .

 The Lilyette style # 458 was -LRB- past tense -RRB- an ENGINEERING MARVEL . The Nobel Peace Prize should be given to it 's inventor . I ordered many of them over time and reordered when the old ones wore out , and then one day I saw , `` No longer available . '' I quickly scoured the internet trying to find the last few in a warehouse somewhere , all to no avail . It was the end of an era.Then I was elated when I saw the # 428 in it 's place , which even used the exact same photo to advertise . No matter the change in digit , I thought my prayers had been answered and I ordered 18 of the # 428 bras , so as to not have this happen again , as the 428 was the visual identical bra to the former # 458 . Well sit down for this bad news
 This bra was not true to size . I ordered 3 and 2 of them did not fit . Not big enough around .
 This bra is NOT the Lilyette 458 , it is n't as pretty and it does n't minimize as much as I 'd hoped . Lilyette discontinued the 458 which was a GREAT minimizer with prettier detailing and more lace on the cups . This one is much flimsier , poorly made and my blouses gap open with this one -- the 458 really did a much better job . Bring back the 458 minimizer !! The bra 's elastic started coming loose on about the third washing and it is just plain tacky looking now . This one just does n't cut it .
 I ordered this bra on whim due to the low price . But I was really disappointed when it arrived . The bra was way too big and completely unflattering . The material was very thin . The bra did n't really seem to have much minimizing effect - instead it looks like I put on a `` cone bra . '' I tried it on and immediately decided to send it back . There was no way I was going to wear it out in public .
 This bra has no support and the straps , Oh my god , when u adjust them , they just go back to when they were before !!!! This is the worst bra , I have ever brought in my life , never again will I buy a bra from this maker , because their bras suck !!! Do n't buy , it has no support and very flimsy !!!!!!!!
 I could no longer find the # 458 Lilyette minimizer bra , but the # 428 looks similar , so I purchased it thinking it might be similar , and it was a big disappointment . I would say , unless you are going for the `` rocks in a sock '' look popularized by one of John Belushi 's characters on Saturday Night Live , avoid this bra like the plague . Unlike the # 458 , there is absolutely zero support for the lower half of your breast area so they just hang there without any shaping or support whatsoever . Also if you are a little shy about the outline of the nipple area showing , the fabric of this bra clings like plastic wrap , living nothing to the imagination !
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 Just going to list the issues
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 I do n't know what others are looking for but I did n't find what I had hoped for in these shorts . The fabric is stiff , almost rough rather than supple . The crotch has a 2 - 2 1/2 '' inset that is unsightly and the seam in the back is folded over at the waistband , and sewn down . Poor workmanship . Also , the waistband is the kind used on men 's underwear , which makes the shorts look like an undergarment . Return policy is poor and shipping is high so make sure you are not going to return these shorts .
 I ordered a large which I usually wear and when it arrived , the fit was nothing what I expected for compression shorts so I returned it for a medium and still there 's no compression . I am not happy with them .
 I use these type of shorts for biking . They are OK but will not be getting another pair . This is due to the uncomfortable waistband and they are a bit too short for my needs . A shame because price is better than other brands . It would have been nice if the inseam length was mentioned in the ad . No problems with shipment from this supplier - arrived within a few days of order .

 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .

 The gloves were big enough to fit my grown up hands . Way too big for my 3year old !! Childrens gloves should fit a child !
 These gloves are for adults ... no child hands could ever fit in them . I bought these gloves for my 5year old and it was n't even close to fitting his hands . Not worth the cost . Total waste of money .
 Although we received the gloves in a timely manner , they are way too big for my son to wear . Both my husband and I were able to put the gloves on ourselves . Very disapointing .
 Given that it was very cheap and came very fast ... . the quality of these gloves are so bad ! The fingers are SO spread out so the stitching job was done horribly wrong . I ca n't believe this is for CHILDREN because as an adult it 's big on me ! The wrists are very loose and it 's very plastic-y and uncomfortable . But hey , for a Halloween costume I guess it 's not meant for any other useful purpose !
 Wow I know the package says they are gloves for children , but they 're too big on me and I am in my 30 's . They are far too big for my son . Under no circumstances are these `` child '' gloves . Not recommended that you buy them unless your `` child '' is a teenager on the large side .
 I saw these in a store today , and had my 7 year old try them on . They were way too big and looked silly on him . They were too big for me , even . I 'm coming on Amazon to see if I can find something different .
 This article did n't send . I d&oacute;n ' t know how is this object because never was send to the direction in Florida .
 This item is titled `` Dath Child Gauntlets '' and is supposedly appropriate for ages 3 and up.Well , these gloves are HUGE . They fit a large man . My 5 year old was swimming in them.So , I returned them and the seller had the nerve to charge me for the return shipment because the return was `` for reasons which were not the result of our error `` I 'd say that stating that this product is for a child was a pretty big error!Don ' t buy these unless your child has SUPER big hands !
 Do not buy these gloves for a child . These gloves fit an adult hand . The quality seems reasonable and they 're not wimpy although they 've made of vinyl .
 Got these for my 7 year old to go with his Darth Vader costume ... Out of the box I noticed they were way TOO BIG ! Even though it clearly says CHILD on the packaging ... These gloves fit tightly on my hands , I could use them ... I wear a adult size Medium ...
 I bought these for my son 's Halloween costume -LRB- He is 4.5 -RRB- . They were HUGE ! They fit me and were n't even close to fitting him . So if your child is small , do n't buy these .
 These are not for a child ; these are huge . I should have sent them back . Maybe I 'll have to be Darth Vader next Halloween .
 I PURCHASED THE MOCK TURTLENECKS THAT WERE ADVERTISED AS A HEAVY 7.4 WEIGHT COTTON I ASSUMED THE NECK AND SWEATER WOULD BE HEAVY DUTY ... NOT ... . THE ITEM WAS MORE OF THE WEIGHT YOU WOULD WEAR UNDER A SHIRT AND THE NECK HAD A SAG IN IT EVEN BEFORE WEARING ... VERY DISSAPOINTED
 Ill-fitting , oversized , cheap material . Waste of money.Can buy similar but much better items elsewhere including Lands End.Terrible tailoring .
 Due to a skin sensitivity , I 've had to wear genuine 100 % cotton fabric for years . I can tell almost immediately if some fabric is real 100 % cotton , or not . This fabric feels ok at first , but after a while I start getting a skin reaction.Upon closer examination , true enough , there are non-cotton fibres and other artificial materials that have been inserted into the shirt.There should be a law against these `` Fake 100 % Cotton '' advertising .
 I ordered two shirts . Both arrived over packaged and took two days for overnight shipping.After reading some reviews , I expected something like a Tshirt with a mock turtleneck . The shirt is thicker than a Tshirt . I find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside . I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues . I ordered a medium and this thing is huge . I washed it in hot water , dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big . After washing and drying , I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes ' longsleeve pullovers . The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches . I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing .
 I laundered this shirt once and it now looks a year old . I recommend you find another manufacturer of mock necks .
 I 've worn the shirt just 4 times , and after normal washing it has the dreaded `` bacon neck '' look . The turtleneck looked great at first , but now looks terrible .
 Received the Mock Turtleneck and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shirt until I put it in the wash . The shirt began &#34; pilling &#34; and the color seemed a couple shades lighter than I remembered before putting it in the washing machine . Long story short , I am disappointed and would not recommend this product or brand . The vendor shipped on time but shipping sub-standard products does n't warrant a high rating .

 Do not buy this ! It does n't even come with the same accessories . In the picture it seems cute , but in person it 's a stiff two piece costume . It also runs big and the belt does not fasten . I ended up having to buy amother costume . I know it 's cheap , but it was probably worth even less .
 This product came to me already opened and missing parts . It seemed to have been used . The seller sent me a very long and detailed message on what to do to get my costum issue worked out . It was way too much work !

 We liked the look of this bag but would have liked to seen in in more detail on the site . Such as how the straps attached to the bag ... were they sewen on or attached with plastic or metal fittings . Also it would have been useful to see what the inside of the bag looked like and to know the exact size of the bag . We were looking at using it as a school bag but it was far too small . When ordering from as far away as NZ it 's important so that we do n't have to incur the cost of return postage to get what we actually need . Not encouraging for future purchasings.CheersGillian
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .
 This bag is very small . The zipper does not have the ability to separate - making the bag much smaller . I returned the bag - very disappointed .
 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .
 Do not even try ... horrible costumer service trying to return this item . Finally contacted by a very rude person that kept on lying to me about their attempts to contact me . They finally did once I filed claim .
 I am very unimpressed by this product . Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made . After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 These pants shrunk up 2 inches after only 2 washes . If they would have shrunk in too I could order the next size up , but they did n't , they only shrunk up . And I requested a return and they would n't take them since I had washed them . Horrible customer service !!! I do not recommend this pant or this supplier .

 This is not a compression short . There is no stretch at all to the fabric and it runs a bit small . I was completely disappointed .
 This was on my wish list but unfortunately it fits very boxy around the entire body and is uncomfortably tight around the arms .
 The arm holes are way too small . It looks and feels cheap . The one good thing is that it is thin enough to wear under a dress coat .

 if I have choice not to rate I wont give even a star ! I ordered the coat and others , fews days later , I recevied all of the items I orderd EXCEPT this coat.Then amazon sent me a e-mail written in `` Due to a lack of availability , we will not be able to obtain the following item -LRB- s -RRB- from your order : `` Marmot Men 's Guides Down Hoody , Green Pepper/Midnight Green , Large `` We 've canceled the item -LRB- s -RRB- and apologize for the inconvenience . `` if you dont have the coats , why you sell them ? it 's winter time , I wait for this give it to my father , then after few days waiting , I heve to reorder other for my father , so ridiculous .
 When are you going to ship my order ? I did order two days ago . It is very cold outside . I appreciate your quick response for my order !! Thanks .
 This jacket was insanely warm and I enjoyed it but the feathers were constantly sticking out of the seams . Too bad because it was incredibly warm , like , sweating while hiking in the winter warm .
 The arm holes are way too small . It looks and feels cheap . The one good thing is that it is thin enough to wear under a dress coat .
 This was on my wish list but unfortunately it fits very boxy around the entire body and is uncomfortably tight around the arms .
 This bag looks royal blue to me , does n't it ? Well no , the bag is the size of my head and it 's PURPLE.Luckily my roommate loves purple and does n't mind using a mini jansport so I gave it to her . They should put a better picture up and remind us of the size and how small it really is . They should n't forget to put the word MINI !
 The description says it 's good for small framed people . I 'm short and only require 1 or 2 books at a time in school . This thing is MINI . I can not fit a regular textbook in here let alone wear it . Returned !
 Not at all what I was expecting , would like my money back . The product descriptiong is way of the mark and quite misleading . This is a TINY , good for nothing backpack - will NOT fit a sweater like everyong claims , if by some slim chance they did get one in there , nothing else went in I garentee ! might as well just carry the damn sweater . Product is SEVERAL inches smaller than described - BEWARE
 This backpack is incredibly small . Unless you 're buying it for agirl , age 3-5 yr old , then it will be great . Otherwise , do notorder this . It is quite tiny and not worth it for anyone over 5 yrs . old!I returned it .
 So I bought this item , not knowing the actual size of the backpack . So before i bought the backack i called amazon and asked about it . The man clearly explained that it was a NORMAL sized backpack . So i get the package , late . But no big deal . . I open it up . If you dont know what size it is either , let me tell you . Its about 9.5 inches tall , 6 inches wide . This is smaller than the backpack you 'd see a toddler carrying around . Keep in mind that it was 24 dollars . I called amazon asked for a redund , Sent the package . No refund adter 6 weeks.Happy shopping .
 Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use . .
 It was not as large as it appeared or the measurements indicated online . The fabric was n't a firm or heavy as larger bags . Overall look was a cheap bag , not the same quality as Jansport larger bags .
 I clicked on a picture of an all black bag and all it said was `` black '' . When I received it , it had skulls and roses on it and the description on the invoice said that this was what I ordered . I went back in to see if I had made an error . I went up to the point of checkout and it automatically switches it from solid black to the bag with skulls ! Be careful when you order , double-check the description before clicking checkout . The picture shows a solid black bag .
 the size is perfect but the straps are sooo uncomfortable ... really stiff not padded at all like the pic says ... wish i returned it .
 A lot smaller than I imagined . Was looking for a simple light weight backpack without a million compartment and that was perfect , but way too small . Just did n't work .
 The description says deluxe but it is the economy quality material with painted designs on the shirt . If you 're on a budget , this costume will suffice . I searched the web and found Amazon with the best price for the DELUXE anakin costume and was disappointed that I never got the deluxe as it was advertised . I ended up purchasing the real deluxe Anakin costume from a different site . I was kind of surprised that this happened because my other Amazon purchases have always been exactly what I ordered .
 This Item is nothing like Picture poorly made I could have made a better one myself out of old pillow cases.Not worth the money avoid this item .
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .
 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .
 I am very unimpressed by this product . Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made . After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .
 I just bought this bag from amazon . I am very unhappy with it . The bag had airlift 1.1 instead of 2.1 . The product description with the bag says it can hold laptop upto 14.1 inch . But the product description on this page says 15.1 . I checked it with my 15.1 inch laptop . It does not fit . I am planning to return this item . I wonder they supplied incorrect product information .

 I do n't know what others are looking for but I did n't find what I had hoped for in these shorts . The fabric is stiff , almost rough rather than supple . The crotch has a 2 - 2 1/2 '' inset that is unsightly and the seam in the back is folded over at the waistband , and sewn down . Poor workmanship . Also , the waistband is the kind used on men 's underwear , which makes the shorts look like an undergarment . Return policy is poor and shipping is high so make sure you are not going to return these shorts .
 I ordered a large which I usually wear and when it arrived , the fit was nothing what I expected for compression shorts so I returned it for a medium and still there 's no compression . I am not happy with them .
 I use these type of shorts for biking . They are OK but will not be getting another pair . This is due to the uncomfortable waistband and they are a bit too short for my needs . A shame because price is better than other brands . It would have been nice if the inseam length was mentioned in the ad . No problems with shipment from this supplier - arrived within a few days of order .
 This is not a compression short . There is no stretch at all to the fabric and it runs a bit small . I was completely disappointed .
 Tie was made of an extremely cheap fabric and poorly sewn together . Stitching was horrendous , extremely noticeable and terrible . Silver ? Please . It 's more like a grey , severely lacking in luster and shine . Would not recommend , it was so terrible I actually returned it to the seller for a refund . If I could rate this zero stars I would have .
 These pants shrunk up 2 inches after only 2 washes . If they would have shrunk in too I could order the next size up , but they did n't , they only shrunk up . And I requested a return and they would n't take them since I had washed them . Horrible customer service !!! I do not recommend this pant or this supplier .

 I laundered this shirt once and it now looks a year old . I recommend you find another manufacturer of mock necks .
 I ordered a women 's 2X mock Tneck . It is definitely a man 's shirt . Shoulders are huge and sleeves are at least five inches too long . Will not order again .
 I 've worn the shirt just 4 times , and after normal washing it has the dreaded `` bacon neck '' look . The turtleneck looked great at first , but now looks terrible .
 Received the Mock Turtleneck and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shirt until I put it in the wash . The shirt began &#34; pilling &#34; and the color seemed a couple shades lighter than I remembered before putting it in the washing machine . Long story short , I am disappointed and would not recommend this product or brand . The vendor shipped on time but shipping sub-standard products does n't warrant a high rating .
 I PURCHASED THE MOCK TURTLENECKS THAT WERE ADVERTISED AS A HEAVY 7.4 WEIGHT COTTON I ASSUMED THE NECK AND SWEATER WOULD BE HEAVY DUTY ... NOT ... . THE ITEM WAS MORE OF THE WEIGHT YOU WOULD WEAR UNDER A SHIRT AND THE NECK HAD A SAG IN IT EVEN BEFORE WEARING ... VERY DISSAPOINTED
 Ill-fitting , oversized , cheap material . Waste of money.Can buy similar but much better items elsewhere including Lands End.Terrible tailoring .
 Due to a skin sensitivity , I 've had to wear genuine 100 % cotton fabric for years . I can tell almost immediately if some fabric is real 100 % cotton , or not . This fabric feels ok at first , but after a while I start getting a skin reaction.Upon closer examination , true enough , there are non-cotton fibres and other artificial materials that have been inserted into the shirt.There should be a law against these `` Fake 100 % Cotton '' advertising .
 I ordered two shirts . Both arrived over packaged and took two days for overnight shipping.After reading some reviews , I expected something like a Tshirt with a mock turtleneck . The shirt is thicker than a Tshirt . I find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside . I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues . I ordered a medium and this thing is huge . I washed it in hot water , dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big . After washing and drying , I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes ' longsleeve pullovers . The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches . I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing .

 I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife . She really liked this checkbook wallet . I ca n't recommend it because the money section clasp will not stay closed . If she drops the wallet the coins fall out onto the ground . This is a defective product . The vendor only offers a partial refunds after 30 days and I have to pay the freight to send it back . I am a Prime customer and expect my prime purchases to be handled better than this.I spent several thousands of dollars using my prime account last year . I am not happy with Amazon or with this supplier . Any local shop would given me a replacement or a full refund on the spot . Now I have to jump through hoops trying to find a receipt that was probably thrown away in the Christmas trash and hope they will send me a partial refund that is more than the cost of return freight .
 I 'm so disappointed in this wallet . I really like the design and the material but it 's cheaply made , which I did n't realize until the coin purse completely separated from the rest of the wallet , spilling change all over . This happened after only 6 months of use . I expect a lot more time out of a wallet than that . The design of the wallet is good so I 'm very disappointed .
 Wallet is fine except the clasp for the change or bills pocket , whichever you want it for will not stay closed . I use it for `` paper money '' -LRB- I do n't have a lot -RRB- but it will not stay closed , can not be carefully bent as it will break according to a jeweler friend of mine .
 Too small a waste of money for a ladies wallet.You should not ask for more words that should be up to the customer .
 This was not as described , I spent a lot of money and had to pay a further 21 custom charge for delivery to the UK , I ordered two of these as I had previously bought some when visiting the states and loved it . One of them is totally as described and is brilliant , the other has less card and note slots than pictured.Product is still very useable and better than your average purse but dissapointed that after spending so much money it is n't what I thoughtI am in the process of emailing supplier directly regarding this
 I received this wallet as a gift from my cousin , it is so handy , really liked it , however , I received it damaged . a small section of the leather was torn . Well . . Sorry cousin , had to return it !!
 I asked for this as a Christmas gift and will already be replacing it , because the clasp on the coin purse does not stay closed . I just have to look at it the wrong way and it pops open , spilling coins into my purse . The slots for credit cards open to the left , so if you are right handed you have to turn the wallet upside down to slide them out ... another huge problem . It is cute , nice leather , but totally useless !
 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .
 Fiance got this to go under his tux for our wedding in an attempt not to be nickled and dimed to death any further . Alas , we had to still buy another vest that fit him better throughout his triangular torso and have the seamstress take the buttons from this one and put it on another vest entirely because altering this one would have cost too much or more than the new one which was $ 60 . Tacky metalic belt hinge on the back , not pictured , when pulled -LRB- but unable to secure -RRB- pleats up the back and wrinkles the look . You want a clean backed vestment , than this is not the vest for you . And the sizes run pretty large . Not as form fitting as it might seem in the picture.Otherwise , the tie is fine -LRB- so I have an overpriced tie instead -RRB- , and it arrived quickly .
 Cheap fabric , very shiny , ill-fitting . The only plus of this product was the price . I wound up giving it to a a friend as part of a gaudy halloween costume . Do n't waste your money . Spend a little more and get something nicer .
 I bought this vest for my son for prom . Big mistake . It looks very cheap .
 I ordered this vest in a size 3XL . I 'm a big guy and always wear 2XL clothes , even some XL . I figured this vest would be a little loose , which is what I wanted , but I was completely wrong . The vest does not even fit around me . There is no way this is a 3XL vest . I ended up going to an actual tuxedo shop and got a 2XL vest that fit perfect . Sizing is DEFINITELY wrong .
 I wear 2XL sized clothes , so to be safe I figured a 3xl would be loose and comfortable . I got the vest and oI buttoned it up . It was a bit snug , but thought nothing of it until I sat down and buttons shot across the room . I was embarrassed and unhappy . If I knew how to send this back for a refund I would . The reason it 's two stars is I like the tie , but the tie is not worth the price of the combination .
 Ordered this vest and tie for my older son . It is small and not true to its size . I would order two sizes bigger than what you need .
 I ordered a 3XL vest from this company because my XL vest no longer fit , but the new 3XL one I bought is the exact same size as the XL one -LRB- but has a 3XL tag on it -RRB- . There was no point in sending it back and asking for the a larger one since 3XL is the largest size they have . I do n't know why there is this size discrepancy , but be careful of shopping from this company online , especially if your a big guy like me .
 The adjuster on this vest is very poorly designed . The vest may not fit perfectly thus you may have to adjust it using the strap in the back , however it does not stay or clip in place on your torso and ends up looking bulky . I had to use safety pins to secure it in place .
 I am very unimpressed by this product . Sizing is very small and the product it flimzy and poorly made . After 2 washings it had shrunk to the point where I just threw it away . I would n't recommend this product to anyone .

 These earmuffs were very uncomfortable . The joint where the band meets the muffs digs into the side of your head . They also do n't shape to your head very quickly after unfolding them .
 I guess you get what you pay for sometimes . This I sure did n't , the thin plastic broke before I got it out of the bag good .
 I was so thrilled to find this type of earmuff instead of the ones that go behind your neck since I like to wear them to play golf and the other ones wo n't stay in place during the swing . I bought the more expensive ones thinking they would be better but the headband on my cheap ones never were sharp enough to cut my scalp like this one did . I would have been better off with 3 pair at $ 5 instead of 1 pair at $ 15 .
 I did not see where the genuine sheepskin is on this earmuff ... It looks as cheep as $ 4 earmuff amazon lists . The head band is not comfortable ...
 Earmuffs have a nice feel and appearance , so that 's a plus . They were a gift to an adult , so they were n't abused by someone who did n't know how to handle them , but nevertheless the connecting band broke within 2 weeks of first use . They were given early in December , and were in the trash by Christmas .
 Maybe I have lopsided ears or something , but these things just let the wind get right in . I live somewhere cold where I need good ear protection when I walk to work in the morning , and these things just do n't cut it . Additionally , they 're the roll-up-for-easy storage sort and , therefore , sit on the head quite awkwardly . If you need good quality ear-muffs to use for more than just cute fashion , I 'd look elsewhere .

 Though the socks fit my foot , they tend to fall down inside half of the slip-on shoes I wear with them . I think if the socks had a stronger/tighter elastic band around the ankle , they might work better .

 I was n't thrilled with the fit of this bra . It was stiff and the edges were so pronounced that even my thickest sweater could n't hide them .
 The bra is too &#34; molded &#34; for my taste . The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head . It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups .
 It felt like it was two cups smaller then what I ordered ! So they run a lot smaller . It was also very scratchy/stiff feeling .
 I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it , but this bra is just not as good . The quality is not great ; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff . When I tried it on , the bra separated my boobs very far apart . It made me look like a 1950 's housewife with cone boobs . No cleavage , total separation , very pointy . Just not attractive.As for the sizing , I did n't feel that the cups were too small . I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional . The cups just made my chest look unattractive .
 The elastic used for the band very easily loses it 's elasticity and thus loses shape quickly -LRB- after one wear I noticed the difference -RRB- . For a molded style , this bra loses it 's use after a week . It 's pretty but poorly engineered .

 This is a great concept , but poorly thought out . The rainwater stays inside the umbrella , but because the umbrella frame is made of metal , it rusts and inevitably will break like mine did.This had to have been designed by non-engineers or lackluster ones .
 No drip rain umbrella ? Pah ! The first time I used this feeble device the skies opened , the rain came down and I almost drowned.This umbrella might work in Albuquerque but it failed to improve British weather patterns , to be fair it did manage to keep the downpour from moistening my head.I wonder if the manufacturer has overstated its effectiveness or maybe it is specially calibrated for U.S. weather patterns ... you know , like DVDs .
 I ordered this as a gift , and am very disappointed . The umbrella is not high quality , and the plastic is clear , not black as pictures . They require you to pay for return shipping which would cost almost as much as the umbrella . BEWARE !
 Umbrella arrives at 4pm . By 6pm the cap keeping the plastic no drip cover attached has already disappeared , leaving me with a fine umbrella with an odd looking top . Not exactly what I had in mind . Seems to be a good idea but the quality leaves something to be desired .
 A year or so ago , I discovered the magic that is a no drip umbrella . So , this review is n't so much about the umbrella , it 's about the seller . I specifically ordered a black on black no drip umbrella . What shows up ? A maroon umbrella with a white cover . And it 's for my boyfriend ... Not very happy .
 It took about a month for the plastic sheathing , which comprises the `` no drip '' portion of the umbrella to completely separate from the regular umbrella portion .
 This thing is a piece of junk . It did n't even make it through the weekend after I bought it -LRB- and I live in Socal , where the rain doesnt even get bad -RRB- . It developed 2 different problems : - one of the metal frame things pierced through the umbrella skin when I closed it-it doesnt close and open properly - always gets stuckI 've had much cheaper umbrellas in the past which were a LOT more durable.I 'm returning it

The shirt is thicker than a Tshirt . I find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside . I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues . I ordered a medium and this thing is huge . I washed it in hot water , dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big . After washing and drying , I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes ' longsleeve pullovers . The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches . I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing .
 The camisole came in a timely manner but is not the one pictured . The one pictured has a fleur de lis on the front and fancy lace and stitching around the arms . I received a plain , no name -LRB- there is literally no name on the tag in the back of the shirt -RRB- black tank .
 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .
 This bra was great looking and fit nicely when it was new . But I washed it in the washing machine on delicate to get the sizing out -LRB- like I do with all my bras -RRB- and then do n't put it in the dryer just let it air dry . For some reason , the foam padding transforms upon washing and the cup of the bra looks like a it is crazed or cracked all over the place . If you are wearing a thick shirt , it wo n't shoe through , but I 've never had this happen before . If you have to hand wash to prevent it , -LRB- because it gets ruined with machine washing -RRB- , then it should stress that in a big bold warning . I was disappointed too , since I liked the fit and look of the new , unwashed bra .
 I was not impressed by the quality of this item or lack there of . The eel skin is a bit stiffer than I wanted or expected . Difficult to get cards in and out of .
 Baggallini Complete Cosmetic Bagg - The Bagallini cosmetic bag is not as well made as I would expect from them ! I have three of their other style bags and love them ! This bag 's material is thin and translucent -LRB- not their usual -RRB- , and offers no padding or protection for your contents , which may be fragile . The compartments are not well thought out -LRB- too large -RRB- and are impractical or impossible to access without other items cascading elsewhere out of the bag . Access to some compartments require you to twist sections of the bag upside down while hanging -LRB- very awkward -RRB- . The most annoying aspect of this bag is the single zipper tab , where two would have made more sense . It is difficult to locate and access contents quickly . The hanger is flimsy . Although I love the turquoise color I chose , I would not recommend this bag to anyone !
 The bag as shown has a velcro closure for the handles . No velcro closure . It was advertised as the original Baggalini , but it has less storage inside . The one that was delivered the zipper was ripped on the interior . Save you rmoney , buy something else . I returned it .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .

 Ordered XL , very small XL . would not even button . Sent back . Tie was nice . If your not on the thin size forget it .
 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .
 I ordered this shirt in a medium which is my normal size . The neck on the shirt was much too small for a medium shirt , and it felt like I was being gently choked . So if you really want this shirt , make sure to order it at least a size larger than you would normally .
 The material is EXTREMELY cheap looking and the buttons fell off . I ended up not even wearing it , what a waste !

 This is not a push in decoration kit for kids age 3 and up as the package showed at my local Target . There are no instructions on the package so I did n't know in advance that I would have to DRILL holes in the pumpkin to push the pieces in . The pieces are ROUND BLUNT - safe - ends ... which DO NOT PUSH INTO THE HARD OUTER LAYER of a pumpkin . Your kids will be disappointed that this is n't a fun activity .
 Based on previous Baggallini purchases , I was looking forward to receiving this organizer . However , when I opened the packet , my first questions were
 I expected a nice sock that will keep my feet dry and comfy all day . Not this sock . You can feel the seams on the toes . They are not soft . They do not keep my feet dry.I might send them back to the company since they have a 30 day guarantee . I would recommend trying Smartwool . They are a far superior sock .
 Although the size was supposed to be X-large , they were very small ! They were way to small for me and I just wear a size 10 shoe .
 For the price I expected a good quality sock . What I got was a padded sock that does n't stay up . Very dissappointed .
 This shirt ran very small ! If I had not gotten it for a clearance price I would have returned it . The material is nice but buy a size larger than you need .
 I do n't like to write bad reviews but I must on this one . Extremely difficult to untwist . Not sure if this will ever be used .
 They are almost impossible to put on . I ca n't get them uncurled , and the adjustment does n't stay the way I put it . I regret buying them because I 'll never be able to wear them .
 They work OK for a while , but it wo n't take too long before they break . They very cheaply made , which is to be expected for the price . The band is plastic , and the point where they connect to each ear muff is plastic and not very sturdy . After some use by the kids opening them up and putting them on , the plastic connection that snaps into place loosens up , and will continually come apart . Since they 're adjustable enough to get more than one season out of them for the kids , we 'll look for a better quality pair next time .
 Product is too small ; no way to tell this from the ad before I bought . I would like to return , but to & from postage is more than the product !! I should have talked to the vendor about the product before ordering . I assumed -LRB- bad thing to do ! -RRB- it would be big enough - never assume - classic case of `` let the buyer beware ! '' I certainly share the responsibility for getting something I ca n't use , but I think the vendor should have had a better description - dimensions , how tight the connecting band is - or how big a head it would comfortably fit . On the positive side , delivery was quick , & I got just what I ordered .
 These ear muffs were nearly impossible to get `` open '' ... that is , they come folded up on itself , and to unfold them to get them on , it took about 10 minutes ! -LRB- really -RRB- They just snapped back into a bundle , the plastic headpiece was so stiff . Once opened up , it was a real struggle to keep them that way just to get them on my head , they kept folding up into a tight bundle again . The ear pieces are nice and warm and confortable , but the plastic headpiece is NOT ! The two adjustable pieces stick into the scalp and are really uncomfortable unless you have something else on your head under it . Plus the headpiece is smooth and slippery so it tends to slide off the head . They were inexpensive so I will not return them but they are not very user friendly , especially in the beginning when they do n't want to open up and the ear pieces keep rotating around ... It was almost comical trying to just get them on my head !!!! If they came with a soft user friendly headpiece I would recommend since the ear pieces are pretty warm once you actually get them on !
 http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&asin=B000632S9M&ref_=oh_rev_o01_s00_i00#Have to say this order bummed me out . Specifically ordered these as over the head muffs and got a pair of the sucky behind then head ones instead . These were for a costume , really sucked that we couldnt get what we wanted and it would cost more than they were worth to ship back . Sucked !!
 The Band is extremely difficult to untwist . I added this in my cart and within a week I see that the price went up from $ 5-6 to $ 10 . I thought ok I will buy it anyway , I was thinking it will be easy to twist it and place it in my purse when I am not using it . But trust me it 's very difficult to untwist , and sometime I just feel like it 's about to break when I am trying to untwist it.You are out cold and this thing just takes forever to adjust , I can say for my experience I am going to buy another regular one .
 They are not very comfy or user friendly . It took me 10 min just to figure out how to put them on . I would look for something else .
 They were very cheaply made , Thank goodness they were just for little girls , I would have been embarrassed if I 'd have ordered them for a gift for someone.I know I should n't expect alot for $ 5. , but I 'd have thought they 'd be better than they were .
 I was very disappointed when I opened the package from GemAvenue . Here 's why :1 . The ear muffs are of a very LOW Quality . Hardly worth the $ 14.99 GemAvenue -LRB- e4hats -RRB- charged me for it . $ 0.99 would have been a fair deal .2 . The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite `` second hand '' feel to it . It reminded meof opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store !!! No Joke . In fact there were no tags on it at all toinform me of where it was made , what it was made of , washing instructions , etc. it did not even have thename of the manufacturer !!!! 3 . The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure . Adjusting the width wasnerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it ! 4 . The `` wool '' -LRB- ? -RRB- had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it . Furthermore it was sparse and flat ... . NOT warm and fuzzy . Idoubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue . Besides , there was no tag to indicate thatit wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester .5 . I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely , so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my earswarm at all.IN CONCLUSION , this product is NOT NEW , NOT SOFT , NOT WARM , NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN !!! What more can I say ? I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue -LRB- e4hats -RRB- for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK !!! I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue -LRB- e4hats -RRB- EVER again !!! Adding some comments to my previous review
 I still have not received this item and am wondering what in the world is going on !
 The headpiece is cheap plastic , not soft on the ear . Would return , but , will keep and wear only in an emergency .
 While they are very warm , they are very difficult to untangle each time you want to put them on and if you move a lot they will try to slip off your head and roll up in to a little ball again . I would not buy these again .
 The ear muff 's band is plastic and difficult to adjust to your head size and the second time I used them the plastic broke . I give them no stars.Ear Muffs-Black W20S35A
 I never got my earmuffs . I paid $ 6 for them , and $ 6 for shipping . After putting in the exact address I receive my bills to , my tax returns and have received countless other packages to , the sender sent the shipment , said the address was invaild and the package was returned to them . There was no effort to contact me regarding a possible mistake on the information provided . The company would only refund the earmuffs , so I ended up eating $ 6 . Never , ever use this company . Quite possibly the worst customer service I have ever used .
 I bought a pair of ear muffs . I 'll never do that again on-line . They looked and sounded -LRB- from item description -RRB- well-made , but when I got them I could n't wear them because they had rough edges that cut into the top of my head . Just very poor manufacturing ! I would definitely never purchase such an item from this manufacturer again .
 i thought these were very scratchy on the skin that made me not want to where them again : -LRB-
 I originally ordered these shawls for my bridesmaids on May 10 . The shipment came relatively quick ; however out of the 4 shawls I ordered , 3 of them arrived dirty and/or damaged . I emailed the seller to inquire about the return policy and was promptly told to send them back and include a copy of the email for their records . I sent the dirty shawls back and repeatedly inquired about the status of my return . I never heard back from Choosy Shopper and it was only after leaving negative feedback and emailing again through Amazon that I finally received a response about my replacement shawls . At this point I was ready for a refund ; however it was too late since Choosy Shopper had already sent my shawls out . They arrived today -LRB- postmarked with the date I notified Amazon of my bad experience -RRB- and they were all clean . The shawls are soft and thin but will work perfectly for a summer wedding . The vendor , Choosy Shopper , I will never buy from again . All I needed was for them to tell me that they received my return and would be sending the new shawls shortly and I would have been a satisfied customer -LRB- even with the shawls arriving dirty in the first place -RRB- .
 This costume is very cute but I was disappointed for many reasons . The skirt is definitely not as long and full as the picture shows . We did fluff it up after shipping , stretched out the tulle , but still no where as shown on the picture . The size is VERY small . This wo n't fit my 3 year old at all . Sizing on the packaging would have been helpful if it was listed on the amazon listing . Probably would have helped me decide on what size to buy . It will fit my 2 year old . The arm holes are VERY small and tight . I do n't know what 3 or 4 year old could have worn it . I had to take it to a person to cut the elastic and re-sew the arms just to fit my 2 year old . The workmanship is very poor also . The seams around the crotch area are all crooked . Definitely not top-notch product here . It 's fine for dress-up around the house .
 Do n't spend your hardened money on this . I bought this pair for hunting trips , but after to machine wash it start folling a part like a piece of the paper . There quality going down to the gator .
 I am not nearly as pleased with my recent purchase of the moss &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; as I am with the brown &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; I have purchased in the past and have worn almost daily for three years . Although the description of the material seems to indicate that both pants are essentially cut from the same type of cloth the moss dungarees have a light weight feel in relation to the brown . I ca n't explain it . In addition the dye has faded/washed out in places on the moss giving the pants a tie-dye effect over the legs of the dungarees . The legs also have annoying creases approximately one inch from the sewn seams . These phantom seams were visible when I received the pants . -LRB- The phantom seams are the type most people have experienced in a least one pair of denim jeans . The type of seam you do battle with after every washing in the hopes that it will somehow disappear -RRB- . The dungarees also have noticeably more loose/dangling threads compared to my brown dungarees . All in all , not very satisfied . I will continue to buy the brown dungarees as long as the quality does not decline and I am able to stand in front of them before I make the purchase .
 I purchased these because of the extensive history I have with wearing carhart clothing . Currently I am furious that I have to contact carhart because on the three pairs I purchased all three pairs have stitching errors so badly that they are falling apart at the seams literally . i am severely irritated not only because of this problem but then I find out this product is made over seas and not here in the USA . Shame on you carhart .
 I have ordered these twice now , double front dungaree , black , 32x32 and both times I have received pants that are marked 32x32 but are 32x34 ish . I wear carharts 5 days a week for work and have about 9 pair . All are the same size , 32x32 and the inseams measure 32 . The first pair measured 34 second pair measured 33.5 .
 In my first attempt I thought I ordered wrong . After reordering I ordered a 34w x 31L and my confirmation email said I ordered a 31x34 which is what happened the first time ! I am not sure what is going on but I they are shipping right away and the first time I was only allowed a refund and not an exchange :-LRB- 80 bucks in limbo : -LRB-
 Carhartt makes the best , most durable work gear I have ever used but PLEASE , pay a few more bucks and buy them somewhere else , I ordered two pairs from here on May 13 , 2009 . It is now June 3 . In fact , it 's almost June 4 and they just shipped them today . They have had my money for almost a month but I still do n't have their product . If I had known it would take them a month to get the product to me I would have happily gone down the street and paid a few dollars more to actually have the product in hand . Do yourself a favor and do n't lend these people your money , interest free for a month.Carhartt Double-Front Work Dungaree Pant - Men 's
 Though this is a bathing suit , I use it as an underwear . I got the medium one -LRB- my hipsize is 36 -RRB- which fits very well for me . Nice to have one or two . Like the blue one very much
 Bought 2 one these , one for a friend . Mine died after 4 uses and hers after 2 . Thoroughtly disgusted with this product and would not recommend it to anyone .
 Cheaply made , designed with a self-destruct fuse that permanently kills the unit the first time it senses the unit is hot . Might fail your first use , might last up to a dozen uses , but it 's designed to fail pretty quickly . I 've bought at least three dozen of these various places during my years of constant travel , and they all fail , no matter how religiously you obey the instructions , do n't blame yourself because THEY ARE DESIGNED TO FAIL.I just think of them now as disposables . If one lasts two uses , I 've broken even vs. the price of a cup of coffee . If it works the third time , I 'm ahead in savings and convenience ; if it lasts a fourth use , I 've doubled the price I paid in savings over room service/Starbucks . Like other reviewers I 'd gladly pay much more for a reliable product that does its simple job without self-destructing , but quality US immersion heaters are no longer made . Another industry sold off to China.One alternative if you 're going to Europe/UK
 This travel immersion should is very dangerous and should not be used or sold . When our heater arrived , there was a notice that indicated that the heater was made in china , it contains lead , and you should wash your hands after using it . We were going to use the heater to heat coffee or tea while on travel so you can imagine our surprise . If I could give this less than one star I would definitely do that ; I am really surprised that Amazon and others are selling this dangerous product . If you do n't take my word for it , buy it for yourself and you will see .
 I fly a lot ... I 'm an airline pilot . My daughter gave me this heater as a most welcomed birthday gift . I followed the attached directions yet it inexplicably failed to work after using it only 4 or 5 times . i was stymied trying to determine how an object so simple could suddenly stop functioning ! Coming here to read online consumer comments in a quest to find a replacement led me to learn of its design to fail . Save your cash . I wish I could find a portable alternative .
 Took this gadget on a 10-day trip and it burned out after 7 days . Very disappointing .
 It died on my second trip ! I was not impressed . I should have returned it but had no time to do that .
 It never workedI need to send it back and try another oneI had one before and it worked great !
 The whole point is to boil water , to have HOT water -- but this only gets to 180 F maximum , so I returned mine
 On my first overseas trip with my immersion water heater , it warmed one cup of water and never worked again . It now is in a Brussels landfill . Ca n't recommend it !
 I am extremely disappointed with this product . The plastic clip broke the second time I used it . It heats water , but it takes a long time -LRB- greater than 5 minutes -RRB- to heat an 8 ounce cup . I do n't recommend the product unless you want to overpay for a device that marginally works and is cheaply constructed .
 Item works great but did n't last very long . I brought it in February and it was dead by May . Amazon nor going in style would replace the item .
 I 've purchased two of these and both went dead during first trip they were used .
 This is a cheap product that broke as soon as we took it out of the box
 This did NOT work at all . I sent it back and never got a refund . Do n't buy it .
 Do n't trust the picture . When worn properly , this holster puts the handle of the gun toward your back , so that it ca n't be drawn from the holster without doing some strange contortions . It should have the grip facing foward , along your left side , to be drawn easily with the right hand , but they designed mine so that the grip protrudes behind you where you ca n't reach it with either hand . It does n't work for costume purposes . The only way to get the gun to face the right way is to wear it on the right side -LRB- putting the straps across your chest instead of your back , obviously wrong and stupid-looking -RRB- or wear it inside-out with the the fake leather on the inside , which looks even worse .
 I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design . The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses . I own several Speedo swimming trunks , this one is the worst . If the band can be improved , I will rank it at least 3 stars .
 Paid for expedited delivery , and it showed up four days later then anticipated .
 This product is made very cheap . It rolls , bunches and feels ucomfortable to wear . The `` athletic supporter '' part is so far off center you can use it as a pocket instead . Do not buy this look somewhere else ...
 I ordered a medium because I had planned to use this tank during workouts and wanted a bit of room . Unfortunately the medium is more like an XL and because it 's so big it gives off a `` boxy '' look . I am a bit disappointed .
 I got three of these in different colors , because I just needed some basic tank tops for running . Not in love with them ; the quality does n't seem great , and the fabric is kind of stiff and scratchy . I did n't get around to returning them , so I suppose I 'll wear them , but I should have just gotten some Gap body tank tops .
 Just rec 'd - fabric is stiff , rough & somewhat transparent . Heavy weight ? Give me a break ! However , at this price plus cost of return shipping , I 'm gon na keep it and wear it for household chores such as cleaning toilets or kitty litter boxes . This fabric is cheap cheap cheap - if it was used for prison uniforms , it would be considered `` cruel and unusual '' punishment !
 no , I hated it and the only reason I did n't return it was that it was so inexpensive -LRB- and cheap ! -RRB- that it was n't worth the bother . It was very stiff and uncomfortable against my skin . A big disappointment . I threw it away -
 I bought this shirt for my horse and he hated it . I tried and tried to get him to wear it but he kept saying it was too tight . Anyway , I 'm going to try a different color .
 An adult XL should equal a Ladies 18 , and this was more like a Juniors XL so I could not wear it . I ended up having to put something together at the last minute . Could n't return as it was Halloween so I am stuck with a costume that does n't fit . Ellen
 This is the most poorly sized costume I have ever encountered . The sizing chart is not at all a decent guide ; if it were accurate this costume should have been too large for me . I went up 2 sizes so I could layer clothes underneath and it turns out this just barely fit me without the layers . The arm holes are very small in diameter and if you have any sort of muscle tone it will be too tight . The bodice is not true to size , more like 1 1/2 to 2 sizes smaller than the listed garment size . This will not fit tall women unless you are rail thin and have a small bustline . Length is great , material and design is great too . It would be a great costume too bad the sizing is inaccurate .
 The size was way off very thin -LRB- cheap -RRB- material for the price.over priced priced their should not be a word number required .
 It looks very cheap . I bought it for my grandson 's christmas present . I wanted to return it , but there was about an $ 8 shipping cost and a r 20 % restocking fee . I felt I already had too much money in an inferior product .
 I returned this item 2 days after receiving it with a confirmation saying you received it and have never been credited back to my account ?
 I expected more with such a high price . It held up for about six hours before it was ripping apart .
 I had reasonable hopes for my floral sarong , and was thoroughly disappointing upon its arrival . The first thing I noticed was that there was a strange , crumbly substance stuck to large areas of my sarong -- it very much resembled dried food waste . If that was n't disgusting enough in itself , the fabric was flimsy and cheap . As I went to wrap it around myself and tie gingerly , there was a very audible tear , and my husband -LRB- who was n't even in the same room as me ! -RRB- stopped what he was doing to voice concern about it . The colors -LRB- blue/gold -RRB- were much duller than as pictured , which I could have lived with if the material was of a good quality -LRB- and for $ 12 + shipping , why is n't it ?! -RRB- . The only thing that did n't go wrong was the shipping , which was , in fact , faster than I expected . But overall -- what an absolute disappointment ! I am such a mild person who rarely has anything negative to say , but I must state that I would NOT recommend this product to anyone .
 I expected more with such a high price . It held up for about six hours before it was ripping apart .
 I have no complain about the product but the Amazon Packing looks to me that is a joke , they pack it in a ver , very big box and I had to pay extra because of this .
 Waited two weeks for my order to ship but finally received an email that there was a delay that would take ANOTHER week to ship . I cancelled my order and ordered a North Face Shifty . Cost more but received the bag two DAYS after i ordered it . Would n't recommend buying this bag . two thumbs down .
 Finger Pull broke -LRB- with-in the first month , -RRB- this is the metal part of the zipper , that should not break for a long time.My Grandson is very disappointed he had the best looking bag in school .
 JanSport has been the leading brand name of backpacks and bags in schools all over the U.S. for a long time , and this product looked like it would live up to the hype of JanSport -LRB- unfortunately , I did not carry JanSport backpacks during my childhood , so this would be my first overall JanSport bag . -RRB- Online , it looked promising as a replacement laptop bag . Of course , you ca n't accurately measure the product without a hands-on approach , and you ca n't always use the reviews of other customers who bought the same product to back your decision up -LRB- i.e. they might be using it differently , it might fit them differently , etc. -RRB- I took all things into account when purchasing this item.Packaging was way too big for the bag , and a flap was open . It did n't look like it was broken in to , but it 's still a safety concern . The plastic bag that sealed the bag had a hole the size of the product tag . Amazon provides a lot better than this , although the flap opening might have been done by UPS . I 'm just glad to point it out to them.The bag itself ... I currently have a Targus CityGear laptop messenger bag for 15 '' laptops . It 's more than 5 years old and still works , although it 's got wear and tear , which is why I even pondered getting a new bag . The Elefunk -LRB- stupid name -RRB- has a lot of handy pockets . Handy is not the same as convenient , however . Here 's some custom problems for this bag for my purpose . - PROBLEM 1
 I thought that this bag had more substance to it , and that the material would be thicker . It feels too flimsy for its size so that it ends up not holding its shape very well and tends to sag like a hammock . It is really much longer than you would need for books and notebooks . The flap is a bit long and makes access a little difficult . I prefer a bag that you can set down , and that provides more structure . I also think the lack of support causes the bag to pull on your shoulder quite a bit . In all it was too big and floppy for me .
 Be careful when buying this bag . It is much larger than it appears . I was looking for a bag to use for college for carrying around my books , and when I got this I was very disappointed . It is extremely wide , and I 'm not sure what kind of textbook or laptop would be that wide . It would not be suitable for easy , on the go , carrying or biking . Be forewarned .
 I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it . Problem is it 's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag . This is not what i really imagined to get .
 The material for the body of the bag is very thin and I 'm worried it wo n't last me through the school year . It 's not a comfortable fit with the weight of my texts no matter where the straps are adjusted . I admit it looks really cute and you ca n't beat the price , but if i were to see that bag in a store where i could touch it and feel the material , i would not have purchased it - even despite how inexpensive it was .
 Purchased it for junier high school student . it 's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be . Overall , it 's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you do n't like it after receiving . Will not buy those bag anyway .
 I bought this backpack for college and after 9 months it tore in three places . Terrible quality . I paid 5 Bucks to mail it in for repair under warranty and after two months with no responce I called and found out that they wo n't fix anything because the damage happened , `` as a result of normal use , '' ... well is n't that exactly why companies have a warranty ? So that if the product you buy from them shows manufacturing defects that become evident through normal use the product is replaced ? This company is a joke and only profits on the fact that they have huge name recognition , but this product was of very low quality and the warranty is a fraud .
 I purchased this , thinking that it was hot pink , but to my surprise the backpack was a unexpected salmon color &#34; pink . &#34; Do n't be fooled by the description -LRB- Pink Prep -RRB- .
 I got my first JanSport backpack when I was in elementary school , and it lasted until my senior year of high school . A while later in college , I decided to buy a backpack , and naturally went for another JanSport.My first disappointment was that the backpack was n't a true navy color -- it 's dark blue , not navy . That I could live with , however . The drastic decrease in quality was the biggest disappointment . Within months , the backpack had small holes in it . I bought this size because I 'm an English major who rarely has textbooks to carry around , so I was n't even carrying anything heavy or sharp . After roughly a year of use , the backpack had several good-sized holes in it.The straps also began to come unattached from the top of the backpack ; the fabric started to fray terribly , and by the week , the straps came off more and more . I was perplexed , since I 'd carried much heavier things in my older backpack for much longer . Before I 'd even had the backpack two years , one of the straps had almost completely come off . I sewed it back on using heavy duty thread , but within a couple of weeks the stitches no longer held because the fabric had frayed even further . I did n't have much choice but to replace it.The last thing is , JanSport backpacks are no longer machine washable . I threw my first backpack in the washer dozens of times . With this one , I had to try to hand wash it if it got a stain on it . Backpacks get enough use that they should really be machine washable . And they should be much more durable than this one was .
 The backpack shown in the picture is not the same as the one delivered . My daughter was quite disappointed . The one delivered is a cute backpack , but not what I thought I was ordering . The one pictured has bright purple ; the one delivered has very dark purple that is n't noticible . The one pictured has purple straps at the top and on the bottom of the shoulder straps . The one delivered has all black ... So , the only things purple on the one we got are the zipper pulls . By the time we got it we were afraid if we sent it back , my daughter would not have a new one by the first day of school . So , we added our own purple to it . I 'll think twice about ordering from here again .
 My kids have used JanSport backpacks in the past and we have n't had a problem with them . However , I ordered this one in the beginning of September . My daughter has used it for about 2 weeks and it has already ripped . I am very disappointed in JanSport .
 I bought this backpack for my 12-year old Goddaughter who was visiting from Brazil . She wanted this particular brand because it happens to be in fashion down there . However , I fail to understand why it costs so much considering the poor quality of the material and the overall product . I can buy a much much better backpack , padded , strongly made and with lots of compartments making it much more useful , for a lot less money . I think the product is way overrated and unless your kid wants it for the `` fashion '' aspect of it , I 'd look for something else of better quality .
 the straps would loosen by itself when carring the bag on your back ... . i dont like it . Also the material is flimsy . but we all know that jansport lasts long ...
 I could n't believe it was a jansport . It is the sorriest excuse for a backpack I have seen in awhile . More like something from the K-mart bargain basement . Would definitely not suggest buying it .
 Very disappointed in this backpack . My daughter was happy with it , but myself as a mother knows that it will last no longer than a couple of months . There is absolutely no lining within the back . Fits all her books though she says ...
 This was supposed to be large enough for an adult . It 's really meant for a Jr. . High school student . A waste !
 This is n't really worth the price . Based on strength and utility alone , I 've seen cheaper backpacks at Wal-Mart , etc. that far outshine this little thing . This is really quite small , do n't let the big numbers fool you.I guess I could suggest this for elementary schoolers , but as a college student this really does n't work for me . I remember carrying even more books in high school , so yeah , that 's out too . When you get this , you 're really just paying for the name brand . They pocket the difference by sacrificing quality .1 . Smaller than it looks .2 . Very thin fabric .3 . The joke they call ` padding ' does n't keep the sharp edges of any book from sticking into your back .4 . The straps feel very weak , and I do n't feel comfortable carrying all my books in it .5 . The backpack has a tendency to ` slide ' down ; the buckle does n't hold the straps well , so the nylon slides past it and causes the straps to loosen against your will .
 the shoulder strap is already broken and it has only been 6 weeks . its a weak backpack , considering that i put it to gentle use
 I saw this bag well displayed with multi-divisions -LRB- sections -RRB- and got attracked to it because that was what I wanted but to my surprise , is far from what it was displayed . I am very much disappointed , it will not serve my purpose and I hate it that I do not even know what to do with it . it was totally wrong product display .
 The shipping time is ok , but the color is totally wronge . It is impossible to carry the kind of color to outside .
 It is REALLY FRUSTRATING ... I ASKED FOR WHITE/SILVER STARS , it seems to be a problem with the product , they sent me the WHITE/SILVER TWINKLE STARS one ... I purchased it in amazon ONLY because I needed SPECIFICALLY the WHITE/SILVER STARS in the RIGHT DAY ... This order was time sensitive , anyhow everybody can make mistakes , so I called to let them know that It was wrong and they told me that they will fix it , they will not make the same mistake they will resend the backpack ... . they ask me to send it back and they sent me `` THE RIGHT ONE '' but today -LRB- 24 days after -RRB- I got in the mail AGAIN THE WRONG BACKPACK ! ... Not to mention the other hydration pack that I bought in the same order that got lost in the mail ... I just want to place the complaint , I feel really frustrated and do n't want to hear again a customer service representative telling me that `` he assure me this will not happen again `` My recommendation
 Jansport has really gone downhill in the past 10 years . It used to be that the top 3 brands were Jansport , Eastpak , and High Sierra . Now Eastpak only deals with the european market . High Sierra has gone into uber industrial -LRB- non casual -RRB- backpacks that are a cross between urban and hiking . And Jansport still produces casual school/day treker backpacks but unfortunately the quality has gone down a lot . They do n't produce the leather/suede bottoms anymore . Now , the bottoms rip and wear out more easily and the entire fabric is a lot thinner and cheaper . I compared one I purchased last week at Staples to one that I had 10 years ago and the one purchased recently will probably wear out faster than the one 10 years back . That 's a little ridiculous . You can really feel how thing the fabric has become , it 's sad . I do n't think they 're even produced in the US anymore , probably China . They 've made no changes to it besides putting some padding in the back . But it 's really lost the appeal that it once had . I ca n't believe you could walk into a Walmart , Kmart or Target and find wall to wall of quality Jansports with leather bottoms and now the closest thing you can get is this piece of crap . Thanks Jansport , maybe in 10 more years you 'll reduce down to a burlap sack or a coffee bean bag . BTW , the jansport I just purchased has been returned .
 I purchased this product for my 1st grader . He liked the design ; I liked the Jansport brand -LRB- I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy -RRB- . Well , the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material . The backpack was so lightweight that my son 's water bottle could put a hole through its side . The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results . In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home . I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off , and he reassured me that it was a genuine product . Although I could n't believe him completely , the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack .
 The color of the real thing is dark gray which is very ugly . And I have tried to return this item , but I failed because UPS did come to pick the package in three days . And I am leaving in two weeks so I am afraid I can not get the refund at that time so I gave up to return this item . This is an awful experience !
 This product is cheap and the stitching was all over the place . It was made overseas and it shows . I will never buy from this company again . It 's doubtful this thing will last 3 weeks as it 's so thin and flimsy . I would like to warn anyone who is considering buying one of the Jansport bags online . Go to a store and look at it first and buy it there . I would have never EVER bought this bag if I was able to check it out first . Either way , it made my 7 year old happy , and i 'm sure she will be upset that it has torn up within a month . Buyers BEWARE .
 I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
 From the description '' ... giving it enough space to store two to three textbooks , a large binder , two to three spiral notebooks ... `` Not sure what textbooks and notebooks these guys used to measure it , but my daughter had to pack 2 middle-school textbooks , 1 binder and 1 spiral notebook and they would not fit . We had to go and buy her a different backpack .
 I bought this backpack for my son for his freshman year of high school . He came to me two days later and told me he had too many things from his classes and they would n't all fit in this pack . Together we tried to make room for everything and were able to squeeze it all in . However , the backpack started coming apart at the seams a week later .
 This bag was going to be for me to use at college , and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that . It is more made for elementry to middle school kids . So luckily I have a little sister to give it to , but otherwise , I 'm pretty disappointed .
 I really like the color and it is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion . I 'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size or something but it is really small . It looks like a first graders back pack , not one for a college student .
 So i bought this backpack because I needed to keep my books somewhere so I could carry things in my hands . I am 17 and a senior in High School . I ordered on the 21st or 22nd of December -LSB- I know I got the rest of my items before Christmas -RSB- and got the bag on the 6th of January . which was a drag.I got the bag at the material is pretty lousy , the straps are stiff and worst of all ... its really small . I am 5 ' 7 '' and this bag looks like a little kid 's backpack . I just got ta say that if you are older than 10 or 11 , find a new backpack or you will just look like a grown person who stole some little helpless kid 's backpack .
 I bought 3 of these to replace worn out back packs . I thought they would be great quality , but from the appearance they look no better than the ones they already had that fell apart after 3 months . I was really disappointed by how thin they are .
 It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it . I think it is not good for a child . Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke !!!
 For the quality and size of this backpack , it is way overpriced . I can buy a large size gym bag for the price of this backpack .
 Finger Pull broke -LRB- with-in the first month , -RRB- this is the metal part of the zipper , that should not break for a long time.My Grandson is very disappointed he had the best looking bag in school .
 I have no complain about the product but the Amazon Packing looks to me that is a joke , they pack it in a ver , very big box and I had to pay extra because of this .
 Waited two weeks for my order to ship but finally received an email that there was a delay that would take ANOTHER week to ship . I cancelled my order and ordered a North Face Shifty . Cost more but received the bag two DAYS after i ordered it . Would n't recommend buying this bag . two thumbs down .
 I thought that this bag had more substance to it , and that the material would be thicker . It feels too flimsy for its size so that it ends up not holding its shape very well and tends to sag like a hammock . It is really much longer than you would need for books and notebooks . The flap is a bit long and makes access a little difficult . I prefer a bag that you can set down , and that provides more structure . I also think the lack of support causes the bag to pull on your shoulder quite a bit . In all it was too big and floppy for me .
 Be careful when buying this bag . It is much larger than it appears . I was looking for a bag to use for college for carrying around my books , and when I got this I was very disappointed . It is extremely wide , and I 'm not sure what kind of textbook or laptop would be that wide . It would not be suitable for easy , on the go , carrying or biking . Be forewarned .
 JanSport has been the leading brand name of backpacks and bags in schools all over the U.S. for a long time , and this product looked like it would live up to the hype of JanSport -LRB- unfortunately , I did not carry JanSport backpacks during my childhood , so this would be my first overall JanSport bag . -RRB- Online , it looked promising as a replacement laptop bag . Of course , you ca n't accurately measure the product without a hands-on approach , and you ca n't always use the reviews of other customers who bought the same product to back your decision up -LRB- i.e. they might be using it differently , it might fit them differently , etc. -RRB- I took all things into account when purchasing this item.Packaging was way too big for the bag , and a flap was open . It did n't look like it was broken in to , but it 's still a safety concern . The plastic bag that sealed the bag had a hole the size of the product tag . Amazon provides a lot better than this , although the flap opening might have been done by UPS . I 'm just glad to point it out to them.The bag itself ... I currently have a Targus CityGear laptop messenger bag for 15 '' laptops . It 's more than 5 years old and still works , although it 's got wear and tear , which is why I even pondered getting a new bag . The Elefunk -LRB- stupid name -RRB- has a lot of handy pockets . Handy is not the same as convenient , however . Here 's some custom problems for this bag for my purpose . - PROBLEM 1
 I only buy Ekco shirts & they are high quality . This shirt is plain butt ugly . Pink & blue stripes in different directions & the size is a xxl not a large . Ekco shirts are larger than normal due to rap style size but this is crazy . No wonder on sale .
 the straps are unevenly sown -LRB- one is higher that the other -RRB- making for uneven adjustment points , yes i get technical but this is suppose to be Jansport ! Also the straps get loosened too easily . I dont like it but gon na have to deal with it .
 This backpack was way too big on me for being a smaller girl and was n't comfy whatsoever . It just looked and felt awkward . It does carry a lot of things but I did n't like it and sent it back . It was pretty true to color , just not the one for me .
 This pack is over-priced . The design is nothing special and materials quality is poor . The zippers are particularly low grade and will be short lived . Not a good value .
 The straps on this backpack are too wide -LRB- almost twice as wide as my old COMFORTABLE Jansport -RRB- and cut weirdly into my neck/shoulder . Without even putting anything in this backpack it hurt me to have it on -LRB- I guess it hit a weird pressure point in my neck or something -RRB- . From reading other people 's review it must be a great backpack to some people , but to me it was awful . Sure , it looks cool , but I 'd much rather be comfortable than cool . Also it seems to be much more cheaply constructed than my old Jansport . I bought one in 1998 , and the material just seems thicker than that of the new Jansports . Also , the zippers on this pack seem to catch the inner lip easily -LRB- A problem I did n't have with my old Jansport -RRB- . Because of all of this I 'm returning my backpack and looking for a new one AGAIN .
 I have always had great experiences with JanSport , but not with this bag . Yes , there is a lot of space , but i find myself digging into the pockets just to get my cell phone or my ipod out for my daily commute . I also love red backpacks , and I loved how vibrant the color was on the Amazon page . I was extremely dissapointed when the bag arrived and it was more orange than red . The straps are also rubbing up against my neck and the plastic clips that hold the straps in place are to easy to adjust . Meaning , if i hit them by accident when taking off the backpack it messes up the settings . My old JanSport was also made of thick , durable fabric , this is like waterproof , windbreaker material with annoying zippers .
 This is a horrible item , I bought it for 30.00 because I need to wear it for a strapless dress . It not only did n't stick well , I could n't even hold it up . Do n't even think about cleavage , it 's not strong enough to hold it up . Also the cup was not big enough to fit . Now I 'm stuck with a 30 piece of garbage I will never be able to use anymore .
 What a disappointment.I reccomend that you save your hard earned money and simply buy a $ 0.79 cent roll of adhesive tape from the local chemist .
 The Nubra Feather-Lite is the worst bra ever . It 's not `` freedom and movement . '' I 've worn it once to the movie theater . Never again ! When I put it on , I was very aware of it sticking to me . The silicone cups allow no air circulation so I was sweating and the Nubra was coming off . The front closure would n't stay closed . I could n't move much for fear of the Nubra falling off . I resorted to sneakily squishing it against my chest to try and make it stick.The worst part is it looks bad . It 's not `` smooth and invisible under sheer clothing . '' The top and sides of the cups created an obvious outline under my shirt that did n't even look like the bra-line of a normal bra . You can see why in the picture ; the edges jut out . The cups create an unnatural shape . The cups should start very thin at the top and sides and get gradually thicker . Then , the Nubra would seamlessly fit , like an extension of the body . It does n't . It looks off .
 I purchased a C cup which was really like a AA cup . To send it back , you would have to pay 10 % , so you would n't get a full refund ... and you have to pay shipping . So it would not benefit to send it back at all . So I bought the bra and can not use it . Not happy .
 What a waste of money . This bra gives no lift . This bra does n't give nice clevage . This bra is not comfortable . This bra 's cup size was too small , though it 's my normal cup size . The only thing this bra did was cover my nipples . Do n't waste your money .
 A D-cup ? Really ? I read that these bras run small , but this is ridiculous ! I gave the product two stars because of its excellent sticking ability , but what good does that do me if the bra does n't fit ? I 'm a large C , so I ordered the D. I think a D-cup would fit a woman -LRB- or an unfortunate man -RRB- with no more than a B cup . It barely covers my nipples . What a waste of money .
 I bought this after my Un Bra went missing , which I LOVE . This version is twice the price and is simply not made to fit the standard width chest . Its too narrow , only covering an inch or so outside the nipple . The result ? No support at all . Its like putting a napkin over your chest . In comparison , the Un Bra actually cups your entire breast making you feel less naked .
 I bought this adhesive bra and am not sure if the manufacturers have ever seen a D cup breast . When I got the bra home I was so excited to try it as I was planning on taking it to go beneath my little black dress while in Paris . Boy was I disappointed to see that the cup barely even covered 1/4 of my breast ! I thought this product may work well from A/B cups so I had my daughter try it who was also disappointed . Although the cup is small , if all you are looking for is a little something to cover the nipples -LRB- and only the nipples -RRB- this would probably work well .
 if you 're a 38C as I am , forget it ! Total waste of money , for something that only covers your breast nipples .
 This was something that I thought sounded great!When It arrived , I tried it right away . It does not work at all for as it is not wide enough when clasped to cover the sides of my breasts . Perhaps I should have gone with a B instead .

 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I bought this because I could n't find my fleece scarf that keeps me warm . I bought the grey and it looked nice but it was just surprisingly thin . It almost felt like if I pulled hard enough it would separate and create a hole of some sort . Luckily , I found my fleece scarf so I no longer need this one . The thing is , it has got to be cold outside for me to think about wearing a scarf in the first place . If it is cold enough that I will put up with the inherent hassle of wearing a scarf , then this scarf just does n't have the warm factor that would make me think , &#34; hey let me choose the grey scarf today now that it is cold . &#34; I gave it two stars because if I lose my fleece scarf again , I can wear this scarf and block out some chill . Also , it is soft .
 Am getting ready to return the ear muffs . The first time I put them on one of the ear muffs popped off and could not be replaced . In addition , there was little to no flexibility to the plastic band to which they were attached .
 The &#34; adjustable &#34; earmuffs were way too tight ! Not only too tight on on my skull , but they were almost impossible to even open to put on my head . I returned them .
 My wife ca n't get the earmuffs on by herself . I can get them on her with a struggle . Hopefully as time goes on the plastic band will not be so curled up tight and relax .

 Ummm , i might have read the description of this cover faceplate , but its not an actual faceplate , its a sticker . and it dont fit correctly . i tried to put the stupid sticker on and it was not good . I actually threw it away immediately ! Man , why a stinkin sticker ?

Also , it is soft .
 I order the blue color and it came in a horrible purple color
 My husband got this for me for my birthday because baby blue is my favorit color . I was so upset to see light purple when Iopened the box !
 I ordered these shorts according to the `` russet '' -LRB- brown -RRB- color that is shown in the image provided on their product information screen . Instead , I received shorts that are the most hideous olive green imaginable . Subsequently , I am not a satisfied customer .
 The jacket itself was very nice , but the size was completely off . I purchased an extra large and it was hanging off of me ! I think purchased a large , but the company mailed me the wrong jacket and i was then informed that an exchange could not be done because the maker no longer had the product . Really a big disappointment .
 I bought this because I could n't find my fleece scarf that keeps me warm . I bought the grey and it looked nice but it was just surprisingly thin .

 i received this bag in a very old condition shapeless and with tarnished buckle and clasp i was totally disappointed that they sell such worn out products to customers .
 I would not have bought this product if I had chance to read the reviews before I purchased it . The product came out to be an old and over-priced purse . The zip button looked very old even it seem never been used . I strongly recommend everyone to think over before purchasing .
 This bag never got delivered and when I contacted DHL they said it got deliveried to the Post Office and the Post Office said they deliveried it . But the receiver never got the package . . I am currently out of the country and have no access to a phone to get in contact with any customer service . DHL said they ca n't do anything . I have never had a problem with Amazon and I would really like to get this matter cleared up . cuz it was expensive !!! Thanks
 I bought one of these as a gift 12 years ago and the recipient loved it and it held up all of this time . So when he wanted to replace the original , I ordered an identical one . However , it did not say this in the description , this one is made in China and the original Italy . I realize a lot of manufacturing happens in China , but this should have been made clear in the product details so the consumer knows what they are purchasing .
 This top has a very awkward fit . I do n't know how to describe it but it 's just one of those tops that looks like it has different features sized for different people ! Or maybe it was just with my size -LRB- M -RRB- . I do n't wear it much .
 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .

 First off they are pretty good looking shorts , but at $ 33.95 we want more . The problem is one of my pet peeves typically found in cheap shorts , the pockets are extremely shallow . When sitting stuff falls out . You may lose your pocket knife and keys and phone and other valuable stuff . . every time you get comfy . Secondly , the cinch rope at the waist is short ! I guess it would be a perfect length on shorts with a 32 inch waist , but on my 42 '' it 's a joke . Rope is cheap adding several inches to the shorts so the thing can function would cost almost nothing . Also the overall length of the shorts is very long . On my 6 ' 1 '' frame they hang to several inches below my knee . Almost capri length . So . . in my opinion keep shopping .

 I am big fan of Prada bags , but this bag is very disappointing ! Firstly , the bag is too small and it does not sit up straight . The handles are too heavy for the body of the bag !! The only plus point I like about this bag is the various colours it comes in !
 I ordered this bag and was thrilled with the fast delivery and overall appearence of the bag . After a few weeks the bag began to unravel at the seams , and I am very disappointed with the quality , and expected more from Prada . Also there was no dust bag included .
 I have a big head and this hat is so tall that if I pull it down on my head all the way it covers my ears . This would only fit a conehead .
 this cap is too tall to sit well on your head , it goes way down to your ears , do n't recommend this , they only have one size ...
 Horrible hat . The photo is misleading . Everything about this hat sucks . It is made of some kind of foam crap on the front . Avoid at all costs .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 The orange astronaut outfit is very cute , but came with black stains on it and the zipper broke the first time my son wore it . We did not return it because we needed it for a costume that day .
 I was dissapointed with the quality and fit of he costume . For the high price , it is very poorly made with cheap , flimsy material , broken straps and strings commimg out of the fabric . I had to return it paying for shipping twice , costing me over $ 15 . what a waste of time and money.I realized that there were two -LRB- or more -RRB- costumes , being sold under the same description , from different sellers , that were of better quality . Since they all have the same picture attached , it is very difficult to know which one is the good one . I finally ordered it from a warehouse who has a great return policy , and I could take it back with no questions if I did not like it . This one was good quality and is a keeper !
 I 've seen these TYPE suits in stores and they are extremely cool - authentic-looking , and very much coveted by little boys ! Also , typically overpriced for a kids ' jumpsuit , cool theme or no , at around $ 55 . So , I thought I 'd found the same suit at simply a more fair price . Wrong ! Instead of heavy cotton fabric as it seems to be in the photos , and the more expensive brands are , this brand is made from slick , neon-orange nylon fabric , with a MUCH smaller gauge zipper . The waist elastic is not adjustable and fits too snugly even though my little boy is very slim . It was also sewn off-center so the suit is always a little twisted to one side , and generally the quality of the stitching is poor , with lots of loose hanging threads . It also seems to be a little small for a size 8-10 . For a kid who loves costumes and will wear them anywhere , 24/7 , I expected he 'd only be removed from his astronaut jumpsuit just long enough to bathe ; however , the texture of the fabric and the awkward fit seem to make it uncomfortable for him and he does n't wear it too long . He was so excited to receive it that I do n't want to take it away from him and return it just because it does n't match the more expensive versions , but I would not recommend the product even if it were less expensive than it is .
 We had similar problems with the zipper that other users have noted - the teeth would no longer close properly after the very first time we zipped/unzipped the costume for my daughter to try it on . I contacted the seller for a replacement , and they apologized and told me they had been previously unaware of the problem but had since heard from multiple buyers experiencing the same zipper malfunction . I was offered a partial refund if I wished to keep the costume and replace the zipper myself or a full refund if I wished to return it . We opted for the partial refund as the zipper was a very simple replacement to make , due to the suit 's construct .
 The material is fine for indoor use . The teeth of the zipper , however , came apart the first time the suit was zipped , and continues to do the same . Unfortunately , the plastic wrapping the suit came in was discarded , so I can not return it for exchange . At this point , the suit is useless .
 I purchased the item for my son for Halloween . The item is described as Boy 's size 4-6 . My son is 5 and he is considered small -LRB- about 3 ft and 2 inches tall -RRB- for his age but the suit fitted him just right . There is no way any six year old boy could have fitted in that suit . Secondly , the zipper was broken the moment my son put the suit on . The item is definitely not quality made .
 Zipper broke the first time my son tried the costume on . He still wears it but only for short times as it get very hot -LRB- like wearing a plastic bag -RRB- . Its a reasonable facsimile for the price .
 The quality of the costume was very poor . It tore when we only started to put it on my son . I will be surprised , if you have not heard this from other parents also . My son is turning 3 and is very slim for his age , and could not wear it even once . We had ordered for his birthday , but the stiching in this dress disappointed us . I feel manufacturers should get this costume checked by their quality department and pull this item off the shelf , until that is fixed .
 The hat was delivered quickly and is what it claims to be . The only issue I have with it is that I look an awful lot like Elmer Fudd when I wear it.Robert M.
 I purchased these because of the extensive history I have with wearing carhart clothing . Currently I am furious that I have to contact carhart because on the three pairs I purchased all three pairs have stitching errors so badly that they are falling apart at the seams literally . i am severely irritated not only because of this problem but then I find out this product is made over seas and not here in the USA . Shame on you carhart .
 I have ordered these twice now , double front dungaree , black , 32x32 and both times I have received pants that are marked 32x32 but are 32x34 ish . I wear carharts 5 days a week for work and have about 9 pair . All are the same size , 32x32 and the inseams measure 32 . The first pair measured 34 second pair measured 33.5 .
 In my first attempt I thought I ordered wrong . After reordering I ordered a 34w x 31L and my confirmation email said I ordered a 31x34 which is what happened the first time ! I am not sure what is going on but I they are shipping right away and the first time I was only allowed a refund and not an exchange :-LRB- 80 bucks in limbo : -LRB-
 Carhartt makes the best , most durable work gear I have ever used but PLEASE , pay a few more bucks and buy them somewhere else , I ordered two pairs from here on May 13 , 2009 . It is now June 3 . In fact , it 's almost June 4 and they just shipped them today . They have had my money for almost a month but I still do n't have their product . If I had known it would take them a month to get the product to me I would have happily gone down the street and paid a few dollars more to actually have the product in hand . Do yourself a favor and do n't lend these people your money , interest free for a month.Carhartt Double-Front Work Dungaree Pant - Men 's
 I am not nearly as pleased with my recent purchase of the moss &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; as I am with the brown &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; I have purchased in the past and have worn almost daily for three years . Although the description of the material seems to indicate that both pants are essentially cut from the same type of cloth the moss dungarees have a light weight feel in relation to the brown . I ca n't explain it . In addition the dye has faded/washed out in places on the moss giving the pants a tie-dye effect over the legs of the dungarees . The legs also have annoying creases approximately one inch from the sewn seams . These phantom seams were visible when I received the pants . -LRB- The phantom seams are the type most people have experienced in a least one pair of denim jeans . The type of seam you do battle with after every washing in the hopes that it will somehow disappear -RRB- . The dungarees also have noticeably more loose/dangling threads compared to my brown dungarees . All in all , not very satisfied . I will continue to buy the brown dungarees as long as the quality does not decline and I am able to stand in front of them before I make the purchase .
 Do n't spend your hardened money on this . I bought this pair for hunting trips , but after to machine wash it start folling a part like a piece of the paper . There quality going down to the gator .

 I was hoping it would be soft and fit comfortably as the other hat I bought from Peter Grimm . It did not , so I can not wear it . It is too small and gives me a head ache.The other hat I wore for 6 years and was comfortable from day 1 and up until it wore out.I really hate I can not wear this new hat , seems as though it is made from concrete ,
 The size 5 panties are too small to fit on people who wear standard size 5 panties . They are meant for narrow-hipped -LRB- under 34 inch hip size -RRB- individuals . I am having to throw the product away after purchase .
 Ca n't recommend these . Laundered once and they shrank so much I can no longer use . Makes you wonder if these manufacturers who go overseas also suspend quality control .
 I gave them one star because theres no provision for -0 - . Legs too small , butt too big . Material is soft but too many negatives .
 I just received my coat today . I have not used it yet and I 'm debating on whether to return it . The material looks nice and waterproof and comfortable , but the workmanship is terrible . The pockets have big holes in them . I put the coat on and decided to put the hood in the pocket for safekeeping . The hood fell right to the floor . Upon further examination I notice big holes in each pocket . The way the holes are set up , it looks like they were put there on purpose . I ca n't imagine why except that maybe they want to play a mean trick on you . Imaging putting your keys or cell phone in your pocket while on the trail only to find them gone at the end of the ride . Also , upon further examination , I saw that the collar was not sewn on completely and is already coming apart.The picture shows the rider 's legs all covered and comfortable , but in reality , you would have to sit on the coat to get that effect . My friend 's raincoat wraps over the horse 's rear end covering both your legs and the horse . I guess if you do n't care about soaking water into your saddle , it does n't matter , but it is deceiving .
 This pack is very cumbersome to get into . And I found the inside of it to be too small and divided up while the outside seems large . It is well constructed however , just did n't work for my needs .
 The flap hat was too small for one size fits all , it did not fit . I purchased and style of flap hat at the same time and it fits fine .

 the q-ty of the product in which i purchased recently is not very good . some part of the frame color has gone
 This was advertised as the most popular nursing gown , bra-less but with some built in support . It had no support , and if I chose a size to fit my breasts , the rest of it looked like a deflated hot-air-balloon . Very oddly constructed , and certainly not enough support , even light support for night wear .
 Did n't really care for this nightgown . Wish it would have been more flowy instead of spandex . Did n't open so easy for breastfeeding either .
 I ordered two nightgowns , same size , same color , a few weeks ago and only one arrived . There is no indication the other item is on back order . I 've been calling for over a week , trying to get through to someone , but there is noone available to accept calls . You are put through to a machine , to leave a message , and noone returns your call . I 'm very disappointed and wonder if it 's a matter of neglect or if I 'm being ignored purposefully . This company lacks responsibility and integrity . Deal with them with extreme caution .
 I received the night gown , tried it on , and actually hated it . The built in bra was loose , as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top . The straps are too wide . The rest of the gown was okay , although it too seemed too drapey and long.I sent the gown back 3 weeks ago , now , and have STILL not received a refund . I am very disappointed with the whole transaction/product .
 I bought this gown and the robe -LRB- Aimee Gowns Robe -RRB- at the same time , and I was surprised and disappointed about how different the fabrics were . The robe is soft and drapey and comfortable ; the gown is thicker , stiffer , and somewhat scratchy because of the fabric 's bulk . I do n't recommend this product at all . As soon as I started nursing and my breasts became tender it was unbearable to wear this garment . I wish they used the same fabric they used for their robes , because the cut of the gown is fine . It 's just awful fabric .
 My husband bought me two nursing gowns for Christmas . Not only was the package shipped late , but only ONE gown arrived . They now refuse to return emails and phone calls . What company takes a customer 's money and then runs without delivering the product ??? We 've called numerous times with no response . What a nightmare ! Would NEVER recommend this company .
 I wore this nightgown once . It is too hot due to the thick material . This is not a good thing postpartum because you get hot and sweat a lot when you sleep . The biggest problem is that it is simply a low v-neck gown . It is impossible to take a breast out without taking down the shoulders and I can do that with a regular nightgown . I also purchased an Expressiva gown at the same time and like that much better . It is also on the warm side , but it has slits for the breasts and is easy to nurse without getting half undressed .
 I first really liked the gown that it 's convenient . But after a few washes in gentle cycle , the gown visibly shrunk , and it gets worse after each wash . Now the bust area is way too small to cover anything when I turn from side to side in my sleep everything falls out !! I ordered size small even tho I 'm normally a size xs . Would have to find another gown .

 I bought 6 pair , with the intent of wearing a different pair to work each day , Monday thru Saturday . I bought these in December . This means that I wore each pair about 6 times thus far . I have had to throw 4 individual socks away from total rips . I have three others with holes already . As for the rest , you can barely tell that they are even socks . They are completely stretched out , and look like an overused dog 's toy ... The name is very fitting !!!!

 The bag is OK , although I do n't like the handle . There was no supporting documentation to guarantee its authenticity so I wish I could just return it .
 I pay for my buckle and I did n't get it were is it . ?? I want it I pay for it ...

Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 I just received my coat today . I have not used it yet and I 'm debating on whether to return it . The material looks nice and waterproof and comfortable , but the workmanship is terrible . The pockets have big holes in them . I put the coat on and decided to put the hood in the pocket for safekeeping . The hood fell right to the floor . Upon further examination I notice big holes in each pocket . The way the holes are set up , it looks like they were put there on purpose . I ca n't imagine why except that maybe they want to play a mean trick on you . Imaging putting your keys or cell phone in your pocket while on the trail only to find them gone at the end of the ride . Also , upon further examination , I saw that the collar was not sewn on completely and is already coming apart.The picture shows the rider 's legs all covered and comfortable , but in reality , you would have to sit on the coat to get that effect . My friend 's raincoat wraps over the horse 's rear end covering both your legs and the horse . I guess if you do n't care about soaking water into your saddle , it does n't matter , but it is deceiving .
 Do n't spend your hardened money on this . I bought this pair for hunting trips , but after to machine wash it start folling a part like a piece of the paper . There quality going down to the gator .
 I am not nearly as pleased with my recent purchase of the moss &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; as I am with the brown &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; I have purchased in the past and have worn almost daily for three years . Although the description of the material seems to indicate that both pants are essentially cut from the same type of cloth the moss dungarees have a light weight feel in relation to the brown . I ca n't explain it . In addition the dye has faded/washed out in places on the moss giving the pants a tie-dye effect over the legs of the dungarees . The legs also have annoying creases approximately one inch from the sewn seams . These phantom seams were visible when I received the pants . -LRB- The phantom seams are the type most people have experienced in a least one pair of denim jeans . The type of seam you do battle with after every washing in the hopes that it will somehow disappear -RRB- . The dungarees also have noticeably more loose/dangling threads compared to my brown dungarees . All in all , not very satisfied . I will continue to buy the brown dungarees as long as the quality does not decline and I am able to stand in front of them before I make the purchase .
 I purchased these because of the extensive history I have with wearing carhart clothing . Currently I am furious that I have to contact carhart because on the three pairs I purchased all three pairs have stitching errors so badly that they are falling apart at the seams literally . i am severely irritated not only because of this problem but then I find out this product is made over seas and not here in the USA . Shame on you carhart .
 I have ordered these twice now , double front dungaree , black , 32x32 and both times I have received pants that are marked 32x32 but are 32x34 ish . I wear carharts 5 days a week for work and have about 9 pair . All are the same size , 32x32 and the inseams measure 32 . The first pair measured 34 second pair measured 33.5 .
 In my first attempt I thought I ordered wrong . After reordering I ordered a 34w x 31L and my confirmation email said I ordered a 31x34 which is what happened the first time ! I am not sure what is going on but I they are shipping right away and the first time I was only allowed a refund and not an exchange :-LRB- 80 bucks in limbo : -LRB-
 Carhartt makes the best , most durable work gear I have ever used but PLEASE , pay a few more bucks and buy them somewhere else , I ordered two pairs from here on May 13 , 2009 . It is now June 3 . In fact , it 's almost June 4 and they just shipped them today . They have had my money for almost a month but I still do n't have their product . If I had known it would take them a month to get the product to me I would have happily gone down the street and paid a few dollars more to actually have the product in hand . Do yourself a favor and do n't lend these people your money , interest free for a month.Carhartt Double-Front Work Dungaree Pant - Men 's

 The waistbands on some of the pairs I own have rolled down , and no amount of ironing seems to be able to straighten them out . Oddly , this seems to affect the blue and gray pairs . Of the four black pairs I bought , only one has this problem . I also had a seam fail on one of the eight pairs I bought.I have since bought some boxer briefs from Nordstrom that have held up much better , with no rolling in the waistband . I 'm going to start replacing these Calvin Kleins with Nordstroms . Maybe not as chic , but it 's better than having a rolled waistband digging into your hip .
 Comfortable only for the first wearing . The waist band on these rolls very easily and then even repeated washing , and ironing ca n't take the roll out . Otherwise , well made and they tend to wear well .
 Men here is a tip . If you want to please your lady , use a sexy thong instead . We love how a man looks in a thong .
 THIS PRODUCT WAS FLIMSY . NO ELASTICITY WHAT SO EVER . YOU 'D BE BETTER OFF BUYING A LEOTARD OR BATHING SUIT . WHEN I PUT IT ON IT FELT LIKE I HAD ON A CAMISOLE . IT DID N'T GIVE ME ANY SUPPORT WHAT SO EVER .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .

 I am very disappointed with these bags.The duffles I bought 5 years ago are made of thick cordura with beefy fittings -LRB- they still serve me well -RRB- . The new bags are about twice as thin -- on everything including the fabric , the strap , the handles , and the buckles . One of the plastic fittings broke on the first day . The only `` improvement '' I see is the needlessly rubberized label that says `` built to last a lifetime . '' Uhmm ... I do n't think so . Please bring the quality back !
 Very cheap fabric , without support on the handles . If you are any Good at packing the bag wont be able to hold the weight.But the bag looks like it is rugged . I did not look at the engineering until mine tore .

 The item that was pictured had black trim but what arrived has white granny panty trim . It looks terrible but because it does n't fit either , it does n't matter . The top is way too small and the only way to adjust the fit is to widen the front tie which in turn leaves your breast exposed . If you have smaller than a C boob it may fit you .

 If you 're looking for a costume that 's even remotely pseudo-nice , I would not recommend this one.As others noted , the skirt and turtleneck are both made of the same hideously lousy thin felt . -LRB- So thin that I could see the outline of my bra through the loose shirt . -RRB- The fabric feels uncomfortable against my skin and is probably going to be pretty hot . The costume does n't even have hems . The edges are left raw , but since it 's felt there 's unlikely to be any raveling.As others also noted , this costume does not come with the knee socks , nor do there appear to be any knee socks made to wear with this costume but purchased separately . You 'll have to hunt those down on your own.The glasses have tinted lenses which I was unable to pop out of the frames . This makes the overall effect a little less accurate . The hair is attached to the wig in strips with a good inch or two in between them , so &#34; bald spots &#34; will be more or less unavoidable . There is barely any stretch to the elastic around the edges of the wig cap , which seems oddly small anyway , so you 'll have to do some major pinning to keep it in place.All that said , I was expecting poor quality , so I 'm satisfied with my purchase . My own haircut looks like Velma 's , so I do n't need the wig , I know where to buy good knee socks , and I can live with the tinted lenses . Since the fabric is so cheap , I will not feel at all bad about distressing it . I got this costume to be Zombie Velma for an event that will likely destroy the costume by the end , so I do n't want to take the time to sew my own . If you 're looking for a DISPOSABLE Velma costume , this will do nicely .
 They were made for someone with a gigantic belly and no hips or seat . They fit terribly . Very uncomfortable . Not made for women . Made more for men with beer bellies .
 I really like Alia slacks . They are true to size and easy care . The pants that arrived were of some different material -LRB- micro-fiber -RRB- and looked like rags . REALLY DISAPPOINTING . The micro-fiber pants do n't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist is n't as comfortable either . I sent them back for a refund .
 I have a flip flop necklace from years ago from Avon , ive been trying to find one like it since . Came across this one . Ordered the white , but it has a yellowish tint to it . Does not look white . And the chain is very short . meant for kids . And I have to break the chain to get the fip flop off to put it on another chain . I wont buy another one again .
 Was way smaller and tighter then it looks . I 'm a size 10 and got an XL and it was still too snug . Works great under a t-shirt , but alone , not so much !
 cheap cheap cheap ... VERY thin would never buy again ... Men 's Powder Blue Dress Shirt w / Convertible Cuffs sz 17 1/2 34/35 ... ca n't recommend ! ~

 The plastic is very soft and the hinge area broke within 10 minutes of opening the package . They are cute but be warned they are not likely to last very long . I guess for $ 5 with free 2 day shipping I should have expected them to be crappy .
 Bought for a 4-year old as a toy . It looked great and fit great , but broke the first time he played with it . The hinges are made of really cheap/weak plastic .
 These glasses broke within a week . My 7 year old was not being rough or hard on them . A very cheap product . Save your money .
 Although my 6-year-old looked adorable in these glasses and the quidditch robes , they broke the third time he took them off his face . We tried to repair them with super glue , but they kept breaking -LRB- in different spots around the glue -RRB- .
 These glasses are a waste of money . They are sized to fit a child but not made to be handled by one . My 5yo child had them out of the package for no more than 30 seconds when one of the temple pieces broke at the hinge . While trying to repair them with superglue the other temple broke at the same location . They are made poorly and I would n't bother .
 I have a flip flop necklace from years ago from Avon , ive been trying to find one like it since . Came across this one . Ordered the white , but it has a yellowish tint to it . Does not look white . And the chain is very short . meant for kids . And I have to break the chain to get the fip flop off to put it on another chain . I wont buy another one again .
 They were made for someone with a gigantic belly and no hips or seat . They fit terribly . Very uncomfortable . Not made for women . Made more for men with beer bellies .
 I really like Alia slacks . They are true to size and easy care . The pants that arrived were of some different material -LRB- micro-fiber -RRB- and looked like rags . REALLY DISAPPOINTING . The micro-fiber pants do n't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist is n't as comfortable either . I sent them back for a refund .
 I purchased 3 extra big size flexfit caps for my son . Unfortunately they did n't fit . Have to return . They are XXL and he needs XXXL .
 Company would not let us exchange it . I do n't feel like this was very good customer service . Stay away . Very disappointed .
 The size 5 panties are too small to fit on people who wear standard size 5 panties . They are meant for narrow-hipped -LRB- under 34 inch hip size -RRB- individuals . I am having to throw the product away after purchase .
 Ca n't recommend these . Laundered once and they shrank so much I can no longer use . Makes you wonder if these manufacturers who go overseas also suspend quality control .
 I gave them one star because theres no provision for -0 - . Legs too small , butt too big . Material is soft but too many negatives .
 THIS PRODUCT WAS FLIMSY . NO ELASTICITY WHAT SO EVER . YOU 'D BE BETTER OFF BUYING A LEOTARD OR BATHING SUIT . WHEN I PUT IT ON IT FELT LIKE I HAD ON A CAMISOLE . IT DID N'T GIVE ME ANY SUPPORT WHAT SO EVER .
 My son broke it open and immediately put it on . I laughed so hard I almost broke my knee bending over to catch my breath . He does n't care , he 's got on Spiderman gear and he 's three months away from actually swimming in a pool this year . I think it 's a mistake to only have one squirting glove -LRB- what if your child is a lefty like mine ? -RRB- but I suppose the manufacturing costs might have pushed this past the forty dollar mark at a retail store.UPDATE
 Wigwam is such a good brand & the high price really made me think the quality must be great . The socks will not stay up . They are like the ` slouch ' socks some kids like to wear . The sizing is correct but he ca n't use a rubber band or those ` sock suspenders ' to keep them up . We were disappointed with them & glad I only bought the 1 pair to try first . We have found it hard to find good diabetic white socks . We will keep looking , I guess . These were not the ` best ' , in our opinion .
 There are many problems that diabetic 's face daily . One of these problems should not be their socks . Nor should diabetic face scams by merchants claiming to solve their aches and pains , at an elevate price . This sock does nothing . The sock is poorly made out of the cheapest material and it will not stay up , as such the marketing relies on suckers like me for a one time purchase . if you are a diabetic or if you even wear socks , save your money on this one .
 No where on the description did it say 1 pair . I should have at least got 2 pair of socks in this order for this price . I am disappointed . Now I have to buy other socks to make up for this 1 in the present .
 Wigwam Men 's Diabetic Strider socks have a promisingname which in no way lives up to reality.They fall apart almost instantly . They bind . Theyhave too much spandex and are really an inferior product.But they look good in advertisements and on first use.I am amazed at how lame they are !
 The sizing on the socks is TOO loose . Large was too tight on my swollen feet and legs . X-Large wo n't stay up , and slides off my feet when walking in my `` sock-feet '' . Which I need to do for several hours a day while teaching Kids .
 I purchased these pants for my fiance and they are still hanging in the closet with the tags still attached waiting to be return . The fabric is very flowy and silk like and made my fiance look like he had stepped back into the early 90 's . Hammerman style is a better way of putting it . I refuse to let him wear them . UGLY !
 This was not worth the price . It looked nothing liked the picture . There was a piece of fluff on it that they called a feather . It 's a peice of flimsy felt and when put on the head it does n't even take the shape of a hat . I was terribly disappointed !!
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .

 These pants are constructed from poor quality twill fabric . Save your money and get pants in 65/35 ripstop -- it will be more durable and far more comfortable .
 it looks better in picture than in real , the head pice is no nice , is a kind of ugly to be honest .

 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .
 Within 3 washings the pants became coarse and began to irritate my skin . Happened with 2 pairs.Pants look nice . Interior seam work not as good as competitors .
 Compared to the Gap , these pants run tight in the waist and long in length . It 's hard to see the detail from the picture , but they are very casual looking as well , not quite as polished as what you 'd get from Gap , BR or Dockers . The best thing about them is they are offered in smaller sizes .

 I am not nearly as pleased with my recent purchase of the moss &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; as I am with the brown &#34; Double-Front Work Dungaree &#34; I have purchased in the past and have worn almost daily for three years . Although the description of the material seems to indicate that both pants are essentially cut from the same type of cloth the moss dungarees have a light weight feel in relation to the brown . I ca n't explain it . In addition the dye has faded/washed out in places on the moss giving the pants a tie-dye effect over the legs of the dungarees . The legs also have annoying creases approximately one inch from the sewn seams . These phantom seams were visible when I received the pants . -LRB- The phantom seams are the type most people have experienced in a least one pair of denim jeans . The type of seam you do battle with after every washing in the hopes that it will somehow disappear -RRB- . The dungarees also have noticeably more loose/dangling threads compared to my brown dungarees . All in all , not very satisfied . I will continue to buy the brown dungarees as long as the quality does not decline and I am able to stand in front of them before I make the purchase .
 Do n't spend your hardened money on this . I bought this pair for hunting trips , but after to machine wash it start folling a part like a piece of the paper . There quality going down to the gator .
 I have ordered these twice now , double front dungaree , black , 32x32 and both times I have received pants that are marked 32x32 but are 32x34 ish . I wear carharts 5 days a week for work and have about 9 pair . All are the same size , 32x32 and the inseams measure 32 . The first pair measured 34 second pair measured 33.5 .
 In my first attempt I thought I ordered wrong . After reordering I ordered a 34w x 31L and my confirmation email said I ordered a 31x34 which is what happened the first time ! I am not sure what is going on but I they are shipping right away and the first time I was only allowed a refund and not an exchange :-LRB- 80 bucks in limbo : -LRB-
 Carhartt makes the best , most durable work gear I have ever used but PLEASE , pay a few more bucks and buy them somewhere else , I ordered two pairs from here on May 13 , 2009 . It is now June 3 . In fact , it 's almost June 4 and they just shipped them today . They have had my money for almost a month but I still do n't have their product . If I had known it would take them a month to get the product to me I would have happily gone down the street and paid a few dollars more to actually have the product in hand . Do yourself a favor and do n't lend these people your money , interest free for a month.Carhartt Double-Front Work Dungaree Pant - Men 's
 I purchased these because of the extensive history I have with wearing carhart clothing . Currently I am furious that I have to contact carhart because on the three pairs I purchased all three pairs have stitching errors so badly that they are falling apart at the seams literally . i am severely irritated not only because of this problem but then I find out this product is made over seas and not here in the USA . Shame on you carhart .
 I bought this backpack for college and after 9 months it tore in three places . Terrible quality . I paid 5 Bucks to mail it in for repair under warranty and after two months with no responce I called and found out that they wo n't fix anything because the damage happened , `` as a result of normal use , '' ... well is n't that exactly why companies have a warranty ? So that if the product you buy from them shows manufacturing defects that become evident through normal use the product is replaced ? This company is a joke and only profits on the fact that they have huge name recognition , but this product was of very low quality and the warranty is a fraud .
 I purchased this , thinking that it was hot pink , but to my surprise the backpack was a unexpected salmon color &#34; pink . &#34; Do n't be fooled by the description -LRB- Pink Prep -RRB- .
 From the description '' ... giving it enough space to store two to three textbooks , a large binder , two to three spiral notebooks ... `` Not sure what textbooks and notebooks these guys used to measure it , but my daughter had to pack 2 middle-school textbooks , 1 binder and 1 spiral notebook and they would not fit . We had to go and buy her a different backpack .
 I bought this backpack for my son for his freshman year of high school . He came to me two days later and told me he had too many things from his classes and they would n't all fit in this pack . Together we tried to make room for everything and were able to squeeze it all in . However , the backpack started coming apart at the seams a week later .
 I got my first JanSport backpack when I was in elementary school , and it lasted until my senior year of high school . A while later in college , I decided to buy a backpack , and naturally went for another JanSport.My first disappointment was that the backpack was n't a true navy color -- it 's dark blue , not navy . That I could live with , however . The drastic decrease in quality was the biggest disappointment . Within months , the backpack had small holes in it . I bought this size because I 'm an English major who rarely has textbooks to carry around , so I was n't even carrying anything heavy or sharp . After roughly a year of use , the backpack had several good-sized holes in it.The straps also began to come unattached from the top of the backpack ; the fabric started to fray terribly , and by the week , the straps came off more and more . I was perplexed , since I 'd carried much heavier things in my older backpack for much longer . Before I 'd even had the backpack two years , one of the straps had almost completely come off . I sewed it back on using heavy duty thread , but within a couple of weeks the stitches no longer held because the fabric had frayed even further . I did n't have much choice but to replace it.The last thing is , JanSport backpacks are no longer machine washable . I threw my first backpack in the washer dozens of times . With this one , I had to try to hand wash it if it got a stain on it . Backpacks get enough use that they should really be machine washable . And they should be much more durable than this one was .
 The backpack shown in the picture is not the same as the one delivered . My daughter was quite disappointed . The one delivered is a cute backpack , but not what I thought I was ordering . The one pictured has bright purple ; the one delivered has very dark purple that is n't noticible . The one pictured has purple straps at the top and on the bottom of the shoulder straps . The one delivered has all black ... So , the only things purple on the one we got are the zipper pulls . By the time we got it we were afraid if we sent it back , my daughter would not have a new one by the first day of school . So , we added our own purple to it . I 'll think twice about ordering from here again .
 So i bought this backpack because I needed to keep my books somewhere so I could carry things in my hands . I am 17 and a senior in High School . I ordered on the 21st or 22nd of December -LSB- I know I got the rest of my items before Christmas -RSB- and got the bag on the 6th of January . which was a drag.I got the bag at the material is pretty lousy , the straps are stiff and worst of all ... its really small . I am 5 ' 7 '' and this bag looks like a little kid 's backpack . I just got ta say that if you are older than 10 or 11 , find a new backpack or you will just look like a grown person who stole some little helpless kid 's backpack .
 I bought 3 of these to replace worn out back packs . I thought they would be great quality , but from the appearance they look no better than the ones they already had that fell apart after 3 months . I was really disappointed by how thin they are .
 I ordered this Superbreak backpack from Amazon -LRB- shipped directly from Amazon -RRB- . I was very disappointed with the quality -- very cheaply made with loose stitch . Ironically it came with a &#34; lifetime warranty . &#34; I returned this bag the next day.I have owned a JanSport air for 4 years , and have always been satisfied with its quality . But this Superbreak is not even comparable in quality .
 It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it . I think it is not good for a child . Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke !!!
 My kids have used JanSport backpacks in the past and we have n't had a problem with them . However , I ordered this one in the beginning of September . My daughter has used it for about 2 weeks and it has already ripped . I am very disappointed in JanSport .
 Jansport has really gone downhill in the past 10 years . It used to be that the top 3 brands were Jansport , Eastpak , and High Sierra . Now Eastpak only deals with the european market . High Sierra has gone into uber industrial -LRB- non casual -RRB- backpacks that are a cross between urban and hiking . And Jansport still produces casual school/day treker backpacks but unfortunately the quality has gone down a lot . They do n't produce the leather/suede bottoms anymore . Now , the bottoms rip and wear out more easily and the entire fabric is a lot thinner and cheaper . I compared one I purchased last week at Staples to one that I had 10 years ago and the one purchased recently will probably wear out faster than the one 10 years back . That 's a little ridiculous . You can really feel how thing the fabric has become , it 's sad . I do n't think they 're even produced in the US anymore , probably China . They 've made no changes to it besides putting some padding in the back . But it 's really lost the appeal that it once had . I ca n't believe you could walk into a Walmart , Kmart or Target and find wall to wall of quality Jansports with leather bottoms and now the closest thing you can get is this piece of crap . Thanks Jansport , maybe in 10 more years you 'll reduce down to a burlap sack or a coffee bean bag . BTW , the jansport I just purchased has been returned .
 I purchased this product for my 1st grader . He liked the design ; I liked the Jansport brand -LRB- I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy -RRB- . Well , the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material . The backpack was so lightweight that my son 's water bottle could put a hole through its side . The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results . In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home . I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off , and he reassured me that it was a genuine product . Although I could n't believe him completely , the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack .
 the shoulder strap is already broken and it has only been 6 weeks . its a weak backpack , considering that i put it to gentle use
 The color of the real thing is dark gray which is very ugly . And I have tried to return this item , but I failed because UPS did come to pick the package in three days . And I am leaving in two weeks so I am afraid I can not get the refund at that time so I gave up to return this item . This is an awful experience !
 This product is cheap and the stitching was all over the place . It was made overseas and it shows . I will never buy from this company again . It 's doubtful this thing will last 3 weeks as it 's so thin and flimsy . I would like to warn anyone who is considering buying one of the Jansport bags online . Go to a store and look at it first and buy it there . I would have never EVER bought this bag if I was able to check it out first . Either way , it made my 7 year old happy , and i 'm sure she will be upset that it has torn up within a month . Buyers BEWARE .
 I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
 I saw this bag well displayed with multi-divisions -LRB- sections -RRB- and got attracked to it because that was what I wanted but to my surprise , is far from what it was displayed . I am very much disappointed , it will not serve my purpose and I hate it that I do not even know what to do with it . it was totally wrong product display .
 The shipping time is ok , but the color is totally wronge . It is impossible to carry the kind of color to outside .
 It is REALLY FRUSTRATING ... I ASKED FOR WHITE/SILVER STARS , it seems to be a problem with the product , they sent me the WHITE/SILVER TWINKLE STARS one ... I purchased it in amazon ONLY because I needed SPECIFICALLY the WHITE/SILVER STARS in the RIGHT DAY ... This order was time sensitive , anyhow everybody can make mistakes , so I called to let them know that It was wrong and they told me that they will fix it , they will not make the same mistake they will resend the backpack ... . they ask me to send it back and they sent me `` THE RIGHT ONE '' but today -LRB- 24 days after -RRB- I got in the mail AGAIN THE WRONG BACKPACK ! ... Not to mention the other hydration pack that I bought in the same order that got lost in the mail ... I just want to place the complaint , I feel really frustrated and do n't want to hear again a customer service representative telling me that `` he assure me this will not happen again `` My recommendation
 The material for the body of the bag is very thin and I 'm worried it wo n't last me through the school year . It 's not a comfortable fit with the weight of my texts no matter where the straps are adjusted . I admit it looks really cute and you ca n't beat the price , but if i were to see that bag in a store where i could touch it and feel the material , i would not have purchased it - even despite how inexpensive it was .
 This bag was going to be for me to use at college , and quite frankly it was WAY too small for that . It is more made for elementry to middle school kids . So luckily I have a little sister to give it to , but otherwise , I 'm pretty disappointed .
 the straps would loosen by itself when carring the bag on your back ... . i dont like it . Also the material is flimsy . but we all know that jansport lasts long ...
 I could n't believe it was a jansport . It is the sorriest excuse for a backpack I have seen in awhile . More like something from the K-mart bargain basement . Would definitely not suggest buying it .
 I really like the color and it is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion . I 'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size or something but it is really small . It looks like a first graders back pack , not one for a college student .
 For the quality and size of this backpack , it is way overpriced . I can buy a large size gym bag for the price of this backpack .
 Very disappointed in this backpack . My daughter was happy with it , but myself as a mother knows that it will last no longer than a couple of months . There is absolutely no lining within the back . Fits all her books though she says ...
 I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it . Problem is it 's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag . This is not what i really imagined to get .
 This is n't really worth the price . Based on strength and utility alone , I 've seen cheaper backpacks at Wal-Mart , etc. that far outshine this little thing . This is really quite small , do n't let the big numbers fool you.I guess I could suggest this for elementary schoolers , but as a college student this really does n't work for me . I remember carrying even more books in high school , so yeah , that 's out too . When you get this , you 're really just paying for the name brand . They pocket the difference by sacrificing quality .1 . Smaller than it looks .2 . Very thin fabric .3 . The joke they call ` padding ' does n't keep the sharp edges of any book from sticking into your back .4 . The straps feel very weak , and I do n't feel comfortable carrying all my books in it .5 . The backpack has a tendency to ` slide ' down ; the buckle does n't hold the straps well , so the nylon slides past it and causes the straps to loosen against your will .
 This was supposed to be large enough for an adult . It 's really meant for a Jr. . High school student . A waste !
 Purchased it for junier high school student . it 's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be . Overall , it 's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you do n't like it after receiving . Will not buy those bag anyway .
 I bought this backpack for my 12-year old Goddaughter who was visiting from Brazil . She wanted this particular brand because it happens to be in fashion down there . However , I fail to understand why it costs so much considering the poor quality of the material and the overall product . I can buy a much much better backpack , padded , strongly made and with lots of compartments making it much more useful , for a lot less money . I think the product is way overrated and unless your kid wants it for the `` fashion '' aspect of it , I 'd look for something else of better quality .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .

 I live in michigan and wanted a great everyday base layer . I am 6 ' 1 '' and 160 lbs . I run and bike and usually wear medium clothing . I purchased the medium -LRB- Regular - not tall - it was $ 30 more ! -RRB- and the sleeve lenght was a bit short but OK since I was wearing it underneath . I liked how soft if felt , but it was a bit tight at the neck and the colar seems be just a bit uncomfortable around my neck.The only other good base layer I own is from louis Garneu - and it is 1/2 the thickness of the minus 33 and it is warmer . I was disapointed with the warmth of this base layer , I read good reviews , but I found it was not warmer than a good fitted cotton shirt.THe packaging and box it comes in are very nice .
 I may be one of the only customers who does not like Minus33 tops . Unfortunately the top was prickly and itchy for me . I tried to like it and feel comfortable but it was just too prickly feeling.I have the bottoms which I like though .
 I had bought a few base layers from Icebreaker but was upset they were manufactured in China so I tried to order this shirt to compare . The problem is that the seller , Essential Apperal has taken almost two weeks to even ship it to me . I only live about 6 hours from their shop and could have driven there and back before they sent it out . It is my fault for not reading some of the previous reports on this seller , the have a bad reputation . My advise is to find a local shop and try it on before ordering .
 I bought this costume for my 2 year old son who loves Elephants . When I got it I quickly found out there was an issue with the lining of the costume . We went to try it on him to make sure it fit . The legs on the intieror did n't line up right . Therefore I still ca n't tell you if it even fits him correctly . When you look into a costume or any pair of pants for that matter , you should be able to see clear holes to the feet . This was not the case . Now I have less than 2 weeks till Halloween and have n't gotten confirmation from this company if they have any in stock without this defect . And they still have this product listed on amazon while supposedly investigating the matter . So buyer beware.The costume is incredibly cute and I am hoping that the company will make this right for my son . So I hope that this is just a one time fluke .
 The product image on the website is old according to the customer rep in BrandsOnSale . The delivery does n't come with the feet , and the manufacture does n't provide the feet , and BrandsOnSale does n't take return because of this . So use your judgement before you buy it .
 First , let me start by saying that the quality of this costume SUCKS . It 's scratchy and too simple to be anything more than a gray piece of fabric . It is also a 4T . It says 2T-4T but the costume clearly has a 4T size on it when you get it . Would not have fit my 2 year old . I returned the product and paid my own shipping . Then , the company charged me a 25 % `` restocking fee '' on top the shipping I paid to have it sent and the shipping I paid to send it back . So basically I paid an extra $ 30 for NOTHING . ***** DO NOT BUY THIS ! **** The `` Cuddly Elephant costume '' also sold on Amazon is much more cute and soft !
 Much bigger than I expected and the nylon feels a little cheap . Although , for the price it does the job !
 This jean I expected a different color and as it says on the ad , it 's not low rise at all .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 I bought this for my grandson as a Christmas gift because he likes to play dress-up . For the price I paid , it was cheaply made and not much to it .
 They were made for someone with a gigantic belly and no hips or seat . They fit terribly . Very uncomfortable . Not made for women . Made more for men with beer bellies .
 I really like Alia slacks . They are true to size and easy care . The pants that arrived were of some different material -LRB- micro-fiber -RRB- and looked like rags . REALLY DISAPPOINTING . The micro-fiber pants do n't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist is n't as comfortable either . I sent them back for a refund .

 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .

 The description states it is 11.5 '' x 8.5 '' x 4 '' . The perfect size I needed . It 's not . It 's actually 9 '' x 7.5 '' x 2.75 '' It also claims to have an interior dividor , which it does not . THERE ARE NO INTERIOR POCKETS ON THIS BAG . Just the 2 impossibly tiny ones on the outside . They could possibly hold a small cell phone , but that would be it . The inside is just one space.The condition oft he bag is brand new and it 's a nice bag . Just not at all what the description of picture depicts . DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU 'RE EXPECTING WHAT THE PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION SHOWS .
 Perhaps my dreams for this products were just too big . They basically do what they claim to do - sort of hoist your breasts up and make them nice and round and all that . But clear = / = invisible and they just did not work for my skimpy dresses . They were , unfortunately , only as useful as a plunge bra and not nearly as durable -LRB- they started slipping as soon as I started sweating and dancing was impossible ! -RRB- They would probably be best for a small busted person , in a backless dress , who plans to go to an event where she will stand still and look pretty .
 Did not breath which cause me to sweat which caused it to not stick . Big problem.Braza Reveal Silicone Bra Style S/7800
 its not that great and the title is so offensive . They look like old lady medical underwear . really weak to be honest . They dont work any better than any tight underwear . . maybe worse .
 I do n't even know why I bought this product , but I did and now it is long gone . Oh well .
 This hiding gaff make you look really like an old lady , while girl panties will do a better job . And surprisingly , it 's hide much better than this .
 This was not what expected.This product is nothing more than a simple pair of panties for men.It does not hide my bulge nor does it make me appear more femine.This was a waste of my hard earned money and time.they should make a product that has a built in cup to hold the testicles and a pouch to hide the penis
 I 'm not a Crossdressing , Transgender or Transvestite Man but I used these underpants at a Norwegian body building contest I was in . The airlines lost my luggage so I did n't have my shorts to compete in . My friend , who was drunk at the time , picked these up on sale at a used clothing store.They are too tight , and stick up your -LSB- blank -RSB- so they are very uncomfortable to wear on the beach or under pants.You might want to avoid putting this on your head too since it will squeeze all your hairs up .

 The waistbands on some of the pairs I own have rolled down , and no amount of ironing seems to be able to straighten them out . Oddly , this seems to affect the blue and gray pairs . Of the four black pairs I bought , only one has this problem . I also had a seam fail on one of the eight pairs I bought.I have since bought some boxer briefs from Nordstrom that have held up much better , with no rolling in the waistband . I 'm going to start replacing these Calvin Kleins with Nordstroms . Maybe not as chic , but it 's better than having a rolled waistband digging into your hip .
 Comfortable only for the first wearing . The waist band on these rolls very easily and then even repeated washing , and ironing ca n't take the roll out . Otherwise , well made and they tend to wear well .

 I could not use this hair dryer while traveling in Switzerland because the rubber plug was big and round and made it impossible to push the metal pins into recessed wall sockets . I ended up buying a hair dryer there with a smaller narrow oval shaped rubber plug which worked just fine .

 I purchased this for my granddaughter . She is 5 ' 2 '' - photo shows a floor length cape , this was not . Would probably be fine for someone shorter unless length is a consideration .
 I purchased sunglasses which were suppose to be polarized , but they were n't . I sent them back to the seller who returned the money to my account . The seller tested them and agreed they were not polarized . I am waiting on the return postage money to be credited to my account .

 A couple months after I purchased this belt , the leather started flaking off the front . It 's not so bad because it 's covered by the overlap of the belt . Probably would have chose a higher quality belt if I had known that would be the case .
 BUY CHEAP - GET CHEAPBraid is loose in places and catches on belt loops.Leather is not supple and belt is too wide .
 The amazon description was : leatherCasual fashion belt that moves with you and conforms to the waistExpands approximately 1 '' without extra tabs or attachmentsPadded leather tabs and loopSatin silver finished buckleWear with jeans or sportswearThe first Item `` Leather '' is misleading , the belt actually states `` Genuine Leather with Bonded Lacing made in china `` So the only real leather part is the portion on both ends that buckle together , the mesh or majority of this beltis in fact not real leather at all . That would probably explain other reviewers comments about longevity and stretching!Had I known it was primarily bonded I would have chosen something else .
 This is the first negative review i have written on Amazon . The belt twisted out of shape in 3 to 4 wearings . The black color started to wear off by 10 wearings . I have used very similar belts be a different vendor with no problems . This is very inferior merchandise .
 I purchased this belt -LRB- a Lee Jeans Men 's Comfort Stretch Braided Belt -RRB- on 7/11/2008 and threw it away 7/25/08 because it had lost its stretch after several wearing and became too long to wear.Definitely a product of inferior quality.Roger V. Rowe
 The elastic wire inside the leather weave on one side broke ... your belt basically becomes a slinky at that point . Took me a while to figure this out and the time for me to return it elapsed . Loved the belt , bad design .
 The stretchiness does make this belt more comfortable , but it alsoseems to stretch out . In my case this was about a month , and nowit does not work so well , even on the last hole .
 My personal shape is , um , outward bound at the waist . Convex . Some might say `` fat '' . This belt is attractive and well made and easily a terrific value at the price . It is also extremely comfortable -- until I move.If I move it turns out to be too stretchy and too easily convinced by that bad boy , Gravity , to abandon its duty of holding my pants up . Both it and my pants go south and my hands must become occupied at constantly chasing after and returning both pants and belt to where they belong.I love this belt but can not use it . At least until I loose a few inches . Wish me luck on that and skip this belt if you do n't have a waist .
 Do yourself a favor and skip this one . It 's too poorly made to last , and it looks like a throw-away . Made in China , it 's below average even for that source .
 I bought this camisole to replace the thread bare ones that I 've been clinging to for longer than I 'd care to admit . When I received it , it looked exactly like my thread bare camis because it was so thin it was see through . To top it off , there 's an elastic band around the bottom that causes it to ride up all day long . It 's a waste of money . I 'm better off wearing my old grungy shirts .
 I ordered Sweatsedo 's `` Baby Blue Crew Men 's Velour Sweatsuit '' based on the photo . What I got is a totally different style warmup suit that is not actually velour at all , but brushed cotton . I might add that the only resemblance between the one I got and the advertised photo , is the color . I will admit that the ad did say , ' 80 % cotton and 20 % polyester . ' However , the fact remains that it is still deceptive advertisement , `` Bait and Switch . '' I did n't feel like the hassle or the headache involved in trying to get it shipped back and maybe getting the same thing again , as I am disabled , which is why I 'm even ordering a warmup suit online in the first place . The only reason I give Sweatsedo a 1 star rating is because that was the lowest rating available . As far as I 'm concerned this purchase rates even lower than that . I will never shop with them again and I will tell all my newtwork of this experience , as well .
 How can we make an intellegent purchase on this site when they fail to give what the fabric is made of . This is primary information and should be included on ALL clothing listed on this site . This is not the first time TODAY I have seen this on Amazon.com
 If you do n't want the `` generous length '' t-shirts , which I 've been trying to avoid -LRB- which is why I 'm buying such a thing online , in the first place -RRB- , then avoid these shirts . The description most certainly does NOT include the fact that these are generous length .
 The quality is not really good , the cotten used is dry and you do not feel them soft .
 They were made for someone with a gigantic belly and no hips or seat . They fit terribly . Very uncomfortable . Not made for women . Made more for men with beer bellies .
 I really like Alia slacks . They are true to size and easy care . The pants that arrived were of some different material -LRB- micro-fiber -RRB- and looked like rags . REALLY DISAPPOINTING . The micro-fiber pants do n't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist is n't as comfortable either . I sent them back for a refund .
 Although , I love the bag itself but I was so sad when only a week after being used I tugged on the handle and the plastic joiner snapped . Grrrr . I bought four carabiners to replace the flimsy plastic pieces .

 This title download was elementary at best . It concentrates on female attire with an advertising at the end . More modern clothing . Save $ 2.99 and search on Google ... you will get more information and it will be hassle free . !
 I ordered a 44D and it is too small . I am glad I did not remove the tags because it is going back right after the holidays .
 As a few others have said these run very small and the band is extremely tight . . They are in no way true to size . Also if you remove the tag and want to return it ... all returns must be received with tags attached , if not they charge a 10 % repricing fee . Whatever that means . Seeing that it will probably cost me half or what I payed to return it I will take the loss . They probably hope everyone will do that as they really are discouraging returns it seems .
 These bras are undersized . I ordered a little larger , and they are very tight . The cups are the same way . These are supposed to be DD , but are closer to D.The underwire is halfway under my armpit . I got them for everyday , but they really are not comfortable
 The Feel Beautiful Cotton Blend jacquard Underwire Bras are great except they run small . The reason for the low rating , the company sent me two different sizes and I only ordered one size . I told them that both sizes were two small and I would need a size larger and I was told they would make it right and that was July 5 and I 'm still waiting . I will be sending everything back and not ordering from this company again .
 I found that these are not good for smaller sizes -LRB- A/B cup -RRB- - if you do n't fill out the material , then it is hard for it to lie smooth under your clothes .
 This product was designed to offer lift and act in effect as a stick-on strapless.Instead , it is more like putting large Band-Aids on your breasts and does not do jack for support.If you want a good stick on strapless , then getsilicone silicon self adhesive nubra bra backless cup A B C Dinstead .
 I wear a C-D cup and purchased the body bra to wear with a low-backed shirt . The photo shows the tabs around each side of the breast , but when I did this , it created floppy CONES . Unless you have very small breasts or breasts that basically do n't need a bra at all , do n't waste your money on this product.I also purchased the Fashion Forms `` Beautiful Lift '' that requires you to tuck the bottom of your breast into a `` canal '' and then put the adhesive over it . The adhesive is NOT strong enough to keep the breast in the shape it describes , and the size D was not big enough for my C-D breasts . I think their sizing runs VERY small , if the product even works at all .
 Do n't not fall for a gimmick . Buy a regular neck gaiter and a real ski mask . This thing is terrible . First , it is poorly made , the thin material part on mine looks like it was cut with scissors and melted on the edge . Wearing as a ski mask it does not channel breath away like real ski masks , so it fogs up the goggles . It also gets wet and cold immediately . It does not have a shape like ski masks do , so it keeps getting in you mouth . It also bunches up in one thick lair so I actually keep feeling cold on the back of my neck . Absolutely not recommended .
 Not what I expected ... does not keep your face warm . . very light weight and wind still blows through it . . I wish I had returned it . . not worth the $

 It was comfortable , but did not fit at all like I had hoped it would . The cups had pretty much no support , and it even seemed like they had too much material . It sort of bunched up ... not attractive . I returned it .
 The bras fit well but after a few times of wearing , the wire popped out .
 Very scratchy fabric and very uncomfortable . The fit is nice , but I ca n't stand to have it on all day ! Ugh !
 Pros : ComfortableVery SupportiveNice Lace -LRB- Ca n't comment on durability - I returned it -RRB- Cons : SHAPEI found this bra to give my breasts a very bizarre shape . Not cone or bullet shaped , but definitely too perky - my breasts pointed up . If you look closely you can actually see the shape on the model in the picture . I did n't notice until I tried it on myself but then I looked back at the picture and sure enough - they point up . I think everyone has a different idea of an appropriate breast shape so my advice is to look very carefully at the picture being mindful of the shape - if it looks good to you then you might like it . It is also possible that with bigger breasts the extra gravity might balance out the extra lift and make a nice shape . -LRB- I am a 40D -RRB-
 I do n't know what shape or size of breast this bra is designed for , but mine are definitely not it . If you want your girls held up in a loose fitting banana hammock , this is the bra for you . I tried to keep an open mind when I first put it on even though I was stupefied with incredulity , and thought maybe it looks good under a shirt . I put on a sweater , and thought ... `` oh , this is how older people get that weird look like their boobs have fallen down but the nipples still manage to point up '' . It 's not a bullet bra , but it 's a similar unnatural shape .
 The generic product description says that there are only 3 rows of hooks . Once you move up to the 38DD size , there are 4 . I know that an extra row does n't sound like a lot , but it makes a huge difference regarding the width of the backstrap . I went back to a 36 b/c I just wanted the three rows of hooks . If you can stand the 4 rows , this is a great bra for women with smaller frames and larger breasts . I found a good amount of support while still having a little movement . Most bras my size are granny-approved , so it is nice to have a lacy one that looks fresh .
 Perhaps this bra will work for those who are not very busty . For me 34DD , it gave me banana boobs . Good construction though , it looks like it would last a while if I actually wore it .
 I was so excited to find this , had my mom buy it , and then when I put it on I was instantly mortified that I looked like a bad imitation of Maddona 's cone look . Not to mention the fact that it did n't hold me up at all . If you are on the bigger side then I would suggest finding something else !

 I bought these for my wife . I expected them to be the same size as the ones in her underwear drawer . But to my amazement , they were 4x the size . They are a product of false sizing . Although they have the same number in size they are just way to big . Could have made a flag out of them . My wife could have covered her entire upper body with them . Needless to say , they were discarded as we know no one large enough to fit them . This company needs to break out a tape measure and return to the drawing board . These are definately for plus , plus , plus size women .

 The waistbands on some of the pairs I own have rolled down , and no amount of ironing seems to be able to straighten them out . Oddly , this seems to affect the blue and gray pairs . Of the four black pairs I bought , only one has this problem . I also had a seam fail on one of the eight pairs I bought.I have since bought some boxer briefs from Nordstrom that have held up much better , with no rolling in the waistband . I 'm going to start replacing these Calvin Kleins with Nordstroms . Maybe not as chic , but it 's better than having a rolled waistband digging into your hip .

 I found that these are not good for smaller sizes -LRB- A/B cup -RRB- - if you do n't fill out the material , then it is hard for it to lie smooth under your clothes .
 This product was designed to offer lift and act in effect as a stick-on strapless.Instead , it is more like putting large Band-Aids on your breasts and does not do jack for support.If you want a good stick on strapless , then getsilicone silicon self adhesive nubra bra backless cup A B C Dinstead .
 I wear a C-D cup and purchased the body bra to wear with a low-backed shirt . The photo shows the tabs around each side of the breast , but when I did this , it created floppy CONES . Unless you have very small breasts or breasts that basically do n't need a bra at all , do n't waste your money on this product.I also purchased the Fashion Forms `` Beautiful Lift '' that requires you to tuck the bottom of your breast into a `` canal '' and then put the adhesive over it . The adhesive is NOT strong enough to keep the breast in the shape it describes , and the size D was not big enough for my C-D breasts . I think their sizing runs VERY small , if the product even works at all .
 They were made for someone with a gigantic belly and no hips or seat . They fit terribly . Very uncomfortable . Not made for women . Made more for men with beer bellies .
 I really like Alia slacks . They are true to size and easy care . The pants that arrived were of some different material -LRB- micro-fiber -RRB- and looked like rags . REALLY DISAPPOINTING . The micro-fiber pants do n't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist is n't as comfortable either . I sent them back for a refund .

 Guess my gut is bigger than a size 40 Levi or Wrangler jeans because I have to wear these with the buttons open on the sides even though I wear size 40 Levi 's and Wranglers . I also do n't like that fact that the straps connect to a piece that is sown on the front at a place lower that the edge of the material . So the material tends to roll inward and is uncomfortable . Bummer .
 I thought it was made in the U.S.A. . Material manufactured in the U.S. but `` assembled in Mexico '' . This is NOT made in the United States of America .
 I ordered these one size larger than I take in Levi 's or Wranglers , but they still did not fit .

 The hat sold is by Disguise , but it is NOT the model shown in the picture . It is a slightly smaller costume hat -LRB- read cheap -RRB- with DEVO in raised letters across the top and a slight brime on the lowest rung.Shame on Disguise and shame on Amazon for misleading the consumer .
 this product is a cheap piece of flimsy plastic !! For 17.99 plus shipping I ca n't believe this is even allowed !!!!! Do n't buy this piece of garbage !!! - they make you give at least 1 star . If I had the choice it would be NO stars !
 I wanted a devo hat for halloween . This was all I could find . Since I did n't want to make one myself I purchased this one . It is a thin bit of plastic that will work but certainly was not worth the price .

 I was looking for more cold weather running gear . I read other reviews on this pant and took a chance . I never got to try them on because they sent me the wrong size . Then when I called to return them they had switched companies . So , I had to return the pants and then reorder from the other company . Not worth the hassle for pants I did n't even like looking at . They were super thin material . Buyer beware ...
 The stitching was defective and left a small area unseamed . Decided to keep them because they are out of stock and for the amount I paid , they are n't bad after a bit of patching up . They do come up to my belly button -LRB- I 'm 5 ' 2 &#34; -RRB- , so the woman modeling them in the picture must be much taller . They also get quite baggy after wearing but return to shape after washing . They do run big but not as bad as most other brands I have tried . I have an x-small , and I weigh 110 lb .
 The seams across the butt are to high making them uncomfortable . I would wear them if not for this flaw in design even though the large shirt like buttons on the front look funny . I 'll stick to my Hanes boxer briefs for now .
 Earlier I reported that these had a very thin ban of elastic in the leg but I finally had to cut one open to really see and it turns out it 's not elastic but gathered material that is stretchy . I presume -LRB- and hope -RRB- it 's cotton since the product says 100 % cotton . So if you do n't want leg elastic go for it !
 Nice but they shrink a LOT . It ; s definitely possible to buy cottan panties that do n't shrink . I 'm going back to National Mosiery where the panties are better , cheaper , and DO N'T shrink .
 I thought I ordered Vanity Fair rayon panties ... these are cotton and I do not like cotton underwear . Was n't worth returning to the store .
 These hats are awful , which matches their customer service.I returned the items I bought , and they refuse to process the refund .

 This thing is really awful wear . It sheds fur constantly , if you have any stubble at all it will get all over your face and tickle like crazy . You ca n't see out if it , and you look out the mouth . I put it on for pictures and then took it right back off .
 So i bought this mask because it looked freaking awesome -- but was very disappointed . The colors of the mask are way off . which really make it look `` fake '' It looks nothing to what the picture looks like . i would not recommend anyone to buy this item . the material is also very cheap . in the end i want my money back .
 I purchased this bag for my daughter , who is in 4th grade and totes around 3-4 large textbooks daily . The entire handle broke off after 3 months . Only buy this rolling backpack if you or your child intend to use it for light loads .
 Bag fell apart at the bottom stitching after 2 months . If you use it as rolling cart , the seams at the corners at the bottom of the bag , beside the wheels are not protected and will wear away quickly causing the bag to open up at the bottom . On a regular rolling case these are normally protected by a piece of plastic or rubber.Have noticed that a lot of other back pack / rolling bags are built like this however I have since replaced with a Samsonite version that does have the plastic protecting the seams .
 My daughter really likes the looks of this backpack however the t-handle is not holding up . After only 10 days of school use the t-handle has pulled out several times already so it 's just a matter of time til it breaks completely . And they certainly are not overloading the backpack in the first few days of school . Too bad cuz the backpack itself is nice .
 I bought these for my daughter prior to a trip to cold Berlin , Germany . She loved them , and they kept her feet quite warm . The problem is that the first time they were washed , the seam on one unraveled from the top all the way down to the sole . Bottom line
 I thought it would be fun being bloom for halloween , so my moommy bought this costume . It was ichy , and not very fun to move in.As I was modeling it , it ripped right down the back , and it was 2 sizes larger than what i wear.Bloom is mean now , and I hate Winx , I guess my sister Kiki was right , Winx is stupid .
 This looks pretty good online , but it is cheap and difficult to put on -LRB- even for a corset ! -RRB- Do n't bother .
 not as advertised , the product display does not represent what was sold , I saw same item for 9.99 without postage or handling ; this is an over priced rip off
 These are horrible ! There is no padding at all so they do nothing for you . One of the previous reviews said they come with clips so you can clip them together for cleavage if you 're wearing something backless , mine came with no clips but the plastic tabs were still there as if someone just cut the clip part off . Worst purchase I 've ever made !! I gave it 1 star because no stars was n't an option .
 First off if your looking for a set of inserts that make your breast look bigger and that feel soft and natural , this is not it ! These are more like a very firm , thin , smooth set of small bra cups , and the clips that are supposed to hook them together in the middle were cut off of mine , however , I 've read in one of the other reviews that theirs were intact . The texture and flexibility is a little more like rubber than silicone . This should be advertised as a bra , not inserts . These are hard and small , they add maybe half a cup . Please do n't confuse these with Original Looks bra inserts , They are not the same . When I received them in my mailbox I knew there was a problem because the package was way too light to have what I was expecting in it , If your looking for smooth backless , strapless bra cups , that look nude under see through clothing and if your skin color happens to match the color , this may be just right for you . They also did n't seem sticky enough to stay on for a long period of time when worn alone , which may be why the clips have been removed and they are being marketed as inserts rather than a bra . If you need to increase your bust try `` Original looks bra inserts '' . I returned these and the customer service person was very courteous and understanding , she offered a refund , not a credit , I was very pleased about that . Shipping was very fast , they came in about 4 days .
 this bra insert is not an original invisi . the original invisi that i 'd seen is a bra like or breastlike held together as one . the piece that held it as one was cut - off .
 I like said about Item being reviewedOriginal Invisi Silicone Bra Inserts ~ Size C ~ NEW my wife did ' t like look so smale but page look nice thank you
 First off let me point out that there are little snaps -LRB- I just learned are for clevage enhancement -RRB- and sticky backs to these inserts , obviously not advertised . Second off I expected them to arrive in a box via UPS of FEDEX instead I find them both -LRB- I ordered two -RRB- crammed into my 6x6 mail box in nothing more than a manila envelope and with nothing but the flimsy plastic crushed into the inserts . Third off I was invited to write a review , which I did , but then I was called by a deals in motion sales somebody who `` Took it personal '' that I didnt call and adress the problem before making the review and to please erase it . So let me just say that if I hadnt needed them so bad for my halloween costume I would have sent them back and that the product isnt that bad but a little more effort on packaging and shipping could improve the first impression .
 The product by Invisi , advertised to be `` a silicone bra insert '' ... is NOT . It IS a extremely thin silicone shell with adhesive backing intended to be worn on the breast -LRB- with such tiny enhancement it could only be evident on lower elementary children . -RRB- This does me absolutely NO GOOD since I have breast cancer and needed it to fill in my bra cup on the side that was removed ! The photo appeared to be what I have bought in the past and I received a cartoon image in comparison . It 's bad enough to have the physical problem without the insult of bad advertising and photo representation !
 Not happy . this item is poorly packaged -- see other reviews -- but not damaged . I was also called . They suggested that I return them for credit , and that was nice.The problem is several in nature . One , they are so thin as to be useless . Two , the inside backing is so sticky that it is painful to remove . Painful . Three , you better get it right the first time because they are extremely difficult to move even a little bit . The material itself is fine , but just not enough of it to matter . I also bought the Invisilooks , and they are perfect .
 I purchased these inserts for a little lift . I am a C-Cup so I just wanted a little bounce back . The item shipped quite fast but I was very dissapointed when I opened the box . There were no instructions , no title even on the box -LRB- just clear plastic wrapped gel inserts -RRB- . I took the plastic off to insert them into a new bra that I also purchased off amazon and noticed that the gel inserts were covered in some form of sticky adhesive -LRB- on both sides -RRB- . If I put the insert into my bra it would stick perfectly to the bra but it would also adhere itself to my skin which was very uncomfortable . The adhesive was n't even that strong . It felt like taking a raw piece of steak and putting it into your bra . Ladies ... beware ... Spend your money on something that is not only better quality but more body-friendly !
 YOU NEED TO BUY SEVERAL PAIRS TO REALLY FILL OUT A `` C '' CUP AND GIVE REALISTIC CLEAVAGE . OTHER THAN THAT THEY ARE N'T TOO BAD AND FEEL PRETTY MUCH LIKE A BREAST BUT NOT TOTALLY . THEY ARE `` OKAY ''
 Oh , my goodness ... I cought them at about my knees . I had to sit down very quickly , run to the bathroom and take them both off . Good thing it was intermission durring a play and not a party . I followed the instructions . i will stick duct tape for now .
 the mask in the picture is what i wanted ! not the red splattered mask i got ! whoever painted this one should be fired ... so much red splatter the eye & teeth are almost covered , , , , , , very disappointed
 I did n't like these because the elastic is way too tight on the legs . It made the leg openings look like diapers and they cut into my skin and there is definitely a visible panty line . The only good thing about them is the fabric is soft .
 I never received this item . I waited a month for it . I was very disappointed ; it was a Christmas gift . I informed Eastbay and I was told that there was a problem with the order . I then asked that the order be canceled . I was told that they would need to ask Amazon to order the refund on my credit card . Please follow = up and let me know the status of this refund . Thank you .
 They were really cheap so I did n't expect too much to begin with , but with them selling them as `` replacement filters '' I thought there might be a chance in hell they 'd be legit ... Wrong . They are ancient and none of them look the same . Might make a good prop for a home-made film or something . Definitely a no-go for intended use .
 They were made for someone with a gigantic belly and no hips or seat . They fit terribly . Very uncomfortable . Not made for women . Made more for men with beer bellies .
 I really like Alia slacks . They are true to size and easy care . The pants that arrived were of some different material -LRB- micro-fiber -RRB- and looked like rags . REALLY DISAPPOINTING . The micro-fiber pants do n't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist is n't as comfortable either . I sent them back for a refund .

 My husband said they do not stay on his feet at all . He wears a size 11 shoe .
 should have sent it back ... I thought it was shorts not a shirt and the skirt ?? well lets just say someone size 1x or 2x ... it was way to short ... but on the bright side the gloves were cute and the robe is plenty big enough .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .

 It was comfortable , but did not fit at all like I had hoped it would . The cups had pretty much no support , and it even seemed like they had too much material . It sort of bunched up ... not attractive . I returned it .
 I do n't know what shape or size of breast this bra is designed for , but mine are definitely not it . If you want your girls held up in a loose fitting banana hammock , this is the bra for you . I tried to keep an open mind when I first put it on even though I was stupefied with incredulity , and thought maybe it looks good under a shirt . I put on a sweater , and thought ... `` oh , this is how older people get that weird look like their boobs have fallen down but the nipples still manage to point up '' . It 's not a bullet bra , but it 's a similar unnatural shape .
 The generic product description says that there are only 3 rows of hooks . Once you move up to the 38DD size , there are 4 . I know that an extra row does n't sound like a lot , but it makes a huge difference regarding the width of the backstrap . I went back to a 36 b/c I just wanted the three rows of hooks . If you can stand the 4 rows , this is a great bra for women with smaller frames and larger breasts . I found a good amount of support while still having a little movement . Most bras my size are granny-approved , so it is nice to have a lacy one that looks fresh .
 Perhaps this bra will work for those who are not very busty . For me 34DD , it gave me banana boobs . Good construction though , it looks like it would last a while if I actually wore it .
 Very scratchy fabric and very uncomfortable . The fit is nice , but I ca n't stand to have it on all day ! Ugh !
 Pros : ComfortableVery SupportiveNice Lace -LRB- Ca n't comment on durability - I returned it -RRB- Cons : SHAPEI found this bra to give my breasts a very bizarre shape . Not cone or bullet shaped , but definitely too perky - my breasts pointed up . If you look closely you can actually see the shape on the model in the picture . I did n't notice until I tried it on myself but then I looked back at the picture and sure enough - they point up . I think everyone has a different idea of an appropriate breast shape so my advice is to look very carefully at the picture being mindful of the shape - if it looks good to you then you might like it . It is also possible that with bigger breasts the extra gravity might balance out the extra lift and make a nice shape . -LRB- I am a 40D -RRB-
 The bras fit well but after a few times of wearing , the wire popped out .

 This hat is really really ugly and does not look like how it does in the picture . The front of it is way too tall , it looks like its meant for someone with a really tall deformed head ...

 i wear a small but first wash it got even smaller
 For something being advertised as a `` Long Beanie '' , I am extremely surprised at how short this hat is . I guess for the price it is good , but I would NOT recommend buying this product .
 I bought this to replace my white burton beanie . This one is just low quality and the fibers stretch and soon enough it does n't fit very well anymore and just does n't look that good . Buy it if you just want something cheap , and it 's fine for that . But to make it your main snowboarding beanie for example , you would be better off spending more and getting something that will last more than a month .
 My daughter got this to wear as part of a halloween costume . She only wore it a few times but it quickly became stretched out and useless . Now it would be a better pillow case than a cap !
 I just received these pajamas yesterday and was so disappointed . The blue on the screen looks pretty but in person these are a sensational metalic blue . Yikes ! They are way too big on me even though I bought the right size according to the merchants chart . They are so stiff & scratchy . I thought they 'd be softer like the ones I buy at Target from Gillian & Malley . I 'll be sending these back .
 My husband bought me these pjs . I had n't worn them but packed them in the bag to bring to the hospital after my daughter was born . Did I mention he got them a size to big to accomodate my pregnancy bloated-ness . I wore them for the first time at the hospital and they ripped . They are un-wearable after half a use . They 're flimsy and I actually was n't very fond of them anyways because the fabric made me feel like I had a plastic drapped around my body -LRB- it did NOT breathe ... even a little -RRB- . So do n't waste your money . These are not worth the packaging they come in .
 I bought 2 pajama sets , size small , for a xmas present . Both tops were like extra large and both bottoms were like extra small . I returned them at my cost -LRB- $ 10.00 -RRB- . Intimo did not correct the problem as promised or phone me back as promised . One month later , they emailed me that the sizing was correct . WHAT ??? Intimo issued me store credit . NO REFUNDS .

 I just received these pajamas yesterday and was so disappointed . The blue on the screen looks pretty but in person these are a sensational metalic blue . Yikes ! They are way too big on me even though I bought the right size according to the merchants chart . They are so stiff & scratchy . I thought they 'd be softer like the ones I buy at Target from Gillian & Malley . I 'll be sending these back .
 My husband bought me these pjs . I had n't worn them but packed them in the bag to bring to the hospital after my daughter was born . Did I mention he got them a size to big to accomodate my pregnancy bloated-ness . I wore them for the first time at the hospital and they ripped . They are un-wearable after half a use . They 're flimsy and I actually was n't very fond of them anyways because the fabric made me feel like I had a plastic drapped around my body -LRB- it did NOT breathe ... even a little -RRB- . So do n't waste your money . These are not worth the packaging they come in .
 I bought 2 pajama sets , size small , for a xmas present . Both tops were like extra large and both bottoms were like extra small . I returned them at my cost -LRB- $ 10.00 -RRB- . Intimo did not correct the problem as promised or phone me back as promised . One month later , they emailed me that the sizing was correct . WHAT ??? Intimo issued me store credit . NO REFUNDS .

 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 From description and picture it seems to be high quality but actual product is poor quality .
 I will be brief.They feel good , they fit well , but the price has gone up and I am not sure it isstill a good value .
 I bought these because one reviewer said he was tall and the shirts were good and long . I 'm only 5 ' 11 '' and after one washing they shrank up and wo n't tuck in good . I 'm long waisted , so the shirts will probably be fine for normal guys that are n't tall . The package also says generous length but they seem no longer than Hanes or other regular T-shirts .
 These undershirts are warm and comfy inside . However , I did not like that they shrink after washing a bit . Also , when I wear the undershirts , the v-neck always show up under any shirt or T-shirt that I wear . This was the main reason I bought the v-neck style , so that I can wear those undershirts under the T-shirt without showing that I wear them !!!
 The t-shirts are very scrathcy and poor cotton . I expected some shrinkage , but wow they barely fit now . Length is way too short now . They are very thin as well .
 I am not happy with the quality of the t-shirts . I wo n't have bought theseif I had touched and felt them at a real store . They are really coarse , bit soft cotton.I actually fell for the 2-for-1 kind of promotion and bought 4 packs for the price of 2 thinking they will last me long . But I am sorry to state that I will be returning them right away t oAmazon : -LRB- I am very sad ...
 No problems acquiring item . Cool enough for tropics and play their roll.However final conclusion '' ... WAY TOO EXPENSIVE ''
 I 'm a really skinny person so I bought the tee 's in a small and to my shock and dismay they hang off me ... They 're really comfortable but apparently I need an extra small or else I ca n't really wear them with anything and I definitely ca n't use them as an under shirt .
 When they arrived , I thought they looked like a Ladies Blouse as the V was very big . Larger than I expected . Did n't really notice the shrinkage as my wife washes with cold water and no dryer . We live in the Caribbean , so I did n't purchase them to be used as an undershirt . Two layers equals too hot . But the quality is lacking to be worn as a Tee . Expected better from a company like FOTL .
 Fair product for the value but pretty unrealistic . Way too much hair and very puffy ! Not one I 'd purchase again .
 the trousers never arrived to Venezuela , I have no information about where it can be
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .

 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .

 All the hardware on this bag fell off within 4 weeks . Like some Fendi bags it can not close securely , but the quality seemd poor to me anyway . The stitching has started to unravel as well in some areas.I have 3 year olf Loius Vuitton that look better than this bag . Not a good deal .

 I agree with the previous review that the main problem with ths product is that it rolls down under the bra and creates a roll/ridge across the rib cage -- not attractive ! I saw that they now offer what seems to be the same product but modified with little straps that hook over your bra which should alleviate the problem this version suffers from .
 My husband and I had a wedding to attend . I happen to be blessed and married to a very important man , and of course alot of eyes are on me.I wanted to look as good as I possibly could , so drove down to Nordstrom and purchased this in nude.I would have to say that overall , it did do some control , however not what it claimed . The top also continously kept rolling down -LRB- which defeats the purpose of these and makes you get a big bulge by your bra -RRB- -LCB- BIG DOWN FALL FOR ME -RCB- I do n't believe I will wear these much . Hard to put on.One good thing I will say , you ca n't see the seem by your legs and it lifts up your buttocks ok.Again , for the price I would have to tell you to save your money !
 I plan on exercising but I bought this to help boost my confidence . I ordered these right from spanx and just recieved this yesterday . It did -LRB- ok -RRB- for the first day but today forget it . It rolls down the back and it doesnt smooth anything out . You have to keep pulling the back part up . The legs look like someone took sizzers to them and chopped them off . Maybe they have something better than these . I hope so because I want my money back .

 I first received the wrong product . I contacted the company multiple times , with no response . They then sent me another package of products that I also did not order and said that they would send me the right product when they had in stock . I needed these shorts for something specific , and the time has already passed . I contacted the company again , and again received no response.I would like to refund , but Amazon will not help me out either . I will never order from Amazon again .

 Back of hat does not read `` make the nail bleed '' as stated in the advertiment , but rather Dead on Tools . I was very disappointed .
 Ok i bought the hammer , thought it was cool being pro-america and labelled `` American to the bone . `` Then I got the hat and it 's MADE IN CHINA . Thats a load of crap and Dead On Tools is a bunch of sellouts . If you want to support overseas market share increase and put Americans out of a job buy this product !
 What ! $ 17 for a baseball cap - you are nuts . How poser chic . Skulls and death are so ... yesterday .
 I agree with the last poster , the seams on the cup are way too visible thru t-shirts ! Also I do n't like the satin poly fabric , looks very cheap . I do n't know why the listing title says `` cotton bra '' because the only part that 's cotton is the lining . Misleading.The cups are a little too pointy for my taste . I like a rounded cup . Basically if you do n't like the look of an overdone breast -LRB- unnatural -RRB- , do n't get this one .

 Coat is well made except for the zipper . within a week of wearing the jacket , the zipper teeth broke towards the bottom & can no longer be zipped . The jacket was not worn for work , so a lot of tension was not put on it .
 I ordered the biggest size and yet the shirt was so short the sleeves barely made it past my elbows . The bottoms were a different story they were long enough to pull up almost to my arm-pits . If you regularly need a `` long '' size then defiantly pass on these !
 And on the Amazon website , the product description says can be machine washed , but the label says hand wash only .
 Bought these for my husband last year . He 's worn them a few times , likes the feel . Unfortunatly I got him red -LRB- go Rutgers ! -RRB- and when he wears them he ends up with a nice pink pair of underwear . I 'd think for the money they would n't bleed .

 The way the products are linked together is misleading . All the sizes on the page make it very hard to tell what are the junior and what are the kids sizes . thought I was ordering one , got the other . Price and quality where great though . I would have spent more sending them back than I spent buying them . So I have 3 pair of worthless shorts now .
 I got these for my daughter as her swim yeam uniform . They are a terrible cut . They look really like old school gym shorts .
 I was looking for some gym shorts for my little girl . These said they were for children . The shorts were adult size . I was stuck with them as to ship them back would cost more that I paid for them . I threw them in the garbage .
 IT WAS MY MISTAKE . I DID N'T REALIZE THAT THIS ITEM WAS &#34; JUNIOR &#34; SO OF COURSE THEY DID N'T FIT . I DID N'T HAVE A PACKING ORDER SO I COULD N'T RETURN THEM . I 'LL FIND SOME SMALL PERSON TO GIVE THEM TO .
 I ordered 4 pairs of LARGE , and the shorts are way too small -- might fit a 10 year old !
 Is this a joke or what ? These are n't an adult X-large they are a childs medium . It wo n't pay to send them back because of the shipping so I wasted $ 7.99 on a cleaning rag .
 I got this for my 3 year old and the size was fine but the dress was extremely uncomfortable . It is a very thin piece of rough fabric with a piece of felt underneath . The wig looks nothing like the wig in the picture , it is also very cheaply made and my daughter would n't even wear it . I could n't believe it had a nick jr tag on it and it was so cheap . I would stay away from this product or you will definitely have buyer 's remorse .

 We loved this ring , but it started leaking with a day or so of receipt : - -LRB-
 I ordered this item on October 5 . It was supposed to have been delivered within the window on Oct. 10-18 . I e-mailed e-toys twice and received no response . Finally , on October 25 , it came in the mail , just in time for Halloween . I wo n't be using this seller again .

 I was looking to save some money when I bought this bra . I normally buy Wacoal minimizers but was short on cash so I got this one instead . I measured my exactg size , and it fit fine when it came but honestly , it didnt minimize anything . A friend commented the first night I wore it that my breasts looked really big tonight . Not what I wanted to hear while wearing a brand spanking new minimizer bra . She was right , they lifted everything up really well , but as for minimizing ... nada . I 'll stick with Wacoal , they are expensive , but sooooo worth it .
 This is a comfortable bra , but the wires were sticking up from between the cups . If they could make this without wires and still the have the support I would have kept it .
 I wanted a more comfy bra for daily wear , this rubs and chafes where an under wire would usually go.Pretty uncomfortable at at the end of the day . It does hod everything in place , though , pretty firm support .
 have always worn this bra and have always bought it at JC Penny in the mall -- trying to save what little money I had I bought it -- every time I put it on it gave me the most awful red oozing rash I was in agony -- I had to go back to wearing the old falling apart bra till I can save to buy a new one -- very frustrating
 Loved the bra but the fit was n't good at all . It definately ran small . Had to return it . Will definately look at other Bali products .
 Not happy . The bra is nice enough , but the underwire comes up too high or something - it sticks out and shows when I put clothing on - any kind , t-shirt , dress blouse , whatever ! And I bought this to wear with clothing ! : - / Bought 2 , 2 are going back . I 'll watch for this `` high center '' on any other bras I purchase , though I have had no problem with it in the past . Perhaps my increased cup size has something to do with this -LRB- went from C to D -RRB- though I highly doubt it .
 I did the whole measuring thing and then ordered that size . Did n't even come close to fitting me . I knew this was something I should n't buy online . Most uncomfortable bra ever !
 The minimizing part works great . I found the stitching to still be itchy after 3 washes .
 did not meet my requirements . cant compare to edith lances minimizer.i cant use it .
 I ORDERED MY CORRECT BRA SIZE . WHEN I RECEIVED MY ORDER IT WAS TOO SMALL ! NOW I HAVE BRAS THAT I CA N'T USE.Bali Women 's Satin Tracings Minimizer Underwire Bra # 3562
 Dealing with this seller is a disaster.I never got the bra.I will never buy anything from this seller again .
 Although this is a well constructed -LRB- heavy duty -RRB- bra , the profile this bra creates is very retro . The seaming across the center of the breast creates a very pointy look . Not the smoother rounder look that is popular today . It also needs to be hand washed because of the seaming which tends to shrink and pucker after washing . I would not recommend this bra .
 I 've worn this bra for 20 years . No more !! Bali has shortened the straps on this bra and eliminated their adjustment feature , making the bra miserable to wear . -LRB- Was this done to save fabric costs ? Or did they send me the super petite model ? I 'm 5 ' 6 '' tall . -RRB- It digs into my armpits and tries to pull up to my neck because the straps are too short . Also , the underwires at the front of the cups poke out in front because they 're too high . They should be cut down at the center by at least 2 inches , about mid breast level . From under my clothes it looks like a 3rd bump poking out . This is the end of my brand loyalty . I 'm looking for a new bra and a new maker .
 Disappointed with this bra . The fit is not good and the underwire digs into my rib cage which I 've neve experienced before . It could be that this bra is just not suitable for my body type .
 We loved this ring , but it started leaking with a day or so of receipt : - -LRB-
 Disappointed with this bra . The fit is not good and the underwire digs into my rib cage which I 've neve experienced before . It could be that this bra is just not suitable for my body type .
 Loved the bra but the fit was n't good at all . It definately ran small . Had to return it . Will definately look at other Bali products .
 This is a comfortable bra , but the wires were sticking up from between the cups . If they could make this without wires and still the have the support I would have kept it .
 I wanted a more comfy bra for daily wear , this rubs and chafes where an under wire would usually go.Pretty uncomfortable at at the end of the day . It does hod everything in place , though , pretty firm support .
 have always worn this bra and have always bought it at JC Penny in the mall -- trying to save what little money I had I bought it -- every time I put it on it gave me the most awful red oozing rash I was in agony -- I had to go back to wearing the old falling apart bra till I can save to buy a new one -- very frustrating
 I was looking to save some money when I bought this bra . I normally buy Wacoal minimizers but was short on cash so I got this one instead . I measured my exactg size , and it fit fine when it came but honestly , it didnt minimize anything . A friend commented the first night I wore it that my breasts looked really big tonight . Not what I wanted to hear while wearing a brand spanking new minimizer bra . She was right , they lifted everything up really well , but as for minimizing ... nada . I 'll stick with Wacoal , they are expensive , but sooooo worth it .

 Not happy . The bra is nice enough , but the underwire comes up too high or something - it sticks out and shows when I put clothing on - any kind , t-shirt , dress blouse , whatever ! And I bought this to wear with clothing ! : - / Bought 2 , 2 are going back . I 'll watch for this `` high center '' on any other bras I purchase , though I have had no problem with it in the past .

 I ordered the biggest size and yet the shirt was so short the sleeves barely made it past my elbows . The bottoms were a different story they were long enough to pull up almost to my arm-pits . If you regularly need a `` long '' size then defiantly pass on these !
 And on the Amazon website , the product description says can be machine washed , but the label says hand wash only .
 Bought these for my husband last year . He 's worn them a few times , likes the feel . Unfortunatly I got him red -LRB- go Rutgers ! -RRB- and when he wears them he ends up with a nice pink pair of underwear . I 'd think for the money they would n't bleed .

 I guess this shirt features some beautiful artwork , but do they make a men 's version ? I 'm thinking like `` The Keymaster '' or something a little less Georgia O'Keeffe and a little more Conan the Destroyer . I want a shirt that 's masculine , but not quite as powerful as a Breakthrough Wolf to round out my semi-casual wardrobe and to be honest the last thing I want is some purple sniz fairy bursting out of my chest like a baby alien .

 To be honest , I was enticed by the thought of owning a $ 100 jacket for $ 19.95 . Unfortunately , jackets of this quality are available at Wal-Mart for less than $ 20.00 and I passed on them.I do n't find this jacket to be very well designed . To protect against rain , you had better be sure and keep the hood on tight . Otherwise , the fuzzy fabric lining the hood gets drenched . But put the hood on and your hair is going to stand on end for the rest of the day because of the static the lining creates . Leave the hood off and it looks pretty unflattering as it does n't hang neatly against your back . Wish I had passed on this one .

 did not meet my requirements . cant compare to edith lances minimizer.i cant use it .
 I ORDERED MY CORRECT BRA SIZE . WHEN I RECEIVED MY ORDER IT WAS TOO SMALL ! NOW I HAVE BRAS THAT I CA N'T USE.Bali Women 's Satin Tracings Minimizer Underwire Bra # 3562
 Dealing with this seller is a disaster.I never got the bra.I will never buy anything from this seller again .
 Although this is a well constructed -LRB- heavy duty -RRB- bra , the profile this bra creates is very retro . The seaming across the center of the breast creates a very pointy look . Not the smoother rounder look that is popular today . It also needs to be hand washed because of the seaming which tends to shrink and pucker after washing . I would not recommend this bra .
 Loved the bra but the fit was n't good at all . It definately ran small . Had to return it . Will definately look at other Bali products .
 This is a comfortable bra , but the wires were sticking up from between the cups . If they could make this without wires and still the have the support I would have kept it .
 I wanted a more comfy bra for daily wear , this rubs and chafes where an under wire would usually go.Pretty uncomfortable at at the end of the day . It does hod everything in place , though , pretty firm support .
 have always worn this bra and have always bought it at JC Penny in the mall -- trying to save what little money I had I bought it -- every time I put it on it gave me the most awful red oozing rash I was in agony -- I had to go back to wearing the old falling apart bra till I can save to buy a new one -- very frustrating
 I was looking to save some money when I bought this bra . I normally buy Wacoal minimizers but was short on cash so I got this one instead . I measured my exactg size , and it fit fine when it came but honestly , it didnt minimize anything . A friend commented the first night I wore it that my breasts looked really big tonight . Not what I wanted to hear while wearing a brand spanking new minimizer bra . She was right , they lifted everything up really well , but as for minimizing ... nada . I 'll stick with Wacoal , they are expensive , but sooooo worth it .
 Disappointed with this bra . The fit is not good and the underwire digs into my rib cage which I 've neve experienced before . It could be that this bra is just not suitable for my body type .
 Beware , you get a deep chestnut or chocolate brown -LRB- box stamped
 I bought these for my husband to use to decorate his Harley for the Susan G Komen 3 Day for the Cure in Seattle . He works on the Route Safety Crew keeping we walkers safe at intersections and elsewhere on the route . The did the job but are very flimsy ! I am not actually sure what other people use these for , but they are a one-time use item for our purpose . I expected them to be more solid , or better made .
 I 've worn this bra for 20 years . No more !! Bali has shortened the straps on this bra and eliminated their adjustment feature , making the bra miserable to wear . -LRB- Was this done to save fabric costs ? Or did they send me the super petite model ? I 'm 5 ' 6 '' tall . -RRB- It digs into my armpits and tries to pull up to my neck because the straps are too short . Also , the underwires at the front of the cups poke out in front because they 're too high . They should be cut down at the center by at least 2 inches , about mid breast level . From under my clothes it looks like a 3rd bump poking out . This is the end of my brand loyalty . I 'm looking for a new bra and a new maker .

 Not happy . The bra is nice enough , but the underwire comes up too high or something - it sticks out and shows when I put clothing on - any kind , t-shirt , dress blouse , whatever ! And I bought this to wear with clothing ! : - / Bought 2 , 2 are going back . I 'll watch for this `` high center '' on any other bras I purchase , though I have had no problem with it in the past .

 These socks are not made of combed cotton as advertised , and they contain 17 % Polyester , which is not even listed as containing . They are very cheap feeling socks . They are already beginning to `` pill '' as polyester does over time . This is exactly the type of sock I prefer to stay away from . This has to be the worst quality Gold Toe product I have ever seen .
 I was looking to find some high quality socks that would last for a few years -LRB- like the old style wigwam cotton socks ; NOT the low quality stuff wigwam is selling now -RRB- instead of weeks or months . Thus , I tried the grey style Gold Toe socks and the first pair shows holes after a few weeks . They are certainly comfortable but seem otherwise average . Taken into a account the higher than average price this results in only two stars .
 If these are gold toe I am supprised . Four of the 24 socks have worn out on the first use . Very dissappointed .
 the trousers never arrived to Venezuela , I have no information about where it can be
 I ordered these for my daughters to wear under costumes so they could be modest while changing backstage between scenes . They normally wear misses size 4-6 . The mediums were so small the fabric was see-through across the butt . Did n't work for our purposes at all .

 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .
 The material was very cheap and not lasting . For the amount of money , it could have been a little more durable . The color was kind of pretty.States the bottom is a thong - Incorrect - It is a string bikini . I felt like was was misled and paid too much for what it actually turned out to be .
 I am very upset , i only received the left hand and i have a shoot in 2 days , was looking forward to using them but with only 1 glove , i wont be able to enjoy it .
 I ordered two of the same costume , I was charged for two of the same costume , and one costume arrived . Had I not called and complained , they would have never refunded my money . When I inquired as to why I only received one costume , I was told that they were sold out . In my opinion , when you realize you ca n't ship what was ordered , you send an email , call , or refund money to the patron . They did none of the above and actually were bothered and sounded inconvenienced that I was complaining and asking for a 50 % refund -LRB- since I only received 50 % of my order -RRB- . Use caution when ordering from them !

 We bought this for our daughter since she loves Dora and putting things in and out of bags . What a ripoff ! The flashlight can work a little , but I can barely get it to work half the time , forget about anyone under 5 making it light . The button has to be pushed down just right , and you can tell the parts are moving around inside to where it wo n't work . The 2 binoculars sections are held together by velcro , I 'm sure for safety reasons , but we ca n't get them to stay together . It just keeps falling apart . The bag and magnifying case are okay , I suppose , but altogether , certainly not worth $ 20 . Save your money !
 i bougt this for my kids but it they dont like it even i had to agree its the uglieset dora thing ive seen

 This belt is not real leather came apart after only a few uses . Studs fall off . Eyelets fall out . overall low quality . I do not recommend .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 I called the company to get more information before purchasing . I was told that this hat was for an adult . The label did read `` adult size '' , but the hat was for a child .
 the trousers never arrived to Venezuela , I have no information about where it can be
 After reading the reviews for this product I thought I 'd give it a try -- the bra did not fit well at all so back it went !

 A great idea but these clips do n't work . My son also takes it right off . The plastic cord is stiff and very uncomfortable on his neck .
 I really liked the idea of being able to turn an ordinary napkin or towel into a bib . However , the `` strings '' that go around the neck are a stiff rubber like material and it will not lay flat around the neck and down the back . Therefore , whenever my son leans back in his high-chair the `` strings '' poke the seat or his head . It bothers him so much that he pulls it off . And since the clips are not very strong , the towel or cloth comes right off . I sent this product back .
 My nine month old can get this off in 3 seconds flat . She thinks this is the best game ever . The clips are too weak to hold anything . I am taking this back today .
 I first saw this in a catalog a few years ago and thought , if I ever have another baby I 'm ordering this ! Flash forward a few years as I sit with my 11 month old in a restaurant with a dirty bib and remember this product . I just received it in the mail today from amazon and stuffed it in the diaper bag as we headed out to dinner . I proudly pulled out this ingenious little gadget and put the napkin carefully in the clips . My son reached up and effortlessly removed the napkin from the clip . I looked at it again to make sure I had put enough of the fabric in the clip to hold it tightly , gave a little extra squeeze and put it back on him . Again he removed the napkin . So long story short , great idea but needs some work . For the $ 12 price tag , I think it should at least hold onto something !
 They look cute . But . String are very stiff . They are sticking out behind the neck and does bother my 20 months old daughter and distract her while she is supposed to eat her meal.Clips ... . very hard to use , too shallow maybe , do n't grip much . My daughter enjoy pulling off napkin.Very disappointed .
 received as a gift my on the small side 1 yr old was able to pull a clip completely off the apparatus in 1 second which can then be a chocking hazard !!! We never even got to try it for it 's intended use .
 I love the concept but the implementation does not work well . It is uncomfortable for the kids , so they tend to take it off . I bought these for our European trip
 my 14 month old could easily remove the bib from the clip within seconds . I had to return it .

 Looked like a nice shirt , but comes out wrinkled from the dryer.I do n't recommend this shirt unless you want to iron polos .
 I 've been wearing XLs from all the other retailers for years , but this last order - they literally choked ! Not good at all , had to discard the two I bought .
 I liked it when I first bought it and wore it but after I washed it once all the elastic started shredding from it ... couldnt wear it again . For look and feel I gave it 4 stars but for usage I give it none .

 Purchased this bag in mid-November of 08 ' for my daughter in 5th grade . A week ago -LRB- less than 2 months -RRB- the aluminum handle pulled right out of the backpack . The bag has only been used for 6 weeks , as Christmas break was 2 weeks of non-use . The bag seems very high-quality . The bag itself is well made . However , I will definitely not purchase another.Kudos to Amazon for issuing a replacement bag immediately . If the bag were not replaced I would have purchased another brand .
 Gave this to my son for his birthday and the handle broke off in one week .
 I just purchased on 7/24/2007 for the 2007-2008 school year and already the handle on the bag is broken . I like the material and the straps , but this should n't be happening already .

 while the pant was an excellent cut and a nice fit , my husband does not like the material of the pant they collect lint and losses its color after one wash . buyers beware !!
 I usually get my bra extenders at Joannes Fabric . I was shocked by the thickness and scratchiness of these bra extenders . They made a lump that you could actually see through my shirts . They dont lay flat and they are big , lumpy and scratchy .
 The product should have had more information as to the width of the item , it is indeed a 3 hook bra extender however it was way to wide for my bra . This could have been avoided with a more detailed discription .
 After reading the reviews for this product I thought I 'd give it a try -- the bra did not fit well at all so back it went !
 This belt is very cheaply made . Thought it was going to be a good present , but in turn , ended up braking as soon as it was put on . Only thing good I can say is they shipped fast .

 I ordered infant size and what I got is a costume that can fit a 3 year old . Very disappointed .
 I received the Elmo costume in the mail , and it was USED . I paid $ 49 and did not expect a used costume at this price . The package had been opened and the costume had stains on the Elmo eyes . The fur on the costume was matted down as well and looked like it might have been washed in a washing machine . It ran very small in size . My son is a very slender 2-year-old and we could barely zip it up . My son wore this to his preschool halloween party . The only reason I did not return this is that my 2-year-old son did n't know the difference , and neither did the other kids at the party . It should have been advertised as used and it should not have been $ 49 .
 Bought this item in a size 2T for my 18 month old son . Item was small and EXTREMELY itchy . He refused to wear it because it was scratchy . Elmo 's eyes and nose do not sit properly to be seen on the head . Total waste of money and seller had ridiculous return policy with 30 % restocking fee . Terrible experience .
 I ordered this for my son -LRB- 18 months -RRB- and the fit is good , and it is made of a heavier material so I know he has a good chance of staying warm . Although the length is good , there is elastic in the ankles and wrists that seemed a bit tight and left marks in his skin after wearing it for only a couple of minutes to try it on . For my own piece of mind , I would have to cut the elastic if he were going to wear it for a longer time . Even though it is plenty long enough , the zipper is right up to his face/neck . The nose is a much lighter shade of orange than in the picture and the eyes and nose are crooked on the hood . As a consumer I am not happy with this purchase and I am considering returning it . My son loves Elmo but does n't seem too excited by the costume so I am glad I bought a second costume.I am sad because I was very excited about dressing my son as Elmo for Halloween and I was going to wear Oscar the Grouch and now we wont be able to do that . I truly was excited about the idea of him being Elmo and this costume seemed great when I first opened the package . I was willing to overlook the pale orange -LRB- almost peach colored -RRB- nose and the fact that they were off center because the costume seemed like it would be warm and the other quality was very nice . After trying it on him and seeing the marks from the elastic and seeing how high the zipper goes I am not so impressed and willing .
 This wig looks much better in the advertised picture than when it got to my house . The curls did not look good and the quality was poor .
 I do not think much of this item . It seemed small and not well made at all . Do not order .
 I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF THESE DIRECTLY FROM THE VENDOR AND THEY WERE OKAY , THESE HOWEVER WERE SLOPPILY SEWN , I HAD TO REPAIR ONE OF THEM , I USE THE AT WORK TO KEEP GREASE AND DIRT OUT OF MY HAIR-I 'M A MECHANIC . I DO N'T KNOW BUYING SOME THINGS OVER THE INTERNET IS VERY LIKE GAMBLING . THE ITEMS ARE SO MINISCULE , I 'M NOT BOTHERING TO ASK FOR EXCHANE OR REFUND . I TOOK MY CHANCES .
 These pants were described as having a 29 inch inseam but actually have a 32 inch inseam for the 2X size . Too long for my short legs !
 I am a 5 ' 10 &#34; , 163lb guy . I order the medium adidas break away warmup pants , they were about a foot to long!I play tennis , these must be made for basketball players . If you are under 5 ' 7 &#34; you will have to have the small pants tailored .
 Had to return this product because the inseam was too long . Usually the inseam is 29.5 inch for medium size but this one was 32 inches long . The material and quality was great though . I will pay a few dollars more and order one of these from adidas.com .
 I have only had the pants for a month , Maybe less and the top snap is broke . For 50.00 I would expect a lot more .
 Am I the only one who received regular Adidas warm up pants ? The description clearly states tearaway pants , which these were not . Cut slightly small as well
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 Sizes seem to be way off on this product . Not good quality . Got this product and it was dirty and could not get it clean . Seemed like I needed to order a bigger size than my normal fitted cap size for it to fit .
 I am very upset that I received a wrong size not even close to what I ordered . Now I am waiting for an exchange .
 I was thinking these would be a bit more understated , slacks to work - but , they are so shiny that I have n't worn them . They do fit true to size . Definitely wish this was a blend and less disco .
 We too wish the Levi-strauss Action slacks were still available . We ordered these in the heather gray , and the color we received was much too light . Evidently they do n't make the darker gray any more . We had to return them .
 I ordered a black and a blue pair of the Dockers levi action slack . The male part of the fastner fell off the Black pair the first time I wore them.I was disappointed that the quality was not as good as they used to be .
 The cut of these pants makes them feel as if they are at least a size too small . They are uncomfortable .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .

 I bought this costume for my 6 month old son . The material is very cheap looking and the costume looked like to already used . The materials made the costume look cheap and for the money it definitely was not worth it . My 2 year old niece could of made a better costume . So buyer . beware .

 I tried it on , fits well , good support and tummy control , great under clothes ... BUT HOW DO I GO TO BATHROOM WITH THIS ON ??? I would have to take off my top and remove it all the way to go to the bathroom . If I knew it did n't have a snap on off bottom , I would n't of bought it . My fault and waste of money .

I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .

 I was thinking these would be a bit more understated , slacks to work - but , they are so shiny that I have n't worn them . They do fit true to size . Definitely wish this was a blend and less disco .
 We too wish the Levi-strauss Action slacks were still available . We ordered these in the heather gray , and the color we received was much too light . Evidently they do n't make the darker gray any more . We had to return them .
 I ordered a black and a blue pair of the Dockers levi action slack . The male part of the fastner fell off the Black pair the first time I wore them.I was disappointed that the quality was not as good as they used to be .
 The cut of these pants makes them feel as if they are at least a size too small . They are uncomfortable .
 I am very upset that I received a wrong size not even close to what I ordered . Now I am waiting for an exchange .

 I am a long-time Amazon customer and recently began searching for leathermouse pads as gifts for my employees and our clients . Found this item andjust want to share a note of caution with you : Bonded Leather , or `` Reconstituted Leather '' is not really a true leatherbut a man-made material composed of 60 % to 90 % leather fibers -LRB- often scrapfrom leather tanneries -RRB- . Bonded leather is not as durable as genuineleathers , and is recommended for use only if the product will be usedinfrequently . -LRB- data from WIKIPEDIA online -RRB- There are many true genuine leather mouse pads from other vendors and atbetter prices ! Amazon may also have some , keep searching , but rememberonly the words `` GENUINE LEATHER '' or equal terminology should appear inthe description .

 should have sent it back ... I thought it was shorts not a shirt and the skirt ?? well lets just say someone size 1x or 2x ... it was way to short ... but on the bright side the gloves were cute and the robe is plenty big enough .

 The nylon is good , the chain is cheap , the key clasp is worthless , and most of all it does n't fit dollars in . Its not wide enough .
 This wallet was well made , but a FOOT long . Who has back pockets that big ? Not me ... I returned it . If you wan na keep a wallet in a briefcase or somewhere else , maybe this is for you ... as for me ... NOT !
 I was expecting something the size of a standard man 's wallet , but this is way longer than that . I ended up buying another wallet at a local -LRB- not online -RRB- merchant in order to avoid repeating this mistake .

 The actual item is much shorter than what is pictured and is barely a top . The material is rough and the elastic is thin . This is poor quality even with the discounted price .
 the lace was very itchy and it was n't as long as it looks in the picture
 The hat is advertized for use in the jungle or at the beach , however , the manufacturer states in the directions that came with the hat , `` Do Not Get Wet '' and `` Do Not Wash '' . This is not stated on the product web page.It is also not clear that headgear can not be returned . There is no size chart to help you choose which size to get.I will no longer purchase from Panama Jack .

I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .
 Does n't look as good as picture . Better off buying high quality lingerie from VS or Fredericks Hollywood .
 the size charts shown are completely wrong . i order size 6 and the panties were big enough to fit my over weight aunt . it 's ridiculous i had to give them to her . on top of that the quality is so poor .
 The hat is advertized for use in the jungle or at the beach , however , the manufacturer states in the directions that came with the hat , `` Do Not Get Wet '' and `` Do Not Wash '' . This is not stated on the product web page.It is also not clear that headgear can not be returned . There is no size chart to help you choose which size to get.I will no longer purchase from Panama Jack .
 I am very upset that I received a wrong size not even close to what I ordered . Now I am waiting for an exchange .
 I was thinking these would be a bit more understated , slacks to work - but , they are so shiny that I have n't worn them . They do fit true to size . Definitely wish this was a blend and less disco .
 We too wish the Levi-strauss Action slacks were still available . We ordered these in the heather gray , and the color we received was much too light . Evidently they do n't make the darker gray any more . We had to return them .
 I ordered a black and a blue pair of the Dockers levi action slack . The male part of the fastner fell off the Black pair the first time I wore them.I was disappointed that the quality was not as good as they used to be .
 The cut of these pants makes them feel as if they are at least a size too small . They are uncomfortable .

 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .

 I read the reviews , some good and some bad . I decided to try it since it just for a school project . The scarf is so small it does not even fit my 2 year old and I bought it for my 7 year old . The glasses are so cheeply made . If you are going to put a screw in something to hold it together it should go all the way trough to the end . Please do n't waste your money
 I bought this for my daughter 's Wax museum book report on Amelia Earhart . The scarf was about 14 inches and just a piece of ribbon with a bit of fringe sewn on . We had to buy another scarf . The hat part is made out of velvety fabric not at all what I expected . I was expecting a vinyl . The goggles were pretty bad too .
 The item in the package is NOT what was pictured . The helmet is cheap black and velvet looking , not at all what is pictured . The goggles look like make shift harry potter glasses with a strap and the scarf is much smaller and much cheaper looking than pictured . DO NOT BUY this product , it is not worth the 13 dollars and shipping .
 I should have read the reviews before ordering . This is a cloth hat not leather like as it shows in pic and scarf is much shorter and fringe all messed up . It 's alright but you 're not getting what is shown .
 I bought this for a book report my son was doing on Amelia Earhart . It is garbage . Cheap googles that broke immediately and had to be rigged up and a little piece of material that is the scarf .
 This was an economically price costume piece , but the actual product fell far short of my expectations . The hat is not made out of a leather-like material at all and was n't even shiny , it was a mate poly-blend of some kind . The goggles did have lenses , but the plasic had foam around the goggle part.We used it for a minor part in a play , so from a distance it looked alright.Overall it was a cheap price , but it was also a cheap product .
 I bought this set for my son 's book report mainly because of the white scarf . The scarf is not a scarf because it does not fit around a neck . It is so cheaply made that it is already falling apart a soon as you open the bag .
 This costume was barely sufficient for one use . The goggles broke even before my daughter used them for her biography presentation . I hot glued them together for the day of her presentation , but by the end of the day , the foam had completely separated from the goggles . They are going in the trash . The cap is holding up fine , but the scarf started unravelling immediately . This costume was fine for a young child to use once . The scarf is very short and would not fit well on a larger child or adult .
 Bought this item for a costume party and wish I would have seen the review stating it is not what it appears . In the picture the hat looks like it could be fake leather for something with substance , it is in fact made of cheap thin fabric . The scarf is very short and the goggles are even cheaper . I looked everywhere for this costume online and this appeared to be the best one . It 's not .
 purchased 5 3-pack vneck men 's munsingwear t-shirts , similar experience to others -- most of the t-shirts were similar to the quality I 've expected and received for years from this brand , except for 2 of the t-shirts that were 1-2 sizes smaller - as in skintight and 5 inches shorter than all the rest . Marked `` L '' , but nowhere near that in size . Researching other brands now ; hate to switch , and the price is fine , but I 'm looking for quality similar to what munsingwear used to offer .
 I second everything `` Honest Review '' said about these shirts . My husband also wore this kind of Munsingwear shirt for years and loved them . All of a sudden , the `` tags '' disappeared , the `` label '' was printed on the back of the shirt , and the shirts now shrink in length something like 3 inches ... and that is just on the first wash -LRB- in warm , not hot water -RRB- . Someone needs to get to Munsingwear about their quality control !!
 Length :
 We have ordered these T-shirts for my husband three times and they are the only type that he likes but this time we are extremely disappointed . They are so much shorter and just do n't fit right . They are also not near as soft as they usually are . WE would like to be able to return them but he likes everything washed before he wears it and I have already washed them . Anyway , we wo n't be ordering anymore . That is way too much money for the quality of the T-shirts !
 This latest set is much skimpier than the ones I bought previously . They are too short -LRB- do n't stay tucked in -RRB- and too small -LRB- seem more like a Large or even a Medium -RRB- .

 Way too too small . I bought for my daughter who goes to school overseas . Not big enough to carry anything . We will use for picnics .
 My 4 year old daughter received this as her birthday gift . She ooh & ahhed when she was opening it , but it was very small on her . She really loved it & wanted to wear it , but moments after she put it on , she took it right off . It 's marked for ages 3 & up , but it 's more appropriate for age 3 to 3 1/2 . The skirt is only knee length but the display photo of the outfit on the package does not let you see that it is only knee-length . It may be all right for a 3 year old , but at the age of 4 , prepare to pass it on .
 I purchased this item , and chose a size -LRB- medium -RRB- that , according to manufacturer sizing charts , was supposed to fit . My understanding about garments is that if they ride up or curl down , they 're too small . Spanx ' error in this regard is really inexcusable , given the price of their items . I ca n't recommend this item , even if you were to buy a larger size than you think you need , because I do n't know if that would prevent the rolling problem . I have found that even wearing a Spanx shaper underneath or over is no guarantee -- in fact , the top of the pants rolled DOWN even while the camisole was rolling UP !
 I have to say , I 'm not as impressed as the other reviewers with Tenderly . I 'd tried Urad , which I was impressed with -LRB- despite the weird pine-needle smell -RRB- , and I thought perhaps Tenderly would work much better than other typical leather conditioners . Alas , this seems to work pretty much just as well as any other leather conditioner that costs a lot less . You still have to use multiple applications to really soften the leather , and while it is n't particularly greasy , it is n't grease-less , it still leaves some residue . If it was n't $ 15 , I 'd give it 3 stars , but at $ 15 for a little tub , I 'd say this is a rip-off . Just buy some cheaper leather lotion from your local leather shop .
 ALL OLGA BRAS RUN SMALL ... FOR SOME REASON , OLGA BRAS ARE MADE SMALL ON THE SIDES OF THE CUP . . I AM A 36 DD , NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BALI , ETC. . . I HAVE TRIED MANY OLGA BRAS ON AND HAVE ALSO TRIED ON A NEXT LARGER CUP SIZE , I HAVE TRIED GOING DOWN A BAND SIZE AND UP THE CUP SIZE , OR WHATEVER , STILL USELESS FOR ME ANYWAY . . IT 'S JUST NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR ME . . I WAS TOLD BY 2 FITTERS , IF YOU ARE A 36 DD , YOU ARE A 36 DD , THAT IS THAT . SOME BRANDS ARE JUST NOT RIGHT FOR YOU , SO DO N'T TRY CHANGING THE SIZES ... I AGREE ... THANK YOU , GOOD LUCK
 The strap loops and strap adjusters triggered a severe nickel allergy on my back where they touch the skin . There should be a warning on the tag but there is n't . If you have a Nickel allergy do not buy this . In most bras these connectors and adjusters are covered with or use plastic . This is bare metal and contains enough Nickel for an almost instant breakout .
 Ordered a 38D for someone who has always been a 38D and it was too small . The tags were already off so it can not be returned . Wo n't be doing business with these folks again soon .
 This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable . The lace cups is n't feel like flour sack material .
 I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this bra . It does n't just run on the small side , the sizes are completely off . Believe us , the cup size is about 2 sizes smaller than should be . If you order a `` D '' cup in this bra , you will get the equivalent of a `` B '' cup , I went so far as to measure it against a `` B '' cup and they were approximately the same size . Save you money , time , and return postage .
 The sizing is seriously off on this item . I am on the small side of a 36D and prefer minimizer bras . Although I always wearing bras on the tightest hook , on even on the loosest hook , this bra was too tight . The D cup fit like a B cup .
 The outer lace on this bra began ripping on the first wear and now there are little rips 1-2 inches all over the cups of the bra . Disappointing to say the least
 I bought my first subway shirt in NYC in 2002 -- well made , heavy cotton , good fit . Loved it . I wore it a lot , even to work -LRB- warehouse , dock work -RRB- and it held up very well , received a lot of comments on it . Ordered another one for my son a couple years later , same quality . But when I finally had to replace my old shirt earlier this year , I received something completely different -- these things are now made about as cheaply as a shirt can be made . No longer a heavy-duty cotton , but a flimsy material that feels more like gauze that an actual shirt . You can feel the graphic right through the shirt , as though it were right against your skin . The fit is much worse -- looser , thinner neckline and much too long . The stitching does n't hold up after a couple of washes . I contacted the company to complain about the workmanship and the material , and they tried to tell me that the new shirts were actually a better material , a `` brushed cotton , '' and that the manufacturer had changed the style about a year before . The older shirts were great . It 's too bad quality has so blatantly taken a back seat to the profit motive .
 I love these shirts for their design , but something needs to be done about the quality of the t-shirt they are printed on . They 're ridiculously light-weight , with a uncomfortably thin neckline and bad stitching.I 'm sure it would wear out quickly , if I could bring myself to wear mine for very long . The shirt is simply the worst quality garment I own.Switch to a better quality , heavyweight cotton shirt and you have a winner on your hands . I hope someone takes notice !
 `` Dont order this hat if you think you are getting white because you 're NOT !!! I needed this hat to complete a Halloween costume for my son and when I recieved it , it was clearly ivory or off-white . When I contacted the seller and explained the situation he replied `` Well , there are many different kinds of white . '' WHAT ? Biggest waste of money I ever spent . ''

 I bought these tights from a store for my daughter last week . They ran the day she put them on , and she was n't being rough on them . We washed them anyway , so she could practice with them as we got cheaper tights . This morning she put them on and both feet had runs everywhere -LRB- the original run was at the top of her leg , so did not cause this mess -RRB- . I washed them according to instructions on the package , and they ran anyway.Save you money and frustration , but cheaper convertible tights . After all , they are tights , and tights will run . They just should n't run on a first AND a second wear .
 The jacket arrived in about 10 days . As soon as I opened the box I knew I had made a mistake . The actual jacket is nothing like the picture . Nothing distressed about the leather . Not at all natural . This is a tan coat with a pebble finish . I ordered it in the large size which is correct for me . The shoulders , chest and sleeve length is a perfect fit . The waist is another story . Rather then a nice snug fit it hangs like a curtain . I gave it 1 star because it only cost me $ 21 and change to return it .
 i had been really excited to get this turban for summer holiday use , but when it arrived today i was more than a little disappointed.the only thing i can honestly say in its defense is , yes , this is a turban . other than that , there are no similarities.the color is nothing like the photo . mine is a super light crayola `` flesh '' tone color . not beige , not khaki , just a super light ivory color . strike one.the style looks nearly nothing like the image . the image looks great and i was looking forward to having it as such . instead i got something that looks pretty cheap . granted it is only $ 10 , but still , this looks fairly cheap . strike two.given i had to pay shipping on these , it 's just not worth it to send them back . i 'm going to look into how to either tie my own , or find another vendor.oh , also , it is VERY polyester and is a little large . the white one i bought in another style is no better . so even after all that , they do n't fit well . strike three.darn .

 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was .

 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt .

 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .
 There 's polyester and then there 's polyester . Very 60 's poly . Looks cheap and ugly . I ca n't imagine any circumstance when I would ever wear it . Maybe if everyone else on earth vanished and all my hair suddenly fell out ...
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .

 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer .

 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 Got the dress and was excited for our 6 year old to be dorthy this year , but the dress reeked so badly of pot we had to return it , even washing and fabrezeing the dress did n't help with the smell . DONT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE !!
 This dress was very cute , however it was poorly made . The straps were sown on all twisted and so we had to try and stitch them at the shoulders so they would seem straight . The shoulders at the seam were coming apart after only one hour of wear . Seveal of the seams at the arms and skirts were unraveling before putting on and had to be re-sewn . I had to put a lot of work into fixing the dress so she could wear it and at the price I paid should not have had too .
 My six year old daughter would have been heart broken if she could n't have been Dorothy this Halloween that is the only reason the costume was not sent back . I know these things are produced as quickly as possible , but the company the costume came from should really pay attention to quality control . If anyone -LRB- who cared -RRB- had checked the costume before packaging , they should have tossed it and sent another . I will not order from them again . With all the sewing I had to do to repair the costume , I could have started from scratch . VERY disappointed .
 My daughters costume tore when she first tried it on , we sewed it and halfway thru trick-or-treating the hemline was torn and hanging down to her knee .
 I ordered the `` deluxe '' Dorothy Costume , size Small . The sizing chart says 4-6 , so I figured my tall five year old would get one year of use out of it.The costume just arrived ... . and I literally laughed out loud when I pulled it out of the packaging . It looks so different than the picture and description . The quality is actually hysterical . If you turn the dress inside out , it looks like a drunk person was given a serger . The hem is uneven , the skirt underneath has holes in it , the neckline has an unfinished blue gingham collar instead of the white mock collar pictured ... . AND the BOW ! The bow is blue with gray insulation backing and is HALF-FINISHED ON THE EDGES WITH WHITE STITCHING only part of the way down the sides of the bow!I tried it on my daughter and the fit was terrible . Not only is it very short , despite the waist falling at her natural waist , but the straps are not even finished off on the side facing the body to lay flat.This costume is a disgrace and it 's right back today .
 I ordered this for my 4 year old granddaughter , since she loves to watch Wizard of Oz so much and dress like Dorthy . however , she will not even wear it . The dress has a petty coat inside and itches her so much she wants to give it away ... . waste of money in item and shipping charges ... I do not recommend for any child . .
 Okay , so the photo on-line shows that the costume looks a little short . My daughter is still five years old , and the other reviews seemed to indicate that the fit is fine , so I ordered the small . As soon as I took it out of the box , I could see that it would be too short for my daughter . Comparing the costume to dresses in her closet quickly confirmed my fears . The other thing I noticed quickly was that the collar did not lay right . The facing is shorter that the outer material , yet stitched to the collar as though it had been cut to shape along the collarbone . I can not imagine that this collar would be comfortable for anyone and it would probably require a few snips to make it lay flat along the base of the neck/throat . If your child is even average height for their age , size UP ! I ended up returning this costume and buying a reversible Dorothy/Glinda pinafore that is much more durable and beautifully made . It was over twice the price , but it is standing up to the rigors of dress-up and washing in this house .
 This costume is made of extremely cheap materials . Ours was already torn , straight out of the packaging . I regret the purchase . Save your money and find a better quality product .
 I ordered this for my daughter , she loves wizard of oz . I ordered this for her birthday , First of all I ordered a small and got a meduim . Then when I got it the shoulder straps were all twisted , I think I am gon na have to cut the straps off and re sew them . Too much money for this costume , its not worth it .
 This is an adorable but flimsy costume . Do n't expect it to last a long time . Also , the sizing is a little different . I bought a size 4-6 only to find out thatit fits ages 3-4 . My 4-year-old loves the costume , but a sturdier version would have been preferable .

 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .

 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .

 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .

 I tried these hose out of desperation . Being a plus size -LRB- 16/18 -RRB- , it ` s very difficult to find hosiery that actually fits . After trying 4 dept. Stores and 2 other websites , I finally resorted to Spanx , the priciest product on the market.I ordered several pairs in different shades to have on hand and to save on shipping costs . The first pair lasted three hours . When I took them off , VERY carefully -LRB- after all , they were $ 26 -RRB- I was shocked to see a run from the thigh all the way to the foot . Never knew they caught on anything at all and I was wearing a long skirt . I was irritated but hoping that it was just a fluke.Tried another new pair today . When I started to put them on , I noticed a hole in the crotch seam where the cotton is supposed to attach to the hosiery . They missed a spot sewing and it was clear that the hole was going to run . This was my last pair of light colored hose -LRB- the previous Spanx pair self-destructing a couple weeks before -RRB- so I grabbed the nail polish for a quick fix . However , once I got them on , I could see 2 snags , one in each leg , and they did n`t come from me.The coup de grace was arriving home after 3 hrs to find another run from mid-thigh to the toe . No idea when it happened but appears to have started where one of the snags had been.So thanx , Spanx , for the public embarrassment of having long runs in my hose . At least the first skirt was long.As far as the material , it ` s not impressive . Cheap quality and not silky . I only gave this product one star because these hose are sized closer to reality than most -- just be prepared to shell out $ 10/hr to wear them , and assume you will be modeling unsightly runs .
 So I bought these pantyhose at century 21 , not even an hour I had two runs !!! I would not recommend these pantyhose ruined my night out : -LRB-
 I was in love with these nylons ! I bought two pair one in black and one in nude , they felt great , my tummy was tucked , my legs looked fab . However , on day one I had a run two hours into my work day , and with the second pair on day two I had a run 5 hours into it . So , over $ 50 for two pairs of nylons that could n't even last through the work day . :-LRB- Real bummer because I LOVED them ! I would definetly reccomend these if they would only last !
 Overpriced for what it is , given they developed runs the first time I wore them . And I have short nails and wore flats . Do n't bother , get the pharmacy cheapers for same effect .
 These hose are too expensive for a single wear - none , in my case . They ran as soon as I put them on ! They are too delicate and run immediately . Be careful . They are expensive and run immediately
 After paying $ 26 for these pantyhose , I wore them once and they ran from top to bottom ... a very expensive experience . I would never buy them again . And , because I put them away and did n't try them in the first 30 days SPANX refused to refund a penny . So buyer beware ...
 This product does not control the tummy or legs and the part for the toes had holes , not happy , I spent 26.00 for this product , I want my money back !!!!!

 The costume was sent promptly and arrived in excellent condition . The quality of the costume was not at all what I had hoped for . It was made from inexpensive felt and did n't even have fur trim . Since it came promptly I 've had time to rework the outfit and make it nicer .

The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie . There 's there 's zero stretch in this , it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big . Since they 're short from crotch to waist anyway , it does n't much matter.The top fits better , since you adjust it . The cut is still quite poor and , again , there 's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders . It 's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust . It 's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.If you 're narrow through the hips , shoulders or bust , this combo will probably be a nice fit . If you 're curvy , you might want to rethink this . It 's a shame since it comes in plus sizes . Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO .
 i guess the cheap price on this should have clued me in . i ordered this for my wife . looks great on the model in the picture most likely because the use different sizes , meaning you get it and the bottoms are huge and the top is small ... not anything like the proportions in the picture .
 Well i am a big sunglass fan . i just love them so i was excited to get these . they seemed very cute . well when i got them the lenses were scratched and there was stuff on the sides of the glasses . this was my first purchase from this seller and honestly i dont think i will ever buy from them again .
 I got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me . Last week I took them to school and I put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half.There was no way to repair them . These glasses look good but dont waste your money on these . Really cheap . I am very unhappy . = -LRB-
 I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me . I wish I had not have gotten it .
 A red star !?!? I bet this wo n't sell well in eastern Europe . Communist governments use the red star symbol . More than 100,000 million people have been killed in the `` rise of the proletariat '' ... so let 's celebrate this with a HAT !?
 I think this hat was sized by elves . I have a fairly large head , 24 inches circumference , so I ordered an extra large . It was tiny , it fit my very small-headed wife perfectly . I thought they sent me the wrong size but the factory tag does say XL . It makes me think these are meant to be kid hats or something .
 when pulled down , it could cover your head all the way from back of your skull to front of your eyes .
 I have written 8 product reviews for this one hat just so I can let people know the truth . However my review keeps getting blocked . I am just trying to tell the truth so people do not get taken . 7 1/4 is listed twice as large and medium . I went with large . It is to big . Company said if I purchase three more caps/hats they would replace the first one for free . Other than that they said it was my fault for ordering the wrong size . I did not order wrong size ! Please let people know the truth .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts .

 These shirts were not what I expected . As soon as I washed them , they shrunk and did not hold their original shape . The end of the sleeves began to roll up ... and that was only after one wash straight out of the package . Will wait until I get back to the US to buy the correct type .
 This is not a t-shirt suitable for outer wear.It comes out of the wash wrinkled , a bit shrunken and with misshapen collar and sleeves.Care directions followed to the letter with the newest digital laundry equipmentokay for sleepwear and as a hidden under layer . I wo n't buy again .
 I received these shirts to wear under my flight suit but they are more of an Air Force greenish tan than brown tan . Not what I expected from the picture . Also I ordered large and the necks are huge and look like crap . I can not wear these in a military uniform . They may be good if you work as a mechanic and need a grease rag that is why I will give two stars .
 Pictures could n't do this bag justice . It 's perfection . The color is a true brown , not nearly as gold as the photo . The stitching is a golden brown . The luggage is sophisticated , elegant , and manly , but I would n't mind being seen with it , either . I can hardly wait to give it to my mate tomorrow - he 's going to love it.Now , the seller deserves kudos for being the fastest , clearest , best communicator ever on Amazon . There was a slight glitch with my payment . The seller was the first to alert me - Amazon never did . The issue resolved itself and the bag arrived a day earlier than expected . They had the best price and free shipping . I could n't be happier . This is the second piece of Floto Milano luggage I 've purchased this year . If my mate needs more , I 'll buy again from this seller , if at all possible . Thanks so much.Added

 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .

 when i got this it was not at all like the picture . it was all loose and the buckles are all janky and do n't look like the do n the picture.its not like leather type material either . it has like a cheap shining material . was very disappointed .
 My only positive feedback for these guys & this item is that it showed up well ahead of the expected arrival date . I got it out of the package , & not only did it not look like the glove shown -LRB- which I kinda expected . -RRB- it has a cut in it like someone slashed it with a box knife . Also , the thing is WAY too big for me , & I even have large hands . I 'll definitely be asking for my money back .
 The photograph and the product do not match . They do not look like each other at all . The photograph looks black and the glove itself is a much lighter brown . The buckles on the product itself look like they need to be closed or secured , except they are non-functional so they just flop around uselessly . After I opened the box I compared it to the photo on the website . The buckles are completely different.Considering the price , I was not looking for real leather or amazing crafstsmanship , but I do expect it to look something like the photo . Right now I am debating to wear it once and be done with it , or return it , get my money back and not wear any kind of gauntlet . This thing might be too embarrassing to wear . I am usually very happy with anything purchased from Amazon , but not this time .
 This is garbage . Unless you have a gigantic forearm and a severely deformed hand , this thing will not fit you . Terrible quality , do n't waste your time or your money on this nonsense
 I am very unimpressed by the fact that this is a single gauntlet and not labeled as so . If It were advertised as one gauntlet I would not have purchased it . This is disappointing !
 Product arrived quickly but bear this in mind.Color of glove is taupe , not chocolate brown as pictured.Metal buckles are somewhat accurate , but they are gun metal finished and not shiny.Finger cut of the glove does not match the liner very well . It may fit better without the liner.The straps around the forearm have a shiny metallic strip instead of leather style.It will take some modifications to make it accurate .
 I received this on time but with one big problem there was only one glove in the package ! If I only had one hand then I think it would work but I have two hands , so I need two gloves . I do not know who to contact to solve this problem so that makes this more frustrating .

I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 Item arrived appearing to be the quality expected for the paid price . It was n't used enough to get it dirty before the bottom fell out of it . It was apparant from checking it that it was defective workmanship . Army Universe said it was past the return date so I had to just eat the $ 70.00 .
 I purchased this backpack about five months ago and initially was impressed with the product . It appeared sturdy and well-constructed and was reasonably comfortable to carry . I 've been using it lightly since - no more than a couple of days a month carrying loads up to twenty pounds . Unfortunately the stitching at the bottom corners of the backpack -LRB- the bottom two corners of the main compartment that are closest to the wearer 's back -RRB- has started to open up . One corner is entirely open such that there 's a one inch gap in the corner through which objects can fall and the other corner is starting to unravel but is not yet open . I have n't been carrying any sharp or unusual objects that should cause this to happen so I have to give this product only two stars .
 The stitching on this bag is terrible . When the bag came , there was loose thread everywhere and the seams looked like they had already been stretched beyond their use . Despite this , I used this bag as my school bag carrying books and what not for what seemed like a couple of weeks when the top seam right above the left shoulder came undone . I stitched it back up , but now I am wary of putting any real weight in it and it feels like a ticking timebomb . If this bag were used in any real strenuous way , I 'm sure it would fall apart in a couple weeks , requiring constant sewing . This a piece of crap like theNCStar Tactical Backpack , Black - Backpacks - DaypacksI had before ; I 'm trying theMilitary MOLLE Large Transport Backpackand if it falls apart I 'm never believing the reviews on these cheap , crappy backpacks . If you do n't want to gamble , buy name brand .
 Not made very well , only two compartments . The straps hurt your shoulders and are hard to adjust . There is no padding at all for your back and sides . And they are charging 52.00 for this very poorly made back pack ... I am sending it back . I 've spent a dollar more for a Field and Stream pack that was 10 times better than this one . I will be glad to spend more for a higher quality pack . Should have stayed with the Molle pack I bought in ACU , that 's a really good pack . I just wanted a differant color and chose this . Never again ...
 seemed to be good quality , but the straps in the smallest position were still much too large for my 220lb relatively unathletic frame . I sent it back for a refund
 This is a really nice bag with one exception . The waist straps are only adjustable at the point where you snap them together in the front . They have no tensioners at the hip , and are extremely long . Unless you 're an 800 lb grizzly bear , the waist straps will be utterly useless , making all the weight of your pack ride only on your shoulders and chest . Sadly , I never even got to use this pack , and had to return it . The build quality of the bag is good . Great , reinforced stitching and heavy duty nylon with unlimited points for attachments and carabiners . If they get this obviously overlooked waist strap in working order , it would be a 5 star bag .
 My husband has worn 505 jeans for his whole life but that is about to change . I bought him 3 pairs , removed the tags , he wore them and we noticed there was a big gap at the waist , on the back-side . We discovered Levis has removed 2 loops `` in a cust-cutting move '' . Well , their cost-cutting has lost this customer . It is SO annoying ! Levis , wake up and put the loops back or you 've lost this customer for good .
 Levis from another land.My favorite since 1957 . These new red tabs have been washed -LRB- 2 -RRB- times and the belt loop over left rear pocket is already tore off leaving a 1/2 '' hole . The right leg outer seam starts is correct at top but ends in the center of my foot at the bottom.CrOoKeD ... FOR LEVI ONLY . . NO OFFENSE TO AMAZON !!!! GOOD JOB TO AMAZON IN ALL THAT THEY DO FOR MY FAMILY ...
 These do not fit like the old 505 . Quality suffers also ! It seems that the venerable 505 have fallen into the globalization trap . I will not buy again .
 I 've been wearing the same size Levis 505s for some 30 years . I am well familiar with how they fit , what they 're made of , and how they feel . For the first time I just ordered two pairs of Amazon 's Levis 505 jeans.The two pairs I purchased from Amazon are a good inch shy of specification in both waist and inseam , and the waist is a half inch or more low . They fit me like hip-hugging sausage skin and the fabric just does n't feel right - it feels as if it 's a lighter weave and I get the distinct impression it 's just not going to wear over time like I expect a 505 to wear . If I wanted a skin-tight lightweight fashion brand jean I 'd buy them and not 505s . I 'll give them two stars because they are blue jeans and because at least visually they look like the genuine article . But when they are clearly not equivalent to the store bought version , I 'm returning both pairs of these pants and not using Amazon again for this particular product.I can not recommend Amazon 's Levis 505 jeans , much as I 'd really prefer the convenience of ordering online .
 Compared to the quality of Levis I owned a few years ago these do n't even come close . They are paper thin and I was almost afraid to put them on without tearing them . I guess we 'll see how long they last .
 I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years . In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores . Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare . I love them but replacement has been needed . After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand . The stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25 . The Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly . No two pair seem the same . However , The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent . The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.Not having a local source for the Levi brand , I ordered through Amazon . The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglersavailable locally . Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers . As a matter of fact , it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL ... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult jeans . The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son 's boy jeans.Last , the jean 's waist and length were at least 2 inches large . Years ago , Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.In summary , the fabric , the zipper , and inconsistent sizes are all very sub-par . The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.This pair was made in Egypt with Egyptian fabric.Avoid mail order Levi jeans
 I am buying this model more than 5 years.The main important things for me is how it fits and a ZIP.I do n't like the bolts.I like Levis because it fits good and quality of material acceptable.There is only one but important problem
 I too have been a long-time fan of the now departed 505 Regular Fit jeans . The decision to summarily drop this enduring style and substitute a new low-rise version -- the abominable 505 Straight Fit -- is positively baffling . I can only ponder what the folks at Levi Strauss were smoking at the time.But hold on , I found a substitute
 These jeans are not of the quality you would expect from the levi brand ... Much thinner material , never thought Levi woulddo this ...
 I hate the 505 straight versus the old Regular fit . i am tired of hitching up my pants every time i stand up and , of course , showing plumber 's crack . can anyone recommend another brand that has the same fit as the old 505 Regular fit ?
 Check out the Levis website for reviews and complaints about the new 505s . They have changed the fit -LRB- the rise -RRB- so that the jeans fit about 1 inch lower at the waist . Many guys are having trouble with the fit as being uncomfortable . They do not stay up ! For some , the 550 is unchanged and may work . As for me , I am changing brands after 45 years of buying Levis .
 I always thought Levi 's were made in America . Sorry to find out they like many others -LRB- what used to be -RRB- quality products are not and lacking in quality and workmanship . These pants are thin materialed and will wear out in 3 months .
 wanted to open a claim , but this item is not an option . Today I received the package and was very surprised that I was sent a completely different color Tumbled Stretch -LRB- although the package has been correctly pointed out Good Old Blue -RRB- !!! Made in China , instead of Egypt -LRB- mentioned in the product description . -RRB- Return the goods can not , because he was in Russia and the transfer will cost several times more expensive than those jeans . This is the first time I was very disappointed by amazon.com and pondered whether to continue to make purchases -LRB- after the loss of my money and time -RRB- .
 The trnsaction was a nightmare.I ordersd a pair of jean , the same style and size Levis that i have beenwearing for many mnay years . When i received the product , since theywere the same style and size , I washed them . Lo and behold theyshrunk so much that i could not wear them or worse yet , return themI did call the Levi corperation , and they told me that you sold discountedpants that they had discontinued or material that had been phased out.they said that they would never sell those products.So you see that the whole Amazon transaction was a nightmare for me , and there is littlereason that you should send me announcements for `` denim sales '' . I 've already been had.Please ackowledge receiptLouis L Ferrario
 For years , I have always been able to buy jeans for my husband without any problems -- Levis 505 regular fit . I recently ordered and received a couple of new pair for him , and OMG ... they were a completely different fit ! Both pair ! They ride low , and the overall fit is not flattering - at all !!! Levi 's has RUINED a perfect fitting jean ! I WANT THE OLD 505 'S BACK !!!!
 Attention all dedicated Levi 's 505 wearers ! Today 's 505 's are NOT the same . They are now calling them `` Straight Fit '' as opposed to `` Regular Fit . '' If you 've been wearing 505 's for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ... or more years , odds are you WO N'T like these . They sit low on the waist . You know , so your underwear can show . If that 's not your idea of fashion , do n't buy these . They 're also a little tighter in the crotch and thighs , whcih coudl be a problem for some . Do n't take my word for it , go to the Levi 's webpage and look up the reviews for the 505 since they changed the style in April , 2011 . They 've lost several generations of customers .
 I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 Jeans for 30 years , and could always rely on the fit . When I put on these jeans , the fit was nowhere close . When I measured , the rise was about 3 inches shorter than the standard Levi 's 505 . Why would any sensible company do that ? There are an infinite number of numbers . If you want to change the fit , why not change the number too . In the past , when Levi has introduced new jeans , they have used new numbers , e.g. 550 . The basic point is that these jeans do n't fit right , and now I have to start shopping for another brand .
 As others have written , Levis changed their 505 jeans without telling customers . The result is a totally poor fitting jean . Shame on Levis ! I have bought and worn Levis my whole life , but now I am off to find a better fitting jean and sadly , it wo n't have the Levis tag on it . : -LRB-
 The new fit of the 505 straight cut are unwearable . The vast majority of men passed the age of 30 do not wear their jeans two inches below their waist . We have more important things to do than pulling up our pants every thirty seconds . The waist is too low the rise is wrong and the cuff too wide . We like the original cut with the understanding that even the original cut was so inconsistent that it was necessary to try on multiple pairs to find a suitable fit.Please stop taking your loyal customers for granted .
 I purchased 2 pair of Levi 505s 33 '' waist , 29 '' length . The pants were both marked 29L and 33W . The 29 '' length was correct , but 1 pair has a 34 '' waist and the other has a 35 '' waist . I kept them because when I was young , Levis shrank when 1st washed . I was wrong !
 Levi stopped offering 505 's in the colors that they used to . They also offer less sizes then they used to . I have worn 505 's for years . 36 waist and 29 inch leg . But now Levi 's offers fewer of the color choices in a 36 waist and 29 inch leg . I ca n't prove it but the material seems lighter to me as well . Unless I want 505 's in my size in shades of blue I am out of luck . To summarize , less choice in colors of my size and cheaper lighter materials used .
 I have worn Levis Regular Fit jeans for many years . They have always fit comfortably . I bought a pair of the Straight Fit jeans thinking they were the same jeans with a new name . The description on the tag is identical to that on the Regular Fit jeans . Both say `` Sits at Waist '' . Not really . The seat has been changed -LRB- I have a 32 '' waist and am not trying to squeeze into too-small jeans -RRB- and the rise is different . I understand that companies must innovate to remain competitive . I do n't understand why anyone would change an established brand and make it useless to its core customers . If Levis wants to attract new customers it should have made the new fit explicit by giving it a new model number . This change reminds me of the `` New Coke '' fiasco . Maybe Lee or Wrangler will do instead .
 For as far back as I can remember , I have been a loyal Levi Strauss customer . I never understood why anyone would buy blue jeans from anyone else , but today I am questioning that loyalty.As a result of some successful changes in my diet , my old blue jeans have become too large for me , so I purchased 2 new pairs of 505 jeans and a new pair of 505 shorts . I have noticed myself hitching up my newer , snugger jeans more often than my older , looser jeans . This afternoon , I specifically noticed that my shorts kept slipping under my belt -- as though they did n't have enough belt loops.This evening I compared my new jeans with my old jeans , and lo and behold , I discovered that Levis have gone from 7 belt loops to 5 . Five belt loops are n't enough.The other posts I have seen about this product are focused on globalization-related issues . I , too , hate to see American jobs move overseas , but this particular problem has nothing to do with country of origin . Regardless of where the jeans were manufactured , Levi Strauss has cheapened the design specification , and they seem to be waiting to see if anyone notices.Dear Levi Strauss : I noticed . Your product is not as good as it used to be.I ca n't remember being this upset about a product change since the introduction of `` New Coke . '' I do n't drink much Coca Cola any more . -LRB- That may be part of the reason I need smaller jeans ! -RRB- Please put back the missing belt loops .
 I 've been wearing Levi 505 's exclusively since the early 70 's . They fit me perfect . I could just walk into a store and pick up my size and buy without trying them on . Best jeans around.Well not any more ! Without any notice they have changed the `` Regular fit '' 505 's to `` Straight fit '' jeans which means they are no longer 505 's at all . The waist is larger , the crotch is higher and you must now wear them down on your hips as kid do with their jeans . These are no longer meant for adults or anyone who wants pants that fit properly . I also do n't like 550 relaxed jeans as they are too baggy.I 'll be looking for a different brand and returning the two pair I just bought . Hopefully Levi will lose enough faithful customers to make them rethink this rude abandonment of loyal customers .
 I 've been happily buying and wearing 505 Regular Fit jeans for many , many years . I did not notice before submitting my most recent order that Regular Fit has been replaced by Straight Fit . But , boy , did I notice a change once they arrived . These are n't the same jeans at all . The fabric is less substantial and - most disheartening to me - the rise is a good inch lower than it used to be . That is , the waistband sits lower on the hips . They feel wrong to me , like I need to pull them up all the time . And they feel cheap . I ca n't wear them.In my opinion , Levi 's should have been more forthright about this change . This new jean should have received its own new model number and they should have retired the 505 number entirely . Because these are not , in any manner that 's important to me , anyway , 505s . Now I have to find another brand of jean whose waistband sits up at my waist where I like it . What a hassle . So very disappointing.Levi 's , you screwed up .
 I have worn Levi 's 505 Jeans for 25 years . I even have a box of `` 34 's '' in the attic for when I lose a couple of pounds.I just sent back 2 new pairs of these jeans because they no longer fit as the other pairs I own . I called Levi 's to find out why.I was told that they changed the fit several months ago , without changing the numeral designation . 505 's are now only made as `` Straight Fit '' rather than `` Regular Fit '' . In addition , they have lowered the `` Rise '' to a `` below the waist '' fit , rather than the old `` at the waist '' fit.Sorry Levi 's , you ca n't do that without losing long-term customers . How can you change something as basic and important as fit , but still call it the same thing?Levi 's Mens 505 Straight Fit Jean
 Warning ! Be advised that the new 505 Straight Fit jeans have replaced the original 505 Regular Fit jeans . They are not the same . Try these on in a store before ordering online or you will be disappointed . Apparently , somebody at Levi 's had the bright idea of changing a tried and true style rather than creating a new one ; a classic example of `` if it aint broke , do n't fix it '' .
 I bought three pairs of 505s at the same time from the same buyer . The first two pairs -LRB- one `` Made in Egypt '' , the other `` Made in Bangladesh '' -RRB- have worn just fine -LRB- so far -RRB- , but the third pair -LRB- `` Made in Lesotho '' -RRB- RIPPED on only the SECOND day I ever wore them , starting from just above and to the left of the back-right pocket and tearing straight down , almost to my crotch ... BETWEEN the center seam and the right-side pocket stitching -LRB- NOT on a seam or a stitch ! -RRB- . They just ripped open -- period -- as I sat down . I did n't poke against anything , or rub against anything , and they were n't too tight -- they just plain up and ripped open on their own ... and while I was at work ! Piece of junk ! I 've been buying and wearing Levi 's 505s for 25 years , and I may not be able to prove or explain exactly how I know these jeans are n't `` the same '' as they were even a few years ago ... but I just KNOW , in my heart , that they are NOT the same quality . Now , I 'm doomed for eternity to constantly checking the back of my other two pairs of jeans every time I wear them to make sure there is n't another big rip in them . This was absolutely the last pair of Levi 's I will ever buy . EVER !
 Despite G & L Clothing 's claim that , `` The jeans are the same quality products Levi 's has manufactured for over 150 years , '' they 're not . They have 5 , not 7 , belt loops , with only one in the back , and the waist sags down below your belt in back so your shirt shows between the belt and top of the jeans . If you want to look really nerdy , these are your jeans . Also , IMO , the denim is not as thick as it used to be , even for the darkest blue jeans.In addition to poor quality , G&L ; automatically signs you up for email . If you want email from people like this , who promise you `` watch your inbox for great things to come ! '' then G&L ; is for you.Finally , I 've understood that it 's illegal to charge a credit card until an item is shipped . Evidently G&L ; has n't heard about this , either . Or does n't care . Amazon 's 1/14/06 confirmation of this sale noted that , '' -LSB- Your order is -RSB- -LRB- available to ship by30-January-2006 -RRB- Amazon Payments has charged your credit card -LRB- Amex -RRB- for this purchase , and the funds have been credited to G & L Clothing.Not only do you get shlock jeans , but they illegally charge your card as much as two weeks in advance , and they opt you in for their lovely email.Personally , I think one star is too many .
 Asked for and received a pair of 33x30s for Christmas . Even after washing , the waist is a full inch larger than my previous 505s . Levis Customer Service confirmed that they are intentionally changing the sizing
 I spent the greater part of my teenage years and twenties trying to find the perfect jeans . Finally I found them with the 505 Regular fit . Then , about five years later , they changed the fit !! The new 505s , called `` Straight fit '' , are too tight in the legs and butt area , whereas the old ones gave you a little room . It 's night and day as far as comfort is concerned . I wish Levi would stop messing around with what works . Another example is the Silvertab , which also were great , but discontinued .
 levi these used to be some of my favorite jeans they fit around the shoe perfectly so it wouldnt rip on the bottom , they gave me enough leg room to move freely and willingly in any direction , they had 7 thick durable belt loops that held the pants over my butt perfectly , and they where made with a a tough 12 ounch jean material . NOW on the other hand you guys have made the exact opposite !! im so freaking pissed off at levi for discontinuing all levi jeans that are worth buying for top dollar , you have lost so many customers because you decided to sell out and give us crap that is only made for the fashion obsessed morons out there that would actually buy something so poorly made . its like buying fast food in comparison to real food , its just plain crap all the way around . you guys made the belt loops so thin they will snap in a month , the jean material is alot thinner , the fit is strange , to tight much bigger waist then you advertise which also makes you guys liars on top of every other thing ive mentioned , GET YOU DAMN ACT TOGETHER AND STOP THINKING ABOUT MONEY , on the other hand . . if money is the only thing you guys can understand then you would know that more then half the population goes for durability and well made products then cheap fashion thrills just to make yourself feel better . well guess what levi we arnt all that self concious ! there are some of us out there that actually work hard for every penny we get and dont think we deserve to pay top dollar for such poorly made peaces of crap . bring levi strauss back to america where it belongs since the 1800s !! im going for carhartt now because they care about the average buyer . your products make me sick to my stomach . you should be ashamed that your still using such a well known name such as levi . . you should just call it crap for now on . unless you go back to the way you used to make the jeans . IF NOT BETTER !!! so do it ! if you dont ill just switch to carhartt and leave my business with you in the past .
 Levi Strauss sold out ; and their Levi jeans are the worse for it . Thin material . Poorly made -LRB- by Egyptians . -RRB- Worst of all , they 've let &#34; fashion designers &#34; take over . Jean styles are now designed for the skinny , hang-down-your pants customer . The 505 fit , in spite of being called &#34; Regular , &#34; is not ; this &#34; updated version &#34; is not the sit-at-your waist , straight leg jean we all used to buy , wear and love . Levi has moved-on ; they 've changed their jeans ... and obviously , have decided to leave their existing customer behind .
 After levis discontinued the mens perfect fit 512 's i was ready to give up buying from levi strauss but decided to give the 505 a try and I 'm not happy . My first thought was these have to be a knock off brand made by some other company that simply puts a levis label on them . I am not saying they are , they just feel cheap , not like levis I have bought in stores . They are thin and feel like a poorly made denim material not the stiff denim i associate with levis of old . I washed them and wore them for a day . After 8 hours they had stretched so much they looked like they were two sizes to big and baggy . Not sure if these are the same as sold in stores but if they are levis has lost a long time customer ... . The only good thing I can say is that the shipping was fast .
 I ordered these jeans on my wife 's Amazon account , I have been wearing Levi 505 's for over thirty years , and I must say that the pair that arrived today have got to be the worst jeans I have ever seen ... no , . . really . I tried to ignore all the 1 star reviews , but I should have heeded their warning . They arrived today , & I knew that they would , but kept thinking , as i picked up the box , this has got to be something else . There was no weight to it ... but low & behold , it was a new pair of Levi 505 's '' Made in Mexico '' , ... paper thin material . I think I could poke my finger through them , If i desired to do so . They got ta be kidding me ... These jeans probably are n't even worth $ 5 , let alone $ 40 . What a joke . Wo n't even be trying these on ... Back in the box , & back to Amazon is where these will go today ... I highly doubt these would survive a few spin cycles in the washer ... Might be useful to buff your vehicle ...
 &#1056; &#1072; &#1079; &#1084; &#1077; &#1088; &#1085; &#1077; &#1089; &#1086; &#1086; &#1090; &#1074; &#1077; &#1090; &#1089; &#1090; &#1074; &#1091; &#1077; &#1090; . &#1050; &#1072; &#1095; &#1077; &#1089; &#1090; &#1074; &#1086; &#1086; &#1095; &#1077; &#1085; &#1100; &#1087; &#1083; &#1086; &#1093; &#1086; &#1077; . &#1053; &#1080; &#1082; &#1086; &#1084; &#1091; &#1073; &#1099; &#1080; &#1093; &#1085; &#1077; &#1089; &#1086; &#1074; &#1077; &#1090; &#1086; &#1074; &#1072; &#1083; &#1072; . &#1057; &#1086; &#1074; &#1087; &#1072; &#1083; &#1090; &#1086; &#1083; &#1100; &#1082; &#1086; &#1094; &#1074; &#1077; &#1090; . &#1064; &#1074; &#1099; &#1085; &#1077; &#1088; &#1086; &#1074; &#1085; &#1099; &#1077; . &#1041; &#1077; &#1088; &#1077; &#1090; &#1089; &#1086; &#1084; &#1085; &#1077; &#1085; &#1080; &#1077; , &#1095; &#1090; &#1086; &#1101; &#1090; &#1086; &#1074; &#1086; &#1086; &#1073; &#1097; &#1077; Levi 's .
 My 17-year-old son has worn Levi 's 505s , in the same size -LRB- 32x34 -RRB- , for several years . He hates these new jeans . They 're too tight/narrowly cut . Yes , we 'd read the other negative reviews , which is why we ordered only one pair , but it seemed to be mostly older guys complaining about the fit . Trust me , tall , slender young men have now also found these jeans to be uncomfortable . Levi 's should bring back the old 505 jeans and give this new product , if they choose to continue it , a different number because they 're not the same thing at all . We will need to find a new jean .
 In my opinion the name Levi 's is being harvested . It is a common practice for companies to raise money quickly by doing what is referred to as `` harvest the company '' . In industry to harvest the company you stop doing maintenance on equipment , stop hiring young employees , stop all training programs , stop quality controls , and make your product as cheap as you can . It makes your company look very good on the bottom line for a short time . If I owned a lot of stock in a company and was ready to sell it I would do the same thing . I have no problem with companies going off sure to make there product as long as the quality remains the same . But this is not the case with Levi 's they are cutting corners however they can even to the point of eliminating two belt loops . How cheap can they be ? I very seldom return items , but I am returning the 505 jeans and I will find another brand after wearing Levi 's for over 40 years .
 I have a pair of Levi 's 505 regular fit that are great . I could n't find ` regular fit ' option anymore and thought I would give this a try . No luck , they do n't fit well , and are made of considerably thinner material than my old ones .
 Like a lot of folks , I too have bought and worn 505s for decades and now I wo n't buy them anymore . Not only did they change the fit , the increased the size of the back pockets so my wallet now rides down my leg . I can no longer carry my wallet in these jeans ... therefore I will no longer buy these jeans.And 1 other comment - anybody notice Levis reduced the amount of belt loops from 7 to 5 a few years back ? Another annoyance -LRB- cost savings -RRB- that I think changed the look and feel -LRB- I wear a belt so now the belt rides up a bit -RRB- . It 's a shame marketing folks do n't learn from old mistakes ... it 's business 101 . and if you do n't know what I 'm talking about , look up `` New Coke '' . Off to buy some crappier jeans -LRB- Old Navy ? Wrangler ? -RRB- but at least they 'll fit ...
 These ca n't be real Levi 's ?! ; the fabric is thin as a handkerchief and the stitching is cheap single stitched cotton thread . If I had the chance to feel these before buying of course I would NOT have bought them and bought the real thick Levi 's jeans . Costs more to ship back from here overseas than the jeans cost.Very disappointed in Amazon because these were sold through Amazon .
 These Levi 's 505 jeans that I bought for my husband fit nothing like his old 505 's do . He has always loved this style , but the styling has been changed so that the same size that once fit him like a glove is now at least 1 '' and probably 2 '' too big in the waist , and the rise is shorter by the same amount . If they wanted to make a new style , then , OK , but do n't call 'em 505 's !!
 These pants are unacceptable . lightweight denim will not stand up . crotch is cut all wrong . I had been been wearing this type of jeans for over 40 years , and they have gotten progressively shoddier . Made in china junk . levis is clearly more interested in the ` high end ' androgenous customer . Can ' even find the standard jean jacket anymore . I 'll be looking for a quality jean elsewhere . Sadly , it probably wo n't ne made in the USA . .
 I have been buying exclusively levi jeans for over 45 years . I have been buying size 32x30 for as long as I can remember . Today I bought 3 pair of 505 regular fit straight leg jeans and the waist was not even close . Must be at least 34 . They fall down . I put them up against my old jeans and there is a huge difference . Almost 50 years of product loyalty and they have let me down . I have bought my last pair .
 I bought several pairs of these jeans for my husband last year in 2009 and I can say that I am very disappointed with the quality . The material is very thin and I have had to put patches on the pockets and fix all of the belt loops because the material is thin and they have pulled away . The hem in the bottom of the pant legs have all started to fray as well . We have always purchased Levi jeans for him to work in and they have always held up well -LRB- years -RRB- not months . But I have never had to fix so many problems before . Do not buy these if you intend to work in them every day , they will not last . Very POOR quaility . Shame on Levi . I will be looking for Jeans made here in America from now on .
 Absolute junk ! I 've noticed a decline in the quality over the last decade , i.e. the pocket stitching actually pulling away from the pant and making holes within months . But the new denim fabric is probably half the weight / thickness as it was for last year 's 505s . I 've been wearing 505s for construction since the early 80s . The new `` denim '' feels less substantial than their Dockers line . Levi , you 've lost a 30 + year -LRB- once dedicated -RRB- customer .
 I bought these thinking ` What a nice color ' . Little did I realise that the dye used for this color has a really unpleasant smell . I washed them repeatedly in my very efficient and eco-friendly Asko washer , but the smell remained . If the jeans were mixed with other laundry , the odor would contaminate the other clothes . So , they were returned to Amazon . Thankfully , they accepted them . -LRB- This , in many years of online purchase , has been my only return -RRB- . I wish I could say something better , but the truth must be told .
 My husband has worn 505 's since he was a young man - so that is many years ! He always wore the Straight Fit , in Rigid . We had read the reviews about how bad the `` new & improved '' Levi 's are but had to see for ourselves . I thought a company only did changes that made their product better ... . wrong ! Well , not the Levi company.The material felt horrible - different from the Rigid he wore in the past . We ordered 2 different sizes since there were people talking about the new lower cut and that their original size not fitting . Neither size fit . My husband said they would rub all the hair off your legs if he tried to wear them . Of course , we are returning them.Luckily we read the reviews on Carhartt jeans - ordered them - and they are wonderful jeans . He wore a `` tight '' 34 waist in the old Levis . The 35 waist in the Carhartts was too tight but the 36 was a perfect fit . The length in the Carhartt is the same he used to wear in Levi . We ordered the Straight-Leg Traditional fit in the Carhartt . Also the fit of the Carhartts in the seat is very good . Not baggy at all . The legs may be a tiny bit wider than the Levi 's he used to wear but not much .
 The color and texture is fine but the size is totally different from the original 30x30 . I use to wear 505 's in size 30x30 and they fit and feel different . I 'm very dissapointed with Amazon and especially with Levis quality control , the sizes are different depending on the country the pants were manufactured . They do n't have quality standards as other jeans brands .
 I have n't seen this problem with any of the other reviews so I suspect it may be related to the color/fabric `` Tumbled Stretch . '' When washed they shrank down a good two sizes , at least two inches smaller in the waist and the length . Hoping amazon will let me return them because my boyfriend ca n't wear them and they 're even too small for me . Shrinking two whole sizes is just a bit too much to be normal.I would give the pants another shot in another color/fabric because before washing they fit perfectly . A little stiff like too much starch but perfectly . Then again , we picked out the straight fit because the pants he 's worn through were the same brand and style which is the only reason we ordered them online .
 INCREDIBLY AWFUL pair of Levis . They either are `` seconds or thirds '' or somebody needs to find a new process for producing this product . The crouch is not sewn together correctly therefore the pant fits poorly . The seams/inseams do not match making each pant leg irregular . WOULD NOT BUY another pair of Levis this way ... really a poor product . There is absolutely no quality in this product ... hopefully others will read this and refrain from wasting their money . Levis are just not what they used to be ...
 Just because it says &#34; 505 &#34; does not mean it is like the same old 505s you used to wear . True , these are cut the same , but the weight of the fabric is maybe half that of my older jeans . I suppose the lesson is that books can be purchased online , not clothes .
 Apparently the &#34; straight &#34; fit has consumed &#34; regular &#34; fit . You ca n't have straight -LRB- regular -RRB- fit as described in the description . They are two different styles . Unfortunately , we are all presumed to wear our jeans at our ankles now .
 The 505 regular fit are now the 505 regular fit . The waist is larger and the hips are extremely tighter . I will NOT be buying the 505 jeans any longer . I have been wearing them for decades .
 I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust . Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd . They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly . The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I ca n't stand it . My old 505s did not do this . The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them . They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle . These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality , look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing .
 I have a Levis 505 34 x 32 but it is smaller , I do not know if regular fit is equals straight fit
 these jeans are made very small , i wear 33-32 and they are not even close , i ` ll be sending them back ... they do n`t make them as good anymore ...
 Good afternoon ... how is possible that companies such as Amazon and Levis sell and send defective items without going through a quality control . One pair of pants that I purchased came with one sleeve shorter than the other . How may be possible coming from you ? What can I do with this piece of rag ?
 I ordered a pant size waist 35 inches and the pant came size 37.5 inches , so I can not used it . I am seeing many complains regarding the wrong size . The problem is that that Levi does not have Quality Control in the sewing plant or they are not doing thei job . The Amazon Service Department is very good , they solved the problem . I am very happy with them .
 spoiled goods came the jeans torn at the front on both legs and the back left pocket near the fabric was torn as if defeated ... !
 I had n't tried on 505 's in many years , but decided to get some since losing weight . WOW , these are way more baggy than they were several years ago . I 'm saying the cut has changed . I guess to make them more attractive to the younger generation that likes baggy pants . What a waste of money for me .
 compre unos 34 '' y parece que fueran como 36 '' porque son grandisimos y me quedan super anchos . No me gustaron para nada
 El pantal&oacute;n est&aacute; en buenas condiciones , pero la talla indicada en la etiqueta est&aacute; errada pues la talla real es 34x32 .
 I was very pleased with the quality of the jeans and the speed of delivery . They were a last minute birhday gift , which arrived on time . It is almost impossible to purchase certain sizes of Levis 's in department stores so this is a great outlet for them .
 I did not receive this item . Please check your records and if I was charged for this item , it was never received.Thank you , Linda Savell
 Ladies and GentlemenI politely inform you that since I start my shopping over the Internet through you had no problem with the products supplied , though two of the pants I purchased with this latest purchase came with defects in order to use them because the outer and inner side lines of these pants because they have defects in their court and do not stay in place and therefore can not use the same lost by giving purchase to have no complain but given that I have requested to report thereon , and not interest me that I returned merchandise credited me or give me money but I guarantee full power to do my shopping in a safe and efficient
 I have never had a pair of levis fall down before . These used to be work pants
 Heed other 's reviews . These are now lower cut . Had to return them after wearing the 505s for 10 years . And trust me , I am not any bigger than I was then.The jeans just do n't fit the same .
 For a company that specializes in jeans , you would think belt hoops would be something they know you need . Only one in the back does not keep your belt where it needs to go in the back . It makes the waistline belt go over the denim . I looked at my other jeans from Lands End and others , and they all have 3 in the back . One over each pocket , one in center .
 Since junior high school in the ' 70 's , I have never NOT had a pair of Levi 's 505 's in my closet . That 's going to change once my current pair-bought at the flagship Levi 's store in San Francisco , no less-finally gives up the ghost . The switch from `` regular '' fit to `` straight '' fit means 505 's are now completely different pants . The waist is easily two inches lower on your hips , the circumference of the legs probably two inches less , too . If you 're not a malnourished punk rock musician with no butt , you 're going to look like ridiculous in these pants . And you 'll feel ridiculous , too . Levi 's is clearly targeting a different market from , um , everyone who ever bought these pants in the past , so good luck with that .
 The size marked on the pants did not correspond to reality , they were one sise bigger.I ordered two pants one blue and one beige . I received two beige . I had to return one of the beige . They send me the blue one one week later . This worked ok.I could not use them because were one size bigger than the size marked . I sold then to a friend .
 When I bought the jeans they seemed to be a good price . I received them `` on time '' and right away something seemed wrong , they stunk ! They smelled like they had been in sewer water . Were these made in a 3rd world country and washed in a polluted river ? The first thing I did was throw them in the wash . More bad news , they bled so badly that the rest of the wash was stained blue ! I had to run the wash several more times . The good news is that the pants did n't stink anymore , the bad news is that several articles of light colored clothing were ruined.On the bright side , they fit well and look good .
 This is the last pair of jeans I buy from this brand . I bought this online because I felt pretty safe that the fit would be good , since these are n't my first pair of jeans from the brand . Still the case , and jeans fit well -LRB- and look nice -RRB- However , the low rating goes to the quality of the material . While I appreciate nice , medium thickness jeans that I 'll break into after awhile and will last many years -LRB- still have a pair of Diesel jeans that I wear after 10 years -RRB- , this is a tissue thickness pair of pants . I doubt that these will last more than a year , even with normal daily use.Levi 's is not the same brand that have have earned my admiration and loyalty over the years . They cheaped out on the material , and therefore sent the quality into the crapper . Please be aware of this when buying their jeans . Shame on you levi 's , for selling out and losing your integrity.And why the hell only 5 belt rings ???? Are they really that expensive ??? Is it worth the economy knowing fans like me will be really dissapointed ?
 I purchased these jeans for my husband , who is not usually very fussy . However , these jeans are made from extremely poor denim which was noticeable immediately . After wearing them once , they all went a bit fuzzy and seems to be pilling already . Very poor quality . I would have returned them immediately other than not worth the postage . They are now used for camping purposes only !!
 I have been buying Levis for 40 years and ca n't believe the jeans I just purchased.They have gone down in quality and up in price . They feel like a cheap pair of designerjeans . The weight of the material is lighter and they have reduced the number of belt loops.I hate them . I will buy Carhartt from now on . Much better quality .
 They do n't fit like the previous 501s I 've purchased . Probably safer to purchase at a local store after trying on .
 These pants are obviously seconds . They do not fold correctly and the color is faded on where the cloth does not lay down . Not made in the USA either . These are the worst pair of Levi 's I have ever bought brand new .
 I 've owned Levis my whole life which spans five decades . But the last four pairs I bought barely lasted a year before they wore out or started falling apart . These are jeans right ? Could fool me.I had not given this much thought but saw a friend of mine who is in the construction trade and he was wearing what looked like really well constructed jeans and I mentioned my Levis problem and he said in a matter of fact way that few people in the trades buy Levis anymore as they cost more but do n't last anywhere near as long as some other brands.So from my point of view , Levis is another example of the current management charging too much and cutting too many corners to make a buck . I will not buy Levis again and am sad to see this brand go down the toilet .
 I have worn 505 jeans for many years and I purchased the same size -LRB- waist and length -RRB- this new pair is about an inch too big around the waist and the cut is different to previous 505 's . It is an uncomfortable fit .
 I 've hardly ever been as annoyed with a product as I am with these jeans . I 've worn the same size 505 Levi 's for probably 25 years . So I had no qualms about ordering these online . But they are cut completely differently than any other pair of 505 's I 've ever owned . Low at the hip and skinnier in the thighs.If Levi Strauss is trying to tell me I 'm not hip , I get the message . But if you 're going to label something 505 , it should be the same jean I 've always worn and loved.Change the flipping name if you change the product . It 's not like you only have one jean ...
 On the red Leib on the pocket is not a word Levi 's , but only mark R. On the inside of the pockets are no inscriptions . This is the second pair 505 , the first one was perfect , but it does not sit well and too small . I am very disappointed .
 Pants looked pretty good and sized well . Then I put my belt on and noticed the front left belt loop was entirely missing . No signs of sewing , no hanging chad , nothing . Shocking quality miss for $ 42 pair of jeans ! Got ta return these and hope seller gets it right and makes good on these name brand jeans . More later after seeing response from Amazon ! Where is inspector 009 when you need him?UPDATE *** One star has become two stars thanks to Amazon.Amazon sent out the replacement pair of jeans and they arrived literally overnight . The pants appear to be fine . Although I am shocked by initial Levi pants quality misstep , Amazon stepped up and fixed the issue . 2 Stars for Levis , 4 stars for Amazon.The pants themselves seem durable . I went back to Levis after my Lees fell apart just after a couple of months and a few washes . Levis material seem more durable . Better be for the $ 12 premium to get Levis over Lees . I 'll update this again after a few months.I still have a pair of Levis from 1980 something with no apparent holes except they are almost white now from all the washes . I am expecting these to hold up a lot better than the designer soft fabric jeans other companies sell .
 I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon . The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer . They were durable and fit well . They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing -LRB- I estimate around 40-50 washes -RRB- . So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work . I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi 's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own . But I wanted the less ` slim ' fit of the 505s for work , also wanted the regular and not low rise waist . So I ordered the same exact size and style : Bad idea!The 505s I got came with a tag saying ` sits below waist ' , which is NOT what they used to say . Before , the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s . Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon , I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair . Trying the new pair on , I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my ` man parts ' being crushed in agonizing ways . No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans , and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area . The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s , but the seat was the main difference . No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505 . And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s -LRB- in the same color as the new 505s I purchased -RRB- I noticed something interesting . The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s . It was n't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing . The 515s never felt that tough , and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description -LRB- no mention of low rise waist -RRB- and inferior quality . I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store . The previous 505s were also great -LRB- Fred Meyer of all places - though they do n't have the 505s anymore ... booo -RRB- . So I 'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them . I 'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood . And the better quality denim means they 'll last longer anyway . So here are my comparisons : Levi 's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi 's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi 's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described , and that the quality appears to vary from order to order . I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews . I love Levi 's jeans , and I will continue to buy them , but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing . And remember , if you buy from Amazon , they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items .
 The pants seem to be acceptably made -LRB- the label indicates it was made in Cambodia -RRB- - although slightly thinner material than I expected . The color that I ordered -LRB- Blue Collar -RRB- is fine and is what I expected . However , these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down , and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it . I though about keeping them , but I can not put up with the tightness at the thighs . Also , the pockets seem to `` bunch up '' too much and you must often put your hands in your pockets to keep them down ... a major fail , so I 'm returning them and will try out the Levi 's Men 's 560 Comfort Fit Jean instead .
 I would really like to know what the thought process was in redesigning a classic piece of American apparel so that it fits like junk . Or , rather , does n't fit your junk . I echo all the other writers here who note that the new `` fit '' does n't fit . Not just slightly off -- terribly made for anyone who has anything resembling a reasonably fit body . If you have any gluteal muscles at all , the jeans wo n't reach your waist . So it constantly feels like the jeans are falling down . It looks moronic , feels truly uncomfortable , and is dysfunctional.The whole idea that made jeans popular in the first place was that they were sturdy , work-oriented pants that broke in to look and feel comfortable . You ca n't work in the new 505s at all unless the point of your labor is not to complete a job but show off `` plumber 's crack . `` Have been wearing Levi 's all my life , have also tried Wrangler 's Lees etc etc. . The new 505 is truly the worst pair of jeans I 've ever owned . Because they use a tag with a lot of brand strength but substitute an inferior product in its place , it 's also deceptive to consumers . They should remove the `` 505 '' brand '' and in the interest of truth-in-packaging rename this style `` dumba ** '' in honor of whatever overpaid executive thought this up and anyone suckered into wearing a pair .
 I 've purchase Levi 's 505 jeans my entire life , but recently purchased a couple of pair and found that the cut has been changed to a low-ride jean . Found similar experiences posted by other folks . Very disappointed . Seems that Levi Strauss is trying to lure in a new demographic -LRB- that like to have that modern everything exposed cut -RRB- at the expense of long term customers . Bad corporate decision making . Recommend that folks looking for the old 505 cut try the Austin jean if they can get them . Probably not as high quality , but about half the price and similar in fit to old 505 's .
 Some genius MBA at Levis decided to change the design of the classic 505 jeans without telling anybody . I bought several pairs before realizing they were n't seconds , Levis had actually made the waist wider and the rise lower so the pants will no longer fit no matter how tight you cinch your belt . Do not buy these without trying them on ! Levis has taken a style you could buy without worry and made it unwearable -- without warning any of its customers.Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight Fit Jean
 For as long as I can remember I wore Levi 505 Regular Fit 36x30 . Obviously a popular size cause they were always difficult to find in the pile of various sizes . Recently my wife came home with 3 new pairs . When I tryed them on they felt as if they were a defective cut . The waist line dipped deep into my crouch the legs were baggy and the felt like they were always falling off my ass . My wife had to return cause I realy did think they were defective . Since , I havent bought a new pair of Jeans . Looking on line today came upon these other common complaints and cant believe the corporate mentality of Levi . Obviously they will be on the road to destruction , if they dont come foward and meet the long time customers needs with the same old jeans . What a Bad Idea you had Mr Levi ! We are deeply disappointed in your products as of today !
 I 've found that the finishing/hemming of the jean 's length is consistently off . No matter what measurement you choose , the pants are either just right or two long . I have n't found any to be too short ... yet . Also , Levi 's is always changing the rise of the jeans . The new ones I just purchased are lower than my older ones . I do like Levi 's quality though . They really hold up .
 I have been wearing these , the Levi 505 , for quite sometime now and I love them . I ordered some on Amazon because they were in a wash that I could n't find in the store . When I got them , I put them on and they were literally HUGE ! I compared them to some other new 505 's and the sizing was awful . They were literally 2 inches too long , and at least 2 sizes too big in the waist . I felt like I put on my dad 's jeans!In addition , one of the seams was coming undone already . Very poor finish .
 jeans are of lighter weight material . Not as durable and one of the five belt loops has already torn off because of the poor quality . I will not be buying Levi 's again . Very disappointing . If I had wanted these cheap knock offs I would have went to Wally World .
 I love 505s but I 've found that if I order 3 pairs , all three will fit completely differently . The faded jeans tend to be really tight and low cut so that they barely cover your backside , the traditional stonewash seem to have the truest fit to the original 505s and the `` trendy '' washes I 've bought are all over the map . I 've stopped buying them online because I have to keep sending them back . It 's a lot easier to wait for a sale locally and go try them on .
 Recived very late and damage . I send it back.First
 jeans with details of elaboration at the level of the boot is damaged sewing line is placed at the middle of the pants , I 'm not satisfied with the product .
 The Levi 's 505 straight fit jeans are clearly labeled 34 - 34 , but the actual size is 38 - 35 . The pants appear to be the real thing . My guess is that they were improperly labeled at the factory . Useless to me , of course .
 I ordered one pair of Levi 's and one pair of Wrangler jeans both 34 waist 30 length . The Wranglers fit perfectly but the Levi 's had to be at least 36x32 or larger . I thought they could n't be that mislabeled so I washed them to see if they would shrink . They did n't . I guess thats what I get for ordering clothes on-line instead of trying them on at a store . Thank you for asking . Phil
 My old levi 's 505 are made in the u.s.a. are tight fitting and ready show off my bulge and theses low quality levis are too loose fitting when they should be tight I even have to wear a belt with these 505 .
 The first set of jeas were the wrong size but still waiting for the revised size . Should be today or next week .
 I bought a pair of Men 's 505 Straight Fit , Blue Collar jeans made by LeviThis is not your father 's Levi 's , or even mine . Something bad has happened to this brand name . The sizing is all wrong , I had to buy a pair 4 inches smaller than my normal size for it to fit right . The material is thin , flimsy and clearly different than the full , sturdy Levi 's of the past . You could buy a pair and were certain that they were indestructible . Now they seem to be made from a fabric that you would make pajamas from.What has happened?Harry Lime
 Recibido el producto en perfectas condiciones , son r&aacute;pidos y seguros.No me gusto mucho el dise & ntilde ; o y la calidad . Gracias desde Vzla
 The style is inconsistent in some sizes . When I bought the pants , the picture associated with the style , was misplaced . It is now corrected . The pants are bulky ... with no style . The color is a mixture of generic blue and some white-ish threads like something you would find in old outlet stores . I am a fan of Levi 's but this particular one , is not my cup of tea .
 I have been trying to find a pair of Levi 's for my husband which are neither blue nor black . The photo of these jeans makes them appear to be brown so I made the mistake of ignoring the color name and assuming they were as pictured . Now he is going to have to wear the `` girlie '' dark blue because it is too much hassle to return .
 I recently bought a pair of 505 's for my tall son . The size I ordered was 34 x 36 . When they came in the mail the outside of the jeans was labeled correctly , but the inside tag read 34 x 29 . I did not notice this until I unfolded the jeans , a day or two after they arrived and unfortunately I have already thrown away the receipt . Good money lost !! How do I get a refund ? A quality control person really ought to check sizes before packaging . There is a BIG and obvious difference between a 29 '' length and a 36 '' . Help
 Quise recordar mis tiempos juveniles , pues esta marca de jean era lo m&aacute;ximo en esa &eacute;poca , pero la verdad la horma cambio y ya no los siento como en aquellos d&iacute;as .
 I need of tracking product no have my pant send all information pleaseWilmer hernandez wilmersimonhernandez@gmail.comW h s ven
 I bought size 40 but this pant it is two sizes biggerIt is not my first Levis but it is my first time with thisproblem with the size .
 Updated with info on the reordered pair ... Again a quality control issue . This time the waist fit ok , but the length was 2 inches longer than the other pair.I did n't believe all of the reviews about poor quality control until I experienced it myself . I am currently wearing a pair of these Jeans . I love them . They are super comfortable and fit great ; therefore , I ordered a 2nd pair in the exact same size.The jeans arrive and they do not fit right.If you get a pair that fits right , then the Jeans are 5 stars , but if you do n't then it 's annoying and frustrating -LRB- hence the 2 star ranking -RRB- . I have already reordered the jeans and will be returning the `` defective '' pair that I received . Yes , it 's annoying , but Amazon 's return policy makes it super easy .
 I just put on a pair of these today for Thanksgiving day . The seam on one leg is crooked and the waist is about an inch too large . I already removed the tags -LRB- my mistake -RRB- so I gues I 'll have to keep them but I wo n't purchase any more clothing from these people.I should have purchased them from a store like Sears . Live and learn I guess .
 As others have stated , these are not the same ol' Levi 's . The fit is terrible , the material is thinner and the quality is nowhere near what you would expect from Levi 's . I have started to look at Lee and Wrangler as replacements . Also , Harley Davidson now has a line of jeans that are better quality and better priced ... and since I own two Harley 's , it seems like the way to go .
 I ordered this pair having worn 505 's for years . I did n't keep the return paperwork and put them through the wash . When wearing them the first time I noticed that they are sized bigger than 38 in the waste.I would guess a full inch bigger . I now have add Levi to the do n't buy list .
 Great fit but did not like the washed out faded look . Description did not state that . I have 505 's and they did not look like them .
 I ordered a pair of the 505s for my husband . He is and always has been a 32x32 and always wears the same Levis 505s ... First of all , Rigid is not a color , it is an adjective . I have never seen jeans so stiff and uncomfortable . The pair could literally stand up on their own when they arrived . Second , they may be marked 32x32 , but they certainly fit like a 34x34 . I was hoping to save money , I should have just gone to my local Macys and picked up a pair there . At least he would have a pair of jeans he would actually wear then .
 Sadly , it appears that Levi Strauss has dramatically changed the cut of their classic 505 Regular Fit jeans . The new model is called the 505 Straight Fit and has a 2 inch wider waist and sits at the hips rather than the waist as the old 505 Regular Fit . I currently have 31 pairs of 505 blue/black jeans and a year ago bought a new pair and found that they did n't fit as the old ones did . I thought I got a cheap rip-off pair and bought another pair at a different store 6 months later only to find that they did n't fit either . I called Levi Strauss and was informed that yes , they had changed the cut of the 505 and now call it the Straight Fit . I was told that the 501 would fit similar to the old 505 Regular Fit , but it has a button fly that I do n't care for . I was also told that the Relaxed Fit was similar to the old 505 Regular Fit , but this 59 year old guy is 5 ' 11 '' and 150 lbs , so I do n't need a Relaxed Fit jean . So , after being a loyal Levi 's customer for 50 years I 've now gone to Lee jeans . They make a Regular Fit jean that fits me like my old 505 's and feels great . Maybe in the future Levi Strauss should consult with a company like Coca-Cola before changing an iconic product .
 The classic Levis 505 jeans are no more . They have now been replaced by Levis 505 `` Straight Fit '' jeans . This means they do n't come up nearly as high on the hips and they feel like hell when you wear them -LRB- unless you 're 14 years old -RRB- . Avoid at all costs if you liked the original style . Apparently the classic 505s had a tag in the inseam that said `` Regular Fit . '' If you can find these in a store or on eBbay , rock on . Otherwise , I would recommend Wrangler Men 's Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jeans . They feel like the old 505s and are actually a bit better anyway . Wrangler makes a better and more consistent product than Levis ? Yes , it 's true .
 I agree with all the reviews which have essentially complained about the current fit of the new 505 's . I had been wearing Levi 505 jeans for decades and have had the same measurements the entire time , so different sizes can not be the issue . These jeans used to fit great from the waist to shoe . But , as I now know from reading other reviews , while keeping the same label , Levi recently changed the fit of these jeans , especially around the waist . I have 3 pair of 505 's . While the oldest pair fits great , the last two that I purchased through Amazon fit poorly.The last 2 sets of 505 's I purchased each fit differently , but both ride too low on the waist . The silver fox colored jeans I purchased fits especially poorly , and the fabric feels flimsy compared to other Levi 's . With the new 505 's , I am continually pulling my pants up higher after bending or sitting.So after being a loyal Levi customer for my entire adult life , I will now switch to Lee regular fit , straight leg jeans , which I now feel are superior . Lee jeans come in as many colors as Levi , but they ride higher on the waist and the material is of equal or better quality IMHO . I notice that Wrangler also makes a similar jean that rides higher on the waist , so I probably will try one of this brand of jeans in the near future as well.Goodbye Levi , it was nice knowing you .
 I ordered 2 pairs of 505 from Amazon in the same size as a pair I have , 36 x 32 . The new jeans arrived as promised . The labels claimed 36 x 32 . These pants are so large that I can not wear them . I tried washing them in hot water and drying in a hot dryer . They are still way too large . I am returning them to Amazon . I 'll never buy Levi brand again . By the way , there are only five belt loops on the new Levi 's instead on seven and the material is MUCH thinner . Buyer beware.Ralph Miller
 I tried to cancel the order minutes after buying it because the color was n't as advertised . It was stonewash jeans -LRB- not as dark as it is claimed -RRB- . I returned the product after I received it with all the labels . Amazon , nevertheless , went ahead to give me only a partial refund . I have since stopped buying items of clothing from Amazon after that .
 I purchased two pair of 505 jeans because the two pair I owned were finally wearing out after about five years . Their longevity is a testament to Levis . I bought these jeans without trying them on ... why would I ? They are the same jeans I have been wearing for decades . When I finally tried them on at home I thought I had returned to the 70 's . They are very low rise jeans - the only thing missing was the 10 inch wide bell bottoms . The genius who decided to ruin a classic rather than simply introduce a new lower cut style , has probably destroyed relationships with thousands of life-long customers . I will return these jeans but never return to Levis until someone undoes a huge mistake .
 I have worn Levi 's for at least 50 years ! I never found any pants to be more comfortable . The last two pair of 505s I bought were so different then the ones that I considered an `` old friend '' over the years . The new ones seemed to feel ` rigid ' in the material used . I washed them many times , and they are still not comfortable . Also they are ` baggy ' in the thigh area . They seem too loose all around and ` hang ' on me . The label said `` Made in Mexico '' , so that answered all my questions . I am now searching for another brand after all these years .
 Not sure why but the jeans I received were the wrong size.The tag on the jeans said the correct size but for some reason this pair is way off . -LRB- I have been wearing the same size for years and have another that fit properly . -RRB- No matter how many times I washed them they are still 2-3 sizes too big.Someone put on the wrong tag .
 What 's going on Levi 's ??? Are paying attention to our opinions ??? I am a good ` ol Levi 's costumer , buying tru Amazon and I was going to buy a 505 , but not after all these reviews ; I have used other models and in the last few years , the guys are right ! , manufacturing and materials have been changing a lot , depending on the place or country where the jeans were manufactured ; well our opinion are important , so what 's going on Levi 's , do you want us to quit ??
 The Levi 's were `` irregular . '' They do not fit at all like an identical pair I purchased at a retail outlet . Ca n't understand how they can get away with this . I ca n't even wear these jeans . A total waste of money . I washed them to see if the fit would improve . Did n't happen . Buyer beware .
 These Jeans are pure rubbish ! Cheap , thin demin that feels like it is made from newspaper pulp . I swear , I think they contain some percentage of newspaper pulp , just so Levi 's can cut down on costs . They lose their colors in just a few washes and the fibers start fraying as soon as you wear them . They crush your crotch , they slide down and need to be hiked up every minute . Levi 's has obviously been taken over by a Bunch of MBA 's with degrees in worthlessness . MBA should stand for Master 's in Business Assassination , because that 's what they actually accomplish in the end . Look what MBA 's did to apple before apple wised up and fired them all . Apple was nearly killed by MBAs ! I am frustrated because I can not find any Jeans that fit on the waist like normal jeans do . I mean , what are these elitist upper management asswipes thinking , that by reducing the rise in their jeans , Men can wear them ? We have balls and we do not like crushed nuts . Also , this stupid low rise jean trend needs to die already . What kind of guy likes to have crushed nads , and have his pants hanging off his ass at the same time ? I guess American Has become Snookie Stupid , because looking like a douchey asswipe is consider cool.I 've spent months looking for jeans that fit like normal jeans . I went to LL . Bean but all their jeans look like something an elderly man would wear diapers with . I am 30 years old , and I just want normal jeans . Anyone know of any replacement brands for Levi 's ?
 Aweful . One leg was almost 2 inches shorter than the other leg . It was a waste of my time when I thought purchasing online would save me time from going into a store .
 I bought 505 Levis , size 36W x 32L , thinking they would be the same as the 505 Levis , 36W x 32L , that I bought in a store in Ithaca , NY several years ago . No such luck ! The new ones have less room from the crotch up , the stitching is shoddier , the belt loops are narrower and the cloth is thinner and less robust . In fact my two year old 505 Levis that have been washed countless times have thicker cloth than the brand new ones that have never been washed.What really bugs me is the fit above the crotch . It 's more or less okay when I wear a shirt . In the summer with a skimpy shirt or no shirt , the crack of my a. . will show and that 's really low class - even for females , which I am not one of.I am going to look at Carhartt the next time I need jeans . So far they have delivered reliable products .
 Probably this was the last time I ordered Levi 's online from Amazon.I got two pairs of Levi 's jeans -LRB- 505 -RRB- in the same shipment and both have extremely different fitting , none close to the Levi 's I know for so long . Now I am wondering why I was so lazy not to go to the local Levi 's store ... . My advice , if you can get out of your sofa and visit a local Levi 's store , it would be worth ...
 The Levi jeans are not what they once were . The denim used does n't seem to hold up as long as they use to , I find the denim also failing where the belt loops are stitched in . The fake leather patch on the back comes off after a few washes also , did n't this use to be real leather ? There use to be 2 additional belt loops as I remember than there are now , I find the belt slipping over the jeans because of this cut back.I am and have been an avid Levi fan , would purchase/wear no other jeans , however , now I find myself looking for a suitable replacement so I can enjoy the quality that Levi once had . The price has gone way up while the quality of the product has seemed to come way down . I am still wearing Levi jeans , but with much disappointment .
 I used to love Levis , but now they have gone with a thinner material , fewer belt loops , and the fit seems to have changed as well . They feel cheap and thin . A belt does n't hold them up evenly all the way around , there are 2 loops in front , 2 at the side , and only 1 in the back at the center . The effect is that you feel like your wearing a constant wedgy . Not to mention how they are charging more for these now . For a better fitting jean , at a better price , with enough belt loops , you 're better off with LLBean Double L Jeans .
 Could someone please tell me why Levi 's does n't make `` REGULAR FIT '' jeans anymore?I usually buy Levi 's 505 's in recent years . But always bought the regular fit size . Now all I see is `` STRAIGHT FIT '' sizing and they 're TOO tight ! Mostly in the upper leg area and seat . What is all that about ? Cost saving measure for Levi 's again ? As if the jean companies are n't making enough $ already !! I 'm reminded of this every time the temperature goes up in the summer time and I 'm trying to work in too tight jeans that are hot and uncomfortable to wear and work in !!
 After wearing these 505s three or four times , the stitching that holds the waistband to the jeans fell apart . I 've worn 505s most every day for 30 years and have not seen stitching fall apart even after years of wear . These brand new jeans just fell apart . I wo n't be buying Levis at Amazon again .
 Had purchased from this retailer previously.The previous purchase WAS the original rigid , heavy jeans I had been looking for . This time , however , the jeans were much thinner and had the ` wrinkly ' look coming out of the dryer . I will be returning these . This IS a very good retailer , just do n't always expect the same quality .
 These may not be the worst jeans I have ever owned but they are way ahead of whatever is in second place . You would think that as much as the charge for jeans now that they could afford to put some belt loops on them . I should have the advise of previous reviews and not purchased these jeans .
 So , I tried on a pair of these jeans in a store . They fit great , so I ordered a pair online for a better price . They came , and they did not fit . I ordered one pair of these and one pair of different Levi 505 's . Those fit.Who knows why the fit is so variable . You 're better off getting a pair in a store .
 The last two pairs I bought -LRB- February 2011 -RRB- had a very loose waist and a tight seat . I have in the past noted some variation in Levi 's sizing from one batch to another -- some are tighter and some are looser -- but the basic shape has always been consistent . These recent jeans are ridiculous . They are n't cut the same way at all . The waist requires a tight belt to stay up , and bunches up under the belt , and the seat is flat and tight . Uncomfortable and unattractive.Levi 's needs to fix this or they will lose many customers . I would think that the online outfits like Amazon would pressure them to improve quality control , because people order things online that they are confident will fit . If you ca n't trust consistency of sizing , folks will have to go to local retailers to try the clothes on first .
 These are not the Levi 's Jeans you were used to . Made in Egypt , very thin cloth , only five belt loops instead of seven . Also , the sizes are not accurate . I love Amazon because they refunded my Levi 505 purchase but I 'll never buy from Levi again.Ralph Miller
 Many of us 505ers out there have been wearing this style for many years ... During this time , there was n't any guesswork , just look for your size , grab them , and go ... But Levis has recently changed the cut of these classic blue jeans ... What was once 505 ` Regular Fit ' is now 505 ` Straight Cut ' ... Let me assure you - THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ... The new cut is tighter in the thighs and much snorter in the belt line/waist line ... They fit like low rise jeans and for most guys , they are prone to falling down ... I discovered this after returning three pairs to the store for thinking they were defective ... Why would Levis go and change a good thing ? . . Guys ... Just bring back the ` Regular Fit ' 505s ... If you want to offer a different cut , for heaven 's sake , give it a different model number ... But do n't screw with a classic ... Take a hint from Coca-Cola ... The ` New Coke ' was a failure - do n't screw with a classic ... I will not be buying any more Levis unless they can make the 505 regular cuts again ... Disgusted , Chris
 I bought two Levis 505 Straight Fit Jeans in May for my Dad in Hong Kong . They were bought as Father 's Day 's gifts for him . In order to order the right size , I asked him to take a picture of his old one to me `` W31 L30 '' . I received them on June 3rd and gave them to my friend to bring them to him . The sizes of both jeans were totally wrong . My Dad told me one measures W33 and the other measures W35.Both jeans will become donations . Sigh ... how come the actual size can be THAT OFF from what is listed on the label !!!! Very disappointed ... . No more Levis Jeans from now on for I can not trust the label anymore . Sigh ...
 My order was the pants Levis Mens size 34W x 32L and I came what I believe is 36W x 34L , made '' in Mexico , which leaves much to be desired in the quality of this product , something similar happened to me Levi 's Tumbled Stretch 34x32 made '' in China , shrank in the first wash being the length in 28 or less ... that disappointment
 I concur with the other disappointed , former , Levi customers . Levi has made a disappointing change to the 505 brand . I naively grabbed a couple 505 replacement jeans , tore off the tags and let them go through a simple rinse cycle . When I went to wear them I sadly found that they did not fit right . Way too loose for me . Not even close . I have done this many times before without problem . When I compared to my older jeans I noticed the labels `` straight '' vs. my good old `` regular '' tags inside.I thought I made a mistake and grabbed the wrong kind . But I could n't find my trusty `` regulars `` s anywhere for purchase . The sales person at a Levi store condescendingly told me that they were the same -LRB- actually , I am not sure she ever heard of `` regular '' 505 's -RRB- . As noted in these reviews , I did n't make a mistake , but it seems Levi has.My new 505s now hang separately in the closet and I wear them when I do n't care about how I look , like when I go to home depot or work in the yard . I would add `` or when I shovel manure '' , but I do n't really ever do that . It seems lthat perhaps Levi is cornering the market on manure piles with this stinky change .
 I ordered 3 pair of jeans , specifying 36X29 , because that is the size I wear , and have other Levi jeans of that size that fit perfectly . Although the label indicates that the jeans that I recently purchased are 36X29 , they are actually 37X293/4 according to the seamstress who had to alter the jeans . Needless to say , these are now the most expensive jeans I own , but they now are 36X29 . I will never order clothing through Amazon again , as it is obvious that Amazon is selling `` rejects '' from the manufacturer .
 I 've been wearing these for more than 40 years -LRB- 501-505 's -RRB- the denim continues to get lighter , the material flaws more frequent , and the sizing more random.I 'm done with the whole Levi 's thing . For my money , there are better , longer wearing options .
 I purchased 2 pairs of different colour this very same size from this same company1 year ago . This year I ordered the very same colours and size and niether of them fitThey are both too tight . . What is up with that ?!!!
 I ordered a size 35x32 . And that is what the tag said it was when it arrived . But , they were not a 32 length . They were about 2 to 3 inches longer ! I was surprised by this , because Levi has always been good with sizing . I would normally be able to order my size and have no problems .
 I thought the material was cheap and nothing like any Levi jeans I have ever owned . I made a big mistake . I do not like them
 The last time I bought a pair of 505 Levi 's was in 2000 in Orem in Utah . I have always been pleased with Levi 's products and was very saddened and disappointed when I tried on the pair I bought through Amazon.com.Everything about them appears to have deteriorated in 12 years . I can only attribute the cause of it to the fact that Levi 's have to cut costs everywhere in order to satisfy the demands of their Shareholders for more and more dividends in the face of ever increasing competition.Levi 's have lost my custom as far as ordering over the Internet is concerned . At least in a Shop I can see when they are not what I am looking for and leave them . That is my experience with them , so I think I will go back to the other brands I have been buying in the intervening 12 years .
 I bought these for my husband as an extra pair of 505 's . He has others in this style from Macys and Zappos . These jeans are almost an inch and a half smaller at the waist than the others , although the sizing reads the same . I just returned them . This is unfortunate since Amazon overs great pricing and service .
 After one washing two of the belt loops have detached . Really poorly made jeans . Very disappointed . Will never order jeans again on line . After this experience will have to see the jeans before purchasing .
 They fit fine and look nice , but they are noticeably thinner or &#34; lighter weight &#34; than past purchases I have made of 505 jeans . It 's a shame that these once durable jeans are now likely to wear down sooner . I will be searching for more durable jeans in my next purchase .
 The quality of the jeans is not the issue . I was not unhappy with the quality . The size is the problem . The jeans were marked 35 waist but clearly are at least a 38 . I always wash my husbands jeans before he wears them . By the time I washed the jeans there was no way that I could return them . I really did not notice that they were not the correct size until my husband tried them on . After at least 3 washings in hot water followed by a hot dryer they are still too big . So I am very disappoined .
 I love Levis and ordered a pair of these as weight lifting had made my slim fit 514 jeans a bit tight , so I figured these are the same cut , just not slim . However , I found these to be equally slim in the thigh . Jean fit is a rather personal thing , so it is n't that these jeans are bad . It is just that they are slimmer than I expect for a ` straight ' fit .
 I should have heeded the reviews that said that these jeans do not fit properly . I actually tried on a pair in a local brick and mortar store and they fit perfectly , -LRB- 40/30 's -RRB- so I thought I 'd try to save $ 20 by buying them online . Bad idea . The jeans ordererd through Amazon were a completely different fit . The ones in the store were made in Nicaragua and the Amazon jeans were made in Egypt . I have no idea if that has anything to do with the fit problem or not , but it 's a shame to see Levi 's destroying what USED to be a great AMERICAN product .
 I thought I just got a bad pair last time I bought these but now I see what the problem was . Also a bit of sticker shock at how much prices seem to have gone up in the last couple of years . Last pair I bought was at a Sam 's Club maybe 12-18 months ago for $ 27 . Never minded paying a bit of a premium for Levi 's in the past compared to other brands but even if they had n't changed the cut , I 'm not so sure they 'd be worth the $ 40 - $ 50 prices I 'm seeing now , especially if they 're being made in some offshore sweatshop . I never thought of these as designer jeans ; I just liked the quality and fit . Guess the company feels that it 's not profitable enough to also cater to the adult market . Good luck to them . As for myself , I think I 'll give Wrangler/Lee/Oshkosh another look .
 These jeans have changed in design ! We buy the same size Levi 's every year and these two pair that I just purchased are way too small . The waist and length is the same as always , but the thigh is way too tight . It barely fits over his leg ! Maybe they are trying to make skinny jeans . These are definitely not traditional 505 's . Very disapointed .
 The `` straight fit '' is complete awfulness -- the pants do n't fit in the waist correctly anymore , they do n't hold cuffs well . I hunt all over for the remaining regular fit 505s I love , and they are becoming harder to find.The new straight fit is absolutely awful .
 We were disappointed to find this pair of Levi 's 505 significantly bigger than a pair of 505 straight fit we bought last fall for my husband . He is tall and slim -LRB- 34 Waist 36 Inseam -RRB- . That is so hard to find so were delighted with the first pair . The new pair required $ 70.00 alteration to take them in to the measurements of the first pair we bought .
 I bought black 505 's in December 2011 that were made in Mexico . They are great , so I bought another pair . The latest 505 's may as well be another brand , they are so different . They are overwashed , really shrunken down and noticeably faded . Poorer stiching as well . I want my new jeans to look NEW . These are `` Made in Lesotho '' . Beware .
 I bought 32/34 for my son for Christmas . . He is actually is 30/34 but I bought them bigger to give him a little room . They are about 4 sizes too small . Unfortunately since we washed them before actually trying them on I ca n't return them . . I doubt anyone would be able to fit in them . . Somehow they were mislabeled . . they say made in Haiti ?? I will be giving them to good will . . I will never buy these online again . .
 I ordered 3 pair of pants from this seller and got 2 very fast . The 3rd was to be shipped when they got it in , which was fine . HOWEVER ... I came home today and found 3 more pairs of pants ! I called them to see what happened and they said I placed two orders ! I told them I did n't and they HUNG UP ON ME ! I called back and went over the while story again and was told AGAIN I placed two orders ! I told them their own order slips show TWO DIFFERENT TIMES so there was no way they were both placed by me ! They refused to do anything about it ! I am now stuck with over $ 100 of pants I do n't need ! With as many more options as you have on the internet ... go somewhere else or get ripped off !
 Geez , ordered a single pair of jeans 3 days ago . Still in the process of shipping . Seriously how long does it take to package a pair of jeans and mail it?It 's not like this is a 50 inch plasma tv set.Amazon you are not on your game . *** EDIT *** Amazon customer service promptly resolved the shipping issue and the Levi 505s were delivered on time.HOWEVER , I had to send them back the next day !! The sizing on the label said 28/30 but was in reality more of a 30-31/30 size . They were freakin ' huge on me -LRB- I have a small waist -RRB- . In fact they were larger than the 29/30 505s I already own -LRB- unbelievable -RRB- . I even had a tailor measure them to prove I was n't crazy.Who ever is manufacture these jeans these days is `` out to lunch '' on quality control . All I have to say is check your sizing carefully folks when you order these . You may not like what you find.Thankfully Amazon refunded my money in full .5 stars to Amazon.com customer service!Less than 1 star to the manufactures of these 505 jeans , just terrible !
 Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit JeanI have been wearing Levi 's 505 's for years . Recently they changed the fit from `` at the waist '' to `` below the waist '' . They are uncomfortable . I feel like I need to pull up my pants all the time . I wo n't be buying any more of these .
 Para ser justo debo corregir , que este producto es un buen producto , de buena calidad y precio ; pero yo cometi un error pues ya habia comprado el producto , ahora tengo dos y sigo estando satisfecho !!!
 505 jeans use to be made made by Levi 's to fit real mean . Levi 's changed the cut of the 505s to now be low riders with skinny little legs . I have personally talked to Levi 's Customer Service and basically they do n't care about all the old timers that have worn 505s all their lives . There basic answer is that they now are catering to the low rider , pinched honey wearers . Good riddance Levi 's ! Do n't make the mistake of buying any Levi products as they are foreign made and they do n't care about what used to be dedicated customers .
 good nightI want to express my deepest dissatisfaction with a product that acquired levis -LRB- levis 505 rinse model -RRB- last November , because it came with a defect in the right pocket red label -LRB- the label does not say anything is just a red cloth -RRB- supposedly legendary symbol and prestigious brand , I 'm really angry because I 've always used its mark since I was a kid , I live in a country where exchange controls and no one can buy dollars and it is very difficult to buy products online in united states both the final effort to send me a defective product , I demand you compensate me in some ways this uncomfortable situation.Thanks in advance I hope will be addressed my claim
 This review concerns two pairs of straight legs which were in the `` Black Amped '' color . I am writing to warn of some problems : -LRB- A -RRB- Color is a deep indigo blue , not black at all . -LRB- B -RRB- The jeans come with a big white tag warning the buyer that the jeans will bleed and continue to do so through their life . First time I 've seen this . -LRB- C -RRB- For denim , this is ridiculously thin fabric . The only upside to this is that I could shrink the jeans just enough to save me the usual tailor 's bill for altering Levis 32 '' inseam to the 31 '' they stopped selling years ago.They 're nice pants but the wrong color and wo n't last long .
 This jeans had a long stain streak under the right pocket , i paid my money for some new but i what i got was BS
 Use it about one mounth . Always uzipping fly , need to check it . Sometimes it causes severe discomfort , becouse I do not notice it and walk with open `` shop door '' !!! So good jeans , but not good fly . Hope it ` s happend only with me .
 The jeans appear to be real levis , but they are so thin it is like I 'm wearing nothing at all . You can see the color of my boxer underneath . It is true it has been a few years since I bought myself a pair of jeans , but holy cow are these thin .
 I 've been wearing Levis for 50 years and I 've never seen anything this bad . The fabric is paper thin , the number of belt loops went from seven to five and , as others have said , the rise has been reduced . This pair was made in Bangladesh - perhaps the ones made in Mexico are better . Do n't buy these things unseen on-line . I 'll keep away from Levis altogether unless I see a pair in a store with decent quality .
 Dear Amazon.com , My last order was about two -LRB- 2 -RRB- black levis jeans 505/33 * 30/straight fit . I was surprised that the size did not fit while I am used to wear it in that particular model.Where did that problem come from ? I came to the truth that the country where the jeans is made can make a huge difference . The 505/straight fit/33 * 30 made in Egypt -LRB- as those I bought recently -RRB- are smaller than Lessotho 's which are themselves smaller than Columbia 's . I have , you can realize , the same size and model from those countries!That is a very important issue on which Amazon.com should focus . May be you will need in the clothes identification to precise the manufacturer 's country.Regards .
 I purchased these because I thought I could always count on Levis for consistent sizing and quality . Unfortunately , this is no longer the case . The pants -LRB- 33 x 32 -RRB- are about a size too big and the fabric is much thinner , so I know they wo n't be lasting as long as the old pairs .
 Only five belt loops instead of seven . I 'm switching to Wrangler . Should 've read the reviews first . But hey , who would 've thought they would decrease the amount of belt loops ? I bought a pair of Levi 's two years ago and they have seven loops . But I lost two inches in the waist and was planning on buying a few more pair of jeans . I hope the manufacturer reads these reviews . The people who decided on the amount of loops made a dreadful mistake . Goodbye Levi 's . Hello Wrangler .
 I ordered 2 pairs of size 36x34 505 jeans from this listing , and they arrived fine , no problems there.The tag on the jeans say 36x34 , but when I put them on the waist is at least two inches larger than advertized , and the inseam is a full four inches larger -LRB- compared to an older pair of Levi 505 jeans that I have.I do n't consider this seller reliable , at all .
 I bought this pair of jeans for my husband . He is 6 ' 3 '' and always take the same size jeans . We when opened the package , it seemed that the jeans were way too big . He tried them on and the fit was way off -LRB- too long , too big . . -RRB- . I do n't know if the compagny has issues with this particular style or if we were simply unlucky with the fitting . Fortunatly , we were able to return the product easily .
 I have been a loyal Levi 's customer since the sixties and have worn the 505 regular fit because they felt comfortable , were durable , and were consistently sized . I bought Levi 's because I like they they looked and liked the way they felt while working in them . That 's doing real work , not just walking down a street or into a bar . In the fall of 2011 I purchased 4 pair of the regular labeled 505 's but noticed they did n't fit right . Came to discover the fit had been changed by Levi 's , I assume to attract a new urban demographic . Levi 's used to be proud of their heritage as a working man 's jean . I suggest someone at Levi 's try doing some farm work , specifically try and split a load of wood with a maul while wearing a pair of the newly designed 505 's . Swing the maul , bend over and pick up the split wood , then stack it . See how many times you have to pull up the new jeans for each block of wood split and stacked . You will find it 's obvious the new 505 's are not designed by or for a real working man . I suggest you add a new cut to the Levi 's menu to address the needs of the urban population but please go back to your old cut for the 505 's before I have to change brands . Real men everywhere will thank you .
 I purchased these because my old 505 's finally needed replacing . When I took them out of the box , I was shocked to feel such thin material . Levis may charge the same high prices , but they 've cheapened the quality of their 505 's regardless of the fact they 're made in China . You can buy much better jeans with recognized names for less than half the price on Amazon or your local discount store . So be it for the name Levis in my book . A cheaply made product at a high price based on their ` Old ' reputation.I would have returned them immediately but I was leaving on a trip in a few days and needed them . I said I 'll keep them but never order Levis again . I wore them only once and noticed a flaw on the top of the thigh . This was a frayed circular flaw about 1/4 inch in diameter ... The kind of flaw that results in a hole after the first or second washing . They never should have passed their quality control.I 'm returning them to Amazon for a full refund . I do not recommend Levis . What a shame for a once great brand .
 I ordered two of these about a year ago . The reduction of seven belt loops to five was very inconvenient , with my belt constantly riding above my trousers at the left and rght rear . But what was really irritating was that I was constantly pulling up my pants . I thought it was just me , or that my shape had changed . Then I learned that the `` rise '' was now shorter than it used to be and that they ride lower , which does n't feel right and I do n't like . Maybe the young crowd likes this . I 've worn levis ' jeans for forty years , but I do n't like the new cut . Someone in their review mentioned Carhartt 's jeans , which I tried and they feel like the old levis . I just ordered another pair of them .
 I bought another pair of 505 this year . I have been using 505s 34x30 for 30 years or more . Unfortunately this time the fit was different . The waist was very loose . So I went to exchange them . I found out that the 505s are not REGULAR FIT anymore , but instead STRAIGHT LEG or REGULAR STRAIGHT LEG . At the store , they convinced me to get one size down -LRB- 33X30 -RRB- . They fit well at the waist , however when I tried to sit , they felt really tight in the crotch . I had to return them . I do not understand why Levi 's has changed the style on an icon jean . I believe they are going to loose a lot of the loyal customers that have been buying the same 505 REGULAR FIT for years !!!!!!!
 So annoying . I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 as long as I can recall . The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans , though . And they are terribly , terribly inconsistent . In the most recent instance , I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon , in different colors . What I 've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico , some in China , some in Bangladesh , etc. . And depending on where they are made , the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent . When I order these things , I want/expect them to fit the same way , every color , every time . Not an unreasonable expectation , I think . Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years . Evidently , though , like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip , opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality . Makes me frickin ' sad .
 I just bought a pair of `` 505 Straight Fit '' jeans and will have to return them . -LRB- They used to be called `` 505 Regular Fit '' but Levi 's no longer offers jeans so marked . -RRB- Levi 's has changed the cut of these jeans since I last bought them . They 're now cut to ride an inch lower than they used to , and have less waist definition -- OK if you 're fat , or if you like to wear your jeans six inches below your natural waist . Ghetto jeans , anyone ?
 My husband has worn these for as long as he can remember . Always a classic perfect fit . Now they changed the `` classic fit '' to `` straight fit '' & they are horrible ! They changed the waist to a low rise waist ... the waist was also ridiculously too wide ... The whole hip area looked baggy & unattractive ... . The waist rise is so low that it would be impossible to bend over without exposing your rear -LRB- plumbers crack -RRB- What a shame ... Bought 4 pair ... returned 4 pair . -LRB- fyi . . tags all showed Made in Mexico -RRB-
 If you like to show plumber 's butt and sing soprano , the new `` Straight Fit '' Levis 505 are for you.Some genius at Levis replaced the classic `` Regular Fit '' 505 's with the terrible 505 `` Straight Fit . '' I assure you , there 's nothing straight about them . Bad fit . Bad jeans . ... and do n't expect any sympathy from Levis inept customer service . They 're too busy counting your money .
 Like many others have said , the 505 is now called the `` straight '' fit from the `` regular '' fit with no information provided on why or what changes were made . Therefore you buy the jeans thinking it is the old style but it is not , this one is supposed to be a hip hugger jean I guess . Why Levis did not just come up with another number for these lowriders I do not know , but what you get with the new 505 is not what you are going to like wearing.I finally went with the Premium Performance Wrangler regular fit and it is fine . Too bad since I have worn Levis for many years , but no more . Plus the lack of rivets in the back , lack of belt loops . Just not a good product anymore.They say other Levi jeans will work , they do not work so I can only recommend to the buyers here to try them on at a local store before you buy a Levis product and be sure it is really what you want.LDW120
 The following is an exchange I had with Levi Strauss recently ... You removed about 3/4 '' of material frombetween the top of the waist and the crouch on the men 's 505 `` Regular Fit `` jeans and you double labeled and re-labeled them `` straight fit '' . . -LRB- you haveboth labels on them !!! - very misleading !!! -RRB- ... and now they ride much loweron my waist and I ca n't keep them up ... or when I pull them up they choke mycrouch !!! I 've purchased Levi Brand for over 50 years and I never try them onand due to past consistancy , I have them hemmed 1 '' because I 'm an in-betweensize -LRB- I buy 38-32 -RRB- ... so now I 'm stuck with two-pair of Jeans I ca n't return -LRB- To Sears -RRB- and wo n't be able to wear ! Also , I 've looked for some of the `` oldregular 's '' but ca n't find them on the shelf any more . I also checked on theInternet and a lot of people are complaining about this same problem . Thedifference in the height of the waistband is clearly visable when you lay anold pair beside a new pair ; in the amount of material under the belt loops ... and is obvious where the bottom of the belt loops are now attached . And whileI 'm at it , the bottom of two belt loops -LRB- the ones on either side of the rearmiddle loop -RRB- pulled loose on the last four pair that I purchased -LRB- I now havethem pinned -RRB- . Would you like photos ? Folks , your quality and design is inreal trouble ! What are you going to do for me ??? Or should I just starttrying on other brands?Hi Richard , Barbara here from Levi 's . Thanks for checking in with us.The 505 style has been updated recently so that the waist and hips are straighter and the rise is slightly shorter . Now the fit is designed to sit lower on the hip . This means you will probably need to order a smaller waist size to get the same fit you have had in the past . If you choose to return your 505 jeans to our Consumer Returns Department , the inspector will exchange your jeans for the next waist size smaller . Levi Strauss & Co. updates many of our products from time to time to keep the line fresh and fashionable , based on demand from consumers and our retail partners.If there 's anything else we can help you with , be sure to email us back or give us a call at 1-800-USA-LEVI Monday - Friday from 6:00 am - 4:30 pm Pacific Time.Thanks again , Barbara , Levi Strauss & Co. , Consumer Relations , Case ID
 I purchased 4 pair of Levi jeans regular and 2 pair stone washed . None fit like the old 505 's I have . They were all about 2 inches larger in the waist and about 2 inches too long in the legs , and the bottom of the zipper is too low in the crotch causing the jeans to poke out like you have two or three pairs f socks in your underware . What a shame for a company that used to be known for providing great fitting jeans . I purchased a new pair of Wranglers and they fit the old 505 's . It is a sad day when someone who has been wearing Levi jeans since the early 60 's has to start buying Wranglers .
 I have purchased Levi 's 505 Regular Fit for 35 years . Much to my dismay , the most recent purchase I made turned out to be the newly improved Straight Fit . I could n't figure out why they kept falling down . When I called Levi 's said they would replace the pair I bought with a pair a waist size smaller . They seem to think if my pants are tighter it will keep them from falling off . Since I work in these jeans , moving around constantly , I like some ease of movement within the garment.The redesign from Regular Fit to Straight Fit consists of shortening the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband . I think it might be shortened as much as 2 or 2.5 inches . This makes it so the pants no longer sit at the waist , slightly above the hip bone which used to keep them from falling off.I am very disappointed in the new pants.My rating is really 0 stars .
 I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 jeans for more years than I care to admit . About a year ago I needed more new jeans so I ordered a couple pairs . They did n't fit quite exactly the way I expected them to , but they were okay . Last month there was this great sale on Levi 's jeans -LRB- on levis.com -RRB- , so I bought a couple more pairs . These new pairs really did n't fit - they were the correct length and waist size , but they were too long and didnt feel right . I wear 36/30 . I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 's in size 36/30 for years and years . So when I ordered a couple 36/30 , and they did n't fit , I was pretty surprised.I called Levi 's and asked about it . They said that they might shrink in the wash and that they would take them back for a full refund even if they had been washed . So I washed them . Several times . Though they did get shorter , they were still not short enough . And they did n't quite fit right in the crotch . So I held them up to my old jeans - they matched perfectly . I could n't find any difference at all , and yet they did n't fit . Well , I ca n't leave a mystery like that alone . So I laid them down on the bed , got out a tape measure , and I measured . I measured everything I could find , but nothing was significantly different from new to old . Then I flipped them over . Ah Ha ! I found that the new jeans were a full inch shorter in what is called the `` back center seam '' than the jeans I had bought just a year ago . This was the case on both pairs I had just purchased , even though the two new pairs were different colors and cloth weights . I then dug out a pair of 505 's from several years ago and found that the `` back center seam '' on that pair was 2 inches longer than the new pairs and 1 inch longer than the pairs I 'd gotten a year ago . That explains why the ones I had bought a year ago were n't quite right , but were okay , while the newest pairs , being of full 2 inches shorter in the back crotch really did n't fit right at all . As for leg lenth , since the inseam is supposed to be the length from the floor to the crotch , a shorter back center seam shouldnt have any effect , however , I can only guess that the short crotch was causing me to wear the jeans lower than I prefer , which somehow changed the effective the leg length . Because I wanted the legs shorter , I had to pull the pants up until they were binding in the crotch -LRB- does this make sense - not sure ? -RRB- In any case , they didnt feel right in the crotch and they were too long.This is disappointing for a number of reasons . First of all having jeans that I could simply purchase sight unseen , pair after pair after pair , is incredibly convenient . But it 's also disappointing because psychologically I think of Levi 's is something unchanging . Levi 's are Levi 's . Coca-Cola , aside from their momentary lapse of reason with new Coke , is Coca-Cola . Etc. . I dont want Levi 's 505 's to change . But strangely , the biggest problem for me with this change is related to the fact that Levi 's numbers their jeans styles . If they are going to change the measurements and design of the 505 , they should call it the 506 . Or the 505b . Or the 505 v2 . Or something . If they were always called simply the `` regular straight fit jean , '' it would n't be as big a deal to change it as it is when the product is called `` 505 . '' To me , psychologically , 505 's are 505 's are 505 's - if they 're going to change them , they need to start calling them 506 's . So I 'm sending my Levi 's 505 's back . I have no idea what I will buy in their place .
 I 'm completely exasperated , disgusted and hopeless . These are entirely unacceptable . There 's nothing `` good old blue '' about them . They 're made of poor quality `` denim '' that bears no resemblance to Levi 's good old denim . They look cheap and greasy , like some off-brand discount junk . In addition , they do n't fit . They 're almost 2 inches smaller than the stated waist size , as compared with the Levi 's 505 's of a couple of years ago . They 're essentially hip-huggers -- no room in the crotch . Worst , they 're made in China . I 'll spare the essay on Chinese trade and labor practices and simply remind readers of the frequent , nay , routine problems with the quality of Chinese-made goods , of which these are a prime example . I 've trusted Levi 's for over 40 years and have worn 505 's since the 70 's . No more . These represent the death of yet another great American brand . Without Levi 's in the market , whither blue jeans ?
 I 've been buying 505 's for many years ; I could hardly believe my recent order was supposedly the same product . The material is * much * thinner than it was even a couple years ago , and overall they look like flimsy knockoff copies of the genuine article . If you are considering buying these , do n't just take my word for it , look at the other reviews that discuss the dramatic recent drop in quality ; ignore these only at your own peril , like I foolishly did . The only consolation is that for $ 22 a piece , they are not such a bad deal for generic casual pants and as such I will probably not endure the hassle of returning them , but had I paid anything close to list price I would have felt royally ripped-off . They will certianly be the last Levi 's I ever buy , however . Too bad , it feels kind of like losing an old friend .
 Warning ! Levi 's changed the cut on it 's 505 jeans . Now they are more like hip-huggers . This happened about a year ago .
 I have bought many 505s over the years . In the last 2 months , Levis changed the name of the straight leg 505s to `` straight fit '' AND shorted the distance between the crotch and waistline by 2 inches . They are now low-riders . This was verified by a Levis rep I met at Macys . Guess they figure to save money by using less material . This is not just from Amazon but all original 505s are pretty much gone . If you want real dungarees to work in look elsewhere . Oh ... and try before you buy . This is my first and last online purchases of clothes .
 These are not the same jeans . Clearly Levis redesigned them . They are wider at the waist and are made to be worn lower . Beware , if you do buy them , try them on before you purchase and walk around in them -LRB- because they will fall down a lot -RRB- . If that 's what you 're looking for enjoy . I 've been loyal to this product , but it 's not the same so unfortunately I have to buy another brand of jeans now .
 I received these pant I am totally disapointed with Amazon / Levis due to the color is totally different what I expected . I bought one of this pant some time ago and it is the same color of the picture , now I bought the same Ridgid color and it is totally different , it is lighter . Adittionaly the size is incorrect 32x32 looks like 34x34 . Return this item is a thurny issue for me.Luis
 Recently I bought a 550 relaxed fit pair of Levi 's Jean -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- and the waist was ok but they were a bit long so in this ocassion I tried the 505 -LRB- 33 * 29 -RRB- and they were too tigh at waist but the leg size was ok . I learn it is necessary to consider the fit type , not only the size which is a bit strange as my old pair of Levi 's 555 -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- -LRB- not currently available -RRB- were ok . The fabric is thick and there is not complaint about the material but the sizing is a bit tricky . Sizes across the different fits should be ok but it seems not . A relative , chubbier than I , actually has a 505 -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- which are ok , so there seems to be sizing problems with this jean .
 The jeans I purchased fit very strangely ; they were a bit long and the waist was n't cut right at all . I kept thinking they would shrink a bit in the wash but they have n't . I 've purchased 505 Levi 's Straight Fit for many years and am familiar with how they should fit . These are not made correctly at all and I do n't really like them . I wo n't purchase these online again for that reason . I purchased online this time because even though I live in the home city for Levi 's , I have trouble finding my size as I am at one end of the size range .
 Hey I love Levis 505 Straight Fit , for the perfect way it sits on me , but for some reason this pair that i just got , not only did n't it sit like all other pairs I have , it also felt different a little thicker than I normally like it . Beside that it 's fine , the shipping came earlier than expected so thanks for that !
 I have worn the same size and style of Levi 's jeans for 20 years . I ordered a pair of jeans and shorts from this vendor . Since they arrived with the same label as the rest of my jeans , I just assumed that they were like the rest in my closet . I washed them and put them away without trying them on . BIG MISTAKE . When I did get around to trying them , what I had was two ridiculous garments with waist sizes easily 2 inches larger than all the other 32 's in my closet . They were so baggy that I could barely keep them on . Since I 'm not a 14 year old with an IQ equal to his age , I prefer not to wear pants that fall off my ass . It cost me more than I initially paid to have the jeans and shorts altered . Unless Levi has just assumed that we all want to look like idiots or they have introduced vanity sizing because so many Americans are obese , I ca n't understand why the same style and size on the label does n't match the same cut of jeans that I have previously purchased . Lesson learned , do n't buy jeans that you do n't try on in the store . No more online purchase of this product for me .
 I 'm disappointed because I ordered the pants but the size is correct does not match the size that is smaller
 Heads up on the fit -LRB- regular , original , etc -RRB- descriptions . Unclear why Levi 's felt compelled to alter the fits on these long established styles -LRB- 501 , 505 -RRB- but they did . What you used to buy is not what you 're getting . Could n't find a notice or explanation on any Levi 's site , so you 're on your own .
 Dear Levi 's , You used to have the best product on the market . As one other person said , `` you can walk in , know your size , pick up 3 pairs , and walk out '' and know that each pair was perfect . Now it 's like wearing a sheet from your bed , they are so thin and cheap . They suck ! They might as well put a strectch band around the top!There is hope . You can gain back millions of customers if you go back to the original syle of the 80 's and people WILL pay more , if they are good quality again . Then , you market the crap out of them saying how you chose to back to quality and watch the money roll in . Until then , I will go somewhere else . To cap it off , what do you say you manufacture it in the US !! GOOD LUCK , I 'LL BE WAITING !!
 the fit was to loose totaly disappointed . wo n't buy chlothes on here again . same size from store fits just fine .
 There are other reviews that talk about the various manufacturing areas that Levi 's Jeans are made from and the inconsistencies from sweat shop to sweat shop . Well it is true . These fit eh . Not so bad that I 'll return them but I am confident this is the last pair of jeans I will buy from Levi 's Co. .
 Let me start by saying that Levi 's 505 jeans are my jeans and will be my jeans until the end of time . The 505 's fit me perfectly and pretty much define my style . But there is something different about the ones that I received from Amazon versus what I 've purchased in the actual Levi 's stores.The material felt flimsy and the fit was completely different . The colors also did n't look anything like what I expected , being much , much lighter than what I had received in store.I sent them back and picked up another pair at the Levi 's store . I may try picking up the next pair from Amazon to see if I just got a bad pair , but I 'm not excited to give it a second shot .
 These are not the jeans I 'm used to . The waist is bigger than it should be . The material is thinner than my older Levis . I 'm keeping them because I need jeans , the price was better than in Kohl 's and they work , but I would n't order these again or recommend them . I 'll get used to this fit and expect them to wear out more quickly than they should !
 I purchased 36x30 jeans . I have worn Levi 's for 50 years . The pair I received said 36x30 - But the actual size must have been 25x30 , I could not get them on . Very Dissatisfied !
 I have worn 505 's for decades . I recently bought a new pair to find out they have changed the fit . I hate the new low waisted fit ! If they are going to change the cut of a pair of jeans , they need to give the new version a different model number . Very bad move on Levi 's part . Who 's in charge there and what were they thinking ?
 If there is a way of giving 1/2 a star , I would have done it . Yes , I 've been wearing Levis 505 `` regular fit '' for the last 30 years and it has always fitted me perfectly until now when the brilliant brains at Levis replaced the `` regular fit '' with `` straight fit '' and results in a classic example of if there is a way of screwing up a good thing , the Levis people thought of a way of doing it . Just like the classic Coke taste that was replaced a few years back that never were quite accepted by the public . For some reasons , they forgot what brought them success in the first place with a successful formula . Good bye Levis for screwing up an American icon . May you rest in peace .
 I always get 505 but these pants material is so thin Levi 's lately use thin and poor materials that this is my last pair of pants from levis will never buy levies again .
 I am very disappointed with these jeans . The fabric is very light . I have been wearing 501s and 505s for years and never seen anything like this . The only reason I am giving them two stars is because I am wearing them . I guess next time I need some new Levis I will need to go to the -LRB- shudder -RRB- mall where I can touch before I buy .
 This brand has been transformed from the one I trusted for over thirty years , to a POS.I 've worn Levi 's blue jeans ever since I was a teen . I 'm now in my early 50 's and these are obviously not the same quality jeans as they were even ten years ago . They 're thinner , the fit of the exact same size and style is extremely varied from one pair to another -LRB- even the belt loops are double sized or super skinny on two ` identical ' pairs of 505 's -RRB- , and they have been designed to self destruct in six months of casual wear.EVERY pair of my ` new ' Levi 's now tear out @ the upper LH corner of the right rear pocket after 180 days of ownwership . I NEVER carry ANYTHING in that pocket ; not even my wallet . There is no excuse for this identical , premature , calculated failure of a forty dollar pair of blue jeans . And the now dainty belt loops tear off these tissue paper jeans if you merely LOOK at them too hard . Chinese Levi 's = CRAP !!! Bye bye , POS blue cotton pants posing as Levis . I 'll not be purchasing another overpriced pair of these pale imitations . The greedy manufacturer has obviously made the decision that a billion new middle class Chinese consumers will buy garbage ` American denim ' . Those of us in the USA with a shred of memory sure as hell wo n't be buying this $ htt.DO NOT BUY LEVI 'S UNLESS YOU ENJOY LIGHTING YOUR MONEY ON FIRE .
 The jeans were very Slow in getting to me and they were way too big . I buy the same size each time for my husband and these were way too big .
 I 've bought several pairs of 31x30 Levi 's jeans in the past - including one pair of 505s -LRB- though not from Amazon -RRB- . These were too big by at least a size . I measured them and they were 31 &#34; long from the inseam , and were too wide at the waist and inseam as well . Returned .
 Maybe some people can buy clothes online without trying them on , but for myself , that 's proven to be most difficult . These jeans were cut very different than the ones in the store . Be careful .
 If you are buying a pair of Levi 's because you are a loyal customer , do n't waste your time . They looked cheap and were paper thin . What a disappointment , sent them back .
 I have worn Levi jeans and other apparel for about 70 years . They first quit making the jeans without the matching white and blue seam which I can see was quite an added expense . They also Quit using real leather pocket tags , also very expensive . ` They then quit honoring the `` If they rip , we replace then '' . The material gradually became thinner and the jeans did n't last very long compared to the originals that were usually handed down to about the third child in the family . The last straw was this latest pair I puchased after several years of avoiding Levis and they now have only 5 belt loops which makes them hang between the loops and do n't look good at all . Basicly I 'm saying Goodbye To Levi jeans for good !
 Why would any seller send out an item with the security tag still attached . I emailed them with the problem and got no responce ! When I took the pants into a local retailer to have the tag removed , they assumed they were stolen jeans ! My advice ... buy locally and save yourself the harassment .
 How on earth can you change the design yet keep the same name . Levis 505 jeans are not the same yet the company sells them under the same name ...
 I have not bought Levis brand in some time , in large part because of their discontinued support of the Boy Scouts . After more than 10 years , I thought i would try them again . Ordered my size that I have been wearing for 30 years and have bought recently in other brands like Lands End and Eddie Bauer . Got my levis and they keep coming down in the back , like they shortened the rise in the rear an inch . No problems with the same &#34; traditional &#34; fit in the other brands . So I do n't think it was me that changed.So when did Levis change their sizes for 505 's ?
 I ordered these per the size label on an old pair that have always fit very well . As yet I have not succeeded in shrinking them down to a proper fit ... . not a happy camper
 Returned these because my son wanted the Regular fit - these were not it - they are n't the same and did n't fit him high enough in the waist
 The redesign shortens the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband . I compared them to an older pair of Jeans and it looks like they loss an inch . If you like the way Levi 's use to fit , you will now feel like they fall off your rear , and are tight in the crotch . I 've worn these for 20 years , and have now switched brands . Bad move Levi 's !
 I was very dissapointed with my new 505 jeans . These are obviously a different design from previous 505 's and I am wondering if Levi Strauss could just tell that us before we buy -LRB- or give the new design a new number -RRB- . With this purchase , I have lost all confidence in their abilitty to deliver a consistant product .
 I DO N'T CARE WHAT IS POSTED WHAT KIND OF REVIEWS LEVIS GET . THE 505 LEVIS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS . THEY NO LONGER EVEN FEEL LIKE BLUE JEANS ... THEY ARE MORE LIKE DENIM SLACKS . I HAVE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR PAIR LEFT FROM ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO ... EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE HOLES IN THE KNEES AND POCKETS ARE FRAYED , I WILL WEAR THEM INSTEAD OF THE BRAND NEW 505s I HAVE IN THE CLOSET . i HAVE BEEN WEARING 505 LEVIS FOR THE PAST 35 TO 40 YEARS ... AS SOON AS MY OLD FADED AND FRAYED JEANS ARE FINALLY GONE ... I WILL HAVE TO FIND A DIFFERENT BRAND ... WRANGLER , LEE 'S -LRB- god forbid -RRB- OR EVEN RUSTLER BRAND AT WALMART . THE `` NEW '' 505s ARE NOTHING LIKE THE OLD ONES ... THE CUT , THE MATERIAL OR THE QUALITY THEY ONCE WERE ... I DO N'T KNOW IF EGYPT IS SCREWING THEM UP OR IF LEVIS HAS SCREWED UP BUT THEY ARE LOSING A 40 YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH ME . IF THERE WAS A 0 RATING THAT 'S WHAT THEY WOULD GET FOR THE `` NEW '' 505s THE OLD ONES WOULD GET A 5 STAR RATING ... BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS ... THANKS LEVI CORPORATION !!
 Apparently the same jackass who introduced us to `` New Coke '' in the 90 's must have gone to work for Levi Strauss . From the posts I 've read , the replacement of the regular fit 505 jeans with the `` straight cut '' lower waist version seems to have ticked off many customers including myself . I 've been buying Levis since the '70s . Now I am forced to buy another brand . They could have kept the regular fit and introduced the straight fit separately . I guess when the jerk was finished at Levis , he went to work for Apple developing Final Cut Pro X , but that 's another story .
 The jeans above the knee are nice , good quality and fit.The problem is that somewhere `` along the line '' the meaning of `` straight fit '' has changed . It used to mean that you bought a pair of normal jeans . What `` straight fit '' seems to mean now is that if you order this style you 'll end up with what closely resembles the ridiculous bell-bottom pant legs from the '70s . So anyone out there looking to order just a `` normal '' pair of jeans go for the slim or regular fit . Btw , the pictures DO NOT show just how '70s the Straight Fit pant legs are .
 I will not buy Levi 's on line again . The cuts are never the same fit for the same size . But I do like Levi 's
 In the last year or so these jeans were changed from regular fit to straight fit . This new fit appears to be intended for someone with no butt . The rise in back is lower as well . I 've been wearing 505 's for decades , but when I tried these new jeans on they were instantly uncomfortable . I have returned them for a refund .
 Levi 's has replaced their 505 regular fit jeans with this abomination , which is a completely different product . The straight fit jeans are not cut the same as the old regular fit jeans and you can not trust the size . Worse , they only have five belt loops instead of seven , so they do not stay up . The fabric used is also inferior to the original 505 regular fit jeans . Before ordering , be sure to have a look at these things in a store to see if this is really what you want to purchase . Levi 's had better figure out a way to sell these to the teeny boppers because their customer base sure is n't going to buy them .
 Levi changed their size specs on the traditional 505 . The `` straight '' 505s have a shortener rise , and are smaller in the hip and leg . The old style fit my husband perfectly - a no brainer when it came to shopping . The new `` straight '' cut is awful . If Levi wanted to introduce another fit , then why not give it a different number and keep the sizing the same on the tried and true 505 . You 've lost a customer with this change .
 After many years of buying the same Levi 's - 505 regular , 38 X 30 , these new jeans are a different cut and the leg size was at least 3 inches too long . I had to return the jeans and will have to move to another brand . Great pity as I really liked my old Levi 's .
 For the past few months since I bought my new jeans I just thought I was in between sizes . Turns out they changed them . No longer do they work , they just go around your waist like some sort of low cut girl pants . Tightening your belt does n't really help either . I thought to myself , `` I do n't want my pants to change every month on some whim of some designer who thinks they know what 's comfortable and what makes me feel like me ... I 'm going to go with a classic ... Levi ... If I find the pair that works for me they wo n't change , they will be here later . '' Wrong . Comfort and pants fitting are apparently unimportant . What is important is pandering to a perceived money base who use their jeans for standing around and looking in a way , not for people who have to bend over and lift anything because the new versions fall down .
 I read the bad reviews but stubbornly decided to order these jeans anyway -LRB- 505 tumble rigid 31x32 -RRB- . And , just as others had warned , the size did not match other levi 's I own . My simple advice
 What is wrong with you people ? I have bought and worn 505 regular fit jeans all my life . Now for some unknown reason you have decided to discontinue this very cut . The closest I can get is the straight cut and they suck . They are crotch bound and uncomfortable . They are designed for the people who wear them around their ass . No thank you , you have lost a good costumer .
 I have been wearing the newer Levi 's `` Straight Fit '' tag for 6 months now , and i am ready to give it up for good!I just pulled out my older worn out `` regular fit '' pre `` straight-fit , '' patched up the hole and i 'm wearing them again until i can find a new jeans brand . The waist is too low on the new `` straight fit . '' If you hold them up next to each other , the straight fit has a shorter fly . My ass is hanging out . . and i 'm a tall fairly skinny guy . There 's no snug support anymore . What happened to my 505 's ??? Levi 's has spread themselves too thin . They seem to have gone quantity over quality . At first i thought , `` they can screw around with all of those foolish looking jeans as much as they want , as long as they 're consistent with the good old 501 , 505 , 517 . . , '' but the foolish experimentation has gotten out of hand , and now the 505 's have been tainted . IMO Levi 's needs to cut the fat . Go back to the durable , traditional , simple line-up , and then only add a handful of other options for the made to last a month spandex type . Levi 's has screwed around too long , and now it 's just screwed up . I 'm sad to not be able to wear them anymore . But I want quality , long lasting products , that 's what brought me to Levi 's two decades ago , and now , that 's what 's going to make me leave .
 Levi 's are taking the micky , they have completely changed the 505 jeans and now they are something else ... I have more than 2 % body fat so I would look like a fool in these low cut genital revealing jeans.Well I guess Levis feel the need to change the demographic of their customers , and as such I should just get my butt over to the stores and try some new brands ...
 WARNING
 The waist on these jeans say 33 but they are as big as a 35 . they must be seconds or irregulars .
 The outside seam ends up on the top of my foot . I ca n't believe I have to start figuring out what brand of jeans to buy going forward . I 've had Levi 's for 40 years . Do n't buy 505 's online ! go get them at the store and make sure they fit and are free of defects !!!
 The new 505 Levi 's fit my husband but were tighter than his old ones . The most alarming development is that the fabric is so thin . I ca n't image these jeans lasting more than a year of moderate wear . Disappointing . I wo n't be buying Levi 's anymore .
 The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline , an endless abyss . The back label , which supposedly should be leather , now seems to be made &#8203; &#8203; of cardboard and a lousy finish . The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least , in my experience , has been . I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world . Previously , a Levis jeans was a piece `` almost perfect '' , today I can not say the same . I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans .
 I ordered these Levi 's size 42 '' x 29 '' . Not an easy size to always find . But they arrived with the tag that indeed listed the size as 42 '' x 29 '' . It tried them on . They seemed too long . I took them off and measured the inseam . It was 30 1/2 '' rather than 29 '' . I boxed them up and returned them . It makes me hesitant to order jeans online . Better to go in the store and try them on .
 Jeans were exactly what I ordered.But once I tried them on the left leg seam had a twist in it.The outside seam twisted to the front.I will continue to buy my Levi 's at Levi 's . Com .
 Ordered 32 &#34; X 29 &#34; 505 Levi 's . Always a given - great quality great fit - well not anymore . These were manufactured in a country I 'd never heard of ??? and the fit was terrible . I ordered a 32 waist and what I received was more like 33 ' or perhaps even 34 &#34; . Buyers beware . I 'm glad amazon has a nice return policy .
 They are now straight fit which means low rise . The closest to the Regular Fit are the 550 's . I returned these .
 I bought these for my 6 ' 5 &#34; , 190lb husband . I usually buy him 34x36 as 33 is hard to find . 34 is always too big in the waist and rear . These were so tight he could n't even fasten them . Sending back
 I bought a pair of `` regular '' 505s , as i have done before , and they have messed with a classic ! They no longer fit nice at the waist , they have changed them to a lower cut ! why ?? Do not be fooled like i was.no wonder people are complaining.And to be perfectly truthful , they just did not seem the same quality at all , very thin . Was really gutted.Just hope levis see sense and change them back to how they were ... soon
 I have been wearing Levi 505 jeans for several years and like the fit . I recently bought two pair of Levi 505 jeans , same size . When the jeans arrived I noticed they were manufactured in two different oversea 's locations . To my surprise , one pair was too small and the other too large . I returned both pair with no problems ; I 'm going to try one more time and if they do n't fit this time guess I 'll end up going to the mall .
 I bought two pair of jeans . One pair fit great . The other pair had legs obviously two inches longer than the other pair .
 The silt-color `` Levi 's 505 Straight Fit Pants '' that I received did not fit like I expected them to . The `` rise '' measured from the crotch to the top is 1-1/2 inches shorter than traditional Levis 505 pants . As a result , they fit like `` low rise '' style pants , not like the 505 Levis that I have purchased in the past . Also , the upper front fabric is excessively wavy when the pants lay empty , flat on a table . They remain so when wearing the pants , unlike the pants shown in the photo . Properly tailored pants would lay flat .
 they are not the same weight or quality I am used to getting at lord and taylor , I also got a pair in black and they are a twill not what I expected . I needed them for trip and took them and wore them , too much of a hassle to return . . thanks for asking
 My old 29x34s are much smaller in both waist and length compared to the new and returned 29x34s . What other brands are there that are really 29x34 ?
 What has happened to Levi 's ? Very thin material , have had several rip on the seam of the back pocket in less than 6 months . Even before they ripped , when I went outside on a cold day , it seemed to offer no warmth in the back end , like it had already ripped , but it had not yet . Not much luck with Wrangler either . I guess if you want good jeans nowadays , you have to pay up bigtime . These are not even close to acceptable . Prepare to be disappointed .
 The last purchase of these jeans was for something called regular fit . They are called something else now but the tag does not say what it is . The fit is lower on the hips . The material is also noticeably thinner so I doubt they will last as long .
 I bought 3 pairs . 2 size 30x32 -- rigid and tumbled rigid , 1 size 31x32 tumbled rigid.The rigid pair fits much larger than the tumbled rigid , even though they are tagged the same size . MUCH larger , like two sizes larger . The 31x32 tumbled rigid are made in egypt , had root beer or something sticky inside the bag , had a bent zipper , and are 2 inches SHORTER than the same style in 30x32 . I think levi 's is way too big to have any kind of real quality control . I 'd rather just pay > $ 100 and get a nice pair of selvedge denim I 'll have for years to come .
 Levi 's denim is so thin now , they tear at the crotch given the slightest stress . They look nice . Just do n't jump , squat , climb , run fast , leap , dance , ride a bike , or any other physical activity . I thought I had gotten a defective pair , but four pairs from different stores tore in the exact same place in less than a month of wear . Such a shame for what was once a great product . I 'll stick to Wranglers which do n't look nearly as good as Levi 's but they last forever at half the cost .
 I have been a Levi 's guy all my life , 58 years . Just like most I started with 501s and as I got a little older and wider moved on to the next most comfortable version . I 've now been wearing 505 and 550 for almost 5 years . While I 'm not going to put the actual size in print , I have been really pleased with the consistency of sizing over the years ... until last week when a pair of black 505s arrived at my door . As always I dumped them in the washer immediately to get rid of the new look and feel -LRB- cold wash , low temp dry as always . -RRB- The next morning I put them on and at first they felt a little tighter than usual . I thought , well maybe I 've put on some weight around the middle recently ... it happens . Well , I SUFFERED all day at the office as these jeans cut me in half . As soon as I got home , I pulled out a flexible tape measure to see what was up . To my surprise , this pair was 1.25 inches smaller around the waste than every other pair I own . Same brand , same model , same size ... except it was n't . So where does this story end . I sent the jeans back to Amazon the next say explaining the problem and as always Amazon sent me a full refund . This is why I do so much business with this great company . They put the customer first . I have since ordered another pair which arrived yesterday . I 'm hopeful that the new pair will actually be the size ordered and that the original pair was a fluke . Some guy on the other side of the planet where Levi 's are made is probably still laughing about the crazy American who got the tight jeans that he mislabeled . I guess it is sort of funny .
 The denim material is fine but the pants have too few belt loops , which causes the pants to sag in the back when you wear them .
 Levi 's thinks they can change the cut and quality of their jeans without losing customers . By shortening the rise to accommodate younger customers , they will lose those of us who desire comfort.Also found out that they produce different quality and sized jeans for different stores . Will be looking for a different brand for my next purchase .
 What you read in recent reviews of Levi 505s is true - they have changed the sizing a LOT & your old size wo n't fit you anymore.For years I 've bought 33 x 32 . I never even bothered to try them on - they always fit nicely . Sadly the last 2 pair I bought fitpoorly - the problem , as many others have pointed out is that they ride too low on the waist . I 'll be shopping for Lee or Wrangler next time I buy jeans .
 I have been wearing Levis 505 jeans for years . I bough these and immediately noticed that the material quality is not as good as the ones I bought over a year ago . This material was thinner and not as comfortable . I also noticed that the fit is not the same as the old 505s -LRB- these are the same size I always wear -RRB- . What 's up Levis ... . It looks like my next jean purchase will not be Levis brand !
 Sad day when a pair of `` classic '' Levi 505 's are the most uncomfortable pair of jeans I 've ever owned.Not sure why the company just could n't come up with a different number for these new low rider jeans and leave the 505 's alone . I 've worn no other jeans since the 70 's , but unfortunately it looks like I have to move on to some other brand .
 From your page : `` Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit Jean `` These are not the same thing , nor are they the same jeans . `` Regular Fit '' 505 jeans were discontinued by Levi 's . Their replacement is the `` Straight Fit , which among other things , has less belt loops and does n't seem to fit worth a damn . Please , Amazon , at least fix the wording , there is no such thing as `` 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit '' Levi 's . I would gladly buy 2 pair of regular fit 505s right now , but there are n't any , so I had to buy a used pair off of ebay.After that wears out , I guess I 'll go naked . I 'll never buy what they are currently selling . Some things should nto be messed with . Levi 's 505 regular fit jeans were great the way they were .
 Agree with the other reviewers who criticize the way they fit -LRB- do n't fit -RRB- at the waist . While they feel and generally fit like quality Levis , they are more low-rise than I expected or like and I am constantly pulling them up . .
 Levi seems to have changed the cut - I always bought 505s , but my latest pair is far lower accross the backside and does n't fit . No more levis for me .
 I have the same problem as every other person providing feedback . The `` Regular fit '' fit me great . The straight fit fall off my rear and I am constantly pulling them up . As soon as I can find another pair that fit right I will switch and never buy Levi again . You can take your hidden price increase and shove it .
 The 505 straight fit is horrible . The 505 `` regular '' fit was much better , but has been discontinued.Levis , please bring back the 505 regular fit .
 I wasted my money . I will buy Carhartt from now on.Problem with Levis
 These pants are NOT authentic Levi 's ! They are cheap Chinese knock-offs . They do not fit at all like any other Levi 's 505s that I have purchased from a local brick and mortar store or have worn over the past 25 years . They are defective , as well , akin to outlet store items .

 I was a loyal Levis wearer for decades . I even put up with the `` coolness tax , '' the higher price that Levis command only because of the famous brand name . Those days have passed , though.The `` new '' 505s are made from something a lot lighter and less durable than before . It seems like only a few weeks before the back pockets blow out , forcing me to buy again . In fact , older Levis with the heavier material are in better shape than the new ones , with less wear on them . A well-known competing brand still uses the heavier cloth , so that 's where I 'm buying now . If Levi went back to something more rugged , I might consider buying them again - but I really do n't have time or patience to go around checking all the features of all the brands . I 'd rather just go to the store , buy what I know , and be done with it.Bye-bye , Levi . We had good times together , but that 's the past . I have a future to get on with . -- wiredweird
 The belt is attached to the buckle by two tiny screws . One of them fell off a month after the belt was bought , rendering the whole thing almost useless . A little later the paint on the buckle started to chip away , exposing the true color -LRB- brass -RRB- of the buckle , giving an uncomplimentary look . Definitely would not recommend it .
 What about this product?I bought the May 12th and I have not received , and I have not received the 6th of June.Also I have not received any message from the cause of the delay
 This is my first time that I bought jeans on line , And I think they send an imperfect jeans . I use to buy Levis 505 32 30 I bought two 505 jeans and one of them was made in Lutovo and not fit good , is different and is very unconfortable . Sorry for my english , but my jeans are worst .
 i bought this pair of jeans . im from malaysia . to my suprise the jeans was made in cambodia with lowest level of quality . i cant return because the cost involved is even more than the cost of the jean . i learned tht i shouldnt be naive and trust big brands for highest level of quality . my honest review . please publish .
 I bought the Levi ` s 505 36x34 and 2 pairs of jeans Levi ` s 36x34 . But the 505 model has proved to be larger than the waist and 2 `` longer than the other two , I am very disappointed . I do not trust online buying Levi ` s
 Every other pair of jeans I have stays around my waist and does n't drag on my heels . Is 34 inches different in Mexico where these are made ? They are WAY too loose and wo n't even shrink when washed . I have to constantly keep pulling them up . I will never buy Levi 's online again .
 this shorts are good but they are to tight i ware a 34w and that is what i got but they make these way deferent i would need a 36 or 38
 I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie . There 's there 's zero stretch in this , it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big . Since they 're short from crotch to waist anyway , it does n't much matter.The top fits better , since you adjust it . The cut is still quite poor and , again , there 's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders . It 's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust . It 's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.If you 're narrow through the hips , shoulders or bust , this combo will probably be a nice fit . If you 're curvy , you might want to rethink this . It 's a shame since it comes in plus sizes . Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO .
 i guess the cheap price on this should have clued me in . i ordered this for my wife . looks great on the model in the picture most likely because the use different sizes , meaning you get it and the bottoms are huge and the top is small ... not anything like the proportions in the picture .
 They are Not large enough , and fairly inflexible . Inelastic , Cheap , and unwearable for me . I discarded them . I would n't recommend buying them
 I wanted these socks for a trip to Europe , where I would use them daily to walk , run , and hike . I have 2 old pair of Ultimax socks that I love . My research lead me to the replacement which appeared to be these Wigwam Cool-Lite Pro socks . I had planned to buy 9 pair if I liked the one pair I ordered . As soon as we received the socks , my wife washed them for me as is my custom . They were washed with a load of other whites , including other socks . These Wigwam socks came out pilled ... and not just a little pilled , but a lot . And there was a thread coming out of the sock where it would be on the top of the foot . Point
 Not sure I can really tell if they are COOL -LRB- temperature wise -RRB- or not . They do seem to come apart and ball up a bit . After a some washing and wearing , I ca n't imagine they would n't develop holes after a while . Not worth the cost , IMO .

 Great price and these pants are very durable ... . but the the lining causes them to be too hot for spring/summer hiking . While they are nylon , they are the `` shiny '' nylon which causing a swishing sound when you walk . I bought these for a summer scout hike . However , one trail run last weekend and I have now bought some much lighter weight pants instead . You get what you pay for with these .
 I bought these pants thinking they would be great much like othere I have bought ... They are the hottest pants I have EVER had !!! Within 5 minutes my legs are soaked!Is it because they are nylon ??? Maybe ! But , think twice before you buy these !!!
 Not impressed . Wo n't stand on own . Product is filled with foam inside and is unfinished on the bottom . I was going to send it back but it 's not worth the return shipping and time .
 These jeans run very tight through the seat and front . I have well over a dozen pants of identical size -LRB- various brands and styles , some also Dickies -RRB- , and most all of them will fall off me without a belt . I 'm tall and lanky . In these pants , I struggle to get a phone or keys out of the front pockets , and sitting down it 's impossible . Seeing as how these are active work pants , it only makes things more difficult and I avoid wearing them . It 's a shame because they 're fairly robust and look decent .
 For a Big Man 's product the cut is terrible . Having read that was the case in another review I played safe and ordered two sizes.Neither fit ! Hopefully I 'll lose weight and make use of them in the future but considering my present needs they were a waste of money .
 These did not fit like my other jeans . I bought 36 x 34 and these are 2-3 &#34; longer . They measure about the same inseam as my other ones -LRB- 34 &#34; -RRB- , but when compared them from the waistband down is where I find the huge difference . I was planning to send them back , but they asked me to pay for shipping to return them . I will just wear them to work around the house . I certainly do not recommend these as a replacement for your regular jeans unless you already realize the fit of these are very different . I will try to upload a picture so you can see what I mean .
 My son wanted these jeans so I ordered them for him . When he wore them he said the material is too stiff and they wore out between the legs on about the fourth time he wore them . He was so upset he threw them out and said he will never use dickies again .
 This product is cheaply made & the sizes run extremely large . The small is supposed to fit sizes 2-8 , height 5 ' -5 ' 6 '' & weights of 100 - 135 . I am a size 5/6 , 5 ' 4 '' tall , & 125 lbs yet this costume fits like a bag on me . It is too long & weigh too wide . If I were 8 months pregnant maybe it would fit alright . As far as the cheaply made part , as soon as I took it out of the package I noticed there were seams already starting to unravel . All in all , this costume is not worth the money .
 I read mixed reviews on this product but decided to take a chance and order it for my girlfriend . Bad decision.I found the shoulder and neck stitching on this costume was loose and pulled out , the threads were almost dangling , either from poor sewing and workmanship or because the product was possibly stretched , ripped , or otherwise damaged by a previous customer and returned.As for sizing , it must have been made by Omar the Tentmaker because the Small/Medium fit is HUGE and baggy , my girlfriend is normally an size 11 , 5 ' 7 '' and she was drowning in it .
 The Costume was not in a good condition and it was smelling . For the same price I could have get a new and unused product .

 i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo , but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front . The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy , and the ties up the back looked awful . It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine , but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it .

 this mask is gigantic , it could not fit on anyone i tried , and it is insanely difigured , i dont recomend
 I ordered this for my husband . Never had bought or ordered one before . Was n't aware you do n't order the size of shirt/coat/tshirt presently used . This item ran really small . He could not even pull it up over his shoulders . Will make a gift for a much smaller family member !
 The wrong item was sent to me even though the shipping labell inside the packaging stated what I had ordered ! I had to ship it back and still have not received the correct item and missed the opportunity to give the gift on time .
 Dickies Men 's Short Sleeve Coverall , Medium Blue , 2X Large-RegularOrdered same size as before but crotch was about 3 inches lower.Washed three times in hot water - not much help.Maybe made in different country caused the difference.Quality good
 This product is cheep . The strings keep coming lose . I do n't know It seems like some thing you could buy at walmart since it 's so badly built .
 Sizes are cut small . Fabric is light weight and cheap feeling . NOT even close to working-weight quality . Wo n't last past a few washings . Maybe ok for lounging around the house instead of in your underware . Made in China .
 This suit fits like a true Italian size - I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately . It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise , the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should , even though the body length was normal for a regular . I think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long . So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves .

 This should be labelled as a Toddler hat , not a child 's hat . It is way too small for my average-sized 6-year old and it even fits really strangely on my 3-year old 's head . It 's like it is not tall enough on the inside to fit a head in it . I 'll keep them -LRB- I bought 2 -RRB- since it is not worth the money to send them back , but I do n't think they will get much use . Aside from the size issues , they are nice for the price .

 I think this shape wear has a bad design - the seam between the top and bottom part digs into your lower ab and makes it very uncomfortable . They should make the whole thing seamless . I have a Lipo in a Box capri and I love it - it 's seamless . I should n't have bothered with Flexees but I wanted to try because they had xs size . Lipo in a Box only has s.
 Created a weird crease on the thigh because it is too tight , does n't provide much tummy support . Does smooth the buns and love handles though .

 It is a new lighter weight than the last pair I had . I liked the fit but in less than a week there was a hole along the seam on a leg .
 I always wear the Levi 's 505 straight leg jeans . However , these are of a softer , inferior fabric than I expected . I have myself to blame . I have learned over time that jeans are the one thing that should not be ordered online . It 's always better to go to a store -LRB- I use Macy 's downtown location in Washington , D.C. -RRB- , try them on , and make certain the fabric is what you 're looking for and the size is right . I will wear them , but I do n't care for them . -LRB- I hate returning products . Just do not like to return . -RRB- The main reason I did n't go out and buy a pair is that Amazon had such a great price -- and now I see why . At no place on the page from which did I see anything saying these were not the stone-washed denim jeans I prefer .
 I 've bought several pairs of 31x30 Levi 's jeans in the past - including one pair of 505s -LRB- though not from Amazon -RRB- . These were too big by at least a size . I measured them and they were 31 &#34; long from the inseam , and were too wide at the waist and inseam as well . Returned .
 I bought these for my 6 ' 5 &#34; , 190lb husband . I usually buy him 34x36 as 33 is hard to find . 34 is always too big in the waist and rear . These were so tight he could n't even fasten them . Sending back
 I bought a pair of `` regular '' 505s , as i have done before , and they have messed with a classic ! They no longer fit nice at the waist , they have changed them to a lower cut ! why ?? Do not be fooled like i was.no wonder people are complaining.And to be perfectly truthful , they just did not seem the same quality at all , very thin . Was really gutted.Just hope levis see sense and change them back to how they were ... soon
 I have been wearing Levi 505 jeans for several years and like the fit . I recently bought two pair of Levi 505 jeans , same size . When the jeans arrived I noticed they were manufactured in two different oversea 's locations . To my surprise , one pair was too small and the other too large . I returned both pair with no problems ; I 'm going to try one more time and if they do n't fit this time guess I 'll end up going to the mall .
 I ordered 2 pairs of size 36x34 505 jeans from this listing , and they arrived fine , no problems there.The tag on the jeans say 36x34 , but when I put them on the waist is at least two inches larger than advertized , and the inseam is a full four inches larger -LRB- compared to an older pair of Levi 505 jeans that I have.I do n't consider this seller reliable , at all .
 I bought this pair of jeans for my husband . He is 6 ' 3 '' and always take the same size jeans . We when opened the package , it seemed that the jeans were way too big . He tried them on and the fit was way off -LRB- too long , too big . . -RRB- . I do n't know if the compagny has issues with this particular style or if we were simply unlucky with the fitting . Fortunatly , we were able to return the product easily .
 This is my first time that I bought jeans on line , And I think they send an imperfect jeans . I use to buy Levis 505 32 30 I bought two 505 jeans and one of them was made in Lutovo and not fit good , is different and is very unconfortable . Sorry for my english , but my jeans are worst .
 I ordered these per the size label on an old pair that have always fit very well . As yet I have not succeeded in shrinking them down to a proper fit ... . not a happy camper
 The outside seam ends up on the top of my foot . I ca n't believe I have to start figuring out what brand of jeans to buy going forward . I 've had Levi 's for 40 years . Do n't buy 505 's online ! go get them at the store and make sure they fit and are free of defects !!!
 The new 505 Levi 's fit my husband but were tighter than his old ones . The most alarming development is that the fabric is so thin . I ca n't image these jeans lasting more than a year of moderate wear . Disappointing . I wo n't be buying Levi 's anymore .
 The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline , an endless abyss . The back label , which supposedly should be leather , now seems to be made &#8203; &#8203; of cardboard and a lousy finish . The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least , in my experience , has been . I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world . Previously , a Levis jeans was a piece `` almost perfect '' , today I can not say the same . I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans .
 WARNING
 This jeans had a long stain streak under the right pocket , i paid my money for some new but i what i got was BS
 Good afternoon ... how is possible that companies such as Amazon and Levis sell and send defective items without going through a quality control . One pair of pants that I purchased came with one sleeve shorter than the other . How may be possible coming from you ? What can I do with this piece of rag ?
 I ordered a pant size waist 35 inches and the pant came size 37.5 inches , so I can not used it . I am seeing many complains regarding the wrong size . The problem is that that Levi does not have Quality Control in the sewing plant or they are not doing thei job . The Amazon Service Department is very good , they solved the problem . I am very happy with them .
 spoiled goods came the jeans torn at the front on both legs and the back left pocket near the fabric was torn as if defeated ... !
 Recibido el producto en perfectas condiciones , son r&aacute;pidos y seguros.No me gusto mucho el dise & ntilde ; o y la calidad . Gracias desde Vzla

 The belt is attached to the buckle by two tiny screws . One of them fell off a month after the belt was bought , rendering the whole thing almost useless . A little later the paint on the buckle started to chip away , exposing the true color -LRB- brass -RRB- of the buckle , giving an uncomplimentary look . Definitely would not recommend it .
 i bought this pair of jeans . im from malaysia . to my suprise the jeans was made in cambodia with lowest level of quality . i cant return because the cost involved is even more than the cost of the jean . i learned tht i shouldnt be naive and trust big brands for highest level of quality . my honest review . please publish .
 What has happened to Levi 's ? Very thin material , have had several rip on the seam of the back pocket in less than 6 months . Even before they ripped , when I went outside on a cold day , it seemed to offer no warmth in the back end , like it had already ripped , but it had not yet . Not much luck with Wrangler either . I guess if you want good jeans nowadays , you have to pay up bigtime . These are not even close to acceptable . Prepare to be disappointed .
 they are not the same weight or quality I am used to getting at lord and taylor , I also got a pair in black and they are a twill not what I expected . I needed them for trip and took them and wore them , too much of a hassle to return . . thanks for asking
 My old 29x34s are much smaller in both waist and length compared to the new and returned 29x34s . What other brands are there that are really 29x34 ?
 Returned these because my son wanted the Regular fit - these were not it - they are n't the same and did n't fit him high enough in the waist
 The redesign shortens the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband . I compared them to an older pair of Jeans and it looks like they loss an inch . If you like the way Levi 's use to fit , you will now feel like they fall off your rear , and are tight in the crotch . I 've worn these for 20 years , and have now switched brands . Bad move Levi 's !
 I was very dissapointed with my new 505 jeans . These are obviously a different design from previous 505 's and I am wondering if Levi Strauss could just tell that us before we buy -LRB- or give the new design a new number -RRB- . With this purchase , I have lost all confidence in their abilitty to deliver a consistant product .
 I DO N'T CARE WHAT IS POSTED WHAT KIND OF REVIEWS LEVIS GET . THE 505 LEVIS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS . THEY NO LONGER EVEN FEEL LIKE BLUE JEANS ... THEY ARE MORE LIKE DENIM SLACKS . I HAVE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR PAIR LEFT FROM ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO ... EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE HOLES IN THE KNEES AND POCKETS ARE FRAYED , I WILL WEAR THEM INSTEAD OF THE BRAND NEW 505s I HAVE IN THE CLOSET . i HAVE BEEN WEARING 505 LEVIS FOR THE PAST 35 TO 40 YEARS ... AS SOON AS MY OLD FADED AND FRAYED JEANS ARE FINALLY GONE ... I WILL HAVE TO FIND A DIFFERENT BRAND ... WRANGLER , LEE 'S -LRB- god forbid -RRB- OR EVEN RUSTLER BRAND AT WALMART . THE `` NEW '' 505s ARE NOTHING LIKE THE OLD ONES ... THE CUT , THE MATERIAL OR THE QUALITY THEY ONCE WERE ... I DO N'T KNOW IF EGYPT IS SCREWING THEM UP OR IF LEVIS HAS SCREWED UP BUT THEY ARE LOSING A 40 YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH ME . IF THERE WAS A 0 RATING THAT 'S WHAT THEY WOULD GET FOR THE `` NEW '' 505s THE OLD ONES WOULD GET A 5 STAR RATING ... BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS ... THANKS LEVI CORPORATION !!
 Apparently the same jackass who introduced us to `` New Coke '' in the 90 's must have gone to work for Levi Strauss . From the posts I 've read , the replacement of the regular fit 505 jeans with the `` straight cut '' lower waist version seems to have ticked off many customers including myself . I 've been buying Levis since the '70s . Now I am forced to buy another brand . They could have kept the regular fit and introduced the straight fit separately . I guess when the jerk was finished at Levis , he went to work for Apple developing Final Cut Pro X , but that 's another story .
 The jeans above the knee are nice , good quality and fit.The problem is that somewhere `` along the line '' the meaning of `` straight fit '' has changed . It used to mean that you bought a pair of normal jeans . What `` straight fit '' seems to mean now is that if you order this style you 'll end up with what closely resembles the ridiculous bell-bottom pant legs from the '70s . So anyone out there looking to order just a `` normal '' pair of jeans go for the slim or regular fit . Btw , the pictures DO NOT show just how '70s the Straight Fit pant legs are .
 I will not buy Levi 's on line again . The cuts are never the same fit for the same size . But I do like Levi 's
 I 've owned Levis my whole life which spans five decades . But the last four pairs I bought barely lasted a year before they wore out or started falling apart . These are jeans right ? Could fool me.I had not given this much thought but saw a friend of mine who is in the construction trade and he was wearing what looked like really well constructed jeans and I mentioned my Levis problem and he said in a matter of fact way that few people in the trades buy Levis anymore as they cost more but do n't last anywhere near as long as some other brands.So from my point of view , Levis is another example of the current management charging too much and cutting too many corners to make a buck . I will not buy Levis again and am sad to see this brand go down the toilet .
 I have worn 505 jeans for many years and I purchased the same size -LRB- waist and length -RRB- this new pair is about an inch too big around the waist and the cut is different to previous 505 's . It is an uncomfortable fit .
 My husband has worn 505 's since he was a young man - so that is many years ! He always wore the Straight Fit , in Rigid . We had read the reviews about how bad the `` new & improved '' Levi 's are but had to see for ourselves . I thought a company only did changes that made their product better ... . wrong ! Well , not the Levi company.The material felt horrible - different from the Rigid he wore in the past . We ordered 2 different sizes since there were people talking about the new lower cut and that their original size not fitting . Neither size fit . My husband said they would rub all the hair off your legs if he tried to wear them . Of course , we are returning them.Luckily we read the reviews on Carhartt jeans - ordered them - and they are wonderful jeans . He wore a `` tight '' 34 waist in the old Levis . The 35 waist in the Carhartts was too tight but the 36 was a perfect fit . The length in the Carhartt is the same he used to wear in Levi . We ordered the Straight-Leg Traditional fit in the Carhartt . Also the fit of the Carhartts in the seat is very good . Not baggy at all . The legs may be a tiny bit wider than the Levi 's he used to wear but not much .
 The color and texture is fine but the size is totally different from the original 30x30 . I use to wear 505 's in size 30x30 and they fit and feel different . I 'm very dissapointed with Amazon and especially with Levis quality control , the sizes are different depending on the country the pants were manufactured . They do n't have quality standards as other jeans brands .
 I have n't seen this problem with any of the other reviews so I suspect it may be related to the color/fabric `` Tumbled Stretch . '' When washed they shrank down a good two sizes , at least two inches smaller in the waist and the length . Hoping amazon will let me return them because my boyfriend ca n't wear them and they 're even too small for me . Shrinking two whole sizes is just a bit too much to be normal.I would give the pants another shot in another color/fabric because before washing they fit perfectly . A little stiff like too much starch but perfectly . Then again , we picked out the straight fit because the pants he 's worn through were the same brand and style which is the only reason we ordered them online .
 In the last year or so these jeans were changed from regular fit to straight fit . This new fit appears to be intended for someone with no butt . The rise in back is lower as well . I 've been wearing 505 's for decades , but when I tried these new jeans on they were instantly uncomfortable . I have returned them for a refund .
 Levi 's has replaced their 505 regular fit jeans with this abomination , which is a completely different product . The straight fit jeans are not cut the same as the old regular fit jeans and you can not trust the size . Worse , they only have five belt loops instead of seven , so they do not stay up . The fabric used is also inferior to the original 505 regular fit jeans . Before ordering , be sure to have a look at these things in a store to see if this is really what you want to purchase . Levi 's had better figure out a way to sell these to the teeny boppers because their customer base sure is n't going to buy them .
 Levi changed their size specs on the traditional 505 . The `` straight '' 505s have a shortener rise , and are smaller in the hip and leg . The old style fit my husband perfectly - a no brainer when it came to shopping . The new `` straight '' cut is awful . If Levi wanted to introduce another fit , then why not give it a different number and keep the sizing the same on the tried and true 505 . You 've lost a customer with this change .
 After many years of buying the same Levi 's - 505 regular , 38 X 30 , these new jeans are a different cut and the leg size was at least 3 inches too long . I had to return the jeans and will have to move to another brand . Great pity as I really liked my old Levi 's .
 For the past few months since I bought my new jeans I just thought I was in between sizes . Turns out they changed them . No longer do they work , they just go around your waist like some sort of low cut girl pants . Tightening your belt does n't really help either . I thought to myself , `` I do n't want my pants to change every month on some whim of some designer who thinks they know what 's comfortable and what makes me feel like me ... I 'm going to go with a classic ... Levi ... If I find the pair that works for me they wo n't change , they will be here later . '' Wrong . Comfort and pants fitting are apparently unimportant . What is important is pandering to a perceived money base who use their jeans for standing around and looking in a way , not for people who have to bend over and lift anything because the new versions fall down .
 I read the bad reviews but stubbornly decided to order these jeans anyway -LRB- 505 tumble rigid 31x32 -RRB- . And , just as others had warned , the size did not match other levi 's I own . My simple advice
 What is wrong with you people ? I have bought and worn 505 regular fit jeans all my life . Now for some unknown reason you have decided to discontinue this very cut . The closest I can get is the straight cut and they suck . They are crotch bound and uncomfortable . They are designed for the people who wear them around their ass . No thank you , you have lost a good costumer .
 I have been wearing the newer Levi 's `` Straight Fit '' tag for 6 months now , and i am ready to give it up for good!I just pulled out my older worn out `` regular fit '' pre `` straight-fit , '' patched up the hole and i 'm wearing them again until i can find a new jeans brand . The waist is too low on the new `` straight fit . '' If you hold them up next to each other , the straight fit has a shorter fly . My ass is hanging out . . and i 'm a tall fairly skinny guy . There 's no snug support anymore . What happened to my 505 's ??? Levi 's has spread themselves too thin . They seem to have gone quantity over quality . At first i thought , `` they can screw around with all of those foolish looking jeans as much as they want , as long as they 're consistent with the good old 501 , 505 , 517 . . , '' but the foolish experimentation has gotten out of hand , and now the 505 's have been tainted . IMO Levi 's needs to cut the fat . Go back to the durable , traditional , simple line-up , and then only add a handful of other options for the made to last a month spandex type . Levi 's has screwed around too long , and now it 's just screwed up . I 'm sad to not be able to wear them anymore . But I want quality , long lasting products , that 's what brought me to Levi 's two decades ago , and now , that 's what 's going to make me leave .
 Levi 's are taking the micky , they have completely changed the 505 jeans and now they are something else ... I have more than 2 % body fat so I would look like a fool in these low cut genital revealing jeans.Well I guess Levis feel the need to change the demographic of their customers , and as such I should just get my butt over to the stores and try some new brands ...
 These Levi 's 505 jeans that I bought for my husband fit nothing like his old 505 's do . He has always loved this style , but the styling has been changed so that the same size that once fit him like a glove is now at least 1 '' and probably 2 '' too big in the waist , and the rise is shorter by the same amount . If they wanted to make a new style , then , OK , but do n't call 'em 505 's !!
 These pants are unacceptable . lightweight denim will not stand up . crotch is cut all wrong . I had been been wearing this type of jeans for over 40 years , and they have gotten progressively shoddier . Made in china junk . levis is clearly more interested in the ` high end ' androgenous customer . Can ' even find the standard jean jacket anymore . I 'll be looking for a quality jean elsewhere . Sadly , it probably wo n't ne made in the USA . .
 I have been buying exclusively levi jeans for over 45 years . I have been buying size 32x30 for as long as I can remember . Today I bought 3 pair of 505 regular fit straight leg jeans and the waist was not even close . Must be at least 34 . They fall down . I put them up against my old jeans and there is a huge difference . Almost 50 years of product loyalty and they have let me down . I have bought my last pair .
 I bought several pairs of these jeans for my husband last year in 2009 and I can say that I am very disappointed with the quality . The material is very thin and I have had to put patches on the pockets and fix all of the belt loops because the material is thin and they have pulled away . The hem in the bottom of the pant legs have all started to fray as well . We have always purchased Levi jeans for him to work in and they have always held up well -LRB- years -RRB- not months . But I have never had to fix so many problems before . Do not buy these if you intend to work in them every day , they will not last . Very POOR quaility . Shame on Levi . I will be looking for Jeans made here in America from now on .
 Absolute junk ! I 've noticed a decline in the quality over the last decade , i.e. the pocket stitching actually pulling away from the pant and making holes within months . But the new denim fabric is probably half the weight / thickness as it was for last year 's 505s . I 've been wearing 505s for construction since the early 80s . The new `` denim '' feels less substantial than their Dockers line . Levi , you 've lost a 30 + year -LRB- once dedicated -RRB- customer .
 I bought these thinking ` What a nice color ' . Little did I realise that the dye used for this color has a really unpleasant smell . I washed them repeatedly in my very efficient and eco-friendly Asko washer , but the smell remained . If the jeans were mixed with other laundry , the odor would contaminate the other clothes . So , they were returned to Amazon . Thankfully , they accepted them . -LRB- This , in many years of online purchase , has been my only return -RRB- . I wish I could say something better , but the truth must be told .
 The pants seem to be acceptably made -LRB- the label indicates it was made in Cambodia -RRB- - although slightly thinner material than I expected . The color that I ordered -LRB- Blue Collar -RRB- is fine and is what I expected . However , these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down , and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it . I though about keeping them , but I can not put up with the tightness at the thighs . Also , the pockets seem to `` bunch up '' too much and you must often put your hands in your pockets to keep them down ... a major fail , so I 'm returning them and will try out the Levi 's Men 's 560 Comfort Fit Jean instead .
 My 17-year-old son has worn Levi 's 505s , in the same size -LRB- 32x34 -RRB- , for several years . He hates these new jeans . They 're too tight/narrowly cut . Yes , we 'd read the other negative reviews , which is why we ordered only one pair , but it seemed to be mostly older guys complaining about the fit . Trust me , tall , slender young men have now also found these jeans to be uncomfortable . Levi 's should bring back the old 505 jeans and give this new product , if they choose to continue it , a different number because they 're not the same thing at all . We will need to find a new jean .
 In my opinion the name Levi 's is being harvested . It is a common practice for companies to raise money quickly by doing what is referred to as `` harvest the company '' . In industry to harvest the company you stop doing maintenance on equipment , stop hiring young employees , stop all training programs , stop quality controls , and make your product as cheap as you can . It makes your company look very good on the bottom line for a short time . If I owned a lot of stock in a company and was ready to sell it I would do the same thing . I have no problem with companies going off sure to make there product as long as the quality remains the same . But this is not the case with Levi 's they are cutting corners however they can even to the point of eliminating two belt loops . How cheap can they be ? I very seldom return items , but I am returning the 505 jeans and I will find another brand after wearing Levi 's for over 40 years .
 I have a pair of Levi 's 505 regular fit that are great . I could n't find ` regular fit ' option anymore and thought I would give this a try . No luck , they do n't fit well , and are made of considerably thinner material than my old ones .
 What about this product?I bought the May 12th and I have not received , and I have not received the 6th of June.Also I have not received any message from the cause of the delay
 good nightI want to express my deepest dissatisfaction with a product that acquired levis -LRB- levis 505 rinse model -RRB- last November , because it came with a defect in the right pocket red label -LRB- the label does not say anything is just a red cloth -RRB- supposedly legendary symbol and prestigious brand , I 'm really angry because I 've always used its mark since I was a kid , I live in a country where exchange controls and no one can buy dollars and it is very difficult to buy products online in united states both the final effort to send me a defective product , I demand you compensate me in some ways this uncomfortable situation.Thanks in advance I hope will be addressed my claim
 This review concerns two pairs of straight legs which were in the `` Black Amped '' color . I am writing to warn of some problems : -LRB- A -RRB- Color is a deep indigo blue , not black at all . -LRB- B -RRB- The jeans come with a big white tag warning the buyer that the jeans will bleed and continue to do so through their life . First time I 've seen this . -LRB- C -RRB- For denim , this is ridiculously thin fabric . The only upside to this is that I could shrink the jeans just enough to save me the usual tailor 's bill for altering Levis 32 '' inseam to the 31 '' they stopped selling years ago.They 're nice pants but the wrong color and wo n't last long .
 Para ser justo debo corregir , que este producto es un buen producto , de buena calidad y precio ; pero yo cometi un error pues ya habia comprado el producto , ahora tengo dos y sigo estando satisfecho !!!
 The style is inconsistent in some sizes . When I bought the pants , the picture associated with the style , was misplaced . It is now corrected . The pants are bulky ... with no style . The color is a mixture of generic blue and some white-ish threads like something you would find in old outlet stores . I am a fan of Levi 's but this particular one , is not my cup of tea .
 I have been trying to find a pair of Levi 's for my husband which are neither blue nor black . The photo of these jeans makes them appear to be brown so I made the mistake of ignoring the color name and assuming they were as pictured . Now he is going to have to wear the `` girlie '' dark blue because it is too much hassle to return .
 I recently bought a pair of 505 's for my tall son . The size I ordered was 34 x 36 . When they came in the mail the outside of the jeans was labeled correctly , but the inside tag read 34 x 29 . I did not notice this until I unfolded the jeans , a day or two after they arrived and unfortunately I have already thrown away the receipt . Good money lost !! How do I get a refund ? A quality control person really ought to check sizes before packaging . There is a BIG and obvious difference between a 29 '' length and a 36 '' . Help
 Dear Levi 's , You used to have the best product on the market . As one other person said , `` you can walk in , know your size , pick up 3 pairs , and walk out '' and know that each pair was perfect . Now it 's like wearing a sheet from your bed , they are so thin and cheap . They suck ! They might as well put a strectch band around the top!There is hope . You can gain back millions of customers if you go back to the original syle of the 80 's and people WILL pay more , if they are good quality again . Then , you market the crap out of them saying how you chose to back to quality and watch the money roll in . Until then , I will go somewhere else . To cap it off , what do you say you manufacture it in the US !! GOOD LUCK , I 'LL BE WAITING !!
 The jeans appear to be real levis , but they are so thin it is like I 'm wearing nothing at all . You can see the color of my boxer underneath . It is true it has been a few years since I bought myself a pair of jeans , but holy cow are these thin .
 I 've been wearing Levis for 50 years and I 've never seen anything this bad . The fabric is paper thin , the number of belt loops went from seven to five and , as others have said , the rise has been reduced . This pair was made in Bangladesh - perhaps the ones made in Mexico are better . Do n't buy these things unseen on-line . I 'll keep away from Levis altogether unless I see a pair in a store with decent quality .
 Dear Amazon.com , My last order was about two -LRB- 2 -RRB- black levis jeans 505/33 * 30/straight fit . I was surprised that the size did not fit while I am used to wear it in that particular model.Where did that problem come from ? I came to the truth that the country where the jeans is made can make a huge difference . The 505/straight fit/33 * 30 made in Egypt -LRB- as those I bought recently -RRB- are smaller than Lessotho 's which are themselves smaller than Columbia 's . I have , you can realize , the same size and model from those countries!That is a very important issue on which Amazon.com should focus . May be you will need in the clothes identification to precise the manufacturer 's country.Regards .
 these jeans are made very small , i wear 33-32 and they are not even close , i ` ll be sending them back ... they do n`t make them as good anymore ...
 Use it about one mounth . Always uzipping fly , need to check it . Sometimes it causes severe discomfort , becouse I do not notice it and walk with open `` shop door '' !!! So good jeans , but not good fly . Hope it ` s happend only with me .
 After one washing two of the belt loops have detached . Really poorly made jeans . Very disappointed . Will never order jeans again on line . After this experience will have to see the jeans before purchasing .
 I purchased 2 pairs of different colour this very same size from this same company1 year ago . This year I ordered the very same colours and size and niether of them fitThey are both too tight . . What is up with that ?!!!
 I ordered a size 35x32 . And that is what the tag said it was when it arrived . But , they were not a 32 length . They were about 2 to 3 inches longer ! I was surprised by this , because Levi has always been good with sizing . I would normally be able to order my size and have no problems .
 I thought the material was cheap and nothing like any Levi jeans I have ever owned . I made a big mistake . I do not like them
 The last time I bought a pair of 505 Levi 's was in 2000 in Orem in Utah . I have always been pleased with Levi 's products and was very saddened and disappointed when I tried on the pair I bought through Amazon.com.Everything about them appears to have deteriorated in 12 years . I can only attribute the cause of it to the fact that Levi 's have to cut costs everywhere in order to satisfy the demands of their Shareholders for more and more dividends in the face of ever increasing competition.Levi 's have lost my custom as far as ordering over the Internet is concerned . At least in a Shop I can see when they are not what I am looking for and leave them . That is my experience with them , so I think I will go back to the other brands I have been buying in the intervening 12 years .
 I would really like to know what the thought process was in redesigning a classic piece of American apparel so that it fits like junk . Or , rather , does n't fit your junk . I echo all the other writers here who note that the new `` fit '' does n't fit . Not just slightly off -- terribly made for anyone who has anything resembling a reasonably fit body . If you have any gluteal muscles at all , the jeans wo n't reach your waist . So it constantly feels like the jeans are falling down . It looks moronic , feels truly uncomfortable , and is dysfunctional.The whole idea that made jeans popular in the first place was that they were sturdy , work-oriented pants that broke in to look and feel comfortable . You ca n't work in the new 505s at all unless the point of your labor is not to complete a job but show off `` plumber 's crack . `` Have been wearing Levi 's all my life , have also tried Wrangler 's Lees etc etc. . The new 505 is truly the worst pair of jeans I 've ever owned . Because they use a tag with a lot of brand strength but substitute an inferior product in its place , it 's also deceptive to consumers . They should remove the `` 505 '' brand '' and in the interest of truth-in-packaging rename this style `` dumba ** '' in honor of whatever overpaid executive thought this up and anyone suckered into wearing a pair .
 I 've purchase Levi 's 505 jeans my entire life , but recently purchased a couple of pair and found that the cut has been changed to a low-ride jean . Found similar experiences posted by other folks . Very disappointed . Seems that Levi Strauss is trying to lure in a new demographic -LRB- that like to have that modern everything exposed cut -RRB- at the expense of long term customers . Bad corporate decision making . Recommend that folks looking for the old 505 cut try the Austin jean if they can get them . Probably not as high quality , but about half the price and similar in fit to old 505 's .
 Some genius MBA at Levis decided to change the design of the classic 505 jeans without telling anybody . I bought several pairs before realizing they were n't seconds , Levis had actually made the waist wider and the rise lower so the pants will no longer fit no matter how tight you cinch your belt . Do not buy these without trying them on ! Levis has taken a style you could buy without worry and made it unwearable -- without warning any of its customers.Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight Fit Jean
 For as long as I can remember I wore Levi 505 Regular Fit 36x30 . Obviously a popular size cause they were always difficult to find in the pile of various sizes . Recently my wife came home with 3 new pairs . When I tryed them on they felt as if they were a defective cut . The waist line dipped deep into my crouch the legs were baggy and the felt like they were always falling off my ass . My wife had to return cause I realy did think they were defective . Since , I havent bought a new pair of Jeans . Looking on line today came upon these other common complaints and cant believe the corporate mentality of Levi . Obviously they will be on the road to destruction , if they dont come foward and meet the long time customers needs with the same old jeans . What a Bad Idea you had Mr Levi ! We are deeply disappointed in your products as of today !
 I 've found that the finishing/hemming of the jean 's length is consistently off . No matter what measurement you choose , the pants are either just right or two long . I have n't found any to be too short ... yet . Also , Levi 's is always changing the rise of the jeans . The new ones I just purchased are lower than my older ones . I do like Levi 's quality though . They really hold up .
 I have been wearing these , the Levi 505 , for quite sometime now and I love them . I ordered some on Amazon because they were in a wash that I could n't find in the store . When I got them , I put them on and they were literally HUGE ! I compared them to some other new 505 's and the sizing was awful . They were literally 2 inches too long , and at least 2 sizes too big in the waist . I felt like I put on my dad 's jeans!In addition , one of the seams was coming undone already . Very poor finish .
 jeans are of lighter weight material . Not as durable and one of the five belt loops has already torn off because of the poor quality . I will not be buying Levi 's again . Very disappointing . If I had wanted these cheap knock offs I would have went to Wally World .
 I love 505s but I 've found that if I order 3 pairs , all three will fit completely differently . The faded jeans tend to be really tight and low cut so that they barely cover your backside , the traditional stonewash seem to have the truest fit to the original 505s and the `` trendy '' washes I 've bought are all over the map . I 've stopped buying them online because I have to keep sending them back . It 's a lot easier to wait for a sale locally and go try them on .
 The 505 straight fit is horrible . The 505 `` regular '' fit was much better , but has been discontinued.Levis , please bring back the 505 regular fit .
 I wasted my money . I will buy Carhartt from now on.Problem with Levis
 I 've hardly ever been as annoyed with a product as I am with these jeans . I 've worn the same size 505 Levi 's for probably 25 years . So I had no qualms about ordering these online . But they are cut completely differently than any other pair of 505 's I 've ever owned . Low at the hip and skinnier in the thighs.If Levi Strauss is trying to tell me I 'm not hip , I get the message . But if you 're going to label something 505 , it should be the same jean I 've always worn and loved.Change the flipping name if you change the product . It 's not like you only have one jean ...
 On the red Leib on the pocket is not a word Levi 's , but only mark R. On the inside of the pockets are no inscriptions . This is the second pair 505 , the first one was perfect , but it does not sit well and too small . I am very disappointed .
 Pants looked pretty good and sized well . Then I put my belt on and noticed the front left belt loop was entirely missing . No signs of sewing , no hanging chad , nothing . Shocking quality miss for $ 42 pair of jeans ! Got ta return these and hope seller gets it right and makes good on these name brand jeans . More later after seeing response from Amazon ! Where is inspector 009 when you need him?UPDATE *** One star has become two stars thanks to Amazon.Amazon sent out the replacement pair of jeans and they arrived literally overnight . The pants appear to be fine . Although I am shocked by initial Levi pants quality misstep , Amazon stepped up and fixed the issue . 2 Stars for Levis , 4 stars for Amazon.The pants themselves seem durable . I went back to Levis after my Lees fell apart just after a couple of months and a few washes . Levis material seem more durable . Better be for the $ 12 premium to get Levis over Lees . I 'll update this again after a few months.I still have a pair of Levis from 1980 something with no apparent holes except they are almost white now from all the washes . I am expecting these to hold up a lot better than the designer soft fabric jeans other companies sell .
 I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon . The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer . They were durable and fit well . They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing -LRB- I estimate around 40-50 washes -RRB- . So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work . I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi 's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own . But I wanted the less ` slim ' fit of the 505s for work , also wanted the regular and not low rise waist . So I ordered the same exact size and style : Bad idea!The 505s I got came with a tag saying ` sits below waist ' , which is NOT what they used to say . Before , the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s . Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon , I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair . Trying the new pair on , I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my ` man parts ' being crushed in agonizing ways . No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans , and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area . The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s , but the seat was the main difference . No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505 . And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s -LRB- in the same color as the new 505s I purchased -RRB- I noticed something interesting . The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s . It was n't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing . The 515s never felt that tough , and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description -LRB- no mention of low rise waist -RRB- and inferior quality . I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store . The previous 505s were also great -LRB- Fred Meyer of all places - though they do n't have the 505s anymore ... booo -RRB- . So I 'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them . I 'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood . And the better quality denim means they 'll last longer anyway . So here are my comparisons : Levi 's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi 's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi 's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described , and that the quality appears to vary from order to order . I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews . I love Levi 's jeans , and I will continue to buy them , but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing . And remember , if you buy from Amazon , they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items .
 I have been a loyal Levi 's customer since the sixties and have worn the 505 regular fit because they felt comfortable , were durable , and were consistently sized . I bought Levi 's because I like they they looked and liked the way they felt while working in them . That 's doing real work , not just walking down a street or into a bar . In the fall of 2011 I purchased 4 pair of the regular labeled 505 's but noticed they did n't fit right . Came to discover the fit had been changed by Levi 's , I assume to attract a new urban demographic . Levi 's used to be proud of their heritage as a working man 's jean . I suggest someone at Levi 's try doing some farm work , specifically try and split a load of wood with a maul while wearing a pair of the newly designed 505 's . Swing the maul , bend over and pick up the split wood , then stack it . See how many times you have to pull up the new jeans for each block of wood split and stacked . You will find it 's obvious the new 505 's are not designed by or for a real working man . I suggest you add a new cut to the Levi 's menu to address the needs of the urban population but please go back to your old cut for the 505 's before I have to change brands . Real men everywhere will thank you .
 I purchased these because my old 505 's finally needed replacing . When I took them out of the box , I was shocked to feel such thin material . Levis may charge the same high prices , but they 've cheapened the quality of their 505 's regardless of the fact they 're made in China . You can buy much better jeans with recognized names for less than half the price on Amazon or your local discount store . So be it for the name Levis in my book . A cheaply made product at a high price based on their ` Old ' reputation.I would have returned them immediately but I was leaving on a trip in a few days and needed them . I said I 'll keep them but never order Levis again . I wore them only once and noticed a flaw on the top of the thigh . This was a frayed circular flaw about 1/4 inch in diameter ... The kind of flaw that results in a hole after the first or second washing . They never should have passed their quality control.I 'm returning them to Amazon for a full refund . I do not recommend Levis . What a shame for a once great brand .
 I ordered two of these about a year ago . The reduction of seven belt loops to five was very inconvenient , with my belt constantly riding above my trousers at the left and rght rear . But what was really irritating was that I was constantly pulling up my pants . I thought it was just me , or that my shape had changed . Then I learned that the `` rise '' was now shorter than it used to be and that they ride lower , which does n't feel right and I do n't like . Maybe the young crowd likes this . I 've worn levis ' jeans for forty years , but I do n't like the new cut . Someone in their review mentioned Carhartt 's jeans , which I tried and they feel like the old levis . I just ordered another pair of them .
 I bought another pair of 505 this year . I have been using 505s 34x30 for 30 years or more . Unfortunately this time the fit was different . The waist was very loose . So I went to exchange them . I found out that the 505s are not REGULAR FIT anymore , but instead STRAIGHT LEG or REGULAR STRAIGHT LEG . At the store , they convinced me to get one size down -LRB- 33X30 -RRB- . They fit well at the waist , however when I tried to sit , they felt really tight in the crotch . I had to return them . I do not understand why Levi 's has changed the style on an icon jean . I believe they are going to loose a lot of the loyal customers that have been buying the same 505 REGULAR FIT for years !!!!!!!
 So annoying . I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 as long as I can recall . The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans , though . And they are terribly , terribly inconsistent . In the most recent instance , I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon , in different colors . What I 've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico , some in China , some in Bangladesh , etc. . And depending on where they are made , the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent . When I order these things , I want/expect them to fit the same way , every color , every time . Not an unreasonable expectation , I think . Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years . Evidently , though , like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip , opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality . Makes me frickin ' sad .
 I just bought a pair of `` 505 Straight Fit '' jeans and will have to return them . -LRB- They used to be called `` 505 Regular Fit '' but Levi 's no longer offers jeans so marked . -RRB- Levi 's has changed the cut of these jeans since I last bought them . They 're now cut to ride an inch lower than they used to , and have less waist definition -- OK if you 're fat , or if you like to wear your jeans six inches below your natural waist . Ghetto jeans , anyone ?
 My husband has worn these for as long as he can remember . Always a classic perfect fit . Now they changed the `` classic fit '' to `` straight fit '' & they are horrible ! They changed the waist to a low rise waist ... the waist was also ridiculously too wide ... The whole hip area looked baggy & unattractive ... . The waist rise is so low that it would be impossible to bend over without exposing your rear -LRB- plumbers crack -RRB- What a shame ... Bought 4 pair ... returned 4 pair . -LRB- fyi . . tags all showed Made in Mexico -RRB-
 If you like to show plumber 's butt and sing soprano , the new `` Straight Fit '' Levis 505 are for you.Some genius at Levis replaced the classic `` Regular Fit '' 505 's with the terrible 505 `` Straight Fit . '' I assure you , there 's nothing straight about them . Bad fit . Bad jeans . ... and do n't expect any sympathy from Levis inept customer service . They 're too busy counting your money .
 Like many others have said , the 505 is now called the `` straight '' fit from the `` regular '' fit with no information provided on why or what changes were made . Therefore you buy the jeans thinking it is the old style but it is not , this one is supposed to be a hip hugger jean I guess . Why Levis did not just come up with another number for these lowriders I do not know , but what you get with the new 505 is not what you are going to like wearing.I finally went with the Premium Performance Wrangler regular fit and it is fine . Too bad since I have worn Levis for many years , but no more . Plus the lack of rivets in the back , lack of belt loops . Just not a good product anymore.They say other Levi jeans will work , they do not work so I can only recommend to the buyers here to try them on at a local store before you buy a Levis product and be sure it is really what you want.LDW120
 This is the last pair of jeans I buy from this brand . I bought this online because I felt pretty safe that the fit would be good , since these are n't my first pair of jeans from the brand . Still the case , and jeans fit well -LRB- and look nice -RRB- However , the low rating goes to the quality of the material . While I appreciate nice , medium thickness jeans that I 'll break into after awhile and will last many years -LRB- still have a pair of Diesel jeans that I wear after 10 years -RRB- , this is a tissue thickness pair of pants . I doubt that these will last more than a year , even with normal daily use.Levi 's is not the same brand that have have earned my admiration and loyalty over the years . They cheaped out on the material , and therefore sent the quality into the crapper . Please be aware of this when buying their jeans . Shame on you levi 's , for selling out and losing your integrity.And why the hell only 5 belt rings ???? Are they really that expensive ??? Is it worth the economy knowing fans like me will be really dissapointed ?
 I purchased these jeans for my husband , who is not usually very fussy . However , these jeans are made from extremely poor denim which was noticeable immediately . After wearing them once , they all went a bit fuzzy and seems to be pilling already . Very poor quality . I would have returned them immediately other than not worth the postage . They are now used for camping purposes only !!
 I have been buying Levis for 40 years and ca n't believe the jeans I just purchased.They have gone down in quality and up in price . They feel like a cheap pair of designerjeans . The weight of the material is lighter and they have reduced the number of belt loops.I hate them . I will buy Carhartt from now on . Much better quality .
 They do n't fit like the previous 501s I 've purchased . Probably safer to purchase at a local store after trying on .
 These pants are obviously seconds . They do not fold correctly and the color is faded on where the cloth does not lay down . Not made in the USA either . These are the worst pair of Levi 's I have ever bought brand new .
 The following is an exchange I had with Levi Strauss recently ... You removed about 3/4 '' of material frombetween the top of the waist and the crouch on the men 's 505 `` Regular Fit `` jeans and you double labeled and re-labeled them `` straight fit '' . . -LRB- you haveboth labels on them !!! - very misleading !!! -RRB- ... and now they ride much loweron my waist and I ca n't keep them up ... or when I pull them up they choke mycrouch !!! I 've purchased Levi Brand for over 50 years and I never try them onand due to past consistancy , I have them hemmed 1 '' because I 'm an in-betweensize -LRB- I buy 38-32 -RRB- ... so now I 'm stuck with two-pair of Jeans I ca n't return -LRB- To Sears -RRB- and wo n't be able to wear ! Also , I 've looked for some of the `` oldregular 's '' but ca n't find them on the shelf any more . I also checked on theInternet and a lot of people are complaining about this same problem . Thedifference in the height of the waistband is clearly visable when you lay anold pair beside a new pair ; in the amount of material under the belt loops ... and is obvious where the bottom of the belt loops are now attached . And whileI 'm at it , the bottom of two belt loops -LRB- the ones on either side of the rearmiddle loop -RRB- pulled loose on the last four pair that I purchased -LRB- I now havethem pinned -RRB- . Would you like photos ? Folks , your quality and design is inreal trouble ! What are you going to do for me ??? Or should I just starttrying on other brands?Hi Richard , Barbara here from Levi 's . Thanks for checking in with us.The 505 style has been updated recently so that the waist and hips are straighter and the rise is slightly shorter . Now the fit is designed to sit lower on the hip . This means you will probably need to order a smaller waist size to get the same fit you have had in the past . If you choose to return your 505 jeans to our Consumer Returns Department , the inspector will exchange your jeans for the next waist size smaller . Levi Strauss & Co. updates many of our products from time to time to keep the line fresh and fashionable , based on demand from consumers and our retail partners.If there 's anything else we can help you with , be sure to email us back or give us a call at 1-800-USA-LEVI Monday - Friday from 6:00 am - 4:30 pm Pacific Time.Thanks again , Barbara , Levi Strauss & Co. , Consumer Relations , Case ID
 I purchased 4 pair of Levi jeans regular and 2 pair stone washed . None fit like the old 505 's I have . They were all about 2 inches larger in the waist and about 2 inches too long in the legs , and the bottom of the zipper is too low in the crotch causing the jeans to poke out like you have two or three pairs f socks in your underware . What a shame for a company that used to be known for providing great fitting jeans . I purchased a new pair of Wranglers and they fit the old 505 's . It is a sad day when someone who has been wearing Levi jeans since the early 60 's has to start buying Wranglers .
 I have purchased Levi 's 505 Regular Fit for 35 years . Much to my dismay , the most recent purchase I made turned out to be the newly improved Straight Fit . I could n't figure out why they kept falling down . When I called Levi 's said they would replace the pair I bought with a pair a waist size smaller . They seem to think if my pants are tighter it will keep them from falling off . Since I work in these jeans , moving around constantly , I like some ease of movement within the garment.The redesign from Regular Fit to Straight Fit consists of shortening the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband . I think it might be shortened as much as 2 or 2.5 inches . This makes it so the pants no longer sit at the waist , slightly above the hip bone which used to keep them from falling off.I am very disappointed in the new pants.My rating is really 0 stars .
 I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 jeans for more years than I care to admit . About a year ago I needed more new jeans so I ordered a couple pairs . They did n't fit quite exactly the way I expected them to , but they were okay . Last month there was this great sale on Levi 's jeans -LRB- on levis.com -RRB- , so I bought a couple more pairs . These new pairs really did n't fit - they were the correct length and waist size , but they were too long and didnt feel right . I wear 36/30 . I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 's in size 36/30 for years and years . So when I ordered a couple 36/30 , and they did n't fit , I was pretty surprised.I called Levi 's and asked about it . They said that they might shrink in the wash and that they would take them back for a full refund even if they had been washed . So I washed them . Several times . Though they did get shorter , they were still not short enough . And they did n't quite fit right in the crotch . So I held them up to my old jeans - they matched perfectly . I could n't find any difference at all , and yet they did n't fit . Well , I ca n't leave a mystery like that alone . So I laid them down on the bed , got out a tape measure , and I measured . I measured everything I could find , but nothing was significantly different from new to old . Then I flipped them over . Ah Ha ! I found that the new jeans were a full inch shorter in what is called the `` back center seam '' than the jeans I had bought just a year ago . This was the case on both pairs I had just purchased , even though the two new pairs were different colors and cloth weights . I then dug out a pair of 505 's from several years ago and found that the `` back center seam '' on that pair was 2 inches longer than the new pairs and 1 inch longer than the pairs I 'd gotten a year ago . That explains why the ones I had bought a year ago were n't quite right , but were okay , while the newest pairs , being of full 2 inches shorter in the back crotch really did n't fit right at all . As for leg lenth , since the inseam is supposed to be the length from the floor to the crotch , a shorter back center seam shouldnt have any effect , however , I can only guess that the short crotch was causing me to wear the jeans lower than I prefer , which somehow changed the effective the leg length . Because I wanted the legs shorter , I had to pull the pants up until they were binding in the crotch -LRB- does this make sense - not sure ? -RRB- In any case , they didnt feel right in the crotch and they were too long.This is disappointing for a number of reasons . First of all having jeans that I could simply purchase sight unseen , pair after pair after pair , is incredibly convenient . But it 's also disappointing because psychologically I think of Levi 's is something unchanging . Levi 's are Levi 's . Coca-Cola , aside from their momentary lapse of reason with new Coke , is Coca-Cola . Etc. . I dont want Levi 's 505 's to change . But strangely , the biggest problem for me with this change is related to the fact that Levi 's numbers their jeans styles . If they are going to change the measurements and design of the 505 , they should call it the 506 . Or the 505b . Or the 505 v2 . Or something . If they were always called simply the `` regular straight fit jean , '' it would n't be as big a deal to change it as it is when the product is called `` 505 . '' To me , psychologically , 505 's are 505 's are 505 's - if they 're going to change them , they need to start calling them 506 's . So I 'm sending my Levi 's 505 's back . I have no idea what I will buy in their place .
 I 'm completely exasperated , disgusted and hopeless . These are entirely unacceptable . There 's nothing `` good old blue '' about them . They 're made of poor quality `` denim '' that bears no resemblance to Levi 's good old denim . They look cheap and greasy , like some off-brand discount junk . In addition , they do n't fit . They 're almost 2 inches smaller than the stated waist size , as compared with the Levi 's 505 's of a couple of years ago . They 're essentially hip-huggers -- no room in the crotch . Worst , they 're made in China . I 'll spare the essay on Chinese trade and labor practices and simply remind readers of the frequent , nay , routine problems with the quality of Chinese-made goods , of which these are a prime example . I 've trusted Levi 's for over 40 years and have worn 505 's since the 70 's . No more . These represent the death of yet another great American brand . Without Levi 's in the market , whither blue jeans ?
 I 've been buying 505 's for many years ; I could hardly believe my recent order was supposedly the same product . The material is * much * thinner than it was even a couple years ago , and overall they look like flimsy knockoff copies of the genuine article . If you are considering buying these , do n't just take my word for it , look at the other reviews that discuss the dramatic recent drop in quality ; ignore these only at your own peril , like I foolishly did . The only consolation is that for $ 22 a piece , they are not such a bad deal for generic casual pants and as such I will probably not endure the hassle of returning them , but had I paid anything close to list price I would have felt royally ripped-off . They will certianly be the last Levi 's I ever buy , however . Too bad , it feels kind of like losing an old friend .
 Warning ! Levi 's changed the cut on it 's 505 jeans . Now they are more like hip-huggers . This happened about a year ago .
 I have bought many 505s over the years . In the last 2 months , Levis changed the name of the straight leg 505s to `` straight fit '' AND shorted the distance between the crotch and waistline by 2 inches . They are now low-riders . This was verified by a Levis rep I met at Macys . Guess they figure to save money by using less material . This is not just from Amazon but all original 505s are pretty much gone . If you want real dungarees to work in look elsewhere . Oh ... and try before you buy . This is my first and last online purchases of clothes .
 These are not the same jeans . Clearly Levis redesigned them . They are wider at the waist and are made to be worn lower . Beware , if you do buy them , try them on before you purchase and walk around in them -LRB- because they will fall down a lot -RRB- . If that 's what you 're looking for enjoy . I 've been loyal to this product , but it 's not the same so unfortunately I have to buy another brand of jeans now .
 The silt-color `` Levi 's 505 Straight Fit Pants '' that I received did not fit like I expected them to . The `` rise '' measured from the crotch to the top is 1-1/2 inches shorter than traditional Levis 505 pants . As a result , they fit like `` low rise '' style pants , not like the 505 Levis that I have purchased in the past . Also , the upper front fabric is excessively wavy when the pants lay empty , flat on a table . They remain so when wearing the pants , unlike the pants shown in the photo . Properly tailored pants would lay flat .
 The last two pairs I bought -LRB- February 2011 -RRB- had a very loose waist and a tight seat . I have in the past noted some variation in Levi 's sizing from one batch to another -- some are tighter and some are looser -- but the basic shape has always been consistent . These recent jeans are ridiculous . They are n't cut the same way at all . The waist requires a tight belt to stay up , and bunches up under the belt , and the seat is flat and tight . Uncomfortable and unattractive.Levi 's needs to fix this or they will lose many customers . I would think that the online outfits like Amazon would pressure them to improve quality control , because people order things online that they are confident will fit . If you ca n't trust consistency of sizing , folks will have to go to local retailers to try the clothes on first .
 These are not the Levi 's Jeans you were used to . Made in Egypt , very thin cloth , only five belt loops instead of seven . Also , the sizes are not accurate . I love Amazon because they refunded my Levi 505 purchase but I 'll never buy from Levi again.Ralph Miller
 Many of us 505ers out there have been wearing this style for many years ... During this time , there was n't any guesswork , just look for your size , grab them , and go ... But Levis has recently changed the cut of these classic blue jeans ... What was once 505 ` Regular Fit ' is now 505 ` Straight Cut ' ... Let me assure you - THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ... The new cut is tighter in the thighs and much snorter in the belt line/waist line ... They fit like low rise jeans and for most guys , they are prone to falling down ... I discovered this after returning three pairs to the store for thinking they were defective ... Why would Levis go and change a good thing ? . . Guys ... Just bring back the ` Regular Fit ' 505s ... If you want to offer a different cut , for heaven 's sake , give it a different model number ... But do n't screw with a classic ... Take a hint from Coca-Cola ... The ` New Coke ' was a failure - do n't screw with a classic ... I will not be buying any more Levis unless they can make the 505 regular cuts again ... Disgusted , Chris
 I bought two Levis 505 Straight Fit Jeans in May for my Dad in Hong Kong . They were bought as Father 's Day 's gifts for him . In order to order the right size , I asked him to take a picture of his old one to me `` W31 L30 '' . I received them on June 3rd and gave them to my friend to bring them to him . The sizes of both jeans were totally wrong . My Dad told me one measures W33 and the other measures W35.Both jeans will become donations . Sigh ... how come the actual size can be THAT OFF from what is listed on the label !!!! Very disappointed ... . No more Levis Jeans from now on for I can not trust the label anymore . Sigh ...
 My order was the pants Levis Mens size 34W x 32L and I came what I believe is 36W x 34L , made '' in Mexico , which leaves much to be desired in the quality of this product , something similar happened to me Levi 's Tumbled Stretch 34x32 made '' in China , shrank in the first wash being the length in 28 or less ... that disappointment
 I concur with the other disappointed , former , Levi customers . Levi has made a disappointing change to the 505 brand . I naively grabbed a couple 505 replacement jeans , tore off the tags and let them go through a simple rinse cycle . When I went to wear them I sadly found that they did not fit right . Way too loose for me . Not even close . I have done this many times before without problem . When I compared to my older jeans I noticed the labels `` straight '' vs. my good old `` regular '' tags inside.I thought I made a mistake and grabbed the wrong kind . But I could n't find my trusty `` regulars `` s anywhere for purchase . The sales person at a Levi store condescendingly told me that they were the same -LRB- actually , I am not sure she ever heard of `` regular '' 505 's -RRB- . As noted in these reviews , I did n't make a mistake , but it seems Levi has.My new 505s now hang separately in the closet and I wear them when I do n't care about how I look , like when I go to home depot or work in the yard . I would add `` or when I shovel manure '' , but I do n't really ever do that . It seems lthat perhaps Levi is cornering the market on manure piles with this stinky change .
 I ordered 3 pair of jeans , specifying 36X29 , because that is the size I wear , and have other Levi jeans of that size that fit perfectly . Although the label indicates that the jeans that I recently purchased are 36X29 , they are actually 37X293/4 according to the seamstress who had to alter the jeans . Needless to say , these are now the most expensive jeans I own , but they now are 36X29 . I will never order clothing through Amazon again , as it is obvious that Amazon is selling `` rejects '' from the manufacturer .
 I 've been wearing these for more than 40 years -LRB- 501-505 's -RRB- the denim continues to get lighter , the material flaws more frequent , and the sizing more random.I 'm done with the whole Levi 's thing . For my money , there are better , longer wearing options .
 I am very disappointed with these jeans . The fabric is very light . I have been wearing 501s and 505s for years and never seen anything like this . The only reason I am giving them two stars is because I am wearing them . I guess next time I need some new Levis I will need to go to the -LRB- shudder -RRB- mall where I can touch before I buy .
 This brand has been transformed from the one I trusted for over thirty years , to a POS.I 've worn Levi 's blue jeans ever since I was a teen . I 'm now in my early 50 's and these are obviously not the same quality jeans as they were even ten years ago . They 're thinner , the fit of the exact same size and style is extremely varied from one pair to another -LRB- even the belt loops are double sized or super skinny on two ` identical ' pairs of 505 's -RRB- , and they have been designed to self destruct in six months of casual wear.EVERY pair of my ` new ' Levi 's now tear out @ the upper LH corner of the right rear pocket after 180 days of ownwership . I NEVER carry ANYTHING in that pocket ; not even my wallet . There is no excuse for this identical , premature , calculated failure of a forty dollar pair of blue jeans . And the now dainty belt loops tear off these tissue paper jeans if you merely LOOK at them too hard . Chinese Levi 's = CRAP !!! Bye bye , POS blue cotton pants posing as Levis . I 'll not be purchasing another overpriced pair of these pale imitations . The greedy manufacturer has obviously made the decision that a billion new middle class Chinese consumers will buy garbage ` American denim ' . Those of us in the USA with a shred of memory sure as hell wo n't be buying this $ htt.DO NOT BUY LEVI 'S UNLESS YOU ENJOY LIGHTING YOUR MONEY ON FIRE .
 I purchased these because I thought I could always count on Levis for consistent sizing and quality . Unfortunately , this is no longer the case . The pants -LRB- 33 x 32 -RRB- are about a size too big and the fabric is much thinner , so I know they wo n't be lasting as long as the old pairs .
 Only five belt loops instead of seven . I 'm switching to Wrangler . Should 've read the reviews first . But hey , who would 've thought they would decrease the amount of belt loops ? I bought a pair of Levi 's two years ago and they have seven loops . But I lost two inches in the waist and was planning on buying a few more pair of jeans . I hope the manufacturer reads these reviews . The people who decided on the amount of loops made a dreadful mistake . Goodbye Levi 's . Hello Wrangler .
 The trnsaction was a nightmare.I ordersd a pair of jean , the same style and size Levis that i have beenwearing for many mnay years . When i received the product , since theywere the same style and size , I washed them . Lo and behold theyshrunk so much that i could not wear them or worse yet , return themI did call the Levi corperation , and they told me that you sold discountedpants that they had discontinued or material that had been phased out.they said that they would never sell those products.So you see that the whole Amazon transaction was a nightmare for me , and there is littlereason that you should send me announcements for `` denim sales '' . I 've already been had.Please ackowledge receiptLouis L Ferrario
 The jeans I purchased fit very strangely ; they were a bit long and the waist was n't cut right at all . I kept thinking they would shrink a bit in the wash but they have n't . I 've purchased 505 Levi 's Straight Fit for many years and am familiar with how they should fit . These are not made correctly at all and I do n't really like them . I wo n't purchase these online again for that reason . I purchased online this time because even though I live in the home city for Levi 's , I have trouble finding my size as I am at one end of the size range .
 Hey I love Levis 505 Straight Fit , for the perfect way it sits on me , but for some reason this pair that i just got , not only did n't it sit like all other pairs I have , it also felt different a little thicker than I normally like it . Beside that it 's fine , the shipping came earlier than expected so thanks for that !
 i am sure you hear this all the time , they do not make them like they used to . . the delivery was prompt and handled professionally , just wrong size , at all.has worn the same size for 30 years , oh well . .
 I received these pant I am totally disapointed with Amazon / Levis due to the color is totally different what I expected . I bought one of this pant some time ago and it is the same color of the picture , now I bought the same Ridgid color and it is totally different , it is lighter . Adittionaly the size is incorrect 32x32 looks like 34x34 . Return this item is a thurny issue for me.Luis
 Recently I bought a 550 relaxed fit pair of Levi 's Jean -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- and the waist was ok but they were a bit long so in this ocassion I tried the 505 -LRB- 33 * 29 -RRB- and they were too tigh at waist but the leg size was ok . I learn it is necessary to consider the fit type , not only the size which is a bit strange as my old pair of Levi 's 555 -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- -LRB- not currently available -RRB- were ok . The fabric is thick and there is not complaint about the material but the sizing is a bit tricky . Sizes across the different fits should be ok but it seems not . A relative , chubbier than I , actually has a 505 -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- which are ok , so there seems to be sizing problems with this jean .
 These are not the jeans I 'm used to . The waist is bigger than it should be . The material is thinner than my older Levis . I 'm keeping them because I need jeans , the price was better than in Kohl 's and they work , but I would n't order these again or recommend them . I 'll get used to this fit and expect them to wear out more quickly than they should !
 I purchased 36x30 jeans . I have worn Levi 's for 50 years . The pair I received said 36x30 - But the actual size must have been 25x30 , I could not get them on . Very Dissatisfied !
 I have worn 505 's for decades . I recently bought a new pair to find out they have changed the fit . I hate the new low waisted fit ! If they are going to change the cut of a pair of jeans , they need to give the new version a different model number . Very bad move on Levi 's part . Who 's in charge there and what were they thinking ?
 If there is a way of giving 1/2 a star , I would have done it . Yes , I 've been wearing Levis 505 `` regular fit '' for the last 30 years and it has always fitted me perfectly until now when the brilliant brains at Levis replaced the `` regular fit '' with `` straight fit '' and results in a classic example of if there is a way of screwing up a good thing , the Levis people thought of a way of doing it . Just like the classic Coke taste that was replaced a few years back that never were quite accepted by the public . For some reasons , they forgot what brought them success in the first place with a successful formula . Good bye Levis for screwing up an American icon . May you rest in peace .
 The waist on these jeans say 33 but they are as big as a 35 . they must be seconds or irregulars .
 the fit was to loose totaly disappointed . wo n't buy chlothes on here again . same size from store fits just fine .
 There are other reviews that talk about the various manufacturing areas that Levi 's Jeans are made from and the inconsistencies from sweat shop to sweat shop . Well it is true . These fit eh . Not so bad that I 'll return them but I am confident this is the last pair of jeans I will buy from Levi 's Co. .
 Recived very late and damage . I send it back.First
 jeans with details of elaboration at the level of the boot is damaged sewing line is placed at the middle of the pants , I 'm not satisfied with the product .
 Great fit but did not like the washed out faded look . Description did not state that . I have 505 's and they did not look like them .
 I ordered these Levi 's size 42 '' x 29 '' . Not an easy size to always find . But they arrived with the tag that indeed listed the size as 42 '' x 29 '' . It tried them on . They seemed too long . I took them off and measured the inseam . It was 30 1/2 '' rather than 29 '' . I boxed them up and returned them . It makes me hesitant to order jeans online . Better to go in the store and try them on .
 Jeans were exactly what I ordered.But once I tried them on the left leg seam had a twist in it.The outside seam twisted to the front.I will continue to buy my Levi 's at Levi 's . Com .
 I bought the Levi ` s 505 36x34 and 2 pairs of jeans Levi ` s 36x34 . But the 505 model has proved to be larger than the waist and 2 `` longer than the other two , I am very disappointed . I do not trust online buying Levi ` s
 Every other pair of jeans I have stays around my waist and does n't drag on my heels . Is 34 inches different in Mexico where these are made ? They are WAY too loose and wo n't even shrink when washed . I have to constantly keep pulling them up . I will never buy Levi 's online again .
 The Levi 's 505 straight fit jeans are clearly labeled 34 - 34 , but the actual size is 38 - 35 . The pants appear to be the real thing . My guess is that they were improperly labeled at the factory . Useless to me , of course .
 I ordered one pair of Levi 's and one pair of Wrangler jeans both 34 waist 30 length . The Wranglers fit perfectly but the Levi 's had to be at least 36x32 or larger . I thought they could n't be that mislabeled so I washed them to see if they would shrink . They did n't . I guess thats what I get for ordering clothes on-line instead of trying them on at a store . Thank you for asking . Phil
 The first set of jeas were the wrong size but still waiting for the revised size . Should be today or next week .
 I bought a pair of Men 's 505 Straight Fit , Blue Collar jeans made by LeviThis is not your father 's Levi 's , or even mine . Something bad has happened to this brand name . The sizing is all wrong , I had to buy a pair 4 inches smaller than my normal size for it to fit right . The material is thin , flimsy and clearly different than the full , sturdy Levi 's of the past . You could buy a pair and were certain that they were indestructible . Now they seem to be made from a fabric that you would make pajamas from.What has happened?Harry Lime
 The jeans were very Slow in getting to me and they were way too big . I buy the same size each time for my husband and these were way too big .
 I did not receive this item . Please check your records and if I was charged for this item , it was never received.Thank you , Linda Savell
 Ladies and GentlemenI politely inform you that since I start my shopping over the Internet through you had no problem with the products supplied , though two of the pants I purchased with this latest purchase came with defects in order to use them because the outer and inner side lines of these pants because they have defects in their court and do not stay in place and therefore can not use the same lost by giving purchase to have no complain but given that I have requested to report thereon , and not interest me that I returned merchandise credited me or give me money but I guarantee full power to do my shopping in a safe and efficient
 My old levi 's 505 are made in the u.s.a. are tight fitting and ready show off my bulge and theses low quality levis are too loose fitting when they should be tight I even have to wear a belt with these 505 .
 I bought 32/34 for my son for Christmas . . He is actually is 30/34 but I bought them bigger to give him a little room . They are about 4 sizes too small . Unfortunately since we washed them before actually trying them on I ca n't return them . . I doubt anyone would be able to fit in them . . Somehow they were mislabeled . . they say made in Haiti ?? I will be giving them to good will . . I will never buy these online again . .
 I ordered 3 pair of pants from this seller and got 2 very fast . The 3rd was to be shipped when they got it in , which was fine . HOWEVER ... I came home today and found 3 more pairs of pants ! I called them to see what happened and they said I placed two orders ! I told them I did n't and they HUNG UP ON ME ! I called back and went over the while story again and was told AGAIN I placed two orders ! I told them their own order slips show TWO DIFFERENT TIMES so there was no way they were both placed by me ! They refused to do anything about it ! I am now stuck with over $ 100 of pants I do n't need ! With as many more options as you have on the internet ... go somewhere else or get ripped off !
 Geez , ordered a single pair of jeans 3 days ago . Still in the process of shipping . Seriously how long does it take to package a pair of jeans and mail it?It 's not like this is a 50 inch plasma tv set.Amazon you are not on your game . *** EDIT *** Amazon customer service promptly resolved the shipping issue and the Levi 505s were delivered on time.HOWEVER , I had to send them back the next day !! The sizing on the label said 28/30 but was in reality more of a 30-31/30 size . They were freakin ' huge on me -LRB- I have a small waist -RRB- . In fact they were larger than the 29/30 505s I already own -LRB- unbelievable -RRB- . I even had a tailor measure them to prove I was n't crazy.Who ever is manufacture these jeans these days is `` out to lunch '' on quality control . All I have to say is check your sizing carefully folks when you order these . You may not like what you find.Thankfully Amazon refunded my money in full .5 stars to Amazon.com customer service!Less than 1 star to the manufactures of these 505 jeans , just terrible !
 I ordered these jeans on my wife 's Amazon account , I have been wearing Levi 505 's for over thirty years , and I must say that the pair that arrived today have got to be the worst jeans I have ever seen ... no , . . really . I tried to ignore all the 1 star reviews , but I should have heeded their warning . They arrived today , & I knew that they would , but kept thinking , as i picked up the box , this has got to be something else . There was no weight to it ... but low & behold , it was a new pair of Levi 505 's '' Made in Mexico '' , ... paper thin material . I think I could poke my finger through them , If i desired to do so . They got ta be kidding me ... These jeans probably are n't even worth $ 5 , let alone $ 40 . What a joke . Wo n't even be trying these on ... Back in the box , & back to Amazon is where these will go today ... I highly doubt these would survive a few spin cycles in the washer ... Might be useful to buff your vehicle ...
 These Jeans are pure rubbish ! Cheap , thin demin that feels like it is made from newspaper pulp . I swear , I think they contain some percentage of newspaper pulp , just so Levi 's can cut down on costs . They lose their colors in just a few washes and the fibers start fraying as soon as you wear them . They crush your crotch , they slide down and need to be hiked up every minute . Levi 's has obviously been taken over by a Bunch of MBA 's with degrees in worthlessness . MBA should stand for Master 's in Business Assassination , because that 's what they actually accomplish in the end . Look what MBA 's did to apple before apple wised up and fired them all . Apple was nearly killed by MBAs ! I am frustrated because I can not find any Jeans that fit on the waist like normal jeans do . I mean , what are these elitist upper management asswipes thinking , that by reducing the rise in their jeans , Men can wear them ? We have balls and we do not like crushed nuts . Also , this stupid low rise jean trend needs to die already . What kind of guy likes to have crushed nads , and have his pants hanging off his ass at the same time ? I guess American Has become Snookie Stupid , because looking like a douchey asswipe is consider cool.I 've spent months looking for jeans that fit like normal jeans . I went to LL . Bean but all their jeans look like something an elderly man would wear diapers with . I am 30 years old , and I just want normal jeans . Anyone know of any replacement brands for Levi 's ?
 Aweful . One leg was almost 2 inches shorter than the other leg . It was a waste of my time when I thought purchasing online would save me time from going into a store .
 I bought 505 Levis , size 36W x 32L , thinking they would be the same as the 505 Levis , 36W x 32L , that I bought in a store in Ithaca , NY several years ago . No such luck ! The new ones have less room from the crotch up , the stitching is shoddier , the belt loops are narrower and the cloth is thinner and less robust . In fact my two year old 505 Levis that have been washed countless times have thicker cloth than the brand new ones that have never been washed.What really bugs me is the fit above the crotch . It 's more or less okay when I wear a shirt . In the summer with a skimpy shirt or no shirt , the crack of my a. . will show and that 's really low class - even for females , which I am not one of.I am going to look at Carhartt the next time I need jeans . So far they have delivered reliable products .
 Probably this was the last time I ordered Levi 's online from Amazon.I got two pairs of Levi 's jeans -LRB- 505 -RRB- in the same shipment and both have extremely different fitting , none close to the Levi 's I know for so long . Now I am wondering why I was so lazy not to go to the local Levi 's store ... . My advice , if you can get out of your sofa and visit a local Levi 's store , it would be worth ...
 The Levi jeans are not what they once were . The denim used does n't seem to hold up as long as they use to , I find the denim also failing where the belt loops are stitched in . The fake leather patch on the back comes off after a few washes also , did n't this use to be real leather ? There use to be 2 additional belt loops as I remember than there are now , I find the belt slipping over the jeans because of this cut back.I am and have been an avid Levi fan , would purchase/wear no other jeans , however , now I find myself looking for a suitable replacement so I can enjoy the quality that Levi once had . The price has gone way up while the quality of the product has seemed to come way down . I am still wearing Levi jeans , but with much disappointment .
 I used to love Levis , but now they have gone with a thinner material , fewer belt loops , and the fit seems to have changed as well . They feel cheap and thin . A belt does n't hold them up evenly all the way around , there are 2 loops in front , 2 at the side , and only 1 in the back at the center . The effect is that you feel like your wearing a constant wedgy . Not to mention how they are charging more for these now . For a better fitting jean , at a better price , with enough belt loops , you 're better off with LLBean Double L Jeans .
 Could someone please tell me why Levi 's does n't make `` REGULAR FIT '' jeans anymore?I usually buy Levi 's 505 's in recent years . But always bought the regular fit size . Now all I see is `` STRAIGHT FIT '' sizing and they 're TOO tight ! Mostly in the upper leg area and seat . What is all that about ? Cost saving measure for Levi 's again ? As if the jean companies are n't making enough $ already !! I 'm reminded of this every time the temperature goes up in the summer time and I 'm trying to work in too tight jeans that are hot and uncomfortable to wear and work in !!
 After wearing these 505s three or four times , the stitching that holds the waistband to the jeans fell apart . I 've worn 505s most every day for 30 years and have not seen stitching fall apart even after years of wear . These brand new jeans just fell apart . I wo n't be buying Levis at Amazon again .
 Like a lot of folks , I too have bought and worn 505s for decades and now I wo n't buy them anymore . Not only did they change the fit , the increased the size of the back pockets so my wallet now rides down my leg . I can no longer carry my wallet in these jeans ... therefore I will no longer buy these jeans.And 1 other comment - anybody notice Levis reduced the amount of belt loops from 7 to 5 a few years back ? Another annoyance -LRB- cost savings -RRB- that I think changed the look and feel -LRB- I wear a belt so now the belt rides up a bit -RRB- . It 's a shame marketing folks do n't learn from old mistakes ... it 's business 101 . and if you do n't know what I 'm talking about , look up `` New Coke '' . Off to buy some crappier jeans -LRB- Old Navy ? Wrangler ? -RRB- but at least they 'll fit ...
 These ca n't be real Levi 's ?! ; the fabric is thin as a handkerchief and the stitching is cheap single stitched cotton thread . If I had the chance to feel these before buying of course I would NOT have bought them and bought the real thick Levi 's jeans . Costs more to ship back from here overseas than the jeans cost.Very disappointed in Amazon because these were sold through Amazon .
 The quality of the jeans is not the issue . I was not unhappy with the quality . The size is the problem . The jeans were marked 35 waist but clearly are at least a 38 . I always wash my husbands jeans before he wears them . By the time I washed the jeans there was no way that I could return them . I really did not notice that they were not the correct size until my husband tried them on . After at least 3 washings in hot water followed by a hot dryer they are still too big . So I am very disappoined .
 I love Levis and ordered a pair of these as weight lifting had made my slim fit 514 jeans a bit tight , so I figured these are the same cut , just not slim . However , I found these to be equally slim in the thigh . Jean fit is a rather personal thing , so it is n't that these jeans are bad . It is just that they are slimmer than I expect for a ` straight ' fit .
 I should have heeded the reviews that said that these jeans do not fit properly . I actually tried on a pair in a local brick and mortar store and they fit perfectly , -LRB- 40/30 's -RRB- so I thought I 'd try to save $ 20 by buying them online . Bad idea . The jeans ordererd through Amazon were a completely different fit . The ones in the store were made in Nicaragua and the Amazon jeans were made in Egypt . I have no idea if that has anything to do with the fit problem or not , but it 's a shame to see Levi 's destroying what USED to be a great AMERICAN product .
 I thought I just got a bad pair last time I bought these but now I see what the problem was . Also a bit of sticker shock at how much prices seem to have gone up in the last couple of years . Last pair I bought was at a Sam 's Club maybe 12-18 months ago for $ 27 . Never minded paying a bit of a premium for Levi 's in the past compared to other brands but even if they had n't changed the cut , I 'm not so sure they 'd be worth the $ 40 - $ 50 prices I 'm seeing now , especially if they 're being made in some offshore sweatshop . I never thought of these as designer jeans ; I just liked the quality and fit . Guess the company feels that it 's not profitable enough to also cater to the adult market . Good luck to them . As for myself , I think I 'll give Wrangler/Lee/Oshkosh another look .
 These jeans have changed in design ! We buy the same size Levi 's every year and these two pair that I just purchased are way too small . The waist and length is the same as always , but the thigh is way too tight . It barely fits over his leg ! Maybe they are trying to make skinny jeans . These are definitely not traditional 505 's . Very disapointed .
 The `` straight fit '' is complete awfulness -- the pants do n't fit in the waist correctly anymore , they do n't hold cuffs well . I hunt all over for the remaining regular fit 505s I love , and they are becoming harder to find.The new straight fit is absolutely awful .
 I ordered a pair of the 505s for my husband . He is and always has been a 32x32 and always wears the same Levis 505s ... First of all , Rigid is not a color , it is an adjective . I have never seen jeans so stiff and uncomfortable . The pair could literally stand up on their own when they arrived . Second , they may be marked 32x32 , but they certainly fit like a 34x34 . I was hoping to save money , I should have just gone to my local Macys and picked up a pair there . At least he would have a pair of jeans he would actually wear then .
 Sadly , it appears that Levi Strauss has dramatically changed the cut of their classic 505 Regular Fit jeans . The new model is called the 505 Straight Fit and has a 2 inch wider waist and sits at the hips rather than the waist as the old 505 Regular Fit . I currently have 31 pairs of 505 blue/black jeans and a year ago bought a new pair and found that they did n't fit as the old ones did . I thought I got a cheap rip-off pair and bought another pair at a different store 6 months later only to find that they did n't fit either . I called Levi Strauss and was informed that yes , they had changed the cut of the 505 and now call it the Straight Fit . I was told that the 501 would fit similar to the old 505 Regular Fit , but it has a button fly that I do n't care for . I was also told that the Relaxed Fit was similar to the old 505 Regular Fit , but this 59 year old guy is 5 ' 11 '' and 150 lbs , so I do n't need a Relaxed Fit jean . So , after being a loyal Levi 's customer for 50 years I 've now gone to Lee jeans . They make a Regular Fit jean that fits me like my old 505 's and feels great . Maybe in the future Levi Strauss should consult with a company like Coca-Cola before changing an iconic product .
 The classic Levis 505 jeans are no more . They have now been replaced by Levis 505 `` Straight Fit '' jeans . This means they do n't come up nearly as high on the hips and they feel like hell when you wear them -LRB- unless you 're 14 years old -RRB- . Avoid at all costs if you liked the original style . Apparently the classic 505s had a tag in the inseam that said `` Regular Fit . '' If you can find these in a store or on eBbay , rock on . Otherwise , I would recommend Wrangler Men 's Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jeans . They feel like the old 505s and are actually a bit better anyway . Wrangler makes a better and more consistent product than Levis ? Yes , it 's true .
 I agree with all the reviews which have essentially complained about the current fit of the new 505 's . I had been wearing Levi 505 jeans for decades and have had the same measurements the entire time , so different sizes can not be the issue . These jeans used to fit great from the waist to shoe . But , as I now know from reading other reviews , while keeping the same label , Levi recently changed the fit of these jeans , especially around the waist . I have 3 pair of 505 's . While the oldest pair fits great , the last two that I purchased through Amazon fit poorly.The last 2 sets of 505 's I purchased each fit differently , but both ride too low on the waist . The silver fox colored jeans I purchased fits especially poorly , and the fabric feels flimsy compared to other Levi 's . With the new 505 's , I am continually pulling my pants up higher after bending or sitting.So after being a loyal Levi customer for my entire adult life , I will now switch to Lee regular fit , straight leg jeans , which I now feel are superior . Lee jeans come in as many colors as Levi , but they ride higher on the waist and the material is of equal or better quality IMHO . I notice that Wrangler also makes a similar jean that rides higher on the waist , so I probably will try one of this brand of jeans in the near future as well.Goodbye Levi , it was nice knowing you .
 I ordered 2 pairs of 505 from Amazon in the same size as a pair I have , 36 x 32 . The new jeans arrived as promised . The labels claimed 36 x 32 . These pants are so large that I can not wear them . I tried washing them in hot water and drying in a hot dryer . They are still way too large . I am returning them to Amazon . I 'll never buy Levi brand again . By the way , there are only five belt loops on the new Levi 's instead on seven and the material is MUCH thinner . Buyer beware.Ralph Miller
 I tried to cancel the order minutes after buying it because the color was n't as advertised . It was stonewash jeans -LRB- not as dark as it is claimed -RRB- . I returned the product after I received it with all the labels . Amazon , nevertheless , went ahead to give me only a partial refund . I have since stopped buying items of clothing from Amazon after that .
 I purchased two pair of 505 jeans because the two pair I owned were finally wearing out after about five years . Their longevity is a testament to Levis . I bought these jeans without trying them on ... why would I ? They are the same jeans I have been wearing for decades . When I finally tried them on at home I thought I had returned to the 70 's . They are very low rise jeans - the only thing missing was the 10 inch wide bell bottoms . The genius who decided to ruin a classic rather than simply introduce a new lower cut style , has probably destroyed relationships with thousands of life-long customers . I will return these jeans but never return to Levis until someone undoes a huge mistake .
 Ordered 32 &#34; X 29 &#34; 505 Levi 's . Always a given - great quality great fit - well not anymore . These were manufactured in a country I 'd never heard of ??? and the fit was terrible . I ordered a 32 waist and what I received was more like 33 ' or perhaps even 34 &#34; . Buyers beware . I 'm glad amazon has a nice return policy .
 They are now straight fit which means low rise . The closest to the Regular Fit are the 550 's . I returned these .
 These may not be the worst jeans I have ever owned but they are way ahead of whatever is in second place . You would think that as much as the charge for jeans now that they could afford to put some belt loops on them . I should have the advise of previous reviews and not purchased these jeans .
 So , I tried on a pair of these jeans in a store . They fit great , so I ordered a pair online for a better price . They came , and they did not fit . I ordered one pair of these and one pair of different Levi 505 's . Those fit.Who knows why the fit is so variable . You 're better off getting a pair in a store .
 INCREDIBLY AWFUL pair of Levis . They either are `` seconds or thirds '' or somebody needs to find a new process for producing this product . The crouch is not sewn together correctly therefore the pant fits poorly . The seams/inseams do not match making each pant leg irregular . WOULD NOT BUY another pair of Levis this way ... really a poor product . There is absolutely no quality in this product ... hopefully others will read this and refrain from wasting their money . Levis are just not what they used to be ...
 Maybe some people can buy clothes online without trying them on , but for myself , that 's proven to be most difficult . These jeans were cut very different than the ones in the store . Be careful .
 If you are buying a pair of Levi 's because you are a loyal customer , do n't waste your time . They looked cheap and were paper thin . What a disappointment , sent them back .
 I have worn Levi jeans and other apparel for about 70 years . They first quit making the jeans without the matching white and blue seam which I can see was quite an added expense . They also Quit using real leather pocket tags , also very expensive . ` They then quit honoring the `` If they rip , we replace then '' . The material gradually became thinner and the jeans did n't last very long compared to the originals that were usually handed down to about the third child in the family . The last straw was this latest pair I puchased after several years of avoiding Levis and they now have only 5 belt loops which makes them hang between the loops and do n't look good at all . Basicly I 'm saying Goodbye To Levi jeans for good !
 Why would any seller send out an item with the security tag still attached . I emailed them with the problem and got no responce ! When I took the pants into a local retailer to have the tag removed , they assumed they were stolen jeans ! My advice ... buy locally and save yourself the harassment .
 I believe that I have just bought my last pair of Levi 's . They have been my favorite jeans brand for years but these are not what they used to be . The fit is awful and I 'm not even sure that the denim fabric is the same . I 'll admit that I have n't bought a new pair in several years but these seem like an entirely different brand . I plan to start shopping around to find another brand that I will like better . It 's sad to say goodbye to such an old frriend .
 After second washing there are major streaks across both front pockets and crotch as if fabric color faded due to poor dye ?
 This is the first pair of jeans I 've had to buy in a few years . I was replacing a pair of the same make and model , Levi 's Men 's 505s . The fabric is lighter , the cut is lower , really down on the hips now . Clearly cost cutting has been going on . They fit OK and I 'm keeping them , but a standard model from a venerable brand should not be getting watered down . Clearly will not be lasting as long . These should be branded under a new number to identify the new cut and the cheaper fabric !!
 These jeans fit very well . However , the fabric 's inside finish was extremely rough , making the jeans uncomfortable to wear . Comfort improved slightly after several washes .
 I bought size 40 but this pant it is two sizes biggerIt is not my first Levis but it is my first time with thisproblem with the size .
 Updated with info on the reordered pair ... Again a quality control issue . This time the waist fit ok , but the length was 2 inches longer than the other pair.I did n't believe all of the reviews about poor quality control until I experienced it myself . I am currently wearing a pair of these Jeans . I love them . They are super comfortable and fit great ; therefore , I ordered a 2nd pair in the exact same size.The jeans arrive and they do not fit right.If you get a pair that fits right , then the Jeans are 5 stars , but if you do n't then it 's annoying and frustrating -LRB- hence the 2 star ranking -RRB- . I have already reordered the jeans and will be returning the `` defective '' pair that I received . Yes , it 's annoying , but Amazon 's return policy makes it super easy .
 I just put on a pair of these today for Thanksgiving day . The seam on one leg is crooked and the waist is about an inch too large . I already removed the tags -LRB- my mistake -RRB- so I gues I 'll have to keep them but I wo n't purchase any more clothing from these people.I should have purchased them from a store like Sears . Live and learn I guess .
 As others have stated , these are not the same ol' Levi 's . The fit is terrible , the material is thinner and the quality is nowhere near what you would expect from Levi 's . I have started to look at Lee and Wrangler as replacements . Also , Harley Davidson now has a line of jeans that are better quality and better priced ... and since I own two Harley 's , it seems like the way to go .
 I ordered this pair having worn 505 's for years . I did n't keep the return paperwork and put them through the wash . When wearing them the first time I noticed that they are sized bigger than 38 in the waste.I would guess a full inch bigger . I now have add Levi to the do n't buy list .
 I have worn Levi 's for at least 50 years ! I never found any pants to be more comfortable . The last two pair of 505s I bought were so different then the ones that I considered an `` old friend '' over the years . The new ones seemed to feel ` rigid ' in the material used . I washed them many times , and they are still not comfortable . Also they are ` baggy ' in the thigh area . They seem too loose all around and ` hang ' on me . The label said `` Made in Mexico '' , so that answered all my questions . I am now searching for another brand after all these years .
 Not sure why but the jeans I received were the wrong size.The tag on the jeans said the correct size but for some reason this pair is way off . -LRB- I have been wearing the same size for years and have another that fit properly . -RRB- No matter how many times I washed them they are still 2-3 sizes too big.Someone put on the wrong tag .
 I bought two pair of jeans . One pair fit great . The other pair had legs obviously two inches longer than the other pair .
 The color and weight of material was way inferior to what the stores carry . The price was no better than what stores advertise for their sale price . Either the pair I received was a second or was made at a different quality per Amazon 's contract with Levi .
 After levis discontinued the mens perfect fit 512 's i was ready to give up buying from levi strauss but decided to give the 505 a try and I 'm not happy . My first thought was these have to be a knock off brand made by some other company that simply puts a levis label on them . I am not saying they are , they just feel cheap , not like levis I have bought in stores . They are thin and feel like a poorly made denim material not the stiff denim i associate with levis of old . I washed them and wore them for a day . After 8 hours they had stretched so much they looked like they were two sizes to big and baggy . Not sure if these are the same as sold in stores but if they are levis has lost a long time customer ... . The only good thing I can say is that the shipping was fast .

 Asked for and received a pair of 33x30s for Christmas . Even after washing , the waist is a full inch larger than my previous 505s . Levis Customer Service confirmed that they are intentionally changing the sizing
 I spent the greater part of my teenage years and twenties trying to find the perfect jeans . Finally I found them with the 505 Regular fit . Then , about five years later , they changed the fit !! The new 505s , called `` Straight fit '' , are too tight in the legs and butt area , whereas the old ones gave you a little room . It 's night and day as far as comfort is concerned . I wish Levi would stop messing around with what works . Another example is the Silvertab , which also were great , but discontinued .
 levi these used to be some of my favorite jeans they fit around the shoe perfectly so it wouldnt rip on the bottom , they gave me enough leg room to move freely and willingly in any direction , they had 7 thick durable belt loops that held the pants over my butt perfectly , and they where made with a a tough 12 ounch jean material . NOW on the other hand you guys have made the exact opposite !! im so freaking pissed off at levi for discontinuing all levi jeans that are worth buying for top dollar , you have lost so many customers because you decided to sell out and give us crap that is only made for the fashion obsessed morons out there that would actually buy something so poorly made . its like buying fast food in comparison to real food , its just plain crap all the way around . you guys made the belt loops so thin they will snap in a month , the jean material is alot thinner , the fit is strange , to tight much bigger waist then you advertise which also makes you guys liars on top of every other thing ive mentioned , GET YOU DAMN ACT TOGETHER AND STOP THINKING ABOUT MONEY , on the other hand . . if money is the only thing you guys can understand then you would know that more then half the population goes for durability and well made products then cheap fashion thrills just to make yourself feel better . well guess what levi we arnt all that self concious ! there are some of us out there that actually work hard for every penny we get and dont think we deserve to pay top dollar for such poorly made peaces of crap . bring levi strauss back to america where it belongs since the 1800s !! im going for carhartt now because they care about the average buyer . your products make me sick to my stomach . you should be ashamed that your still using such a well known name such as levi . . you should just call it crap for now on . unless you go back to the way you used to make the jeans . IF NOT BETTER !!! so do it ! if you dont ill just switch to carhartt and leave my business with you in the past .
 I always get 505 but these pants material is so thin Levi 's lately use thin and poor materials that this is my last pair of pants from levis will never buy levies again .
 These do not fit like the old 505 . Quality suffers also ! It seems that the venerable 505 have fallen into the globalization trap . I will not buy again .
 I 've been wearing the same size Levis 505s for some 30 years . I am well familiar with how they fit , what they 're made of , and how they feel . For the first time I just ordered two pairs of Amazon 's Levis 505 jeans.The two pairs I purchased from Amazon are a good inch shy of specification in both waist and inseam , and the waist is a half inch or more low . They fit me like hip-hugging sausage skin and the fabric just does n't feel right - it feels as if it 's a lighter weave and I get the distinct impression it 's just not going to wear over time like I expect a 505 to wear . If I wanted a skin-tight lightweight fashion brand jean I 'd buy them and not 505s . I 'll give them two stars because they are blue jeans and because at least visually they look like the genuine article . But when they are clearly not equivalent to the store bought version , I 'm returning both pairs of these pants and not using Amazon again for this particular product.I can not recommend Amazon 's Levis 505 jeans , much as I 'd really prefer the convenience of ordering online .
 Let me start by saying that Levi 's 505 jeans are my jeans and will be my jeans until the end of time . The 505 's fit me perfectly and pretty much define my style . But there is something different about the ones that I received from Amazon versus what I 've purchased in the actual Levi 's stores.The material felt flimsy and the fit was completely different . The colors also did n't look anything like what I expected , being much , much lighter than what I had received in store.I sent them back and picked up another pair at the Levi 's store . I may try picking up the next pair from Amazon to see if I just got a bad pair , but I 'm not excited to give it a second shot .
 My husband has worn 505 jeans for his whole life but that is about to change . I bought him 3 pairs , removed the tags , he wore them and we noticed there was a big gap at the waist , on the back-side . We discovered Levis has removed 2 loops `` in a cust-cutting move '' . Well , their cost-cutting has lost this customer . It is SO annoying ! Levis , wake up and put the loops back or you 've lost this customer for good .
 Levis from another land.My favorite since 1957 . These new red tabs have been washed -LRB- 2 -RRB- times and the belt loop over left rear pocket is already tore off leaving a 1/2 '' hole . The right leg outer seam starts is correct at top but ends in the center of my foot at the bottom.CrOoKeD ... FOR LEVI ONLY . . NO OFFENSE TO AMAZON !!!! GOOD JOB TO AMAZON IN ALL THAT THEY DO FOR MY FAMILY ...
 The last purchase of these jeans was for something called regular fit . They are called something else now but the tag does not say what it is . The fit is lower on the hips . The material is also noticeably thinner so I doubt they will last as long .
 Had purchased from this retailer previously.The previous purchase WAS the original rigid , heavy jeans I had been looking for . This time , however , the jeans were much thinner and had the ` wrinkly ' look coming out of the dryer . I will be returning these . This IS a very good retailer , just do n't always expect the same quality .
 I always thought Levi 's were made in America . Sorry to find out they like many others -LRB- what used to be -RRB- quality products are not and lacking in quality and workmanship . These pants are thin materialed and will wear out in 3 months .
 wanted to open a claim , but this item is not an option . Today I received the package and was very surprised that I was sent a completely different color Tumbled Stretch -LRB- although the package has been correctly pointed out Good Old Blue -RRB- !!! Made in China , instead of Egypt -LRB- mentioned in the product description . -RRB- Return the goods can not , because he was in Russia and the transfer will cost several times more expensive than those jeans . This is the first time I was very disappointed by amazon.com and pondered whether to continue to make purchases -LRB- after the loss of my money and time -RRB- .
 What 's going on Levi 's ??? Are paying attention to our opinions ??? I am a good ` ol Levi 's costumer , buying tru Amazon and I was going to buy a 505 , but not after all these reviews ; I have used other models and in the last few years , the guys are right ! , manufacturing and materials have been changing a lot , depending on the place or country where the jeans were manufactured ; well our opinion are important , so what 's going on Levi 's , do you want us to quit ??
 The Levi 's were `` irregular . '' They do not fit at all like an identical pair I purchased at a retail outlet . Ca n't understand how they can get away with this . I ca n't even wear these jeans . A total waste of money . I washed them to see if the fit would improve . Did n't happen . Buyer beware .
 I have worn the same size and style of Levi 's jeans for 20 years . I ordered a pair of jeans and shorts from this vendor . Since they arrived with the same label as the rest of my jeans , I just assumed that they were like the rest in my closet . I washed them and put them away without trying them on . BIG MISTAKE . When I did get around to trying them , what I had was two ridiculous garments with waist sizes easily 2 inches larger than all the other 32 's in my closet . They were so baggy that I could barely keep them on . Since I 'm not a 14 year old with an IQ equal to his age , I prefer not to wear pants that fall off my ass . It cost me more than I initially paid to have the jeans and shorts altered . Unless Levi has just assumed that we all want to look like idiots or they have introduced vanity sizing because so many Americans are obese , I ca n't understand why the same style and size on the label does n't match the same cut of jeans that I have previously purchased . Lesson learned , do n't buy jeans that you do n't try on in the store . No more online purchase of this product for me .
 I 'm disappointed because I ordered the pants but the size is correct does not match the size that is smaller
 Heads up on the fit -LRB- regular , original , etc -RRB- descriptions . Unclear why Levi 's felt compelled to alter the fits on these long established styles -LRB- 501 , 505 -RRB- but they did . What you used to buy is not what you 're getting . Could n't find a notice or explanation on any Levi 's site , so you 're on your own .
 505 jeans use to be made made by Levi 's to fit real mean . Levi 's changed the cut of the 505s to now be low riders with skinny little legs . I have personally talked to Levi 's Customer Service and basically they do n't care about all the old timers that have worn 505s all their lives . There basic answer is that they now are catering to the low rider , pinched honey wearers . Good riddance Levi 's ! Do n't make the mistake of buying any Levi products as they are foreign made and they do n't care about what used to be dedicated customers .
 I have never had a pair of levis fall down before . These used to be work pants
 Heed other 's reviews . These are now lower cut . Had to return them after wearing the 505s for 10 years . And trust me , I am not any bigger than I was then.The jeans just do n't fit the same .
 For a company that specializes in jeans , you would think belt hoops would be something they know you need . Only one in the back does not keep your belt where it needs to go in the back . It makes the waistline belt go over the denim . I looked at my other jeans from Lands End and others , and they all have 3 in the back . One over each pocket , one in center .
 Since junior high school in the ' 70 's , I have never NOT had a pair of Levi 's 505 's in my closet . That 's going to change once my current pair-bought at the flagship Levi 's store in San Francisco , no less-finally gives up the ghost . The switch from `` regular '' fit to `` straight '' fit means 505 's are now completely different pants . The waist is easily two inches lower on your hips , the circumference of the legs probably two inches less , too . If you 're not a malnourished punk rock musician with no butt , you 're going to look like ridiculous in these pants . And you 'll feel ridiculous , too . Levi 's is clearly targeting a different market from , um , everyone who ever bought these pants in the past , so good luck with that .
 The size marked on the pants did not correspond to reality , they were one sise bigger.I ordered two pants one blue and one beige . I received two beige . I had to return one of the beige . They send me the blue one one week later . This worked ok.I could not use them because were one size bigger than the size marked . I sold then to a friend .
 When I bought the jeans they seemed to be a good price . I received them `` on time '' and right away something seemed wrong , they stunk ! They smelled like they had been in sewer water . Were these made in a 3rd world country and washed in a polluted river ? The first thing I did was throw them in the wash . More bad news , they bled so badly that the rest of the wash was stained blue ! I had to run the wash several more times . The good news is that the pants did n't stink anymore , the bad news is that several articles of light colored clothing were ruined.On the bright side , they fit well and look good .
 I had n't tried on 505 's in many years , but decided to get some since losing weight . WOW , these are way more baggy than they were several years ago . I 'm saying the cut has changed . I guess to make them more attractive to the younger generation that likes baggy pants . What a waste of money for me .
 Quise recordar mis tiempos juveniles , pues esta marca de jean era lo m&aacute;ximo en esa &eacute;poca , pero la verdad la horma cambio y ya no los siento como en aquellos d&iacute;as .
 I need of tracking product no have my pant send all information pleaseWilmer hernandez wilmersimonhernandez@gmail.comW h s ven
 compre unos 34 '' y parece que fueran como 36 '' porque son grandisimos y me quedan super anchos . No me gustaron para nada
 El pantal&oacute;n est&aacute; en buenas condiciones , pero la talla indicada en la etiqueta est&aacute; errada pues la talla real es 34x32 .
 I was very pleased with the quality of the jeans and the speed of delivery . They were a last minute birhday gift , which arrived on time . It is almost impossible to purchase certain sizes of Levis 's in department stores so this is a great outlet for them .
 For years , I have always been able to buy jeans for my husband without any problems -- Levis 505 regular fit . I recently ordered and received a couple of new pair for him , and OMG ... they were a completely different fit ! Both pair ! They ride low , and the overall fit is not flattering - at all !!! Levi 's has RUINED a perfect fitting jean ! I WANT THE OLD 505 'S BACK !!!!
 Attention all dedicated Levi 's 505 wearers ! Today 's 505 's are NOT the same . They are now calling them `` Straight Fit '' as opposed to `` Regular Fit . '' If you 've been wearing 505 's for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ... or more years , odds are you WO N'T like these . They sit low on the waist . You know , so your underwear can show . If that 's not your idea of fashion , do n't buy these . They 're also a little tighter in the crotch and thighs , whcih coudl be a problem for some . Do n't take my word for it , go to the Levi 's webpage and look up the reviews for the 505 since they changed the style in April , 2011 . They 've lost several generations of customers .
 I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 Jeans for 30 years , and could always rely on the fit . When I put on these jeans , the fit was nowhere close . When I measured , the rise was about 3 inches shorter than the standard Levi 's 505 . Why would any sensible company do that ? There are an infinite number of numbers . If you want to change the fit , why not change the number too . In the past , when Levi has introduced new jeans , they have used new numbers , e.g. 550 . The basic point is that these jeans do n't fit right , and now I have to start shopping for another brand .
 As others have written , Levis changed their 505 jeans without telling customers . The result is a totally poor fitting jean . Shame on Levis ! I have bought and worn Levis my whole life , but now I am off to find a better fitting jean and sadly , it wo n't have the Levis tag on it . : -LRB-
 The new fit of the 505 straight cut are unwearable . The vast majority of men passed the age of 30 do not wear their jeans two inches below their waist . We have more important things to do than pulling up our pants every thirty seconds . The waist is too low the rise is wrong and the cuff too wide . We like the original cut with the understanding that even the original cut was so inconsistent that it was necessary to try on multiple pairs to find a suitable fit.Please stop taking your loyal customers for granted .
 I purchased 2 pair of Levi 505s 33 '' waist , 29 '' length . The pants were both marked 29L and 33W . The 29 '' length was correct , but 1 pair has a 34 '' waist and the other has a 35 '' waist . I kept them because when I was young , Levis shrank when 1st washed . I was wrong !
 Levi stopped offering 505 's in the colors that they used to . They also offer less sizes then they used to . I have worn 505 's for years . 36 waist and 29 inch leg . But now Levi 's offers fewer of the color choices in a 36 waist and 29 inch leg . I ca n't prove it but the material seems lighter to me as well . Unless I want 505 's in my size in shades of blue I am out of luck . To summarize , less choice in colors of my size and cheaper lighter materials used .
 I have worn Levis Regular Fit jeans for many years . They have always fit comfortably . I bought a pair of the Straight Fit jeans thinking they were the same jeans with a new name . The description on the tag is identical to that on the Regular Fit jeans . Both say `` Sits at Waist '' . Not really . The seat has been changed -LRB- I have a 32 '' waist and am not trying to squeeze into too-small jeans -RRB- and the rise is different . I understand that companies must innovate to remain competitive . I do n't understand why anyone would change an established brand and make it useless to its core customers . If Levis wants to attract new customers it should have made the new fit explicit by giving it a new model number . This change reminds me of the `` New Coke '' fiasco . Maybe Lee or Wrangler will do instead .
 I 've been wearing Levi 505 's exclusively since the early 70 's . They fit me perfect . I could just walk into a store and pick up my size and buy without trying them on . Best jeans around.Well not any more ! Without any notice they have changed the `` Regular fit '' 505 's to `` Straight fit '' jeans which means they are no longer 505 's at all . The waist is larger , the crotch is higher and you must now wear them down on your hips as kid do with their jeans . These are no longer meant for adults or anyone who wants pants that fit properly . I also do n't like 550 relaxed jeans as they are too baggy.I 'll be looking for a different brand and returning the two pair I just bought . Hopefully Levi will lose enough faithful customers to make them rethink this rude abandonment of loyal customers .
 For as far back as I can remember , I have been a loyal Levi Strauss customer . I never understood why anyone would buy blue jeans from anyone else , but today I am questioning that loyalty.As a result of some successful changes in my diet , my old blue jeans have become too large for me , so I purchased 2 new pairs of 505 jeans and a new pair of 505 shorts . I have noticed myself hitching up my newer , snugger jeans more often than my older , looser jeans . This afternoon , I specifically noticed that my shorts kept slipping under my belt -- as though they did n't have enough belt loops.This evening I compared my new jeans with my old jeans , and lo and behold , I discovered that Levis have gone from 7 belt loops to 5 . Five belt loops are n't enough.The other posts I have seen about this product are focused on globalization-related issues . I , too , hate to see American jobs move overseas , but this particular problem has nothing to do with country of origin . Regardless of where the jeans were manufactured , Levi Strauss has cheapened the design specification , and they seem to be waiting to see if anyone notices.Dear Levi Strauss : I noticed . Your product is not as good as it used to be.I ca n't remember being this upset about a product change since the introduction of `` New Coke . '' I do n't drink much Coca Cola any more . -LRB- That may be part of the reason I need smaller jeans ! -RRB- Please put back the missing belt loops .
 I 've been happily buying and wearing 505 Regular Fit jeans for many , many years . I did not notice before submitting my most recent order that Regular Fit has been replaced by Straight Fit . But , boy , did I notice a change once they arrived . These are n't the same jeans at all . The fabric is less substantial and - most disheartening to me - the rise is a good inch lower than it used to be . That is , the waistband sits lower on the hips . They feel wrong to me , like I need to pull them up all the time . And they feel cheap . I ca n't wear them.In my opinion , Levi 's should have been more forthright about this change . This new jean should have received its own new model number and they should have retired the 505 number entirely . Because these are not , in any manner that 's important to me , anyway , 505s . Now I have to find another brand of jean whose waistband sits up at my waist where I like it . What a hassle . So very disappointing.Levi 's , you screwed up .
 I have worn Levi 's 505 Jeans for 25 years . I even have a box of `` 34 's '' in the attic for when I lose a couple of pounds.I just sent back 2 new pairs of these jeans because they no longer fit as the other pairs I own . I called Levi 's to find out why.I was told that they changed the fit several months ago , without changing the numeral designation . 505 's are now only made as `` Straight Fit '' rather than `` Regular Fit '' . In addition , they have lowered the `` Rise '' to a `` below the waist '' fit , rather than the old `` at the waist '' fit.Sorry Levi 's , you ca n't do that without losing long-term customers . How can you change something as basic and important as fit , but still call it the same thing?Levi 's Mens 505 Straight Fit Jean
 Warning ! Be advised that the new 505 Straight Fit jeans have replaced the original 505 Regular Fit jeans . They are not the same . Try these on in a store before ordering online or you will be disappointed . Apparently , somebody at Levi 's had the bright idea of changing a tried and true style rather than creating a new one ; a classic example of `` if it aint broke , do n't fix it '' .
 I bought three pairs of 505s at the same time from the same buyer . The first two pairs -LRB- one `` Made in Egypt '' , the other `` Made in Bangladesh '' -RRB- have worn just fine -LRB- so far -RRB- , but the third pair -LRB- `` Made in Lesotho '' -RRB- RIPPED on only the SECOND day I ever wore them , starting from just above and to the left of the back-right pocket and tearing straight down , almost to my crotch ... BETWEEN the center seam and the right-side pocket stitching -LRB- NOT on a seam or a stitch ! -RRB- . They just ripped open -- period -- as I sat down . I did n't poke against anything , or rub against anything , and they were n't too tight -- they just plain up and ripped open on their own ... and while I was at work ! Piece of junk ! I 've been buying and wearing Levi 's 505s for 25 years , and I may not be able to prove or explain exactly how I know these jeans are n't `` the same '' as they were even a few years ago ... but I just KNOW , in my heart , that they are NOT the same quality . Now , I 'm doomed for eternity to constantly checking the back of my other two pairs of jeans every time I wear them to make sure there is n't another big rip in them . This was absolutely the last pair of Levi 's I will ever buy . EVER !
 Despite G & L Clothing 's claim that , `` The jeans are the same quality products Levi 's has manufactured for over 150 years , '' they 're not . They have 5 , not 7 , belt loops , with only one in the back , and the waist sags down below your belt in back so your shirt shows between the belt and top of the jeans . If you want to look really nerdy , these are your jeans . Also , IMO , the denim is not as thick as it used to be , even for the darkest blue jeans.In addition to poor quality , G&L ; automatically signs you up for email . If you want email from people like this , who promise you `` watch your inbox for great things to come ! '' then G&L ; is for you.Finally , I 've understood that it 's illegal to charge a credit card until an item is shipped . Evidently G&L ; has n't heard about this , either . Or does n't care . Amazon 's 1/14/06 confirmation of this sale noted that , '' -LSB- Your order is -RSB- -LRB- available to ship by30-January-2006 -RRB- Amazon Payments has charged your credit card -LRB- Amex -RRB- for this purchase , and the funds have been credited to G & L Clothing.Not only do you get shlock jeans , but they illegally charge your card as much as two weeks in advance , and they opt you in for their lovely email.Personally , I think one star is too many .
 Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit JeanI have been wearing Levi 's 505 's for years . Recently they changed the fit from `` at the waist '' to `` below the waist '' . They are uncomfortable . I feel like I need to pull up my pants all the time . I wo n't be buying any more of these .
 I have been wearing Levis 505 jeans for years . I bough these and immediately noticed that the material quality is not as good as the ones I bought over a year ago . This material was thinner and not as comfortable . I also noticed that the fit is not the same as the old 505s -LRB- these are the same size I always wear -RRB- . What 's up Levis ... . It looks like my next jean purchase will not be Levis brand !
 Sad day when a pair of `` classic '' Levi 505 's are the most uncomfortable pair of jeans I 've ever owned.Not sure why the company just could n't come up with a different number for these new low rider jeans and leave the 505 's alone . I 've worn no other jeans since the 70 's , but unfortunately it looks like I have to move on to some other brand .
 From your page : `` Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit Jean `` These are not the same thing , nor are they the same jeans . `` Regular Fit '' 505 jeans were discontinued by Levi 's . Their replacement is the `` Straight Fit , which among other things , has less belt loops and does n't seem to fit worth a damn . Please , Amazon , at least fix the wording , there is no such thing as `` 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit '' Levi 's . I would gladly buy 2 pair of regular fit 505s right now , but there are n't any , so I had to buy a used pair off of ebay.After that wears out , I guess I 'll go naked . I 'll never buy what they are currently selling . Some things should nto be messed with . Levi 's 505 regular fit jeans were great the way they were .
 Agree with the other reviewers who criticize the way they fit -LRB- do n't fit -RRB- at the waist . While they feel and generally fit like quality Levis , they are more low-rise than I expected or like and I am constantly pulling them up . .
 Levi seems to have changed the cut - I always bought 505s , but my latest pair is far lower accross the backside and does n't fit . No more levis for me .
 I have the same problem as every other person providing feedback . The `` Regular fit '' fit me great . The straight fit fall off my rear and I am constantly pulling them up . As soon as I can find another pair that fit right I will switch and never buy Levi again . You can take your hidden price increase and shove it .
 Compared to the quality of Levis I owned a few years ago these do n't even come close . They are paper thin and I was almost afraid to put them on without tearing them . I guess we 'll see how long they last .
 I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years . In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores . Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare . I love them but replacement has been needed . After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand . The stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25 . The Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly . No two pair seem the same . However , The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent . The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.Not having a local source for the Levi brand , I ordered through Amazon . The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglersavailable locally . Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers . As a matter of fact , it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL ... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult jeans . The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son 's boy jeans.Last , the jean 's waist and length were at least 2 inches large . Years ago , Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.In summary , the fabric , the zipper , and inconsistent sizes are all very sub-par . The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.This pair was made in Egypt with Egyptian fabric.Avoid mail order Levi jeans
 I am buying this model more than 5 years.The main important things for me is how it fits and a ZIP.I do n't like the bolts.I like Levis because it fits good and quality of material acceptable.There is only one but important problem
 I too have been a long-time fan of the now departed 505 Regular Fit jeans . The decision to summarily drop this enduring style and substitute a new low-rise version -- the abominable 505 Straight Fit -- is positively baffling . I can only ponder what the folks at Levi Strauss were smoking at the time.But hold on , I found a substitute
 These jeans are not of the quality you would expect from the levi brand ... Much thinner material , never thought Levi woulddo this ...
 I hate the 505 straight versus the old Regular fit . i am tired of hitching up my pants every time i stand up and , of course , showing plumber 's crack . can anyone recommend another brand that has the same fit as the old 505 Regular fit ?
 Check out the Levis website for reviews and complaints about the new 505s . They have changed the fit -LRB- the rise -RRB- so that the jeans fit about 1 inch lower at the waist . Many guys are having trouble with the fit as being uncomfortable . They do not stay up ! For some , the 550 is unchanged and may work . As for me , I am changing brands after 45 years of buying Levis .
 We were disappointed to find this pair of Levi 's 505 significantly bigger than a pair of 505 straight fit we bought last fall for my husband . He is tall and slim -LRB- 34 Waist 36 Inseam -RRB- . That is so hard to find so were delighted with the first pair . The new pair required $ 70.00 alteration to take them in to the measurements of the first pair we bought .
 I bought black 505 's in December 2011 that were made in Mexico . They are great , so I bought another pair . The latest 505 's may as well be another brand , they are so different . They are overwashed , really shrunken down and noticeably faded . Poorer stiching as well . I want my new jeans to look NEW . These are `` Made in Lesotho '' . Beware .
 I bought 3 pairs . 2 size 30x32 -- rigid and tumbled rigid , 1 size 31x32 tumbled rigid.The rigid pair fits much larger than the tumbled rigid , even though they are tagged the same size . MUCH larger , like two sizes larger . The 31x32 tumbled rigid are made in egypt , had root beer or something sticky inside the bag , had a bent zipper , and are 2 inches SHORTER than the same style in 30x32 . I think levi 's is way too big to have any kind of real quality control . I 'd rather just pay > $ 100 and get a nice pair of selvedge denim I 'll have for years to come .
 Levi 's denim is so thin now , they tear at the crotch given the slightest stress . They look nice . Just do n't jump , squat , climb , run fast , leap , dance , ride a bike , or any other physical activity . I thought I had gotten a defective pair , but four pairs from different stores tore in the exact same place in less than a month of wear . Such a shame for what was once a great product . I 'll stick to Wranglers which do n't look nearly as good as Levi 's but they last forever at half the cost .
 I have been a Levi 's guy all my life , 58 years . Just like most I started with 501s and as I got a little older and wider moved on to the next most comfortable version . I 've now been wearing 505 and 550 for almost 5 years . While I 'm not going to put the actual size in print , I have been really pleased with the consistency of sizing over the years ... until last week when a pair of black 505s arrived at my door . As always I dumped them in the washer immediately to get rid of the new look and feel -LRB- cold wash , low temp dry as always . -RRB- The next morning I put them on and at first they felt a little tighter than usual . I thought , well maybe I 've put on some weight around the middle recently ... it happens . Well , I SUFFERED all day at the office as these jeans cut me in half . As soon as I got home , I pulled out a flexible tape measure to see what was up . To my surprise , this pair was 1.25 inches smaller around the waste than every other pair I own . Same brand , same model , same size ... except it was n't . So where does this story end . I sent the jeans back to Amazon the next say explaining the problem and as always Amazon sent me a full refund . This is why I do so much business with this great company . They put the customer first . I have since ordered another pair which arrived yesterday . I 'm hopeful that the new pair will actually be the size ordered and that the original pair was a fluke . Some guy on the other side of the planet where Levi 's are made is probably still laughing about the crazy American who got the tight jeans that he mislabeled . I guess it is sort of funny .
 The denim material is fine but the pants have too few belt loops , which causes the pants to sag in the back when you wear them .
 Levi 's thinks they can change the cut and quality of their jeans without losing customers . By shortening the rise to accommodate younger customers , they will lose those of us who desire comfort.Also found out that they produce different quality and sized jeans for different stores . Will be looking for a different brand for my next purchase .
 What you read in recent reviews of Levi 505s is true - they have changed the sizing a LOT & your old size wo n't fit you anymore.For years I 've bought 33 x 32 . I never even bothered to try them on - they always fit nicely . Sadly the last 2 pair I bought fitpoorly - the problem , as many others have pointed out is that they ride too low on the waist . I 'll be shopping for Lee or Wrangler next time I buy jeans .
 They fit fine and look nice , but they are noticeably thinner or &#34; lighter weight &#34; than past purchases I have made of 505 jeans . It 's a shame that these once durable jeans are now likely to wear down sooner . I will be searching for more durable jeans in my next purchase .
 The 505 regular fit are now the 505 regular fit . The waist is larger and the hips are extremely tighter . I will NOT be buying the 505 jeans any longer . I have been wearing them for decades .
 I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust . Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd . They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly . The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I ca n't stand it . My old 505s did not do this . The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them . They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle . These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality , look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing .
 I have a Levis 505 34 x 32 but it is smaller , I do not know if regular fit is equals straight fit
 I bought these for my husband as an extra pair of 505 's . He has others in this style from Macys and Zappos . These jeans are almost an inch and a half smaller at the waist than the others , although the sizing reads the same . I just returned them . This is unfortunate since Amazon overs great pricing and service .
 Just because it says &#34; 505 &#34; does not mean it is like the same old 505s you used to wear . True , these are cut the same , but the weight of the fabric is maybe half that of my older jeans . I suppose the lesson is that books can be purchased online , not clothes .
 Apparently the &#34; straight &#34; fit has consumed &#34; regular &#34; fit . You ca n't have straight -LRB- regular -RRB- fit as described in the description . They are two different styles . Unfortunately , we are all presumed to wear our jeans at our ankles now .
 Levi Strauss sold out ; and their Levi jeans are the worse for it . Thin material . Poorly made -LRB- by Egyptians . -RRB- Worst of all , they 've let &#34; fashion designers &#34; take over . Jean styles are now designed for the skinny , hang-down-your pants customer . The 505 fit , in spite of being called &#34; Regular , &#34; is not ; this &#34; updated version &#34; is not the sit-at-your waist , straight leg jean we all used to buy , wear and love . Levi has moved-on ; they 've changed their jeans ... and obviously , have decided to leave their existing customer behind .
 How on earth can you change the design yet keep the same name . Levis 505 jeans are not the same yet the company sells them under the same name ...
 I have not bought Levis brand in some time , in large part because of their discontinued support of the Boy Scouts . After more than 10 years , I thought i would try them again . Ordered my size that I have been wearing for 30 years and have bought recently in other brands like Lands End and Eddie Bauer . Got my levis and they keep coming down in the back , like they shortened the rise in the rear an inch . No problems with the same &#34; traditional &#34; fit in the other brands . So I do n't think it was me that changed.So when did Levis change their sizes for 505 's ?
 Sizes are cut small . Fabric is light weight and cheap feeling . NOT even close to working-weight quality . Wo n't last past a few washings . Maybe ok for lounging around the house instead of in your underware . Made in China .
 This product is cheep . The strings keep coming lose . I do n't know It seems like some thing you could buy at walmart since it 's so badly built .
 Dickies Men 's Short Sleeve Coverall , Medium Blue , 2X Large-RegularOrdered same size as before but crotch was about 3 inches lower.Washed three times in hot water - not much help.Maybe made in different country caused the difference.Quality good
 I ordered this for my husband . Never had bought or ordered one before . Was n't aware you do n't order the size of shirt/coat/tshirt presently used . This item ran really small . He could not even pull it up over his shoulders . Will make a gift for a much smaller family member !
 The wrong item was sent to me even though the shipping labell inside the packaging stated what I had ordered ! I had to ship it back and still have not received the correct item and missed the opportunity to give the gift on time .
 This wig came in looking truly horrible . It is basically a pink afro wig -LRB- for volume ? -RRB- with smooth pink hair on the top to make the style . The curly portion was impossible to tame , and the smooth top layer was patchy and ruffled from shipping .
 Although the wig came promptly , it was not at all like the photo
 Pros : -- Better than paper masks . -- It 's so light -LRB- under 2 oz . -RRB- , you hardly think about it . It 's also comfortable , as the straps are cloth and fully adjustable , and the filtering material is soft . The bottom strap uses Velcro , and the top has a non-Velcro adjustable ring . -- I wear glasses , and although they fog a tad if I get overheated , it 's no worse than paper masks . -- Has an imbedded aluminum strip in the nose area which can be bent to fit the user.Cons : -- When cutting treated timbers , I had been using an MSA Comfo Classic respirator , as that device seems to be 100 % effective in filtering out wood dust . Rather than using the bulky respirator , I tried a Dust Bee Gone mask - and coughed for several hours that evening , from dust inhalation . Have no idea how the dust was getting in , but it was . -- Absurdly over-priced . Should have sent it back on that basis alone . Worth $ 5 at best.Summary : I bought one of these sight-unseen , solely on the recommendation of Fine Woodworking magazine . It 's better than paper masks , but since it was n't effective with wood dust , it 's not useful to me . Bottom line - if you want effective dust protection , buy a decent respirator .
 I just recieved my Dust Bee Gone dust mask . I 'm dissapointed on the stitching on the mask . It was sewn poorly and the stitching by the nose came undone . For the price you pay for this product , it should come in perfect shape .

 These were fine for one time , but they got a hole in the toe after wearing them for about 3 hours . I liked the top though . It was nice not to have to deal with a garter belt .
 These panty hose were a bunch of garbage . They came with a run already in the very thin nylon . The only good thing about them , I was able to return them for free and get my money back . I would recommend purchasing the MUSIC LEGS 338 Spandex sheer suspender pantyhose instead .
 I think this shape wear has a bad design - the seam between the top and bottom part digs into your lower ab and makes it very uncomfortable . They should make the whole thing seamless . I have a Lipo in a Box capri and I love it - it 's seamless . I should n't have bothered with Flexees but I wanted to try because they had xs size . Lipo in a Box only has s.
 Created a weird crease on the thigh because it is too tight , does n't provide much tummy support . Does smooth the buns and love handles though .
 The Panty has 4 bars -LRB- .2 '' of approximate width -RRB- that are shown too much and easily it can be distinguished that a strip of this type is using
 This was a bit to big in the bodice for me and the cups did not fit as I hoped . I am a natural 32DD/DDD and I need much more support . Had to return .
 This bustier made pretty good cleavage , but the boning was awkward . It pressed in just under the bust to push up for cleavage , but then the boning stuck out at the bottom . The boning that went over the `` love handles '' to enhance the natural waist definitely enhanced the natural waist , but the love handles grew . I have a long torso , and even I could n't sit comforatably -LRB- especially when the boning in the front got caught on my other clothing since it stuck out so far -RRB- . So if you have an average or short torso , do not buy . If you have a long torso with very little plumpness on your body , I 'm sure this product will be perfect for you because it enhances cleavage well .
 I bought it to go under a bridesmaid dress but I could n't even wear it because it was too bulky . By the time I realized it the time had passed and I could n't return it . Now I 'm stuck with something I ca n't use .

 I used to love these socks when they were made of cotton . the new material used by wigwam is horrible . It is uncomfortable and just horrible . I sent them all back and threw away the one pair I kept to see if I could get used to them . Get a clue WigWam and bring back REAL COTTON !!
 I 'm disappointed . I wanted fleece lined jeans . I thought that was what I ordered . I do n't know if I 'll ever order this type of product again .

 I 'm 6 ' 10 '' and own a non-thermal lined hooded sweatshirt which fits great and should be identical to this one . It is not . Even though the thermal lined sweatshirt is 2X Tall , it is way too short in the back and is being returned .
 this jacket is not the same anymore ! i bought one of these in the 1990 's and if i knew that they were going to stop making them , i would have bought 5 of them then ! i wish i would have taken better care of my old one ! this jacket will not last like the old ones ! this is just another example of a company like carhartt , outsourcing their manufacturing of quality american made products and becoming foriegn made garbage , and still chargeing us as if they were paying a decent wage to an american worker , which i wouldnt mind ! this is the way of the future ! i feel bad for my kids !
 When the beret is held up u can see through it also u can actually tear apart the material .
 My fellow large-chested women know the drill
 This is a pretty bra , and I will say it is comfortable however I will not leave the house with this thing on . Talk about Torpedoes !! My husband , being his ever humorous self actually had the nerve to say `` burn that thing before you put an eye out '' ... great . I spent more than I should have on it without knowing how pointy the thing would be . This bra reminds me of that bra Madonna used to wear in her videos . I ca n't return it now that I 've tried it on and I am stuck with something I would n't be caught dead in . I 'm a 36DD so maybe this thing would be OK for a bigger gal but for me , I made a very expensive mistake . Ugh .
 I am a 40F and this bra although it is pretty does not hold or lift the girls up . I will be sticking with Goddess . This bra is good for night-time lounging around the house .
 Okay , before purchasing I ALWAYS look at the reviews and wonder if they are real or fabricated to sell the product . I am 33yrs old , have been top heavy since I was 12 and the girls did n't stop growing until my mid-20 's . Finding a bra that fit properly has always been a challenge and through the years I acquired tons of bras . I could never find the one that simply fit properly and did n't cost me tons of money . So , I bought this bra thinking it was the one and when I received it I WAS ECSTATIC , YAYY ! Until ... less than ten washes and the bra came apart . The material did n't hold together for anything , the material also pulls away from the exposed chest area making the bra seem loose.I am once again disappointed . If you would like a bra that gives a nice lift , not too expensive , but do n't mind replacing it several times and make your breasts look like the bra is too big for you , then this bra is for you ! Ladies who are top heavy do n't waste your time or money making this purchase .
 This product has no support at all . Very flimsy design . I hate it and would n't recommend it to anyone . After wearing a few times the back of the bra rides up . Very uncomfortable .
 It just fits weird . I thought it looked strange on the model in the white bra -LRB- see color selection photos -RRB- and assumed it was just that they had a full figure item on a not so full figure model . No , it actually fits this full figured -LRB- 44H -RRB- woman like that . That extra bit of fabric on the underside does not seem to be part of the cup or the band and causes an odd lumpy look.The side panel fabric is way too flimsy to offer any side support.Also , the bottom elastic band somehow manages to fit snug in the back and loose in the front . How is that even possible ? I mean snug and very loose . My engineer husband spent way too much time trying to figure this out last night .
 I think I would really like this bra if the seller decided to send me my correct size ! They do make boobies a tad pointy , but I like the way it lifts ! Good support .
 Not strong enough to hold up this size cup . Need stronger material.The woman said &#34; no support . &#34; Woman said bust not held up .
 I need a wire-free bra right now due to costochondritis . This definitely has the support , but turns the girls into a cone shape . It looked absurd under a shirt , so had to end it back .
 Not worth the 25 plus s & h paid for this . Bra is very uncomfortable !!! The cups are very separated making your breast very far apart . Also very pointy making breast look like cones . Did not like one bit
 this bra is very itchy , uncomfortable and a bad buy all around . i am a 48 F and ca n't find a bra that will support me comfortably . wish someone could make a bra for us bigger breasted women ...
 Would not recommend runs small ... stick uncomfortable pointy ... everything you do n't want in a bra ... it is not something I would ever buy again ! ~
 This bra may work for those of us with bullet or more pointy-shaped breats , but if your rounded , like me , this bra is ENTIRELY UNSUITABLE . Even ordering a cup size down , I would have had to stuff something in the nipple area just to fill out the pointed front of the cup . Weirdness ! And even if it had fit , the front seams are so obvious and unsightly that tee shirts are out of the question ! Let the Madonna jokes fly . This one went promptly back .
 The lining falls apart too fast . The ` uplift ' band crumbles over time . I ended up cutting the material under the arm and trying to empty it out . The straps are too short for a tall person , so the back keeps riding up and the gel shoulder pads position in front of the shoulder , not on top . A lot of money for such a poor fit .
 I was pleasantly surprised at how well this bra fit when it arrived ... great coverage in all the right places and very comfortable . However , after having worn it for a few weeks now , it really has `` let me down '' in the support department . It feels more like a sleep bra . I agree with other posters that for larger cup sizes , they should be using non-stretch straps for support . Also , the mesh netting on the back feels very thin and cheaply made , not offering the support it could . I would not buy this product again .
 Cup size not as generous as others I have had by glamorise . Returned another that was similar to brand slam . Looks pointy under garments .
 Would not reccomend ! No uplift ! No support ! Uncomfortable ! I am so sorry I ordered it . Will not be wearing it !
 The tabs that hold the interchangable lens break extremely easily . I broke each one by interchanging each no more than 3 times . Funky styled goggles , and a great concept , but extremely poorly executed manufacturing .
 I am very short-waisted and have been looking for `` undies '' that wo n't roll down at the waistband . I was hoping that since these panties had a wider waistband that they would not roll at the top . Unfortunately with my bodytype they do .
 I was really looking forward to receiving this sweatshirt , and when it did I was pretty disappointed . I ordered a 2x Tall and it fit me perfect , but it was the itchiest article of clothing I have ever bought . I was bummed too cause it was really nice , heavy and dutiable , but ultimately I returned it and got a refund .
 do n't like the thigh part is not long enough and it rolls unless you do n't pull it all the way up then it gaps between the leg .

 the molded plastic does not stay on the kid 's shoulders and as soon as my grandson raises his arms as if to fly , the cape drops down his back & the S shield pulls against his neck and chokes him . I am so disappointed . He would love it otherwise but will not wear it because it is painful . Do not waste your money .
 Fred the talking garbage can is cute , and I assumed because my son loved the broom he would love the garbage can but honestly , it scared him and he prefers to sweep and dump the garbage in the BIG garbage can . Not necessarily and engaging as the broom .

 This place sucks !! When contacted I was told to return it and i would get my money back , but not the right costume !!! Very upset with the service here !!!!!
 The description on the product was for the Grinch costume , however a `` jailbate '' costume was sent , I was not a satisfied customer at all
 ordered this costume and needed for a function , they sent a jail bird costume which turned out to be a department of corrections costume instead . Made several attemts to contact them and they never returned and responce . I would not recommend doing business with this company .
 Being a real Drill Sergeant , I bought this as a spare , but when I took it out the box ... WTF ? It 's a TOY ! If this was for a halloween costume or some bit , it would be perfect . So let that be a lesson , Kids ... do n't expect professional gear at what-ta bargain prices !
 This product I 'd listed as : FeltImportedWOOL FELTHIGHEST QUALITYAlso said : Product DescriptionOur American made military campaign hat . Made of all natural wool fibers , including a black chinstrap.What is n't stated is that the black chin strap is a very cheap plastic that distracts from the overall appearance of this hat . It makes it look as a costume piece and not a high quality hat .
 Junk !!!! Not quality for the military !! Flimsy bill , not the right color . . not even the right material ! Not to mention we ordered a size 6 and got size 7 in the mail !! i do not reccomend this product ! We returned it last week , and still have not got our money back for the thing !! waste of money !! Its more of a toy than anything although im not sure who would pay 70 $ for a TOY !!!
 Item arrived damaged . The company never reimbursed me for the postage I paid let alone the postage I paid to send it back . Would never deal with these people again .
 Not what I was expecting . It felt great but not the finish I was looking for.It was very ` old ladyish '' . Good service from this company .
 This jacket of very bad quality - it is inaccuratly made , everywhere stick out a thread , the cord in a hood is sewn up - to not pull out . Fasteners are sewn awfully-only half . I am very upset by this purchase , but unfortunately I can not send it back to the seller is very long

 I purchased this wallet in -LRB- nero -RRB- black on black and I was very disappointed with the quality for the price ! Also I never received a certificate of authenticity which was upsetting , Amazon did give me a small discount as they did not have another one to exchange it for but I even offered to take another color but they were sold out ! I just do n't think it was very good quality for Fendi !

 Product not what was expected , size seems to run very small ... hat not what was expected at all . . would keep shopping elsewhere for something made in U.S. if I were you . . I gave it to the kids to play with .

 Unable to wear them after the 1st washing . Stretched out at the waist . Size is right , Elasticity is gone . Definitely would not recommend or buy again .
 The size 8 is huge , at least 6 &#34; wider in the hips than the size 8 Olga I buy in stores . Do not trust the sizing !
 I love these Olga panties as they are the exact same style and brand I have used for years . However I checked the size of the ones I am wearing and they are the same size as my order . Absolutely , not the same . The new ones are so large I do n't even want to wear them . Seem to be missized . I washed them and they wash great but they are NOT my size . A bad purchase . Ca n't wear them .
 Bought these for some moderate shaping and comfort . Instead , I was wholly depressed by the ginormous granny panties that were so big and flimsy that I felt I 'd aged 30 years .

 I wear a size 12 normally and the large was too tight for me . These are really not cut very well at all and i am extremely disappointed that a size that should have fit amply did not and caused me an issue in returning the item.I think you should be able to rely on correct or market sizing .
 It looked better on the website , but they look cheap in person . If you ca n't fold a square this is a good product , but a real square looks so much better ...

 the shirt is ok but the skirt is weird . I do n't know if it 's the length and it just looks strange with her size but I never put it on her .
 Updated with info on the reordered pair ... Again a quality control issue . This time the waist fit ok , but the length was 2 inches longer than the other pair.I did n't believe all of the reviews about poor quality control until I experienced it myself . I am currently wearing a pair of these Jeans . I love them . They are super comfortable and fit great ; therefore , I ordered a 2nd pair in the exact same size.The jeans arrive and they do not fit right.If you get a pair that fits right , then the Jeans are 5 stars , but if you do n't then it 's annoying and frustrating -LRB- hence the 2 star ranking -RRB- . I have already reordered the jeans and will be returning the `` defective '' pair that I received . Yes , it 's annoying , but Amazon 's return policy makes it super easy .
 I just put on a pair of these today for Thanksgiving day . The seam on one leg is crooked and the waist is about an inch too large . I already removed the tags -LRB- my mistake -RRB- so I gues I 'll have to keep them but I wo n't purchase any more clothing from these people.I should have purchased them from a store like Sears . Live and learn I guess .
 The outside seam ends up on the top of my foot . I ca n't believe I have to start figuring out what brand of jeans to buy going forward . I 've had Levi 's for 40 years . Do n't buy 505 's online ! go get them at the store and make sure they fit and are free of defects !!!
 The new 505 Levi 's fit my husband but were tighter than his old ones . The most alarming development is that the fabric is so thin . I ca n't image these jeans lasting more than a year of moderate wear . Disappointing . I wo n't be buying Levi 's anymore .
 Great fit but did not like the washed out faded look . Description did not state that . I have 505 's and they did not look like them .
 I ordered these Levi 's size 42 '' x 29 '' . Not an easy size to always find . But they arrived with the tag that indeed listed the size as 42 '' x 29 '' . It tried them on . They seemed too long . I took them off and measured the inseam . It was 30 1/2 '' rather than 29 '' . I boxed them up and returned them . It makes me hesitant to order jeans online . Better to go in the store and try them on .
 Jeans were exactly what I ordered.But once I tried them on the left leg seam had a twist in it.The outside seam twisted to the front.I will continue to buy my Levi 's at Levi 's . Com .
 Had purchased from this retailer previously.The previous purchase WAS the original rigid , heavy jeans I had been looking for . This time , however , the jeans were much thinner and had the ` wrinkly ' look coming out of the dryer . I will be returning these . This IS a very good retailer , just do n't always expect the same quality .
 I always thought Levi 's were made in America . Sorry to find out they like many others -LRB- what used to be -RRB- quality products are not and lacking in quality and workmanship . These pants are thin materialed and will wear out in 3 months .
 wanted to open a claim , but this item is not an option . Today I received the package and was very surprised that I was sent a completely different color Tumbled Stretch -LRB- although the package has been correctly pointed out Good Old Blue -RRB- !!! Made in China , instead of Egypt -LRB- mentioned in the product description . -RRB- Return the goods can not , because he was in Russia and the transfer will cost several times more expensive than those jeans . This is the first time I was very disappointed by amazon.com and pondered whether to continue to make purchases -LRB- after the loss of my money and time -RRB- .
 Not sure why but the jeans I received were the wrong size.The tag on the jeans said the correct size but for some reason this pair is way off . -LRB- I have been wearing the same size for years and have another that fit properly . -RRB- No matter how many times I washed them they are still 2-3 sizes too big.Someone put on the wrong tag .
 What 's going on Levi 's ??? Are paying attention to our opinions ??? I am a good ` ol Levi 's costumer , buying tru Amazon and I was going to buy a 505 , but not after all these reviews ; I have used other models and in the last few years , the guys are right ! , manufacturing and materials have been changing a lot , depending on the place or country where the jeans were manufactured ; well our opinion are important , so what 's going on Levi 's , do you want us to quit ??
 The Levi 's were `` irregular . '' They do not fit at all like an identical pair I purchased at a retail outlet . Ca n't understand how they can get away with this . I ca n't even wear these jeans . A total waste of money . I washed them to see if the fit would improve . Did n't happen . Buyer beware .
 So , I tried on a pair of these jeans in a store . They fit great , so I ordered a pair online for a better price . They came , and they did not fit . I ordered one pair of these and one pair of different Levi 505 's . Those fit.Who knows why the fit is so variable . You 're better off getting a pair in a store .
 Asked for and received a pair of 33x30s for Christmas . Even after washing , the waist is a full inch larger than my previous 505s . Levis Customer Service confirmed that they are intentionally changing the sizing
 INCREDIBLY AWFUL pair of Levis . They either are `` seconds or thirds '' or somebody needs to find a new process for producing this product . The crouch is not sewn together correctly therefore the pant fits poorly . The seams/inseams do not match making each pant leg irregular . WOULD NOT BUY another pair of Levis this way ... really a poor product . There is absolutely no quality in this product ... hopefully others will read this and refrain from wasting their money . Levis are just not what they used to be ...
 Maybe some people can buy clothes online without trying them on , but for myself , that 's proven to be most difficult . These jeans were cut very different than the ones in the store . Be careful .
 If you are buying a pair of Levi 's because you are a loyal customer , do n't waste your time . They looked cheap and were paper thin . What a disappointment , sent them back .
 I have worn Levi jeans and other apparel for about 70 years . They first quit making the jeans without the matching white and blue seam which I can see was quite an added expense . They also Quit using real leather pocket tags , also very expensive . ` They then quit honoring the `` If they rip , we replace then '' . The material gradually became thinner and the jeans did n't last very long compared to the originals that were usually handed down to about the third child in the family . The last straw was this latest pair I puchased after several years of avoiding Levis and they now have only 5 belt loops which makes them hang between the loops and do n't look good at all . Basicly I 'm saying Goodbye To Levi jeans for good !
 Why would any seller send out an item with the security tag still attached . I emailed them with the problem and got no responce ! When I took the pants into a local retailer to have the tag removed , they assumed they were stolen jeans ! My advice ... buy locally and save yourself the harassment .
 These jeans fit very well . However , the fabric 's inside finish was extremely rough , making the jeans uncomfortable to wear . Comfort improved slightly after several washes .
 The color and weight of material was way inferior to what the stores carry . The price was no better than what stores advertise for their sale price . Either the pair I received was a second or was made at a different quality per Amazon 's contract with Levi .
 After levis discontinued the mens perfect fit 512 's i was ready to give up buying from levi strauss but decided to give the 505 a try and I 'm not happy . My first thought was these have to be a knock off brand made by some other company that simply puts a levis label on them . I am not saying they are , they just feel cheap , not like levis I have bought in stores . They are thin and feel like a poorly made denim material not the stiff denim i associate with levis of old . I washed them and wore them for a day . After 8 hours they had stretched so much they looked like they were two sizes to big and baggy . Not sure if these are the same as sold in stores but if they are levis has lost a long time customer ... . The only good thing I can say is that the shipping was fast .
 &#1056; &#1072; &#1079; &#1084; &#1077; &#1088; &#1085; &#1077; &#1089; &#1086; &#1086; &#1090; &#1074; &#1077; &#1090; &#1089; &#1090; &#1074; &#1091; &#1077; &#1090; . &#1050; &#1072; &#1095; &#1077; &#1089; &#1090; &#1074; &#1086; &#1086; &#1095; &#1077; &#1085; &#1100; &#1087; &#1083; &#1086; &#1093; &#1086; &#1077; . &#1053; &#1080; &#1082; &#1086; &#1084; &#1091; &#1073; &#1099; &#1080; &#1093; &#1085; &#1077; &#1089; &#1086; &#1074; &#1077; &#1090; &#1086; &#1074; &#1072; &#1083; &#1072; . &#1057; &#1086; &#1074; &#1087; &#1072; &#1083; &#1090; &#1086; &#1083; &#1100; &#1082; &#1086; &#1094; &#1074; &#1077; &#1090; . &#1064; &#1074; &#1099; &#1085; &#1077; &#1088; &#1086; &#1074; &#1085; &#1099; &#1077; . &#1041; &#1077; &#1088; &#1077; &#1090; &#1089; &#1086; &#1084; &#1085; &#1077; &#1085; &#1080; &#1077; , &#1095; &#1090; &#1086; &#1101; &#1090; &#1086; &#1074; &#1086; &#1086; &#1073; &#1097; &#1077; Levi 's .
 I bought 32/34 for my son for Christmas . . He is actually is 30/34 but I bought them bigger to give him a little room . They are about 4 sizes too small . Unfortunately since we washed them before actually trying them on I ca n't return them . . I doubt anyone would be able to fit in them . . Somehow they were mislabeled . . they say made in Haiti ?? I will be giving them to good will . . I will never buy these online again . .
 I ordered 3 pair of pants from this seller and got 2 very fast . The 3rd was to be shipped when they got it in , which was fine . HOWEVER ... I came home today and found 3 more pairs of pants ! I called them to see what happened and they said I placed two orders ! I told them I did n't and they HUNG UP ON ME ! I called back and went over the while story again and was told AGAIN I placed two orders ! I told them their own order slips show TWO DIFFERENT TIMES so there was no way they were both placed by me ! They refused to do anything about it ! I am now stuck with over $ 100 of pants I do n't need ! With as many more options as you have on the internet ... go somewhere else or get ripped off !
 Geez , ordered a single pair of jeans 3 days ago . Still in the process of shipping . Seriously how long does it take to package a pair of jeans and mail it?It 's not like this is a 50 inch plasma tv set.Amazon you are not on your game . *** EDIT *** Amazon customer service promptly resolved the shipping issue and the Levi 505s were delivered on time.HOWEVER , I had to send them back the next day !! The sizing on the label said 28/30 but was in reality more of a 30-31/30 size . They were freakin ' huge on me -LRB- I have a small waist -RRB- . In fact they were larger than the 29/30 505s I already own -LRB- unbelievable -RRB- . I even had a tailor measure them to prove I was n't crazy.Who ever is manufacture these jeans these days is `` out to lunch '' on quality control . All I have to say is check your sizing carefully folks when you order these . You may not like what you find.Thankfully Amazon refunded my money in full .5 stars to Amazon.com customer service!Less than 1 star to the manufactures of these 505 jeans , just terrible !
 I ordered these jeans on my wife 's Amazon account , I have been wearing Levi 505 's for over thirty years , and I must say that the pair that arrived today have got to be the worst jeans I have ever seen ... no , . . really . I tried to ignore all the 1 star reviews , but I should have heeded their warning . They arrived today , & I knew that they would , but kept thinking , as i picked up the box , this has got to be something else . There was no weight to it ... but low & behold , it was a new pair of Levi 505 's '' Made in Mexico '' , ... paper thin material . I think I could poke my finger through them , If i desired to do so . They got ta be kidding me ... These jeans probably are n't even worth $ 5 , let alone $ 40 . What a joke . Wo n't even be trying these on ... Back in the box , & back to Amazon is where these will go today ... I highly doubt these would survive a few spin cycles in the washer ... Might be useful to buff your vehicle ...
 Like a lot of folks , I too have bought and worn 505s for decades and now I wo n't buy them anymore . Not only did they change the fit , the increased the size of the back pockets so my wallet now rides down my leg . I can no longer carry my wallet in these jeans ... therefore I will no longer buy these jeans.And 1 other comment - anybody notice Levis reduced the amount of belt loops from 7 to 5 a few years back ? Another annoyance -LRB- cost savings -RRB- that I think changed the look and feel -LRB- I wear a belt so now the belt rides up a bit -RRB- . It 's a shame marketing folks do n't learn from old mistakes ... it 's business 101 . and if you do n't know what I 'm talking about , look up `` New Coke '' . Off to buy some crappier jeans -LRB- Old Navy ? Wrangler ? -RRB- but at least they 'll fit ...
 These ca n't be real Levi 's ?! ; the fabric is thin as a handkerchief and the stitching is cheap single stitched cotton thread . If I had the chance to feel these before buying of course I would NOT have bought them and bought the real thick Levi 's jeans . Costs more to ship back from here overseas than the jeans cost.Very disappointed in Amazon because these were sold through Amazon .
 The quality of the jeans is not the issue . I was not unhappy with the quality . The size is the problem . The jeans were marked 35 waist but clearly are at least a 38 . I always wash my husbands jeans before he wears them . By the time I washed the jeans there was no way that I could return them . I really did not notice that they were not the correct size until my husband tried them on . After at least 3 washings in hot water followed by a hot dryer they are still too big . So I am very disappoined .
 I love Levis and ordered a pair of these as weight lifting had made my slim fit 514 jeans a bit tight , so I figured these are the same cut , just not slim . However , I found these to be equally slim in the thigh . Jean fit is a rather personal thing , so it is n't that these jeans are bad . It is just that they are slimmer than I expect for a ` straight ' fit .
 I should have heeded the reviews that said that these jeans do not fit properly . I actually tried on a pair in a local brick and mortar store and they fit perfectly , -LRB- 40/30 's -RRB- so I thought I 'd try to save $ 20 by buying them online . Bad idea . The jeans ordererd through Amazon were a completely different fit . The ones in the store were made in Nicaragua and the Amazon jeans were made in Egypt . I have no idea if that has anything to do with the fit problem or not , but it 's a shame to see Levi 's destroying what USED to be a great AMERICAN product .
 I thought I just got a bad pair last time I bought these but now I see what the problem was . Also a bit of sticker shock at how much prices seem to have gone up in the last couple of years . Last pair I bought was at a Sam 's Club maybe 12-18 months ago for $ 27 . Never minded paying a bit of a premium for Levi 's in the past compared to other brands but even if they had n't changed the cut , I 'm not so sure they 'd be worth the $ 40 - $ 50 prices I 'm seeing now , especially if they 're being made in some offshore sweatshop . I never thought of these as designer jeans ; I just liked the quality and fit . Guess the company feels that it 's not profitable enough to also cater to the adult market . Good luck to them . As for myself , I think I 'll give Wrangler/Lee/Oshkosh another look .
 These jeans have changed in design ! We buy the same size Levi 's every year and these two pair that I just purchased are way too small . The waist and length is the same as always , but the thigh is way too tight . It barely fits over his leg ! Maybe they are trying to make skinny jeans . These are definitely not traditional 505 's . Very disapointed .
 The `` straight fit '' is complete awfulness -- the pants do n't fit in the waist correctly anymore , they do n't hold cuffs well . I hunt all over for the remaining regular fit 505s I love , and they are becoming harder to find.The new straight fit is absolutely awful .
 The following is an exchange I had with Levi Strauss recently ... You removed about 3/4 '' of material frombetween the top of the waist and the crouch on the men 's 505 `` Regular Fit `` jeans and you double labeled and re-labeled them `` straight fit '' . . -LRB- you haveboth labels on them !!! - very misleading !!! -RRB- ... and now they ride much loweron my waist and I ca n't keep them up ... or when I pull them up they choke mycrouch !!! I 've purchased Levi Brand for over 50 years and I never try them onand due to past consistancy , I have them hemmed 1 '' because I 'm an in-betweensize -LRB- I buy 38-32 -RRB- ... so now I 'm stuck with two-pair of Jeans I ca n't return -LRB- To Sears -RRB- and wo n't be able to wear ! Also , I 've looked for some of the `` oldregular 's '' but ca n't find them on the shelf any more . I also checked on theInternet and a lot of people are complaining about this same problem . Thedifference in the height of the waistband is clearly visable when you lay anold pair beside a new pair ; in the amount of material under the belt loops ... and is obvious where the bottom of the belt loops are now attached . And whileI 'm at it , the bottom of two belt loops -LRB- the ones on either side of the rearmiddle loop -RRB- pulled loose on the last four pair that I purchased -LRB- I now havethem pinned -RRB- . Would you like photos ? Folks , your quality and design is inreal trouble ! What are you going to do for me ??? Or should I just starttrying on other brands?Hi Richard , Barbara here from Levi 's . Thanks for checking in with us.The 505 style has been updated recently so that the waist and hips are straighter and the rise is slightly shorter . Now the fit is designed to sit lower on the hip . This means you will probably need to order a smaller waist size to get the same fit you have had in the past . If you choose to return your 505 jeans to our Consumer Returns Department , the inspector will exchange your jeans for the next waist size smaller . Levi Strauss & Co. updates many of our products from time to time to keep the line fresh and fashionable , based on demand from consumers and our retail partners.If there 's anything else we can help you with , be sure to email us back or give us a call at 1-800-USA-LEVI Monday - Friday from 6:00 am - 4:30 pm Pacific Time.Thanks again , Barbara , Levi Strauss & Co. , Consumer Relations , Case ID
 I purchased 4 pair of Levi jeans regular and 2 pair stone washed . None fit like the old 505 's I have . They were all about 2 inches larger in the waist and about 2 inches too long in the legs , and the bottom of the zipper is too low in the crotch causing the jeans to poke out like you have two or three pairs f socks in your underware . What a shame for a company that used to be known for providing great fitting jeans . I purchased a new pair of Wranglers and they fit the old 505 's . It is a sad day when someone who has been wearing Levi jeans since the early 60 's has to start buying Wranglers .
 I have purchased Levi 's 505 Regular Fit for 35 years . Much to my dismay , the most recent purchase I made turned out to be the newly improved Straight Fit . I could n't figure out why they kept falling down . When I called Levi 's said they would replace the pair I bought with a pair a waist size smaller . They seem to think if my pants are tighter it will keep them from falling off . Since I work in these jeans , moving around constantly , I like some ease of movement within the garment.The redesign from Regular Fit to Straight Fit consists of shortening the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband . I think it might be shortened as much as 2 or 2.5 inches . This makes it so the pants no longer sit at the waist , slightly above the hip bone which used to keep them from falling off.I am very disappointed in the new pants.My rating is really 0 stars .
 I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 jeans for more years than I care to admit . About a year ago I needed more new jeans so I ordered a couple pairs . They did n't fit quite exactly the way I expected them to , but they were okay . Last month there was this great sale on Levi 's jeans -LRB- on levis.com -RRB- , so I bought a couple more pairs . These new pairs really did n't fit - they were the correct length and waist size , but they were too long and didnt feel right . I wear 36/30 . I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 's in size 36/30 for years and years . So when I ordered a couple 36/30 , and they did n't fit , I was pretty surprised.I called Levi 's and asked about it . They said that they might shrink in the wash and that they would take them back for a full refund even if they had been washed . So I washed them . Several times . Though they did get shorter , they were still not short enough . And they did n't quite fit right in the crotch . So I held them up to my old jeans - they matched perfectly . I could n't find any difference at all , and yet they did n't fit . Well , I ca n't leave a mystery like that alone . So I laid them down on the bed , got out a tape measure , and I measured . I measured everything I could find , but nothing was significantly different from new to old . Then I flipped them over . Ah Ha ! I found that the new jeans were a full inch shorter in what is called the `` back center seam '' than the jeans I had bought just a year ago . This was the case on both pairs I had just purchased , even though the two new pairs were different colors and cloth weights . I then dug out a pair of 505 's from several years ago and found that the `` back center seam '' on that pair was 2 inches longer than the new pairs and 1 inch longer than the pairs I 'd gotten a year ago . That explains why the ones I had bought a year ago were n't quite right , but were okay , while the newest pairs , being of full 2 inches shorter in the back crotch really did n't fit right at all . As for leg lenth , since the inseam is supposed to be the length from the floor to the crotch , a shorter back center seam shouldnt have any effect , however , I can only guess that the short crotch was causing me to wear the jeans lower than I prefer , which somehow changed the effective the leg length . Because I wanted the legs shorter , I had to pull the pants up until they were binding in the crotch -LRB- does this make sense - not sure ? -RRB- In any case , they didnt feel right in the crotch and they were too long.This is disappointing for a number of reasons . First of all having jeans that I could simply purchase sight unseen , pair after pair after pair , is incredibly convenient . But it 's also disappointing because psychologically I think of Levi 's is something unchanging . Levi 's are Levi 's . Coca-Cola , aside from their momentary lapse of reason with new Coke , is Coca-Cola . Etc. . I dont want Levi 's 505 's to change . But strangely , the biggest problem for me with this change is related to the fact that Levi 's numbers their jeans styles . If they are going to change the measurements and design of the 505 , they should call it the 506 . Or the 505b . Or the 505 v2 . Or something . If they were always called simply the `` regular straight fit jean , '' it would n't be as big a deal to change it as it is when the product is called `` 505 . '' To me , psychologically , 505 's are 505 's are 505 's - if they 're going to change them , they need to start calling them 506 's . So I 'm sending my Levi 's 505 's back . I have no idea what I will buy in their place .
 I 'm completely exasperated , disgusted and hopeless . These are entirely unacceptable . There 's nothing `` good old blue '' about them . They 're made of poor quality `` denim '' that bears no resemblance to Levi 's good old denim . They look cheap and greasy , like some off-brand discount junk . In addition , they do n't fit . They 're almost 2 inches smaller than the stated waist size , as compared with the Levi 's 505 's of a couple of years ago . They 're essentially hip-huggers -- no room in the crotch . Worst , they 're made in China . I 'll spare the essay on Chinese trade and labor practices and simply remind readers of the frequent , nay , routine problems with the quality of Chinese-made goods , of which these are a prime example . I 've trusted Levi 's for over 40 years and have worn 505 's since the 70 's . No more . These represent the death of yet another great American brand . Without Levi 's in the market , whither blue jeans ?
 I 've been buying 505 's for many years ; I could hardly believe my recent order was supposedly the same product . The material is * much * thinner than it was even a couple years ago , and overall they look like flimsy knockoff copies of the genuine article . If you are considering buying these , do n't just take my word for it , look at the other reviews that discuss the dramatic recent drop in quality ; ignore these only at your own peril , like I foolishly did . The only consolation is that for $ 22 a piece , they are not such a bad deal for generic casual pants and as such I will probably not endure the hassle of returning them , but had I paid anything close to list price I would have felt royally ripped-off . They will certianly be the last Levi 's I ever buy , however . Too bad , it feels kind of like losing an old friend .
 Warning ! Levi 's changed the cut on it 's 505 jeans . Now they are more like hip-huggers . This happened about a year ago .
 I have bought many 505s over the years . In the last 2 months , Levis changed the name of the straight leg 505s to `` straight fit '' AND shorted the distance between the crotch and waistline by 2 inches . They are now low-riders . This was verified by a Levis rep I met at Macys . Guess they figure to save money by using less material . This is not just from Amazon but all original 505s are pretty much gone . If you want real dungarees to work in look elsewhere . Oh ... and try before you buy . This is my first and last online purchases of clothes .
 These are not the same jeans . Clearly Levis redesigned them . They are wider at the waist and are made to be worn lower . Beware , if you do buy them , try them on before you purchase and walk around in them -LRB- because they will fall down a lot -RRB- . If that 's what you 're looking for enjoy . I 've been loyal to this product , but it 's not the same so unfortunately I have to buy another brand of jeans now .
 I have been a loyal Levi 's customer since the sixties and have worn the 505 regular fit because they felt comfortable , were durable , and were consistently sized . I bought Levi 's because I like they they looked and liked the way they felt while working in them . That 's doing real work , not just walking down a street or into a bar . In the fall of 2011 I purchased 4 pair of the regular labeled 505 's but noticed they did n't fit right . Came to discover the fit had been changed by Levi 's , I assume to attract a new urban demographic . Levi 's used to be proud of their heritage as a working man 's jean . I suggest someone at Levi 's try doing some farm work , specifically try and split a load of wood with a maul while wearing a pair of the newly designed 505 's . Swing the maul , bend over and pick up the split wood , then stack it . See how many times you have to pull up the new jeans for each block of wood split and stacked . You will find it 's obvious the new 505 's are not designed by or for a real working man . I suggest you add a new cut to the Levi 's menu to address the needs of the urban population but please go back to your old cut for the 505 's before I have to change brands . Real men everywhere will thank you .
 I purchased these because my old 505 's finally needed replacing . When I took them out of the box , I was shocked to feel such thin material . Levis may charge the same high prices , but they 've cheapened the quality of their 505 's regardless of the fact they 're made in China . You can buy much better jeans with recognized names for less than half the price on Amazon or your local discount store . So be it for the name Levis in my book . A cheaply made product at a high price based on their ` Old ' reputation.I would have returned them immediately but I was leaving on a trip in a few days and needed them . I said I 'll keep them but never order Levis again . I wore them only once and noticed a flaw on the top of the thigh . This was a frayed circular flaw about 1/4 inch in diameter ... The kind of flaw that results in a hole after the first or second washing . They never should have passed their quality control.I 'm returning them to Amazon for a full refund . I do not recommend Levis . What a shame for a once great brand .
 I ordered two of these about a year ago . The reduction of seven belt loops to five was very inconvenient , with my belt constantly riding above my trousers at the left and rght rear . But what was really irritating was that I was constantly pulling up my pants . I thought it was just me , or that my shape had changed . Then I learned that the `` rise '' was now shorter than it used to be and that they ride lower , which does n't feel right and I do n't like . Maybe the young crowd likes this . I 've worn levis ' jeans for forty years , but I do n't like the new cut . Someone in their review mentioned Carhartt 's jeans , which I tried and they feel like the old levis . I just ordered another pair of them .
 I bought another pair of 505 this year . I have been using 505s 34x30 for 30 years or more . Unfortunately this time the fit was different . The waist was very loose . So I went to exchange them . I found out that the 505s are not REGULAR FIT anymore , but instead STRAIGHT LEG or REGULAR STRAIGHT LEG . At the store , they convinced me to get one size down -LRB- 33X30 -RRB- . They fit well at the waist , however when I tried to sit , they felt really tight in the crotch . I had to return them . I do not understand why Levi 's has changed the style on an icon jean . I believe they are going to loose a lot of the loyal customers that have been buying the same 505 REGULAR FIT for years !!!!!!!
 So annoying . I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 as long as I can recall . The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans , though . And they are terribly , terribly inconsistent . In the most recent instance , I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon , in different colors . What I 've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico , some in China , some in Bangladesh , etc. . And depending on where they are made , the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent . When I order these things , I want/expect them to fit the same way , every color , every time . Not an unreasonable expectation , I think . Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years . Evidently , though , like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip , opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality . Makes me frickin ' sad .
 I just bought a pair of `` 505 Straight Fit '' jeans and will have to return them . -LRB- They used to be called `` 505 Regular Fit '' but Levi 's no longer offers jeans so marked . -RRB- Levi 's has changed the cut of these jeans since I last bought them . They 're now cut to ride an inch lower than they used to , and have less waist definition -- OK if you 're fat , or if you like to wear your jeans six inches below your natural waist . Ghetto jeans , anyone ?
 My husband has worn these for as long as he can remember . Always a classic perfect fit . Now they changed the `` classic fit '' to `` straight fit '' & they are horrible ! They changed the waist to a low rise waist ... the waist was also ridiculously too wide ... The whole hip area looked baggy & unattractive ... . The waist rise is so low that it would be impossible to bend over without exposing your rear -LRB- plumbers crack -RRB- What a shame ... Bought 4 pair ... returned 4 pair . -LRB- fyi . . tags all showed Made in Mexico -RRB-
 If you like to show plumber 's butt and sing soprano , the new `` Straight Fit '' Levis 505 are for you.Some genius at Levis replaced the classic `` Regular Fit '' 505 's with the terrible 505 `` Straight Fit . '' I assure you , there 's nothing straight about them . Bad fit . Bad jeans . ... and do n't expect any sympathy from Levis inept customer service . They 're too busy counting your money .
 Like many others have said , the 505 is now called the `` straight '' fit from the `` regular '' fit with no information provided on why or what changes were made . Therefore you buy the jeans thinking it is the old style but it is not , this one is supposed to be a hip hugger jean I guess . Why Levis did not just come up with another number for these lowriders I do not know , but what you get with the new 505 is not what you are going to like wearing.I finally went with the Premium Performance Wrangler regular fit and it is fine . Too bad since I have worn Levis for many years , but no more . Plus the lack of rivets in the back , lack of belt loops . Just not a good product anymore.They say other Levi jeans will work , they do not work so I can only recommend to the buyers here to try them on at a local store before you buy a Levis product and be sure it is really what you want.LDW120
 What has happened to Levi 's ? Very thin material , have had several rip on the seam of the back pocket in less than 6 months . Even before they ripped , when I went outside on a cold day , it seemed to offer no warmth in the back end , like it had already ripped , but it had not yet . Not much luck with Wrangler either . I guess if you want good jeans nowadays , you have to pay up bigtime . These are not even close to acceptable . Prepare to be disappointed .
 They are now straight fit which means low rise . The closest to the Regular Fit are the 550 's . I returned these .
 they are not the same weight or quality I am used to getting at lord and taylor , I also got a pair in black and they are a twill not what I expected . I needed them for trip and took them and wore them , too much of a hassle to return . . thanks for asking
 My old 29x34s are much smaller in both waist and length compared to the new and returned 29x34s . What other brands are there that are really 29x34 ?
 The last purchase of these jeans was for something called regular fit . They are called something else now but the tag does not say what it is . The fit is lower on the hips . The material is also noticeably thinner so I doubt they will last as long .
 jeans with details of elaboration at the level of the boot is damaged sewing line is placed at the middle of the pants , I 'm not satisfied with the product .
 I ordered one pair of Levi 's and one pair of Wrangler jeans both 34 waist 30 length . The Wranglers fit perfectly but the Levi 's had to be at least 36x32 or larger . I thought they could n't be that mislabeled so I washed them to see if they would shrink . They did n't . I guess thats what I get for ordering clothes on-line instead of trying them on at a store . Thank you for asking . Phil

 These pants are NOT authentic Levi 's ! They are cheap Chinese knock-offs . They do not fit at all like any other Levi 's 505s that I have purchased from a local brick and mortar store or have worn over the past 25 years . They are defective , as well , akin to outlet store items .
 nunca llegaron a destino final ok , devolucion ahora retirar el producto de la puerta principal donde lo dejaron por error .
 I was a loyal Levis wearer for decades . I even put up with the `` coolness tax , '' the higher price that Levis command only because of the famous brand name . Those days have passed , though.The `` new '' 505s are made from something a lot lighter and less durable than before . It seems like only a few weeks before the back pockets blow out , forcing me to buy again . In fact , older Levis with the heavier material are in better shape than the new ones , with less wear on them . A well-known competing brand still uses the heavier cloth , so that 's where I 'm buying now . If Levi went back to something more rugged , I might consider buying them again - but I really do n't have time or patience to go around checking all the features of all the brands . I 'd rather just go to the store , buy what I know , and be done with it.Bye-bye , Levi . We had good times together , but that 's the past . I have a future to get on with . -- wiredweird
 The belt is attached to the buckle by two tiny screws . One of them fell off a month after the belt was bought , rendering the whole thing almost useless . A little later the paint on the buckle started to chip away , exposing the true color -LRB- brass -RRB- of the buckle , giving an uncomplimentary look . Definitely would not recommend it .
 In the last year or so these jeans were changed from regular fit to straight fit . This new fit appears to be intended for someone with no butt . The rise in back is lower as well . I 've been wearing 505 's for decades , but when I tried these new jeans on they were instantly uncomfortable . I have returned them for a refund .
 Levi 's has replaced their 505 regular fit jeans with this abomination , which is a completely different product . The straight fit jeans are not cut the same as the old regular fit jeans and you can not trust the size . Worse , they only have five belt loops instead of seven , so they do not stay up . The fabric used is also inferior to the original 505 regular fit jeans . Before ordering , be sure to have a look at these things in a store to see if this is really what you want to purchase . Levi 's had better figure out a way to sell these to the teeny boppers because their customer base sure is n't going to buy them .
 Levi changed their size specs on the traditional 505 . The `` straight '' 505s have a shortener rise , and are smaller in the hip and leg . The old style fit my husband perfectly - a no brainer when it came to shopping . The new `` straight '' cut is awful . If Levi wanted to introduce another fit , then why not give it a different number and keep the sizing the same on the tried and true 505 . You 've lost a customer with this change .
 After many years of buying the same Levi 's - 505 regular , 38 X 30 , these new jeans are a different cut and the leg size was at least 3 inches too long . I had to return the jeans and will have to move to another brand . Great pity as I really liked my old Levi 's .
 For the past few months since I bought my new jeans I just thought I was in between sizes . Turns out they changed them . No longer do they work , they just go around your waist like some sort of low cut girl pants . Tightening your belt does n't really help either . I thought to myself , `` I do n't want my pants to change every month on some whim of some designer who thinks they know what 's comfortable and what makes me feel like me ... I 'm going to go with a classic ... Levi ... If I find the pair that works for me they wo n't change , they will be here later . '' Wrong . Comfort and pants fitting are apparently unimportant . What is important is pandering to a perceived money base who use their jeans for standing around and looking in a way , not for people who have to bend over and lift anything because the new versions fall down .
 I read the bad reviews but stubbornly decided to order these jeans anyway -LRB- 505 tumble rigid 31x32 -RRB- . And , just as others had warned , the size did not match other levi 's I own . My simple advice
 What is wrong with you people ? I have bought and worn 505 regular fit jeans all my life . Now for some unknown reason you have decided to discontinue this very cut . The closest I can get is the straight cut and they suck . They are crotch bound and uncomfortable . They are designed for the people who wear them around their ass . No thank you , you have lost a good costumer .
 I have been wearing the newer Levi 's `` Straight Fit '' tag for 6 months now , and i am ready to give it up for good!I just pulled out my older worn out `` regular fit '' pre `` straight-fit , '' patched up the hole and i 'm wearing them again until i can find a new jeans brand . The waist is too low on the new `` straight fit . '' If you hold them up next to each other , the straight fit has a shorter fly . My ass is hanging out . . and i 'm a tall fairly skinny guy . There 's no snug support anymore . What happened to my 505 's ??? Levi 's has spread themselves too thin . They seem to have gone quantity over quality . At first i thought , `` they can screw around with all of those foolish looking jeans as much as they want , as long as they 're consistent with the good old 501 , 505 , 517 . . , '' but the foolish experimentation has gotten out of hand , and now the 505 's have been tainted . IMO Levi 's needs to cut the fat . Go back to the durable , traditional , simple line-up , and then only add a handful of other options for the made to last a month spandex type . Levi 's has screwed around too long , and now it 's just screwed up . I 'm sad to not be able to wear them anymore . But I want quality , long lasting products , that 's what brought me to Levi 's two decades ago , and now , that 's what 's going to make me leave .
 Levi 's are taking the micky , they have completely changed the 505 jeans and now they are something else ... I have more than 2 % body fat so I would look like a fool in these low cut genital revealing jeans.Well I guess Levis feel the need to change the demographic of their customers , and as such I should just get my butt over to the stores and try some new brands ...
 Returned these because my son wanted the Regular fit - these were not it - they are n't the same and did n't fit him high enough in the waist
 The redesign shortens the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband . I compared them to an older pair of Jeans and it looks like they loss an inch . If you like the way Levi 's use to fit , you will now feel like they fall off your rear , and are tight in the crotch . I 've worn these for 20 years , and have now switched brands . Bad move Levi 's !
 I was very dissapointed with my new 505 jeans . These are obviously a different design from previous 505 's and I am wondering if Levi Strauss could just tell that us before we buy -LRB- or give the new design a new number -RRB- . With this purchase , I have lost all confidence in their abilitty to deliver a consistant product .
 I DO N'T CARE WHAT IS POSTED WHAT KIND OF REVIEWS LEVIS GET . THE 505 LEVIS HAVE CHANGED OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS . THEY NO LONGER EVEN FEEL LIKE BLUE JEANS ... THEY ARE MORE LIKE DENIM SLACKS . I HAVE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR PAIR LEFT FROM ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO ... EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE HOLES IN THE KNEES AND POCKETS ARE FRAYED , I WILL WEAR THEM INSTEAD OF THE BRAND NEW 505s I HAVE IN THE CLOSET . i HAVE BEEN WEARING 505 LEVIS FOR THE PAST 35 TO 40 YEARS ... AS SOON AS MY OLD FADED AND FRAYED JEANS ARE FINALLY GONE ... I WILL HAVE TO FIND A DIFFERENT BRAND ... WRANGLER , LEE 'S -LRB- god forbid -RRB- OR EVEN RUSTLER BRAND AT WALMART . THE `` NEW '' 505s ARE NOTHING LIKE THE OLD ONES ... THE CUT , THE MATERIAL OR THE QUALITY THEY ONCE WERE ... I DO N'T KNOW IF EGYPT IS SCREWING THEM UP OR IF LEVIS HAS SCREWED UP BUT THEY ARE LOSING A 40 YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH ME . IF THERE WAS A 0 RATING THAT 'S WHAT THEY WOULD GET FOR THE `` NEW '' 505s THE OLD ONES WOULD GET A 5 STAR RATING ... BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS ... THANKS LEVI CORPORATION !!
 Apparently the same jackass who introduced us to `` New Coke '' in the 90 's must have gone to work for Levi Strauss . From the posts I 've read , the replacement of the regular fit 505 jeans with the `` straight cut '' lower waist version seems to have ticked off many customers including myself . I 've been buying Levis since the '70s . Now I am forced to buy another brand . They could have kept the regular fit and introduced the straight fit separately . I guess when the jerk was finished at Levis , he went to work for Apple developing Final Cut Pro X , but that 's another story .
 The jeans above the knee are nice , good quality and fit.The problem is that somewhere `` along the line '' the meaning of `` straight fit '' has changed . It used to mean that you bought a pair of normal jeans . What `` straight fit '' seems to mean now is that if you order this style you 'll end up with what closely resembles the ridiculous bell-bottom pant legs from the '70s . So anyone out there looking to order just a `` normal '' pair of jeans go for the slim or regular fit . Btw , the pictures DO NOT show just how '70s the Straight Fit pant legs are .
 I will not buy Levi 's on line again . The cuts are never the same fit for the same size . But I do like Levi 's
 Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit JeanI have been wearing Levi 's 505 's for years . Recently they changed the fit from `` at the waist '' to `` below the waist '' . They are uncomfortable . I feel like I need to pull up my pants all the time . I wo n't be buying any more of these .
 I have been wearing Levis 505 jeans for years . I bough these and immediately noticed that the material quality is not as good as the ones I bought over a year ago . This material was thinner and not as comfortable . I also noticed that the fit is not the same as the old 505s -LRB- these are the same size I always wear -RRB- . What 's up Levis ... . It looks like my next jean purchase will not be Levis brand !
 Sad day when a pair of `` classic '' Levi 505 's are the most uncomfortable pair of jeans I 've ever owned.Not sure why the company just could n't come up with a different number for these new low rider jeans and leave the 505 's alone . I 've worn no other jeans since the 70 's , but unfortunately it looks like I have to move on to some other brand .
 From your page : `` Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit Jean `` These are not the same thing , nor are they the same jeans . `` Regular Fit '' 505 jeans were discontinued by Levi 's . Their replacement is the `` Straight Fit , which among other things , has less belt loops and does n't seem to fit worth a damn . Please , Amazon , at least fix the wording , there is no such thing as `` 505 Straight -LRB- Regular -RRB- Fit '' Levi 's . I would gladly buy 2 pair of regular fit 505s right now , but there are n't any , so I had to buy a used pair off of ebay.After that wears out , I guess I 'll go naked . I 'll never buy what they are currently selling . Some things should nto be messed with . Levi 's 505 regular fit jeans were great the way they were .
 Agree with the other reviewers who criticize the way they fit -LRB- do n't fit -RRB- at the waist . While they feel and generally fit like quality Levis , they are more low-rise than I expected or like and I am constantly pulling them up . .
 Levi seems to have changed the cut - I always bought 505s , but my latest pair is far lower accross the backside and does n't fit . No more levis for me .
 I have the same problem as every other person providing feedback . The `` Regular fit '' fit me great . The straight fit fall off my rear and I am constantly pulling them up . As soon as I can find another pair that fit right I will switch and never buy Levi again . You can take your hidden price increase and shove it .
 We were disappointed to find this pair of Levi 's 505 significantly bigger than a pair of 505 straight fit we bought last fall for my husband . He is tall and slim -LRB- 34 Waist 36 Inseam -RRB- . That is so hard to find so were delighted with the first pair . The new pair required $ 70.00 alteration to take them in to the measurements of the first pair we bought .
 I bought black 505 's in December 2011 that were made in Mexico . They are great , so I bought another pair . The latest 505 's may as well be another brand , they are so different . They are overwashed , really shrunken down and noticeably faded . Poorer stiching as well . I want my new jeans to look NEW . These are `` Made in Lesotho '' . Beware .
 I bought 3 pairs . 2 size 30x32 -- rigid and tumbled rigid , 1 size 31x32 tumbled rigid.The rigid pair fits much larger than the tumbled rigid , even though they are tagged the same size . MUCH larger , like two sizes larger . The 31x32 tumbled rigid are made in egypt , had root beer or something sticky inside the bag , had a bent zipper , and are 2 inches SHORTER than the same style in 30x32 . I think levi 's is way too big to have any kind of real quality control . I 'd rather just pay > $ 100 and get a nice pair of selvedge denim I 'll have for years to come .
 Levi 's denim is so thin now , they tear at the crotch given the slightest stress . They look nice . Just do n't jump , squat , climb , run fast , leap , dance , ride a bike , or any other physical activity . I thought I had gotten a defective pair , but four pairs from different stores tore in the exact same place in less than a month of wear . Such a shame for what was once a great product . I 'll stick to Wranglers which do n't look nearly as good as Levi 's but they last forever at half the cost .
 I have been a Levi 's guy all my life , 58 years . Just like most I started with 501s and as I got a little older and wider moved on to the next most comfortable version . I 've now been wearing 505 and 550 for almost 5 years . While I 'm not going to put the actual size in print , I have been really pleased with the consistency of sizing over the years ... until last week when a pair of black 505s arrived at my door . As always I dumped them in the washer immediately to get rid of the new look and feel -LRB- cold wash , low temp dry as always . -RRB- The next morning I put them on and at first they felt a little tighter than usual . I thought , well maybe I 've put on some weight around the middle recently ... it happens . Well , I SUFFERED all day at the office as these jeans cut me in half . As soon as I got home , I pulled out a flexible tape measure to see what was up . To my surprise , this pair was 1.25 inches smaller around the waste than every other pair I own . Same brand , same model , same size ... except it was n't . So where does this story end . I sent the jeans back to Amazon the next say explaining the problem and as always Amazon sent me a full refund . This is why I do so much business with this great company . They put the customer first . I have since ordered another pair which arrived yesterday . I 'm hopeful that the new pair will actually be the size ordered and that the original pair was a fluke . Some guy on the other side of the planet where Levi 's are made is probably still laughing about the crazy American who got the tight jeans that he mislabeled . I guess it is sort of funny .
 The denim material is fine but the pants have too few belt loops , which causes the pants to sag in the back when you wear them .
 Levi 's thinks they can change the cut and quality of their jeans without losing customers . By shortening the rise to accommodate younger customers , they will lose those of us who desire comfort.Also found out that they produce different quality and sized jeans for different stores . Will be looking for a different brand for my next purchase .
 What you read in recent reviews of Levi 505s is true - they have changed the sizing a LOT & your old size wo n't fit you anymore.For years I 've bought 33 x 32 . I never even bothered to try them on - they always fit nicely . Sadly the last 2 pair I bought fitpoorly - the problem , as many others have pointed out is that they ride too low on the waist . I 'll be shopping for Lee or Wrangler next time I buy jeans .
 Just because it says &#34; 505 &#34; does not mean it is like the same old 505s you used to wear . True , these are cut the same , but the weight of the fabric is maybe half that of my older jeans . I suppose the lesson is that books can be purchased online , not clothes .
 Apparently the &#34; straight &#34; fit has consumed &#34; regular &#34; fit . You ca n't have straight -LRB- regular -RRB- fit as described in the description . They are two different styles . Unfortunately , we are all presumed to wear our jeans at our ankles now .
 I have not bought Levis brand in some time , in large part because of their discontinued support of the Boy Scouts . After more than 10 years , I thought i would try them again . Ordered my size that I have been wearing for 30 years and have bought recently in other brands like Lands End and Eddie Bauer . Got my levis and they keep coming down in the back , like they shortened the rise in the rear an inch . No problems with the same &#34; traditional &#34; fit in the other brands . So I do n't think it was me that changed.So when did Levis change their sizes for 505 's ?
 Ordered 32 &#34; X 29 &#34; 505 Levi 's . Always a given - great quality great fit - well not anymore . These were manufactured in a country I 'd never heard of ??? and the fit was terrible . I ordered a 32 waist and what I received was more like 33 ' or perhaps even 34 &#34; . Buyers beware . I 'm glad amazon has a nice return policy .
 I have worn the same size and style of Levi 's jeans for 20 years . I ordered a pair of jeans and shorts from this vendor . Since they arrived with the same label as the rest of my jeans , I just assumed that they were like the rest in my closet . I washed them and put them away without trying them on . BIG MISTAKE . When I did get around to trying them , what I had was two ridiculous garments with waist sizes easily 2 inches larger than all the other 32 's in my closet . They were so baggy that I could barely keep them on . Since I 'm not a 14 year old with an IQ equal to his age , I prefer not to wear pants that fall off my ass . It cost me more than I initially paid to have the jeans and shorts altered . Unless Levi has just assumed that we all want to look like idiots or they have introduced vanity sizing because so many Americans are obese , I ca n't understand why the same style and size on the label does n't match the same cut of jeans that I have previously purchased . Lesson learned , do n't buy jeans that you do n't try on in the store . No more online purchase of this product for me .
 I 'm disappointed because I ordered the pants but the size is correct does not match the size that is smaller
 Heads up on the fit -LRB- regular , original , etc -RRB- descriptions . Unclear why Levi 's felt compelled to alter the fits on these long established styles -LRB- 501 , 505 -RRB- but they did . What you used to buy is not what you 're getting . Could n't find a notice or explanation on any Levi 's site , so you 're on your own .
 Dear Levi 's , You used to have the best product on the market . As one other person said , `` you can walk in , know your size , pick up 3 pairs , and walk out '' and know that each pair was perfect . Now it 's like wearing a sheet from your bed , they are so thin and cheap . They suck ! They might as well put a strectch band around the top!There is hope . You can gain back millions of customers if you go back to the original syle of the 80 's and people WILL pay more , if they are good quality again . Then , you market the crap out of them saying how you chose to back to quality and watch the money roll in . Until then , I will go somewhere else . To cap it off , what do you say you manufacture it in the US !! GOOD LUCK , I 'LL BE WAITING !!
 The jeans appear to be real levis , but they are so thin it is like I 'm wearing nothing at all . You can see the color of my boxer underneath . It is true it has been a few years since I bought myself a pair of jeans , but holy cow are these thin .
 these jeans are made very small , i wear 33-32 and they are not even close , i ` ll be sending them back ... they do n`t make them as good anymore ...
 Use it about one mounth . Always uzipping fly , need to check it . Sometimes it causes severe discomfort , becouse I do not notice it and walk with open `` shop door '' !!! So good jeans , but not good fly . Hope it ` s happend only with me .
 I purchased these because I thought I could always count on Levis for consistent sizing and quality . Unfortunately , this is no longer the case . The pants -LRB- 33 x 32 -RRB- are about a size too big and the fabric is much thinner , so I know they wo n't be lasting as long as the old pairs .
 Only five belt loops instead of seven . I 'm switching to Wrangler . Should 've read the reviews first . But hey , who would 've thought they would decrease the amount of belt loops ? I bought a pair of Levi 's two years ago and they have seven loops . But I lost two inches in the waist and was planning on buying a few more pair of jeans . I hope the manufacturer reads these reviews . The people who decided on the amount of loops made a dreadful mistake . Goodbye Levi 's . Hello Wrangler .
 When I bought the jeans they seemed to be a good price . I received them `` on time '' and right away something seemed wrong , they stunk ! They smelled like they had been in sewer water . Were these made in a 3rd world country and washed in a polluted river ? The first thing I did was throw them in the wash . More bad news , they bled so badly that the rest of the wash was stained blue ! I had to run the wash several more times . The good news is that the pants did n't stink anymore , the bad news is that several articles of light colored clothing were ruined.On the bright side , they fit well and look good .
 The first set of jeas were the wrong size but still waiting for the revised size . Should be today or next week .
 I bought a pair of Men 's 505 Straight Fit , Blue Collar jeans made by LeviThis is not your father 's Levi 's , or even mine . Something bad has happened to this brand name . The sizing is all wrong , I had to buy a pair 4 inches smaller than my normal size for it to fit right . The material is thin , flimsy and clearly different than the full , sturdy Levi 's of the past . You could buy a pair and were certain that they were indestructible . Now they seem to be made from a fabric that you would make pajamas from.What has happened?Harry Lime

 Ladies and GentlemenI politely inform you that since I start my shopping over the Internet through you had no problem with the products supplied , though two of the pants I purchased with this latest purchase came with defects in order to use them because the outer and inner side lines of these pants because they have defects in their court and do not stay in place and therefore can not use the same lost by giving purchase to have no complain but given that I have requested to report thereon , and not interest me that I returned merchandise credited me or give me money but I guarantee full power to do my shopping in a safe and efficient
 My old levi 's 505 are made in the u.s.a. are tight fitting and ready show off my bulge and theses low quality levis are too loose fitting when they should be tight I even have to wear a belt with these 505 .
 As others have stated , these are not the same ol' Levi 's . The fit is terrible , the material is thinner and the quality is nowhere near what you would expect from Levi 's . I have started to look at Lee and Wrangler as replacements . Also , Harley Davidson now has a line of jeans that are better quality and better priced ... and since I own two Harley 's , it seems like the way to go .
 I ordered this pair having worn 505 's for years . I did n't keep the return paperwork and put them through the wash . When wearing them the first time I noticed that they are sized bigger than 38 in the waste.I would guess a full inch bigger . I now have add Levi to the do n't buy list .
 I bought size 40 but this pant it is two sizes biggerIt is not my first Levis but it is my first time with thisproblem with the size .
 The trnsaction was a nightmare.I ordersd a pair of jean , the same style and size Levis that i have beenwearing for many mnay years . When i received the product , since theywere the same style and size , I washed them . Lo and behold theyshrunk so much that i could not wear them or worse yet , return themI did call the Levi corperation , and they told me that you sold discountedpants that they had discontinued or material that had been phased out.they said that they would never sell those products.So you see that the whole Amazon transaction was a nightmare for me , and there is littlereason that you should send me announcements for `` denim sales '' . I 've already been had.Please ackowledge receiptLouis L Ferrario
 The jeans I purchased fit very strangely ; they were a bit long and the waist was n't cut right at all . I kept thinking they would shrink a bit in the wash but they have n't . I 've purchased 505 Levi 's Straight Fit for many years and am familiar with how they should fit . These are not made correctly at all and I do n't really like them . I wo n't purchase these online again for that reason . I purchased online this time because even though I live in the home city for Levi 's , I have trouble finding my size as I am at one end of the size range .
 Hey I love Levis 505 Straight Fit , for the perfect way it sits on me , but for some reason this pair that i just got , not only did n't it sit like all other pairs I have , it also felt different a little thicker than I normally like it . Beside that it 's fine , the shipping came earlier than expected so thanks for that !
 i am sure you hear this all the time , they do not make them like they used to . . the delivery was prompt and handled professionally , just wrong size , at all.has worn the same size for 30 years , oh well . .
 I received these pant I am totally disapointed with Amazon / Levis due to the color is totally different what I expected . I bought one of this pant some time ago and it is the same color of the picture , now I bought the same Ridgid color and it is totally different , it is lighter . Adittionaly the size is incorrect 32x32 looks like 34x34 . Return this item is a thurny issue for me.Luis
 I bought two pair of jeans . One pair fit great . The other pair had legs obviously two inches longer than the other pair .
 I am very disappointed with these jeans . The fabric is very light . I have been wearing 501s and 505s for years and never seen anything like this . The only reason I am giving them two stars is because I am wearing them . I guess next time I need some new Levis I will need to go to the -LRB- shudder -RRB- mall where I can touch before I buy .
 I spent the greater part of my teenage years and twenties trying to find the perfect jeans . Finally I found them with the 505 Regular fit . Then , about five years later , they changed the fit !! The new 505s , called `` Straight fit '' , are too tight in the legs and butt area , whereas the old ones gave you a little room . It 's night and day as far as comfort is concerned . I wish Levi would stop messing around with what works . Another example is the Silvertab , which also were great , but discontinued .
 levi these used to be some of my favorite jeans they fit around the shoe perfectly so it wouldnt rip on the bottom , they gave me enough leg room to move freely and willingly in any direction , they had 7 thick durable belt loops that held the pants over my butt perfectly , and they where made with a a tough 12 ounch jean material . NOW on the other hand you guys have made the exact opposite !! im so freaking pissed off at levi for discontinuing all levi jeans that are worth buying for top dollar , you have lost so many customers because you decided to sell out and give us crap that is only made for the fashion obsessed morons out there that would actually buy something so poorly made . its like buying fast food in comparison to real food , its just plain crap all the way around . you guys made the belt loops so thin they will snap in a month , the jean material is alot thinner , the fit is strange , to tight much bigger waist then you advertise which also makes you guys liars on top of every other thing ive mentioned , GET YOU DAMN ACT TOGETHER AND STOP THINKING ABOUT MONEY , on the other hand . . if money is the only thing you guys can understand then you would know that more then half the population goes for durability and well made products then cheap fashion thrills just to make yourself feel better . well guess what levi we arnt all that self concious ! there are some of us out there that actually work hard for every penny we get and dont think we deserve to pay top dollar for such poorly made peaces of crap . bring levi strauss back to america where it belongs since the 1800s !! im going for carhartt now because they care about the average buyer . your products make me sick to my stomach . you should be ashamed that your still using such a well known name such as levi . . you should just call it crap for now on . unless you go back to the way you used to make the jeans . IF NOT BETTER !!! so do it ! if you dont ill just switch to carhartt and leave my business with you in the past .
 Levi Strauss sold out ; and their Levi jeans are the worse for it . Thin material . Poorly made -LRB- by Egyptians . -RRB- Worst of all , they 've let &#34; fashion designers &#34; take over . Jean styles are now designed for the skinny , hang-down-your pants customer . The 505 fit , in spite of being called &#34; Regular , &#34; is not ; this &#34; updated version &#34; is not the sit-at-your waist , straight leg jean we all used to buy , wear and love . Levi has moved-on ; they 've changed their jeans ... and obviously , have decided to leave their existing customer behind .
 How on earth can you change the design yet keep the same name . Levis 505 jeans are not the same yet the company sells them under the same name ...
 After one washing two of the belt loops have detached . Really poorly made jeans . Very disappointed . Will never order jeans again on line . After this experience will have to see the jeans before purchasing .
 I purchased 2 pairs of different colour this very same size from this same company1 year ago . This year I ordered the very same colours and size and niether of them fitThey are both too tight . . What is up with that ?!!!
 I ordered a size 35x32 . And that is what the tag said it was when it arrived . But , they were not a 32 length . They were about 2 to 3 inches longer ! I was surprised by this , because Levi has always been good with sizing . I would normally be able to order my size and have no problems .
 For as far back as I can remember , I have been a loyal Levi Strauss customer . I never understood why anyone would buy blue jeans from anyone else , but today I am questioning that loyalty.As a result of some successful changes in my diet , my old blue jeans have become too large for me , so I purchased 2 new pairs of 505 jeans and a new pair of 505 shorts . I have noticed myself hitching up my newer , snugger jeans more often than my older , looser jeans . This afternoon , I specifically noticed that my shorts kept slipping under my belt -- as though they did n't have enough belt loops.This evening I compared my new jeans with my old jeans , and lo and behold , I discovered that Levis have gone from 7 belt loops to 5 . Five belt loops are n't enough.The other posts I have seen about this product are focused on globalization-related issues . I , too , hate to see American jobs move overseas , but this particular problem has nothing to do with country of origin . Regardless of where the jeans were manufactured , Levi Strauss has cheapened the design specification , and they seem to be waiting to see if anyone notices.Dear Levi Strauss : I noticed . Your product is not as good as it used to be.I ca n't remember being this upset about a product change since the introduction of `` New Coke . '' I do n't drink much Coca Cola any more . -LRB- That may be part of the reason I need smaller jeans ! -RRB- Please put back the missing belt loops .
 I 've been wearing Levi 505 's exclusively since the early 70 's . They fit me perfect . I could just walk into a store and pick up my size and buy without trying them on . Best jeans around.Well not any more ! Without any notice they have changed the `` Regular fit '' 505 's to `` Straight fit '' jeans which means they are no longer 505 's at all . The waist is larger , the crotch is higher and you must now wear them down on your hips as kid do with their jeans . These are no longer meant for adults or anyone who wants pants that fit properly . I also do n't like 550 relaxed jeans as they are too baggy.I 'll be looking for a different brand and returning the two pair I just bought . Hopefully Levi will lose enough faithful customers to make them rethink this rude abandonment of loyal customers .
 I 've been happily buying and wearing 505 Regular Fit jeans for many , many years . I did not notice before submitting my most recent order that Regular Fit has been replaced by Straight Fit . But , boy , did I notice a change once they arrived . These are n't the same jeans at all . The fabric is less substantial and - most disheartening to me - the rise is a good inch lower than it used to be . That is , the waistband sits lower on the hips . They feel wrong to me , like I need to pull them up all the time . And they feel cheap . I ca n't wear them.In my opinion , Levi 's should have been more forthright about this change . This new jean should have received its own new model number and they should have retired the 505 number entirely . Because these are not , in any manner that 's important to me , anyway , 505s . Now I have to find another brand of jean whose waistband sits up at my waist where I like it . What a hassle . So very disappointing.Levi 's , you screwed up .
 I have worn Levi 's 505 Jeans for 25 years . I even have a box of `` 34 's '' in the attic for when I lose a couple of pounds.I just sent back 2 new pairs of these jeans because they no longer fit as the other pairs I own . I called Levi 's to find out why.I was told that they changed the fit several months ago , without changing the numeral designation . 505 's are now only made as `` Straight Fit '' rather than `` Regular Fit '' . In addition , they have lowered the `` Rise '' to a `` below the waist '' fit , rather than the old `` at the waist '' fit.Sorry Levi 's , you ca n't do that without losing long-term customers . How can you change something as basic and important as fit , but still call it the same thing?Levi 's Mens 505 Straight Fit Jean
 Warning ! Be advised that the new 505 Straight Fit jeans have replaced the original 505 Regular Fit jeans . They are not the same . Try these on in a store before ordering online or you will be disappointed . Apparently , somebody at Levi 's had the bright idea of changing a tried and true style rather than creating a new one ; a classic example of `` if it aint broke , do n't fix it '' .
 I bought three pairs of 505s at the same time from the same buyer . The first two pairs -LRB- one `` Made in Egypt '' , the other `` Made in Bangladesh '' -RRB- have worn just fine -LRB- so far -RRB- , but the third pair -LRB- `` Made in Lesotho '' -RRB- RIPPED on only the SECOND day I ever wore them , starting from just above and to the left of the back-right pocket and tearing straight down , almost to my crotch ... BETWEEN the center seam and the right-side pocket stitching -LRB- NOT on a seam or a stitch ! -RRB- . They just ripped open -- period -- as I sat down . I did n't poke against anything , or rub against anything , and they were n't too tight -- they just plain up and ripped open on their own ... and while I was at work ! Piece of junk ! I 've been buying and wearing Levi 's 505s for 25 years , and I may not be able to prove or explain exactly how I know these jeans are n't `` the same '' as they were even a few years ago ... but I just KNOW , in my heart , that they are NOT the same quality . Now , I 'm doomed for eternity to constantly checking the back of my other two pairs of jeans every time I wear them to make sure there is n't another big rip in them . This was absolutely the last pair of Levi 's I will ever buy . EVER !
 Despite G & L Clothing 's claim that , `` The jeans are the same quality products Levi 's has manufactured for over 150 years , '' they 're not . They have 5 , not 7 , belt loops , with only one in the back , and the waist sags down below your belt in back so your shirt shows between the belt and top of the jeans . If you want to look really nerdy , these are your jeans . Also , IMO , the denim is not as thick as it used to be , even for the darkest blue jeans.In addition to poor quality , G&L ; automatically signs you up for email . If you want email from people like this , who promise you `` watch your inbox for great things to come ! '' then G&L ; is for you.Finally , I 've understood that it 's illegal to charge a credit card until an item is shipped . Evidently G&L ; has n't heard about this , either . Or does n't care . Amazon 's 1/14/06 confirmation of this sale noted that , '' -LSB- Your order is -RSB- -LRB- available to ship by30-January-2006 -RRB- Amazon Payments has charged your credit card -LRB- Amex -RRB- for this purchase , and the funds have been credited to G & L Clothing.Not only do you get shlock jeans , but they illegally charge your card as much as two weeks in advance , and they opt you in for their lovely email.Personally , I think one star is too many .
 I 've owned Levis my whole life which spans five decades . But the last four pairs I bought barely lasted a year before they wore out or started falling apart . These are jeans right ? Could fool me.I had not given this much thought but saw a friend of mine who is in the construction trade and he was wearing what looked like really well constructed jeans and I mentioned my Levis problem and he said in a matter of fact way that few people in the trades buy Levis anymore as they cost more but do n't last anywhere near as long as some other brands.So from my point of view , Levis is another example of the current management charging too much and cutting too many corners to make a buck . I will not buy Levis again and am sad to see this brand go down the toilet .
 I have worn 505 jeans for many years and I purchased the same size -LRB- waist and length -RRB- this new pair is about an inch too big around the waist and the cut is different to previous 505 's . It is an uncomfortable fit .
 My husband has worn 505 's since he was a young man - so that is many years ! He always wore the Straight Fit , in Rigid . We had read the reviews about how bad the `` new & improved '' Levi 's are but had to see for ourselves . I thought a company only did changes that made their product better ... . wrong ! Well , not the Levi company.The material felt horrible - different from the Rigid he wore in the past . We ordered 2 different sizes since there were people talking about the new lower cut and that their original size not fitting . Neither size fit . My husband said they would rub all the hair off your legs if he tried to wear them . Of course , we are returning them.Luckily we read the reviews on Carhartt jeans - ordered them - and they are wonderful jeans . He wore a `` tight '' 34 waist in the old Levis . The 35 waist in the Carhartts was too tight but the 36 was a perfect fit . The length in the Carhartt is the same he used to wear in Levi . We ordered the Straight-Leg Traditional fit in the Carhartt . Also the fit of the Carhartts in the seat is very good . Not baggy at all . The legs may be a tiny bit wider than the Levi 's he used to wear but not much .
 The color and texture is fine but the size is totally different from the original 30x30 . I use to wear 505 's in size 30x30 and they fit and feel different . I 'm very dissapointed with Amazon and especially with Levis quality control , the sizes are different depending on the country the pants were manufactured . They do n't have quality standards as other jeans brands .
 I have n't seen this problem with any of the other reviews so I suspect it may be related to the color/fabric `` Tumbled Stretch . '' When washed they shrank down a good two sizes , at least two inches smaller in the waist and the length . Hoping amazon will let me return them because my boyfriend ca n't wear them and they 're even too small for me . Shrinking two whole sizes is just a bit too much to be normal.I would give the pants another shot in another color/fabric because before washing they fit perfectly . A little stiff like too much starch but perfectly . Then again , we picked out the straight fit because the pants he 's worn through were the same brand and style which is the only reason we ordered them online .
 For years , I have always been able to buy jeans for my husband without any problems -- Levis 505 regular fit . I recently ordered and received a couple of new pair for him , and OMG ... they were a completely different fit ! Both pair ! They ride low , and the overall fit is not flattering - at all !!! Levi 's has RUINED a perfect fitting jean ! I WANT THE OLD 505 'S BACK !!!!
 Attention all dedicated Levi 's 505 wearers ! Today 's 505 's are NOT the same . They are now calling them `` Straight Fit '' as opposed to `` Regular Fit . '' If you 've been wearing 505 's for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 ... or more years , odds are you WO N'T like these . They sit low on the waist . You know , so your underwear can show . If that 's not your idea of fashion , do n't buy these . They 're also a little tighter in the crotch and thighs , whcih coudl be a problem for some . Do n't take my word for it , go to the Levi 's webpage and look up the reviews for the 505 since they changed the style in April , 2011 . They 've lost several generations of customers .
 I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 Jeans for 30 years , and could always rely on the fit . When I put on these jeans , the fit was nowhere close . When I measured , the rise was about 3 inches shorter than the standard Levi 's 505 . Why would any sensible company do that ? There are an infinite number of numbers . If you want to change the fit , why not change the number too . In the past , when Levi has introduced new jeans , they have used new numbers , e.g. 550 . The basic point is that these jeans do n't fit right , and now I have to start shopping for another brand .
 As others have written , Levis changed their 505 jeans without telling customers . The result is a totally poor fitting jean . Shame on Levis ! I have bought and worn Levis my whole life , but now I am off to find a better fitting jean and sadly , it wo n't have the Levis tag on it . : -LRB-
 The new fit of the 505 straight cut are unwearable . The vast majority of men passed the age of 30 do not wear their jeans two inches below their waist . We have more important things to do than pulling up our pants every thirty seconds . The waist is too low the rise is wrong and the cuff too wide . We like the original cut with the understanding that even the original cut was so inconsistent that it was necessary to try on multiple pairs to find a suitable fit.Please stop taking your loyal customers for granted .
 I purchased 2 pair of Levi 505s 33 '' waist , 29 '' length . The pants were both marked 29L and 33W . The 29 '' length was correct , but 1 pair has a 34 '' waist and the other has a 35 '' waist . I kept them because when I was young , Levis shrank when 1st washed . I was wrong !
 Levi stopped offering 505 's in the colors that they used to . They also offer less sizes then they used to . I have worn 505 's for years . 36 waist and 29 inch leg . But now Levi 's offers fewer of the color choices in a 36 waist and 29 inch leg . I ca n't prove it but the material seems lighter to me as well . Unless I want 505 's in my size in shades of blue I am out of luck . To summarize , less choice in colors of my size and cheaper lighter materials used .
 I have worn Levis Regular Fit jeans for many years . They have always fit comfortably . I bought a pair of the Straight Fit jeans thinking they were the same jeans with a new name . The description on the tag is identical to that on the Regular Fit jeans . Both say `` Sits at Waist '' . Not really . The seat has been changed -LRB- I have a 32 '' waist and am not trying to squeeze into too-small jeans -RRB- and the rise is different . I understand that companies must innovate to remain competitive . I do n't understand why anyone would change an established brand and make it useless to its core customers . If Levis wants to attract new customers it should have made the new fit explicit by giving it a new model number . This change reminds me of the `` New Coke '' fiasco . Maybe Lee or Wrangler will do instead .
 These Levi 's 505 jeans that I bought for my husband fit nothing like his old 505 's do . He has always loved this style , but the styling has been changed so that the same size that once fit him like a glove is now at least 1 '' and probably 2 '' too big in the waist , and the rise is shorter by the same amount . If they wanted to make a new style , then , OK , but do n't call 'em 505 's !!
 These pants are unacceptable . lightweight denim will not stand up . crotch is cut all wrong . I had been been wearing this type of jeans for over 40 years , and they have gotten progressively shoddier . Made in china junk . levis is clearly more interested in the ` high end ' androgenous customer . Can ' even find the standard jean jacket anymore . I 'll be looking for a quality jean elsewhere . Sadly , it probably wo n't ne made in the USA . .
 I have been buying exclusively levi jeans for over 45 years . I have been buying size 32x30 for as long as I can remember . Today I bought 3 pair of 505 regular fit straight leg jeans and the waist was not even close . Must be at least 34 . They fall down . I put them up against my old jeans and there is a huge difference . Almost 50 years of product loyalty and they have let me down . I have bought my last pair .
 I bought several pairs of these jeans for my husband last year in 2009 and I can say that I am very disappointed with the quality . The material is very thin and I have had to put patches on the pockets and fix all of the belt loops because the material is thin and they have pulled away . The hem in the bottom of the pant legs have all started to fray as well . We have always purchased Levi jeans for him to work in and they have always held up well -LRB- years -RRB- not months . But I have never had to fix so many problems before . Do not buy these if you intend to work in them every day , they will not last . Very POOR quaility . Shame on Levi . I will be looking for Jeans made here in America from now on .
 Absolute junk ! I 've noticed a decline in the quality over the last decade , i.e. the pocket stitching actually pulling away from the pant and making holes within months . But the new denim fabric is probably half the weight / thickness as it was for last year 's 505s . I 've been wearing 505s for construction since the early 80s . The new `` denim '' feels less substantial than their Dockers line . Levi , you 've lost a 30 + year -LRB- once dedicated -RRB- customer .
 I bought these thinking ` What a nice color ' . Little did I realise that the dye used for this color has a really unpleasant smell . I washed them repeatedly in my very efficient and eco-friendly Asko washer , but the smell remained . If the jeans were mixed with other laundry , the odor would contaminate the other clothes . So , they were returned to Amazon . Thankfully , they accepted them . -LRB- This , in many years of online purchase , has been my only return -RRB- . I wish I could say something better , but the truth must be told .
 Compared to the quality of Levis I owned a few years ago these do n't even come close . They are paper thin and I was almost afraid to put them on without tearing them . I guess we 'll see how long they last .
 I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years . In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores . Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare . I love them but replacement has been needed . After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand . The stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25 . The Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly . No two pair seem the same . However , The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent . The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.Not having a local source for the Levi brand , I ordered through Amazon . The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglersavailable locally . Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers . As a matter of fact , it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL ... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult jeans . The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son 's boy jeans.Last , the jean 's waist and length were at least 2 inches large . Years ago , Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.In summary , the fabric , the zipper , and inconsistent sizes are all very sub-par . The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.This pair was made in Egypt with Egyptian fabric.Avoid mail order Levi jeans
 I am buying this model more than 5 years.The main important things for me is how it fits and a ZIP.I do n't like the bolts.I like Levis because it fits good and quality of material acceptable.There is only one but important problem
 I too have been a long-time fan of the now departed 505 Regular Fit jeans . The decision to summarily drop this enduring style and substitute a new low-rise version -- the abominable 505 Straight Fit -- is positively baffling . I can only ponder what the folks at Levi Strauss were smoking at the time.But hold on , I found a substitute
 These jeans are not of the quality you would expect from the levi brand ... Much thinner material , never thought Levi woulddo this ...
 I hate the 505 straight versus the old Regular fit . i am tired of hitching up my pants every time i stand up and , of course , showing plumber 's crack . can anyone recommend another brand that has the same fit as the old 505 Regular fit ?
 Check out the Levis website for reviews and complaints about the new 505s . They have changed the fit -LRB- the rise -RRB- so that the jeans fit about 1 inch lower at the waist . Many guys are having trouble with the fit as being uncomfortable . They do not stay up ! For some , the 550 is unchanged and may work . As for me , I am changing brands after 45 years of buying Levis .
 The pants seem to be acceptably made -LRB- the label indicates it was made in Cambodia -RRB- - although slightly thinner material than I expected . The color that I ordered -LRB- Blue Collar -RRB- is fine and is what I expected . However , these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down , and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it . I though about keeping them , but I can not put up with the tightness at the thighs . Also , the pockets seem to `` bunch up '' too much and you must often put your hands in your pockets to keep them down ... a major fail , so I 'm returning them and will try out the Levi 's Men 's 560 Comfort Fit Jean instead .
 My 17-year-old son has worn Levi 's 505s , in the same size -LRB- 32x34 -RRB- , for several years . He hates these new jeans . They 're too tight/narrowly cut . Yes , we 'd read the other negative reviews , which is why we ordered only one pair , but it seemed to be mostly older guys complaining about the fit . Trust me , tall , slender young men have now also found these jeans to be uncomfortable . Levi 's should bring back the old 505 jeans and give this new product , if they choose to continue it , a different number because they 're not the same thing at all . We will need to find a new jean .
 In my opinion the name Levi 's is being harvested . It is a common practice for companies to raise money quickly by doing what is referred to as `` harvest the company '' . In industry to harvest the company you stop doing maintenance on equipment , stop hiring young employees , stop all training programs , stop quality controls , and make your product as cheap as you can . It makes your company look very good on the bottom line for a short time . If I owned a lot of stock in a company and was ready to sell it I would do the same thing . I have no problem with companies going off sure to make there product as long as the quality remains the same . But this is not the case with Levi 's they are cutting corners however they can even to the point of eliminating two belt loops . How cheap can they be ? I very seldom return items , but I am returning the 505 jeans and I will find another brand after wearing Levi 's for over 40 years .
 I have a pair of Levi 's 505 regular fit that are great . I could n't find ` regular fit ' option anymore and thought I would give this a try . No luck , they do n't fit well , and are made of considerably thinner material than my old ones .
 The style is inconsistent in some sizes . When I bought the pants , the picture associated with the style , was misplaced . It is now corrected . The pants are bulky ... with no style . The color is a mixture of generic blue and some white-ish threads like something you would find in old outlet stores . I am a fan of Levi 's but this particular one , is not my cup of tea .
 I have been trying to find a pair of Levi 's for my husband which are neither blue nor black . The photo of these jeans makes them appear to be brown so I made the mistake of ignoring the color name and assuming they were as pictured . Now he is going to have to wear the `` girlie '' dark blue because it is too much hassle to return .
 What about this product?I bought the May 12th and I have not received , and I have not received the 6th of June.Also I have not received any message from the cause of the delay
 good nightI want to express my deepest dissatisfaction with a product that acquired levis -LRB- levis 505 rinse model -RRB- last November , because it came with a defect in the right pocket red label -LRB- the label does not say anything is just a red cloth -RRB- supposedly legendary symbol and prestigious brand , I 'm really angry because I 've always used its mark since I was a kid , I live in a country where exchange controls and no one can buy dollars and it is very difficult to buy products online in united states both the final effort to send me a defective product , I demand you compensate me in some ways this uncomfortable situation.Thanks in advance I hope will be addressed my claim
 I bought the Levi ` s 505 36x34 and 2 pairs of jeans Levi ` s 36x34 . But the 505 model has proved to be larger than the waist and 2 `` longer than the other two , I am very disappointed . I do not trust online buying Levi ` s
 Every other pair of jeans I have stays around my waist and does n't drag on my heels . Is 34 inches different in Mexico where these are made ? They are WAY too loose and wo n't even shrink when washed . I have to constantly keep pulling them up . I will never buy Levi 's online again .
 The Levi 's 505 straight fit jeans are clearly labeled 34 - 34 , but the actual size is 38 - 35 . The pants appear to be the real thing . My guess is that they were improperly labeled at the factory . Useless to me , of course .
 Recived very late and damage . I send it back.First
 I have worn Levi 's for at least 50 years ! I never found any pants to be more comfortable . The last two pair of 505s I bought were so different then the ones that I considered an `` old friend '' over the years . The new ones seemed to feel ` rigid ' in the material used . I washed them many times , and they are still not comfortable . Also they are ` baggy ' in the thigh area . They seem too loose all around and ` hang ' on me . The label said `` Made in Mexico '' , so that answered all my questions . I am now searching for another brand after all these years .
 The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline , an endless abyss . The back label , which supposedly should be leather , now seems to be made &#8203; &#8203; of cardboard and a lousy finish . The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least , in my experience , has been . I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world . Previously , a Levis jeans was a piece `` almost perfect '' , today I can not say the same . I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans .
 These are not the jeans I 'm used to . The waist is bigger than it should be . The material is thinner than my older Levis . I 'm keeping them because I need jeans , the price was better than in Kohl 's and they work , but I would n't order these again or recommend them . I 'll get used to this fit and expect them to wear out more quickly than they should !
 I purchased 36x30 jeans . I have worn Levi 's for 50 years . The pair I received said 36x30 - But the actual size must have been 25x30 , I could not get them on . Very Dissatisfied !
 I have worn 505 's for decades . I recently bought a new pair to find out they have changed the fit . I hate the new low waisted fit ! If they are going to change the cut of a pair of jeans , they need to give the new version a different model number . Very bad move on Levi 's part . Who 's in charge there and what were they thinking ?
 WARNING
 The waist on these jeans say 33 but they are as big as a 35 . they must be seconds or irregulars .
 the fit was to loose totaly disappointed . wo n't buy chlothes on here again . same size from store fits just fine .
 There are other reviews that talk about the various manufacturing areas that Levi 's Jeans are made from and the inconsistencies from sweat shop to sweat shop . Well it is true . These fit eh . Not so bad that I 'll return them but I am confident this is the last pair of jeans I will buy from Levi 's Co. .
 I believe that I have just bought my last pair of Levi 's . They have been my favorite jeans brand for years but these are not what they used to be . The fit is awful and I 'm not even sure that the denim fabric is the same . I 'll admit that I have n't bought a new pair in several years but these seem like an entirely different brand . I plan to start shopping around to find another brand that I will like better . It 's sad to say goodbye to such an old frriend .
 After second washing there are major streaks across both front pockets and crotch as if fabric color faded due to poor dye ?
 This is the first pair of jeans I 've had to buy in a few years . I was replacing a pair of the same make and model , Levi 's Men 's 505s . The fabric is lighter , the cut is lower , really down on the hips now . Clearly cost cutting has been going on . They fit OK and I 'm keeping them , but a standard model from a venerable brand should not be getting watered down . Clearly will not be lasting as long . These should be branded under a new number to identify the new cut and the cheaper fabric !!
 These may not be the worst jeans I have ever owned but they are way ahead of whatever is in second place . You would think that as much as the charge for jeans now that they could afford to put some belt loops on them . I should have the advise of previous reviews and not purchased these jeans .
 I ordered 2 pairs of size 36x34 505 jeans from this listing , and they arrived fine , no problems there.The tag on the jeans say 36x34 , but when I put them on the waist is at least two inches larger than advertized , and the inseam is a full four inches larger -LRB- compared to an older pair of Levi 505 jeans that I have.I do n't consider this seller reliable , at all .
 I bought this pair of jeans for my husband . He is 6 ' 3 '' and always take the same size jeans . We when opened the package , it seemed that the jeans were way too big . He tried them on and the fit was way off -LRB- too long , too big . . -RRB- . I do n't know if the compagny has issues with this particular style or if we were simply unlucky with the fitting . Fortunatly , we were able to return the product easily .
 This is my first time that I bought jeans on line , And I think they send an imperfect jeans . I use to buy Levis 505 32 30 I bought two 505 jeans and one of them was made in Lutovo and not fit good , is different and is very unconfortable . Sorry for my english , but my jeans are worst .
 I ordered these per the size label on an old pair that have always fit very well . As yet I have not succeeded in shrinking them down to a proper fit ... . not a happy camper
 Recently I bought a 550 relaxed fit pair of Levi 's Jean -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- and the waist was ok but they were a bit long so in this ocassion I tried the 505 -LRB- 33 * 29 -RRB- and they were too tigh at waist but the leg size was ok . I learn it is necessary to consider the fit type , not only the size which is a bit strange as my old pair of Levi 's 555 -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- -LRB- not currently available -RRB- were ok . The fabric is thick and there is not complaint about the material but the sizing is a bit tricky . Sizes across the different fits should be ok but it seems not . A relative , chubbier than I , actually has a 505 -LRB- 33 * 30 -RRB- which are ok , so there seems to be sizing problems with this jean .
 If there is a way of giving 1/2 a star , I would have done it . Yes , I 've been wearing Levis 505 `` regular fit '' for the last 30 years and it has always fitted me perfectly until now when the brilliant brains at Levis replaced the `` regular fit '' with `` straight fit '' and results in a classic example of if there is a way of screwing up a good thing , the Levis people thought of a way of doing it . Just like the classic Coke taste that was replaced a few years back that never were quite accepted by the public . For some reasons , they forgot what brought them success in the first place with a successful formula . Good bye Levis for screwing up an American icon . May you rest in peace .
 I always get 505 but these pants material is so thin Levi 's lately use thin and poor materials that this is my last pair of pants from levis will never buy levies again .
 These do not fit like the old 505 . Quality suffers also ! It seems that the venerable 505 have fallen into the globalization trap . I will not buy again .
 I 've been wearing the same size Levis 505s for some 30 years . I am well familiar with how they fit , what they 're made of , and how they feel . For the first time I just ordered two pairs of Amazon 's Levis 505 jeans.The two pairs I purchased from Amazon are a good inch shy of specification in both waist and inseam , and the waist is a half inch or more low . They fit me like hip-hugging sausage skin and the fabric just does n't feel right - it feels as if it 's a lighter weave and I get the distinct impression it 's just not going to wear over time like I expect a 505 to wear . If I wanted a skin-tight lightweight fashion brand jean I 'd buy them and not 505s . I 'll give them two stars because they are blue jeans and because at least visually they look like the genuine article . But when they are clearly not equivalent to the store bought version , I 'm returning both pairs of these pants and not using Amazon again for this particular product.I can not recommend Amazon 's Levis 505 jeans , much as I 'd really prefer the convenience of ordering online .
 Let me start by saying that Levi 's 505 jeans are my jeans and will be my jeans until the end of time . The 505 's fit me perfectly and pretty much define my style . But there is something different about the ones that I received from Amazon versus what I 've purchased in the actual Levi 's stores.The material felt flimsy and the fit was completely different . The colors also did n't look anything like what I expected , being much , much lighter than what I had received in store.I sent them back and picked up another pair at the Levi 's store . I may try picking up the next pair from Amazon to see if I just got a bad pair , but I 'm not excited to give it a second shot .
 My husband has worn 505 jeans for his whole life but that is about to change . I bought him 3 pairs , removed the tags , he wore them and we noticed there was a big gap at the waist , on the back-side . We discovered Levis has removed 2 loops `` in a cust-cutting move '' . Well , their cost-cutting has lost this customer . It is SO annoying ! Levis , wake up and put the loops back or you 've lost this customer for good .
 Levis from another land.My favorite since 1957 . These new red tabs have been washed -LRB- 2 -RRB- times and the belt loop over left rear pocket is already tore off leaving a 1/2 '' hole . The right leg outer seam starts is correct at top but ends in the center of my foot at the bottom.CrOoKeD ... FOR LEVI ONLY . . NO OFFENSE TO AMAZON !!!! GOOD JOB TO AMAZON IN ALL THAT THEY DO FOR MY FAMILY ...
 The silt-color `` Levi 's 505 Straight Fit Pants '' that I received did not fit like I expected them to . The `` rise '' measured from the crotch to the top is 1-1/2 inches shorter than traditional Levis 505 pants . As a result , they fit like `` low rise '' style pants , not like the 505 Levis that I have purchased in the past . Also , the upper front fabric is excessively wavy when the pants lay empty , flat on a table . They remain so when wearing the pants , unlike the pants shown in the photo . Properly tailored pants would lay flat .
 The last two pairs I bought -LRB- February 2011 -RRB- had a very loose waist and a tight seat . I have in the past noted some variation in Levi 's sizing from one batch to another -- some are tighter and some are looser -- but the basic shape has always been consistent . These recent jeans are ridiculous . They are n't cut the same way at all . The waist requires a tight belt to stay up , and bunches up under the belt , and the seat is flat and tight . Uncomfortable and unattractive.Levi 's needs to fix this or they will lose many customers . I would think that the online outfits like Amazon would pressure them to improve quality control , because people order things online that they are confident will fit . If you ca n't trust consistency of sizing , folks will have to go to local retailers to try the clothes on first .
 These are not the Levi 's Jeans you were used to . Made in Egypt , very thin cloth , only five belt loops instead of seven . Also , the sizes are not accurate . I love Amazon because they refunded my Levi 505 purchase but I 'll never buy from Levi again.Ralph Miller
 Many of us 505ers out there have been wearing this style for many years ... During this time , there was n't any guesswork , just look for your size , grab them , and go ... But Levis has recently changed the cut of these classic blue jeans ... What was once 505 ` Regular Fit ' is now 505 ` Straight Cut ' ... Let me assure you - THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ... The new cut is tighter in the thighs and much snorter in the belt line/waist line ... They fit like low rise jeans and for most guys , they are prone to falling down ... I discovered this after returning three pairs to the store for thinking they were defective ... Why would Levis go and change a good thing ? . . Guys ... Just bring back the ` Regular Fit ' 505s ... If you want to offer a different cut , for heaven 's sake , give it a different model number ... But do n't screw with a classic ... Take a hint from Coca-Cola ... The ` New Coke ' was a failure - do n't screw with a classic ... I will not be buying any more Levis unless they can make the 505 regular cuts again ... Disgusted , Chris
 I bought two Levis 505 Straight Fit Jeans in May for my Dad in Hong Kong . They were bought as Father 's Day 's gifts for him . In order to order the right size , I asked him to take a picture of his old one to me `` W31 L30 '' . I received them on June 3rd and gave them to my friend to bring them to him . The sizes of both jeans were totally wrong . My Dad told me one measures W33 and the other measures W35.Both jeans will become donations . Sigh ... how come the actual size can be THAT OFF from what is listed on the label !!!! Very disappointed ... . No more Levis Jeans from now on for I can not trust the label anymore . Sigh ...
 My order was the pants Levis Mens size 34W x 32L and I came what I believe is 36W x 34L , made '' in Mexico , which leaves much to be desired in the quality of this product , something similar happened to me Levi 's Tumbled Stretch 34x32 made '' in China , shrank in the first wash being the length in 28 or less ... that disappointment
 I concur with the other disappointed , former , Levi customers . Levi has made a disappointing change to the 505 brand . I naively grabbed a couple 505 replacement jeans , tore off the tags and let them go through a simple rinse cycle . When I went to wear them I sadly found that they did not fit right . Way too loose for me . Not even close . I have done this many times before without problem . When I compared to my older jeans I noticed the labels `` straight '' vs. my good old `` regular '' tags inside.I thought I made a mistake and grabbed the wrong kind . But I could n't find my trusty `` regulars `` s anywhere for purchase . The sales person at a Levi store condescendingly told me that they were the same -LRB- actually , I am not sure she ever heard of `` regular '' 505 's -RRB- . As noted in these reviews , I did n't make a mistake , but it seems Levi has.My new 505s now hang separately in the closet and I wear them when I do n't care about how I look , like when I go to home depot or work in the yard . I would add `` or when I shovel manure '' , but I do n't really ever do that . It seems lthat perhaps Levi is cornering the market on manure piles with this stinky change .
 I ordered 3 pair of jeans , specifying 36X29 , because that is the size I wear , and have other Levi jeans of that size that fit perfectly . Although the label indicates that the jeans that I recently purchased are 36X29 , they are actually 37X293/4 according to the seamstress who had to alter the jeans . Needless to say , these are now the most expensive jeans I own , but they now are 36X29 . I will never order clothing through Amazon again , as it is obvious that Amazon is selling `` rejects '' from the manufacturer .
 I 've been wearing these for more than 40 years -LRB- 501-505 's -RRB- the denim continues to get lighter , the material flaws more frequent , and the sizing more random.I 'm done with the whole Levi 's thing . For my money , there are better , longer wearing options .
 This brand has been transformed from the one I trusted for over thirty years , to a POS.I 've worn Levi 's blue jeans ever since I was a teen . I 'm now in my early 50 's and these are obviously not the same quality jeans as they were even ten years ago . They 're thinner , the fit of the exact same size and style is extremely varied from one pair to another -LRB- even the belt loops are double sized or super skinny on two ` identical ' pairs of 505 's -RRB- , and they have been designed to self destruct in six months of casual wear.EVERY pair of my ` new ' Levi 's now tear out @ the upper LH corner of the right rear pocket after 180 days of ownwership . I NEVER carry ANYTHING in that pocket ; not even my wallet . There is no excuse for this identical , premature , calculated failure of a forty dollar pair of blue jeans . And the now dainty belt loops tear off these tissue paper jeans if you merely LOOK at them too hard . Chinese Levi 's = CRAP !!! Bye bye , POS blue cotton pants posing as Levis . I 'll not be purchasing another overpriced pair of these pale imitations . The greedy manufacturer has obviously made the decision that a billion new middle class Chinese consumers will buy garbage ` American denim ' . Those of us in the USA with a shred of memory sure as hell wo n't be buying this $ htt.DO NOT BUY LEVI 'S UNLESS YOU ENJOY LIGHTING YOUR MONEY ON FIRE .
 The jeans were very Slow in getting to me and they were way too big . I buy the same size each time for my husband and these were way too big .
 I 've bought several pairs of 31x30 Levi 's jeans in the past - including one pair of 505s -LRB- though not from Amazon -RRB- . These were too big by at least a size . I measured them and they were 31 &#34; long from the inseam , and were too wide at the waist and inseam as well . Returned .
 I bought these for my 6 ' 5 &#34; , 190lb husband . I usually buy him 34x36 as 33 is hard to find . 34 is always too big in the waist and rear . These were so tight he could n't even fasten them . Sending back
 I bought a pair of `` regular '' 505s , as i have done before , and they have messed with a classic ! They no longer fit nice at the waist , they have changed them to a lower cut ! why ?? Do not be fooled like i was.no wonder people are complaining.And to be perfectly truthful , they just did not seem the same quality at all , very thin . Was really gutted.Just hope levis see sense and change them back to how they were ... soon
 I have been wearing Levi 505 jeans for several years and like the fit . I recently bought two pair of Levi 505 jeans , same size . When the jeans arrived I noticed they were manufactured in two different oversea 's locations . To my surprise , one pair was too small and the other too large . I returned both pair with no problems ; I 'm going to try one more time and if they do n't fit this time guess I 'll end up going to the mall .
 They fit fine and look nice , but they are noticeably thinner or &#34; lighter weight &#34; than past purchases I have made of 505 jeans . It 's a shame that these once durable jeans are now likely to wear down sooner . I will be searching for more durable jeans in my next purchase .
 The 505 regular fit are now the 505 regular fit . The waist is larger and the hips are extremely tighter . I will NOT be buying the 505 jeans any longer . I have been wearing them for decades .
 I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust . Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd . They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly . The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I ca n't stand it . My old 505s did not do this . The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them . They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle . These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality , look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing .
 I have a Levis 505 34 x 32 but it is smaller , I do not know if regular fit is equals straight fit
 I thought the material was cheap and nothing like any Levi jeans I have ever owned . I made a big mistake . I do not like them
 The last time I bought a pair of 505 Levi 's was in 2000 in Orem in Utah . I have always been pleased with Levi 's products and was very saddened and disappointed when I tried on the pair I bought through Amazon.com.Everything about them appears to have deteriorated in 12 years . I can only attribute the cause of it to the fact that Levi 's have to cut costs everywhere in order to satisfy the demands of their Shareholders for more and more dividends in the face of ever increasing competition.Levi 's have lost my custom as far as ordering over the Internet is concerned . At least in a Shop I can see when they are not what I am looking for and leave them . That is my experience with them , so I think I will go back to the other brands I have been buying in the intervening 12 years .
 I bought these for my husband as an extra pair of 505 's . He has others in this style from Macys and Zappos . These jeans are almost an inch and a half smaller at the waist than the others , although the sizing reads the same . I just returned them . This is unfortunate since Amazon overs great pricing and service .
 I would really like to know what the thought process was in redesigning a classic piece of American apparel so that it fits like junk . Or , rather , does n't fit your junk . I echo all the other writers here who note that the new `` fit '' does n't fit . Not just slightly off -- terribly made for anyone who has anything resembling a reasonably fit body . If you have any gluteal muscles at all , the jeans wo n't reach your waist . So it constantly feels like the jeans are falling down . It looks moronic , feels truly uncomfortable , and is dysfunctional.The whole idea that made jeans popular in the first place was that they were sturdy , work-oriented pants that broke in to look and feel comfortable . You ca n't work in the new 505s at all unless the point of your labor is not to complete a job but show off `` plumber 's crack . `` Have been wearing Levi 's all my life , have also tried Wrangler 's Lees etc etc. . The new 505 is truly the worst pair of jeans I 've ever owned . Because they use a tag with a lot of brand strength but substitute an inferior product in its place , it 's also deceptive to consumers . They should remove the `` 505 '' brand '' and in the interest of truth-in-packaging rename this style `` dumba ** '' in honor of whatever overpaid executive thought this up and anyone suckered into wearing a pair .
 I 've purchase Levi 's 505 jeans my entire life , but recently purchased a couple of pair and found that the cut has been changed to a low-ride jean . Found similar experiences posted by other folks . Very disappointed . Seems that Levi Strauss is trying to lure in a new demographic -LRB- that like to have that modern everything exposed cut -RRB- at the expense of long term customers . Bad corporate decision making . Recommend that folks looking for the old 505 cut try the Austin jean if they can get them . Probably not as high quality , but about half the price and similar in fit to old 505 's .
 Some genius MBA at Levis decided to change the design of the classic 505 jeans without telling anybody . I bought several pairs before realizing they were n't seconds , Levis had actually made the waist wider and the rise lower so the pants will no longer fit no matter how tight you cinch your belt . Do not buy these without trying them on ! Levis has taken a style you could buy without worry and made it unwearable -- without warning any of its customers.Levi 's Men 's 505 Straight Fit Jean
 For as long as I can remember I wore Levi 505 Regular Fit 36x30 . Obviously a popular size cause they were always difficult to find in the pile of various sizes . Recently my wife came home with 3 new pairs . When I tryed them on they felt as if they were a defective cut . The waist line dipped deep into my crouch the legs were baggy and the felt like they were always falling off my ass . My wife had to return cause I realy did think they were defective . Since , I havent bought a new pair of Jeans . Looking on line today came upon these other common complaints and cant believe the corporate mentality of Levi . Obviously they will be on the road to destruction , if they dont come foward and meet the long time customers needs with the same old jeans . What a Bad Idea you had Mr Levi ! We are deeply disappointed in your products as of today !
 I 've found that the finishing/hemming of the jean 's length is consistently off . No matter what measurement you choose , the pants are either just right or two long . I have n't found any to be too short ... yet . Also , Levi 's is always changing the rise of the jeans . The new ones I just purchased are lower than my older ones . I do like Levi 's quality though . They really hold up .
 I have been wearing these , the Levi 505 , for quite sometime now and I love them . I ordered some on Amazon because they were in a wash that I could n't find in the store . When I got them , I put them on and they were literally HUGE ! I compared them to some other new 505 's and the sizing was awful . They were literally 2 inches too long , and at least 2 sizes too big in the waist . I felt like I put on my dad 's jeans!In addition , one of the seams was coming undone already . Very poor finish .
 jeans are of lighter weight material . Not as durable and one of the five belt loops has already torn off because of the poor quality . I will not be buying Levi 's again . Very disappointing . If I had wanted these cheap knock offs I would have went to Wally World .
 I love 505s but I 've found that if I order 3 pairs , all three will fit completely differently . The faded jeans tend to be really tight and low cut so that they barely cover your backside , the traditional stonewash seem to have the truest fit to the original 505s and the `` trendy '' washes I 've bought are all over the map . I 've stopped buying them online because I have to keep sending them back . It 's a lot easier to wait for a sale locally and go try them on .
 These Jeans are pure rubbish ! Cheap , thin demin that feels like it is made from newspaper pulp . I swear , I think they contain some percentage of newspaper pulp , just so Levi 's can cut down on costs . They lose their colors in just a few washes and the fibers start fraying as soon as you wear them . They crush your crotch , they slide down and need to be hiked up every minute . Levi 's has obviously been taken over by a Bunch of MBA 's with degrees in worthlessness . MBA should stand for Master 's in Business Assassination , because that 's what they actually accomplish in the end . Look what MBA 's did to apple before apple wised up and fired them all . Apple was nearly killed by MBAs ! I am frustrated because I can not find any Jeans that fit on the waist like normal jeans do . I mean , what are these elitist upper management asswipes thinking , that by reducing the rise in their jeans , Men can wear them ? We have balls and we do not like crushed nuts . Also , this stupid low rise jean trend needs to die already . What kind of guy likes to have crushed nads , and have his pants hanging off his ass at the same time ? I guess American Has become Snookie Stupid , because looking like a douchey asswipe is consider cool.I 've spent months looking for jeans that fit like normal jeans . I went to LL . Bean but all their jeans look like something an elderly man would wear diapers with . I am 30 years old , and I just want normal jeans . Anyone know of any replacement brands for Levi 's ?
 Aweful . One leg was almost 2 inches shorter than the other leg . It was a waste of my time when I thought purchasing online would save me time from going into a store .
 I bought 505 Levis , size 36W x 32L , thinking they would be the same as the 505 Levis , 36W x 32L , that I bought in a store in Ithaca , NY several years ago . No such luck ! The new ones have less room from the crotch up , the stitching is shoddier , the belt loops are narrower and the cloth is thinner and less robust . In fact my two year old 505 Levis that have been washed countless times have thicker cloth than the brand new ones that have never been washed.What really bugs me is the fit above the crotch . It 's more or less okay when I wear a shirt . In the summer with a skimpy shirt or no shirt , the crack of my a. . will show and that 's really low class - even for females , which I am not one of.I am going to look at Carhartt the next time I need jeans . So far they have delivered reliable products .
 Probably this was the last time I ordered Levi 's online from Amazon.I got two pairs of Levi 's jeans -LRB- 505 -RRB- in the same shipment and both have extremely different fitting , none close to the Levi 's I know for so long . Now I am wondering why I was so lazy not to go to the local Levi 's store ... . My advice , if you can get out of your sofa and visit a local Levi 's store , it would be worth ...
 The Levi jeans are not what they once were . The denim used does n't seem to hold up as long as they use to , I find the denim also failing where the belt loops are stitched in . The fake leather patch on the back comes off after a few washes also , did n't this use to be real leather ? There use to be 2 additional belt loops as I remember than there are now , I find the belt slipping over the jeans because of this cut back.I am and have been an avid Levi fan , would purchase/wear no other jeans , however , now I find myself looking for a suitable replacement so I can enjoy the quality that Levi once had . The price has gone way up while the quality of the product has seemed to come way down . I am still wearing Levi jeans , but with much disappointment .
 I used to love Levis , but now they have gone with a thinner material , fewer belt loops , and the fit seems to have changed as well . They feel cheap and thin . A belt does n't hold them up evenly all the way around , there are 2 loops in front , 2 at the side , and only 1 in the back at the center . The effect is that you feel like your wearing a constant wedgy . Not to mention how they are charging more for these now . For a better fitting jean , at a better price , with enough belt loops , you 're better off with LLBean Double L Jeans .
 Could someone please tell me why Levi 's does n't make `` REGULAR FIT '' jeans anymore?I usually buy Levi 's 505 's in recent years . But always bought the regular fit size . Now all I see is `` STRAIGHT FIT '' sizing and they 're TOO tight ! Mostly in the upper leg area and seat . What is all that about ? Cost saving measure for Levi 's again ? As if the jean companies are n't making enough $ already !! I 'm reminded of this every time the temperature goes up in the summer time and I 'm trying to work in too tight jeans that are hot and uncomfortable to wear and work in !!
 After wearing these 505s three or four times , the stitching that holds the waistband to the jeans fell apart . I 've worn 505s most every day for 30 years and have not seen stitching fall apart even after years of wear . These brand new jeans just fell apart . I wo n't be buying Levis at Amazon again .
 The 505 straight fit is horrible . The 505 `` regular '' fit was much better , but has been discontinued.Levis , please bring back the 505 regular fit .
 I wasted my money . I will buy Carhartt from now on.Problem with Levis
 I 've hardly ever been as annoyed with a product as I am with these jeans . I 've worn the same size 505 Levi 's for probably 25 years . So I had no qualms about ordering these online . But they are cut completely differently than any other pair of 505 's I 've ever owned . Low at the hip and skinnier in the thighs.If Levi Strauss is trying to tell me I 'm not hip , I get the message . But if you 're going to label something 505 , it should be the same jean I 've always worn and loved.Change the flipping name if you change the product . It 's not like you only have one jean ...
 On the red Leib on the pocket is not a word Levi 's , but only mark R. On the inside of the pockets are no inscriptions . This is the second pair 505 , the first one was perfect , but it does not sit well and too small . I am very disappointed .
 Pants looked pretty good and sized well . Then I put my belt on and noticed the front left belt loop was entirely missing . No signs of sewing , no hanging chad , nothing . Shocking quality miss for $ 42 pair of jeans ! Got ta return these and hope seller gets it right and makes good on these name brand jeans . More later after seeing response from Amazon ! Where is inspector 009 when you need him?UPDATE *** One star has become two stars thanks to Amazon.Amazon sent out the replacement pair of jeans and they arrived literally overnight . The pants appear to be fine . Although I am shocked by initial Levi pants quality misstep , Amazon stepped up and fixed the issue . 2 Stars for Levis , 4 stars for Amazon.The pants themselves seem durable . I went back to Levis after my Lees fell apart just after a couple of months and a few washes . Levis material seem more durable . Better be for the $ 12 premium to get Levis over Lees . I 'll update this again after a few months.I still have a pair of Levis from 1980 something with no apparent holes except they are almost white now from all the washes . I am expecting these to hold up a lot better than the designer soft fabric jeans other companies sell .
 I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon . The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer . They were durable and fit well . They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing -LRB- I estimate around 40-50 washes -RRB- . So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work . I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi 's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own . But I wanted the less ` slim ' fit of the 505s for work , also wanted the regular and not low rise waist . So I ordered the same exact size and style : Bad idea!The 505s I got came with a tag saying ` sits below waist ' , which is NOT what they used to say . Before , the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s . Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon , I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair . Trying the new pair on , I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my ` man parts ' being crushed in agonizing ways . No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans , and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area . The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s , but the seat was the main difference . No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505 . And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s -LRB- in the same color as the new 505s I purchased -RRB- I noticed something interesting . The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s . It was n't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing . The 515s never felt that tough , and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description -LRB- no mention of low rise waist -RRB- and inferior quality . I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store . The previous 505s were also great -LRB- Fred Meyer of all places - though they do n't have the 505s anymore ... booo -RRB- . So I 'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them . I 'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood . And the better quality denim means they 'll last longer anyway . So here are my comparisons : Levi 's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi 's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi 's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described , and that the quality appears to vary from order to order . I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews . I love Levi 's jeans , and I will continue to buy them , but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing . And remember , if you buy from Amazon , they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items .
 This is the last pair of jeans I buy from this brand . I bought this online because I felt pretty safe that the fit would be good , since these are n't my first pair of jeans from the brand . Still the case , and jeans fit well -LRB- and look nice -RRB- However , the low rating goes to the quality of the material . While I appreciate nice , medium thickness jeans that I 'll break into after awhile and will last many years -LRB- still have a pair of Diesel jeans that I wear after 10 years -RRB- , this is a tissue thickness pair of pants . I doubt that these will last more than a year , even with normal daily use.Levi 's is not the same brand that have have earned my admiration and loyalty over the years . They cheaped out on the material , and therefore sent the quality into the crapper . Please be aware of this when buying their jeans . Shame on you levi 's , for selling out and losing your integrity.And why the hell only 5 belt rings ???? Are they really that expensive ??? Is it worth the economy knowing fans like me will be really dissapointed ?
 I purchased these jeans for my husband , who is not usually very fussy . However , these jeans are made from extremely poor denim which was noticeable immediately . After wearing them once , they all went a bit fuzzy and seems to be pilling already . Very poor quality . I would have returned them immediately other than not worth the postage . They are now used for camping purposes only !!
 I have been buying Levis for 40 years and ca n't believe the jeans I just purchased.They have gone down in quality and up in price . They feel like a cheap pair of designerjeans . The weight of the material is lighter and they have reduced the number of belt loops.I hate them . I will buy Carhartt from now on . Much better quality .
 They do n't fit like the previous 501s I 've purchased . Probably safer to purchase at a local store after trying on .
 These pants are obviously seconds . They do not fold correctly and the color is faded on where the cloth does not lay down . Not made in the USA either . These are the worst pair of Levi 's I have ever bought brand new .
 I ordered a pair of the 505s for my husband . He is and always has been a 32x32 and always wears the same Levis 505s ... First of all , Rigid is not a color , it is an adjective . I have never seen jeans so stiff and uncomfortable . The pair could literally stand up on their own when they arrived . Second , they may be marked 32x32 , but they certainly fit like a 34x34 . I was hoping to save money , I should have just gone to my local Macys and picked up a pair there . At least he would have a pair of jeans he would actually wear then .
 Sadly , it appears that Levi Strauss has dramatically changed the cut of their classic 505 Regular Fit jeans . The new model is called the 505 Straight Fit and has a 2 inch wider waist and sits at the hips rather than the waist as the old 505 Regular Fit . I currently have 31 pairs of 505 blue/black jeans and a year ago bought a new pair and found that they did n't fit as the old ones did . I thought I got a cheap rip-off pair and bought another pair at a different store 6 months later only to find that they did n't fit either . I called Levi Strauss and was informed that yes , they had changed the cut of the 505 and now call it the Straight Fit . I was told that the 501 would fit similar to the old 505 Regular Fit , but it has a button fly that I do n't care for . I was also told that the Relaxed Fit was similar to the old 505 Regular Fit , but this 59 year old guy is 5 ' 11 '' and 150 lbs , so I do n't need a Relaxed Fit jean . So , after being a loyal Levi 's customer for 50 years I 've now gone to Lee jeans . They make a Regular Fit jean that fits me like my old 505 's and feels great . Maybe in the future Levi Strauss should consult with a company like Coca-Cola before changing an iconic product .
 The classic Levis 505 jeans are no more . They have now been replaced by Levis 505 `` Straight Fit '' jeans . This means they do n't come up nearly as high on the hips and they feel like hell when you wear them -LRB- unless you 're 14 years old -RRB- . Avoid at all costs if you liked the original style . Apparently the classic 505s had a tag in the inseam that said `` Regular Fit . '' If you can find these in a store or on eBbay , rock on . Otherwise , I would recommend Wrangler Men 's Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jeans . They feel like the old 505s and are actually a bit better anyway . Wrangler makes a better and more consistent product than Levis ? Yes , it 's true .
 I agree with all the reviews which have essentially complained about the current fit of the new 505 's . I had been wearing Levi 505 jeans for decades and have had the same measurements the entire time , so different sizes can not be the issue . These jeans used to fit great from the waist to shoe . But , as I now know from reading other reviews , while keeping the same label , Levi recently changed the fit of these jeans , especially around the waist . I have 3 pair of 505 's . While the oldest pair fits great , the last two that I purchased through Amazon fit poorly.The last 2 sets of 505 's I purchased each fit differently , but both ride too low on the waist . The silver fox colored jeans I purchased fits especially poorly , and the fabric feels flimsy compared to other Levi 's . With the new 505 's , I am continually pulling my pants up higher after bending or sitting.So after being a loyal Levi customer for my entire adult life , I will now switch to Lee regular fit , straight leg jeans , which I now feel are superior . Lee jeans come in as many colors as Levi , but they ride higher on the waist and the material is of equal or better quality IMHO . I notice that Wrangler also makes a similar jean that rides higher on the waist , so I probably will try one of this brand of jeans in the near future as well.Goodbye Levi , it was nice knowing you .
 I ordered 2 pairs of 505 from Amazon in the same size as a pair I have , 36 x 32 . The new jeans arrived as promised . The labels claimed 36 x 32 . These pants are so large that I can not wear them . I tried washing them in hot water and drying in a hot dryer . They are still way too large . I am returning them to Amazon . I 'll never buy Levi brand again . By the way , there are only five belt loops on the new Levi 's instead on seven and the material is MUCH thinner . Buyer beware.Ralph Miller
 I tried to cancel the order minutes after buying it because the color was n't as advertised . It was stonewash jeans -LRB- not as dark as it is claimed -RRB- . I returned the product after I received it with all the labels . Amazon , nevertheless , went ahead to give me only a partial refund . I have since stopped buying items of clothing from Amazon after that .
 I purchased two pair of 505 jeans because the two pair I owned were finally wearing out after about five years . Their longevity is a testament to Levis . I bought these jeans without trying them on ... why would I ? They are the same jeans I have been wearing for decades . When I finally tried them on at home I thought I had returned to the 70 's . They are very low rise jeans - the only thing missing was the 10 inch wide bell bottoms . The genius who decided to ruin a classic rather than simply introduce a new lower cut style , has probably destroyed relationships with thousands of life-long customers . I will return these jeans but never return to Levis until someone undoes a huge mistake .
 This review concerns two pairs of straight legs which were in the `` Black Amped '' color . I am writing to warn of some problems : -LRB- A -RRB- Color is a deep indigo blue , not black at all . -LRB- B -RRB- The jeans come with a big white tag warning the buyer that the jeans will bleed and continue to do so through their life . First time I 've seen this . -LRB- C -RRB- For denim , this is ridiculously thin fabric . The only upside to this is that I could shrink the jeans just enough to save me the usual tailor 's bill for altering Levis 32 '' inseam to the 31 '' they stopped selling years ago.They 're nice pants but the wrong color and wo n't last long .
 This jeans had a long stain streak under the right pocket , i paid my money for some new but i what i got was BS
 Good afternoon ... how is possible that companies such as Amazon and Levis sell and send defective items without going through a quality control . One pair of pants that I purchased came with one sleeve shorter than the other . How may be possible coming from you ? What can I do with this piece of rag ?
 I ordered a pant size waist 35 inches and the pant came size 37.5 inches , so I can not used it . I am seeing many complains regarding the wrong size . The problem is that that Levi does not have Quality Control in the sewing plant or they are not doing thei job . The Amazon Service Department is very good , they solved the problem . I am very happy with them .
 spoiled goods came the jeans torn at the front on both legs and the back left pocket near the fabric was torn as if defeated ... !
 Para ser justo debo corregir , que este producto es un buen producto , de buena calidad y precio ; pero yo cometi un error pues ya habia comprado el producto , ahora tengo dos y sigo estando satisfecho !!!
 505 jeans use to be made made by Levi 's to fit real mean . Levi 's changed the cut of the 505s to now be low riders with skinny little legs . I have personally talked to Levi 's Customer Service and basically they do n't care about all the old timers that have worn 505s all their lives . There basic answer is that they now are catering to the low rider , pinched honey wearers . Good riddance Levi 's ! Do n't make the mistake of buying any Levi products as they are foreign made and they do n't care about what used to be dedicated customers .
 I have never had a pair of levis fall down before . These used to be work pants
 Heed other 's reviews . These are now lower cut . Had to return them after wearing the 505s for 10 years . And trust me , I am not any bigger than I was then.The jeans just do n't fit the same .
 For a company that specializes in jeans , you would think belt hoops would be something they know you need . Only one in the back does not keep your belt where it needs to go in the back . It makes the waistline belt go over the denim . I looked at my other jeans from Lands End and others , and they all have 3 in the back . One over each pocket , one in center .
 Since junior high school in the ' 70 's , I have never NOT had a pair of Levi 's 505 's in my closet . That 's going to change once my current pair-bought at the flagship Levi 's store in San Francisco , no less-finally gives up the ghost . The switch from `` regular '' fit to `` straight '' fit means 505 's are now completely different pants . The waist is easily two inches lower on your hips , the circumference of the legs probably two inches less , too . If you 're not a malnourished punk rock musician with no butt , you 're going to look like ridiculous in these pants . And you 'll feel ridiculous , too . Levi 's is clearly targeting a different market from , um , everyone who ever bought these pants in the past , so good luck with that .
 The size marked on the pants did not correspond to reality , they were one sise bigger.I ordered two pants one blue and one beige . I received two beige . I had to return one of the beige . They send me the blue one one week later . This worked ok.I could not use them because were one size bigger than the size marked . I sold then to a friend .
 I recently bought a pair of 505 's for my tall son . The size I ordered was 34 x 36 . When they came in the mail the outside of the jeans was labeled correctly , but the inside tag read 34 x 29 . I did not notice this until I unfolded the jeans , a day or two after they arrived and unfortunately I have already thrown away the receipt . Good money lost !! How do I get a refund ? A quality control person really ought to check sizes before packaging . There is a BIG and obvious difference between a 29 '' length and a 36 '' . Help
 Quise recordar mis tiempos juveniles , pues esta marca de jean era lo m&aacute;ximo en esa &eacute;poca , pero la verdad la horma cambio y ya no los siento como en aquellos d&iacute;as .
 I need of tracking product no have my pant send all information pleaseWilmer hernandez wilmersimonhernandez@gmail.comW h s ven
 compre unos 34 '' y parece que fueran como 36 '' porque son grandisimos y me quedan super anchos . No me gustaron para nada
 El pantal&oacute;n est&aacute; en buenas condiciones , pero la talla indicada en la etiqueta est&aacute; errada pues la talla real es 34x32 .
 I was very pleased with the quality of the jeans and the speed of delivery . They were a last minute birhday gift , which arrived on time . It is almost impossible to purchase certain sizes of Levis 's in department stores so this is a great outlet for them .
 I had n't tried on 505 's in many years , but decided to get some since losing weight . WOW , these are way more baggy than they were several years ago . I 'm saying the cut has changed . I guess to make them more attractive to the younger generation that likes baggy pants . What a waste of money for me .
 I 've been wearing Levis for 50 years and I 've never seen anything this bad . The fabric is paper thin , the number of belt loops went from seven to five and , as others have said , the rise has been reduced . This pair was made in Bangladesh - perhaps the ones made in Mexico are better . Do n't buy these things unseen on-line . I 'll keep away from Levis altogether unless I see a pair in a store with decent quality .
 Dear Amazon.com , My last order was about two -LRB- 2 -RRB- black levis jeans 505/33 * 30/straight fit . I was surprised that the size did not fit while I am used to wear it in that particular model.Where did that problem come from ? I came to the truth that the country where the jeans is made can make a huge difference . The 505/straight fit/33 * 30 made in Egypt -LRB- as those I bought recently -RRB- are smaller than Lessotho 's which are themselves smaller than Columbia 's . I have , you can realize , the same size and model from those countries!That is a very important issue on which Amazon.com should focus . May be you will need in the clothes identification to precise the manufacturer 's country.Regards .
 i bought this pair of jeans . im from malaysia . to my suprise the jeans was made in cambodia with lowest level of quality . i cant return because the cost involved is even more than the cost of the jean . i learned tht i shouldnt be naive and trust big brands for highest level of quality . my honest review . please publish .
 This item would probably have been really nice , but I never received it . I received a similar item . The company did not respond to my cry for help until AFTER I submitted a negative comment . By then , Christmas was over and it was too late .
 4/13/07 Product used to come from Vietnam -LRB- or may still ? -RRB- but this batch came from Honduras - totally different product , different color , different material . So money spent for nothing . I will have to look harder in order to get the Vietnam manufacturer 's product . Oh , also , the Vietnam manufacture says Size 7 but the Honduras Size 7 is really Size 8 -- a whole inch larger around the waist !
 i too have been searching for the panty in the picture.i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg . there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric , but there is more like 3 inches ... yuk ! ; bhas anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured ? -LRB- the ones that we all seem to love and want -RRB- ? please email me personally if u have found them!sheemna@yahoo.com
 The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered . However , the item that is described and that I received -LRB- Halfpant -RRB- , is NOT what is pictured . What is pictured is a hi-cut pant . I did not realize this until I received the order , and was greatly disappointed . I had to send everything back . You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item . I actually would give this 0 stars , but the computer would not allow that .
 Like every review before mine , my order was wrong as well . The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated . I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design ... yes it 's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund . I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner . Is this just another big uncaring corporation ? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again .
 My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years ; however , the items received were nothing like the picture . The pictured item was exactly what she wanted , lace waistband AT -LRB- not below -RRB- her waist and high-cut leg openings ; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different -LRB- and unsatisfactory -RRB- fit . She 'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return .
 I ordered these based on the picture -- a high cut brief . These are not the ones they sent me and now I have to pay to return them ! Rip off !!! Zero stars .
 i have worn olga scoop underwear for 20 years . i will keep buying them . however , when i bought 9 pair last november from herroom , i noticed over the months that the little elastic strings were coming out of the underwear , short ones and long ones . they get all tangled up in the wash . in short , they are falling apart . i contacted herroom customer service and they told me that they would not be able to exchange as their policy is that the product must be unworn and unused and within 30 days . i wonder how one is supposed to find out that they are defective without washing and wearing them . so keep buying these underwear , but do n't buy from herroom
 I waited for months only to find out my order was not available . Would have loved to have received it !
 Very pretty . Ordered my normal size , but this product runs big . Very little elastic in the lace and creeps as you wear it .
 I ordered two of these for an upcoming beach trip . The reeked of cigarette smoke . I contacted the seller and was told that `` We 've heard this before ... '' -LRB- yet you have n't done anything about it ?? -RRB- and `` The dyes on these solid sarongs can take on a smell similar to cigarette smoke . '' Fabric dye that smells like cigarettes ? I doubt it . They did refund the cost of one sarong . Fine , but I still bought a product I assumed was new but sure did n't arrive that way.I 'm also disappointed in the size . I am a large and although this fits my waist , I wo n't be able to wear it as a dress tied at the neck like I wanted.That said , the fabric is soft and the colors are pretty so I 'm sure they 'll get used for something . Probably my kids will use them this summer .
 Too small to wear as a skirt I am a size medium and this sarong does not fit all the way around Should only be ordered if you are a size 6 or lower with very small hips
 WTH !!! I ca n't believe anyone would think it is acceptable to put such a hurtful word on a shirt . I hope nobody buys it .
 Great price and these pants are very durable ... . but the the lining causes them to be too hot for spring/summer hiking . While they are nylon , they are the `` shiny '' nylon which causing a swishing sound when you walk . I bought these for a summer scout hike . However , one trail run last weekend and I have now bought some much lighter weight pants instead . You get what you pay for with these .
 I bought these pants thinking they would be great much like othere I have bought ... They are the hottest pants I have EVER had !!! Within 5 minutes my legs are soaked!Is it because they are nylon ??? Maybe ! But , think twice before you buy these !!!
 The look of the costume as pictured seems cute , especially on the little girl who appears 3-4 years old , but the costume was n't made to fit a 3-4T . It looked like it could maybe fit a 1-2 year old , maybe . Rather small , but still cute . Had too send back .
 Our granddaughter 's brothers love to play `` Pirates , '' so I thought their 2 year old sister might like this costume to play with them . The hat and boot covers are made of such soft , floppy material that they do not hold their shape . The dress is a little difficult to get on a toddler , but perhaps as she gets older she will show an interest in the outfit . But I would not recommend this for a 2 year old .
 Like other reviews , it does n't look as pretty as in the picture . The strap looks not so nice and quite short .
 It looks really cheap . Strap is flimsy and not worth 50 $ and DEFINITELY not worth $ 250 . I got this hoping to use it as a gift but it did n't look high-quality at all . I had to return it .
 I bought this `` Prada '' handbag for my wife . We feel very disappointed with the handbag that we received . It looks very different compared to that of in the picture , especially the strap . The body of the handbag is still ok , but the strap is really pulling down the overall of the handbag . This `` Prada '' handbag looks very cheap ! : - -LRB-
 OMG ! Are they making people pay through the nose for fakes ?! On all of the authentic Prada 's I 've seen , the emblem is raised . The emblems on the Prada 's here are n't . Reading the reviews of the `` Prada '' bags here , I see nothing but complaints . I Love Amazon ... for books , DVD 's , CD 's . But , I 'll get my Prada 's elsewhere .
 I never received my first order . I contacted the seller and he did send me another one right away . Disappointed in the product however as it 's a cheap made in China bonded leather belt -LRB- does n't look like the one pictured -RRB- . The thin top layer of `` leather '' started pealing off after one wearing . I wore it once and it 's now trash . You get what you pay for .
 Though the seller is fast and reliable , I found the product to be a piece of junk in the long run . Started to fall apart after a few months . I guess you get what you pay for .
 Not worth the money , the belt will not hold up to every day use.You get what you pay for so pay more and get quality .
 Product arrived damaged . Re-shipped and never received that shipment-broken in transit so was returned to supplier before it arrived . I can only assume that this supplier is not aware of proper packaging of fragile items . What was not broken was pretty cool though .
 I thought I ordered Vanity Fair rayon panties ... these are cotton and I do not like cotton underwear . Was n't worth returning to the store .
 Earlier I reported that these had a very thin ban of elastic in the leg but I finally had to cut one open to really see and it turns out it 's not elastic but gathered material that is stretchy . I presume -LRB- and hope -RRB- it 's cotton since the product says 100 % cotton . So if you do n't want leg elastic go for it !
 Nice but they shrink a LOT . It ; s definitely possible to buy cottan panties that do n't shrink . I 'm going back to National Mosiery where the panties are better , cheaper , and DO N'T shrink .

 never receive this product , and i will resolve this situa < tion for shopping in the future , thanks
 i responded to an email asking me to rate the sale and all i can say , once again , is that I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM . i wanted to use `` zero '' stars , but i did not have that option .
 These jeans fit well , but beware ... the different colors all fit differently . I will only buy these at a store that I can try them on . The last time I ordered them one pair fit and the other two had to be returned .
 Gloria Vanderbilt jeans were always the best fitting jeans for women who were long-waisted , had a longer inseam and a more defined waist but not any more . I am completely disgusted with the changes she has made to the Amanda line of jeans . They now fit like hiphuggers with gaps in the waistband and after more than 25 years of purchasing Gloria Vanderbilt jeans , they have lost my business !
 I was so excited to see Amanda stretch jeans ! They 're very hard to find and they 're my favorite . Unfortunately , I received Classic Fit jeans instead ! I contacted the seller but received no response . After several days , I finally contacted Amazon and they resolved the issue . But I still did n't get my stretch jeans , which was a disappointment . I ordered them around Christmas , and it was a good thing they were n't a gift .
 Misses Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda Stretch Denim Jeans terrible ... I recieved seconds instead of product I paid dearly for .
 I think it is rediculus that you ca n't offer size 4 misses in any other color than black.I like the way they fit but I do n't want to wear black everyday . You sure do offer many colors in larger sizes Not everyone is a large person .
 I have purchased this item before from Beals through Amazon.com and was very happy with the product . This time , I bought two colors of the same item and they were not sized correctly as they did not fit like my other pairs that I have ordered within the past 6 months . I was very disapointed . They were made in a different country than what I had originally purchased , so maybe they were cut differently and not to the correct size .
 The jeans were to big . Very large in the legs . Did not like that at all . Cost to much to return .
 I had to return this shirt since it was way too small but if it had fit it seemed like a decent , light-weight shirt for the money .
 This towel should not be called a towel it is just a small napkin and it is linen fabric not cotton can not be used as a towel on the baptism day . . It is so small and has a lace from one side only not as shown in the picture . . It is so expensive , I regretted buying it : -LRB- The baptism date is next week & I can do nothing about it . .
 The handle was with kind of blue and pink dots - ugly.The main stick was bamboo - maybe - but was not one color but had two different colors mixed
 Looks cheap . You get what you pay for . It does not look like in the Amazon product pictures . I will look elsewhere for a quality chinese parasol . Not worth it to send this back .
 For the last few years I have been wearing Izod Khakis because of the good fit.Reading about this new matrix fit thing made me want to check them out before ordering . I went down to a nearby outlet mall whe Izod has a store . When I tried on those new khakis , I found that the waistband was two inches below my navel , and that they bulge out in the front like a balloon . Now even the sales lady agreed that the old ones which I was wearing were a far better fit.If you are over 50 and prefer pleated pants , you are probably a bit over weight like me , and I think you would not like how these things fit.This is a problem for me because I liked that I did not have to think about it , just buy Izods in my size . Now I have to find something else that looks good on me .
 Well , first , the pants run small , I always wear the same size pants , and these were a bit tight . The biggest problem , though , was that the pants wore through on the seat after only wearing them about 8 times . I work in an office , and sit at a chair all day , and the pants wore through right on the right seat pocket ! I 'd imagine it 's from sitting down all day , but still , I 've never had a pair of pants do that before , or since . I 'm pretty easy on clothes , I 've got jeans and other khakis that I originally bought in college . I wo n't be buying any more IZOD products .
 My pleated Khakis started showing wear after I wore them twice . There is noticeable wear on the back pockets and even the pleats that run down the front .
 These might be &#34; wrinkle resistant &#34; but it would have been nice if the crease &#34; wrinkles &#34; remained after washing . These are not the old IZOD quality .
 These pants are advertised as &#34; wrinkle free . &#34; They 're not even close . The Izod pants I 've picked up at the Izod Lacoste outlets are great pants . They just do n't in cuffed versions which I prefer . So I tried these pants expecting that they would have the same quality materials as the pants found in the outlets -LRB- i.e. , those pants are indeed wrinkle free -RRB- . Sadly , these pants are not nearly as good looking -LRB- and office appropriate -RRB- as the ones found in the outlet stores . Wearing these pants around the house may be OK but you 'll be totally out of place in these pants anywhere else . Caveat emptor .

They now fit like hiphuggers with gaps in the waistband and after more than 25 years of purchasing Gloria Vanderbilt jeans , they have lost my business !
 I was so excited to see Amanda stretch jeans ! They 're very hard to find and they 're my favorite . Unfortunately , I received Classic Fit jeans instead ! I contacted the seller but received no response . After several days , I finally contacted Amazon and they resolved the issue . But I still did n't get my stretch jeans , which was a disappointment . I ordered them around Christmas , and it was a good thing they were n't a gift .
 Misses Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda Stretch Denim Jeans terrible ... I recieved seconds instead of product I paid dearly for .
 I think it is rediculus that you ca n't offer size 4 misses in any other color than black.I like the way they fit but I do n't want to wear black everyday . You sure do offer many colors in larger sizes Not everyone is a large person .
 These jeans fit well , but beware ... the different colors all fit differently . I will only buy these at a store that I can try them on . The last time I ordered them one pair fit and the other two had to be returned .
 i responded to an email asking me to rate the sale and all i can say , once again , is that I DID NOT RECEIVE THE ITEM . i wanted to use `` zero '' stars , but i did not have that option .
 These might be &#34; wrinkle resistant &#34; but it would have been nice if the crease &#34; wrinkles &#34; remained after washing . These are not the old IZOD quality .
 These pants are advertised as &#34; wrinkle free . &#34; They 're not even close . The Izod pants I 've picked up at the Izod Lacoste outlets are great pants . They just do n't in cuffed versions which I prefer . So I tried these pants expecting that they would have the same quality materials as the pants found in the outlets -LRB- i.e. , those pants are indeed wrinkle free -RRB- . Sadly , these pants are not nearly as good looking -LRB- and office appropriate -RRB- as the ones found in the outlet stores . Wearing these pants around the house may be OK but you 'll be totally out of place in these pants anywhere else . Caveat emptor .
 My pleated Khakis started showing wear after I wore them twice . There is noticeable wear on the back pockets and even the pleats that run down the front .
 For the last few years I have been wearing Izod Khakis because of the good fit.Reading about this new matrix fit thing made me want to check them out before ordering . I went down to a nearby outlet mall whe Izod has a store . When I tried on those new khakis , I found that the waistband was two inches below my navel , and that they bulge out in the front like a balloon . Now even the sales lady agreed that the old ones which I was wearing were a far better fit.If you are over 50 and prefer pleated pants , you are probably a bit over weight like me , and I think you would not like how these things fit.This is a problem for me because I liked that I did not have to think about it , just buy Izods in my size . Now I have to find something else that looks good on me .
 Well , first , the pants run small , I always wear the same size pants , and these were a bit tight . The biggest problem , though , was that the pants wore through on the seat after only wearing them about 8 times . I work in an office , and sit at a chair all day , and the pants wore through right on the right seat pocket ! I 'd imagine it 's from sitting down all day , but still , I 've never had a pair of pants do that before , or since . I 'm pretty easy on clothes , I 've got jeans and other khakis that I originally bought in college . I wo n't be buying any more IZOD products .
 less than a week the bra started coming apart.the underwires poked through.i noticed one underwire end coating had broken off.i had to take both underwires out and repair them to be able to wear the bra .
 The underwires on both sides of the bra hve poked through the fabric , and the bare metal stabs like a knife . Very disappointing . I usually like Olga braa , but not this one .

 Bought this compact umbrella for my girlfriend for about $ 20 -LRB- figured I 'd spend a decent amount for better quality -RRB- and it broke the first time she used it ! Looks like I 'll go back to the cheapo umbrellas from now on !
 Oh My . It enhanced my rolls instead of hide them . It did not help having the bones sticking out above my butt , which was very noticeable . Not worth the money charged for it .
 I have small hips and I went exactly by the products sizing and the shaper was too big ... it does n't do anything for me and I could n't return it so be carful

 I failed with this product - announced as `` Cotton '' - according to attached label its 60/40 only and i hate polyester with my body.second complain - bying L size didn '' t expect to get very loose waist rubber ribbon like for beer belly and `` bottom '' part too while legs are fitting tight good.So they are falling from me . I wish to send em back if I knew how - thru my friend in the States .

 The jeans were to big . Very large in the legs . Did not like that at all . Cost to much to return .
 I have purchased this item before from Beals through Amazon.com and was very happy with the product . This time , I bought two colors of the same item and they were not sized correctly as they did not fit like my other pairs that I have ordered within the past 6 months . I was very disapointed . They were made in a different country than what I had originally purchased , so maybe they were cut differently and not to the correct size .
 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .
 I always enjoy purchasing from Amazon . However , the navy blue gold toes socks I purchased for $ 10.00 for one pair -LRB- which I thought were more expensive than I usually pay -RRB- would be of better quality . I wore them once and there was a hole in the toe that evening . -LRB- no long or rough toe nails -RRB- . I wrote to amazon and they were kind enough to send me another pair at no charge . I do wear them but I feel the quality is not as good as the gold toe socks I usually buy for myself , my husband and son . That is why I gave it a poor review . I would not purchase them again .
 do not stay up on my ankle and are not comfortable because I always have to fix them

 I knew that for less than 3 dollars i would n't get much out of it , but I bought these for that 1 % chance that the sunglasses might be half decent.These glasses are TERRIBLE quality . Most of the images posted for this item are false advertising . The customer images are mostly fake as well . The sunglasses are made up of the lowest quality plastic you can think of and then it was coated in cheap paint to look like metal.My guess is most of the reviews for this item are FAKE.Don ' t buy these , even for 3 bucks it 's not worth it .
 I was expecting to be the glasses from the 1st pix . It turned out to be the glasses from the 2nd pix . It 's pretty bad as I can not adjust to fit to my face . It will crack the lens if I attend to expand the frame ...
 Oh boy , where do I begin with these sunglasses ? Okay , I 'll make this short and sweet ... Bottom-line
 I got it with scratches on it , I did n't return it , is not worth the return , but it is waist of money .
 Very poor quality . I should have known better , but thought I would give it a try . I would not purchase this item again .
 The glasses are way smaller than they look in the picture . Too small for an average guys face -LRB- The only thing that really annoyed me about this product -RRB- . The quality is pretty bad as well , but you get what you are paying for . They look call but do n't fit . Not that great of a trade off .
 these glasses are very nice looking , but broke the first time i took them off . . the lenses popped out . . tried to put them back in , and they just keep popping off .
 Do not buy these glasses from Yagoozon since they were not the real thing and were cheap knock-offs . The size was very small and they barely fit behind my ears . They were very inexpensive so I guess you get what you pay for .
 I was really excited about these ! But once receiving them , one of the lens was n't completely set into the frames , and they were bent . Also , they are VERY dark , just fyi . The look is fantastic , but the quality was poor . But I guess thats my fault for not spending more money .
 Received sunglasses in small box . Opened the box and the glasses were smugged and quite dirty . There is a noticeable 1cm diameter scrap right in the middle of the left lenses where its completely black . Unprofessional of a company to send a damaged product . BUYER BEWARE !
 At first glance these sunglasses look really good , they are highly reflective though not chrome like it looks in the pictures . However when putting them on they are awkwardly large , and I have an average sized head/face . The frame was n't straight either , it took some bending to get them to sit level on my face , and the whole time I was worried they might snap . Also the nose rest is n't made well , even with some bending of the pads they still sit low and fall down the bridge of my nose easily . Overall , not worth the $ 4 , you do n't get what you pay for with these , you get less .
 These things are EXTREMELY flimsy and mine came so out of whack that after 10min of trying to make adjustments so they would n't sit on my head at an angle I give up . If you 're buying them for a costume or something they 'll be fine but I think they are terrible for everyday use . They might be metal but they 're so delicate it feels like they 're made out of plastic . Overall these glasses are just `` ok '' , even for $ 5 .
 You get what you pay for . Lenses where already fallen out when the package arrived . These are junk dollar store sunglasses .
 I ordered these because they looked really reflective . the ones i got were a dark grey color and barely reflective with nasty spots on the lenses . They look terrible
 i just bought these glasses and when i received these sunglasses they were bent . the ear peice was very bent and 1 of the nose peice was bigger then the other nose peice . so i was trying to bend the ear peice for it to be normal and it broke . i didnt even get a chance to wear these sunglasses because i received it all crappy . all bent and nose peice bigger then the other . it was a waste of time money and excitement . DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!
 This is the biggest rip off ever !! You are n't giving much $ $ for them , and it is still a HUGE rip off ! These are the cheapest EVER !!! The frame is tiny and flimsy , and will barely stay on your face . My pair broke within the first 24 hours of getting them in the mail . The lenses fell out WHILE I WAS WEARING THEM !!! Do NOT buy these !
 Just do that - Walk to a 99c store and purchase glasses from them - these are cheap 25 cents glasses , not worth your wear .
 These are kinda crappy , they feel like they 're going to break . They are also really small for my head . My head is big but they barely reach my ears . I would suggest not buying sun glasses off the internet .
 got these on a special online offer . received broken but contacted company and told me to return them and they will replace free of charge . i will also be reimbursed my return shipping fee . hopefully better next time .
 My husband ordered this and they were definetely flimsy and cheap they broke I believe within the first 2 daysdefinetely would not order again or advise others too
 While these glasses looked fine , the tint was much much too dark for normal use . The fact that the glasses seem as though they were meant for use on the surface of the sun should have been made very clear . However , they were very cheap and were promptly delivered so I guess I ca n't complain .
 i received the product in the standard 3-5 business day range , and was disheartened to see the shape they were in.the glasses were bent in 3 different areas , and were much too big for any human face ! but seriously , there not worth the purchase if your intention is style , as they are noticeably cheap and of low preparation quality . However , if your intent isa relaxed game of poker with friends , or a paintball match , these will suit you .
 This item arrived at my home broken . It 's not worth returning for the 4 bucks I payed for it . If only it would have been intact , the lens was mirrored , it would 've been great . Crap .
 I have bought this item before and they were the best sunglasses i have ever owned and they were the ones in the picture . they were extremely well made . recently i sat on them so i have to buy them again.I got 4 and these are the cheapest pieces of junk . the part that rests on your ears is not clear at all its black . Do not buy these . i would give them 0 stairs if i could ! thanks a lot amazon for sending me a different product than was advertised.Unsatisfied .
 So I ordered these sunglasses and another pair on the same day ... I received the other ones quite a bit faster . I was excited to try them on because I thought I would get a good deal ... wrong . These practically fell of my face because they did n't fit . The plastic things that go on your nose were n't even so it was lopsided . I am disappointed with my order and plan to return them or give them to someone else .
 I was so excited for these glasses . I 'm Asian so my face is pretty flat and these looked straight across and even , symmetrical , yadda yadda yadda . Because of all the positive reviews describing them with larger lenses -LRB- a must for me -RRB- and overall decent quality , I thought , why not ? Big mistake . When I got them one of the arms was stuck down so I almost had to break the glasses to even put them on my face . Next they do not at all look like the picture . They have a more black-metallic finish on the lenses and they are not shaped as the picture shows . The lenses are more curved at the bridge and around the face more . Also , for the life of me I can not get them to sit straight on my face . No matter what I do , the left lens remains about a cm below the right . I suggest you go to target or the gas station to get your sunglasses , before buying these .
 Bought from Yagoozon because the price was right and Prime shipping was available . What a waste of time . Unboxed them 20 minutes ago and have already printed my return label . Shame that Amazon is eating the cost of shipping this trash in both directions . What arrived did not match the product description ; the shape was similar , I 'll give them that . The mirrored finish was lame , frames were all bent to hell , no cloth bag , etc. . Seriously , if you 're tempted , make sure you order from someone other than Yagoozon because what you 'll get is garbage .
 The glasses i got arent quite as reflective as the picture but are still very shiny . They are VERY cheap tho . . One lense is constantly popping out part way and there is a sharp piece of metal poking out by the nose piece . These are great if you want a pair for your halloween costume but not for every day use . There is a spot on one lense that is not reflective and one of the bows has a kink/dent in it . neither of these make them unuseable but i expected better.Also , i took them off today and put one of the plastic ear pieces in my mouth while i got my keys out of my pocket -LRB- about 20 seconds -RRB- and the place where my tongue touched the plastic it got a strange tingly/numb sensation . I know they arent supposed to go in your mouth but this is a little worrying none-the-less . I would not buy these again .
 Bad product fast fractureI can not believe that one of the most popular products !!!!!!!!! Do not recommend purchase for several reasons . . Including : TenderDifficult cleaningInaccurate sizes . .
 I BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND AND I WAS SO EXCITED WAITING FOR THEM AND WHEN THEY FINALLY ARRIVE SURPRISE !!!!! THEY ARE TOO DARK YOU CAN BARELY SEE THE STREET , AND THEY START TO PEEL THE SECOND DAY BUT WELL I KNOW ITS A 2.00 DOLLARS SUNGLASSES IF YOU WANT THEM FOR JUST ONE DAY THEY R COOL
 The item arrived on time and as described . The price was outstanding and I was excited about getting them . They looked very nice upon arriving but after 2 days part the the tint bubbled up and chipped off near the rim . I was pretty disappointed .
 If this is for a costume then its great , but not good for day to day use , really cheap and flimsy
 These are the worst pair of glasses of any kind I have ever put on my face - the crappy plastic 3d glasses I got from watching Spy Kids YEARS ago are better quality than these . First of all , you can not see ANYTHING out of them . Driving , I could n't see the dashboard at all . Forget the tach , forget the clock , forget the radio . They 're so dark Helen Keller would have sympathy for whomever wears them.As for their quality ? The 3-year-old who was tasked with gluing them together would have a hard time explaining this one . The bridge across the top is misaligned , the center nose bridge is crooked , the left arm sits on the frame 2-3mm lower than the other , one arm is longer than the other , the right nose piece is 1-2mm lower than the other , the paint is chipping after 1 day of use , and it looks like they 're RUSTING where the arm connects with the frame hinge . They dont fit well , they 're uncomfortable , the arms are too small for my face , and I ca n't give them away they 're so cheaply made . The only positive thing to say - if that at all - is that they have two lenses and two arms.So , what use did I find for them ? I read a book on sun spots the other day , and for the first time , I actually had the opportunity to stare at the sun long enough to find the ones mentioned . Not only that , they act as GREAT eye protection when welding . No longer do I have to wear a full helmet . Lower the shades and run a bead . BAM . I 'm too poor to afford a nice welding helmet , but after these I have no need for one . Also , my dog took me on a walk -LRB- since I could n't see anything out of these -RRB- and she decided to do the nasty on the side walk . Using my newly heightened sence of smell , I was able to stop in time before stepping in it . Since I forgot anything to scoop it with , I found the glasses were PERFECT for scraping her mess into a colostomy bag . The lenses are large enough to scoop roughly half a pound of dog waste with incredible ease.TL ; DR : These glasses are great for welding , staring at sun spots and solar eclipses , and acting as a pooper scooper .
 So , I bought these waiting for the sun . First , it turns out that if you stand in a shadow , you ca n't see anything . The lenses are awful for walking around , though they might be ideal if you do a lot of welding and hate those masks you wear when you do so to protect yourself from the light . Second , they feel and behave incredibly cheaply . Not cheap as in `` Wow , I ca n't believe I got these for such a low price , '' more `` I ca n't believe I paid five dollars for these '' . The frame is chinsy and bends altogether too easily . Also , the parts of the frame that fold ? They break . Mine were destroyed before I saw the sun . Overall , this is one of the worst purchases I 've ever made , and I feel nothing but regret . Do n't make the same mistake I did !
 When I ordered these I thought I would get something resembling the picture , well no , not the case . What I got were a pair that hardly fit my face , being bent up and to the right . After fighting to bend them back into place I put them on and the glare was massive , in full sun I could not recognize people any further than 15 feet . Driving with these things on , forget it I ca n't with all the glare . Finally , I had the same branding issue others have had , please find a way to make the brand this comes from solid or list the brand as rotating .
 the only complaint I have is the big scratch on the left lens I through them right into the trash !
 I had a pair of gunmetal 80s purple aviators for a year , loved them and they were stolen . Got another pair wore them for a year . Needed a new pair and I saw these , for $ 3.60 and my 80s purple sunglasses were $ 10.00 I ordered them they got here and they are so dark I ca n't see anything . Definitely ca n't drive in them . Really tough to adjust the sunglasses to fit my face.Order came right on time and packaged nicely however .
 I love aviators but these are just trash ... There VERY cheap , and not only that but there so dark that you cant drive w them . These glasses are perfect for haloween ...
 You get what you pay for . The frame was very flimsy and the nose pad fell off within an hour of use . Do yourself a favor and buy a better pair of glasses .
 These broke the second we took them out of the box ! Piece of crap , not worth the energy to order !
 It is nothing like it is claimed to be in the description of the product . What you get is a cheap looking , totally bent glasses with finger prints all over in a very trashy looking pouch . Please dont waster your dollars on this item .
 This sunglasses arrived wrapped by plastic sheet inside a thin small cloth bag . No foams or hardcover for protections , and I found two 1-inch long hair thin scratches on one of the sunglasses.Initially hoped they 're only streaks and attempted to clean them with my newly purchased Monster ScreenClean kit , including a special MicroFiber cleaning cloth and Alcohol free spray . But , streaks stays after repeated tries then I realized they are really scratches : -LRB-
 I purchased these sunglasses after seeing all the five-star reviews ; but these glasses are n't even worth the low price I paid for them . But if you 're looking for shades to stick into snowmen , sit on a dashboard , or just collect dust on top of a desk , these are the glasses for you . ... And paperweights ... They make good paperweights too .
 Just save the 3 bucks and buy a better pair . The 1st pair we bought were scratched so we sent them back . The 2nd pair are bent so we are just going to let our kids play with them . They seem good , I read the reviews that stated they loved thwm , but really they are not . They are very cheap and flimsy .
 Saw the reviews and thought I 'd roll the dice . Unfortunately , I received a pair that has some kind of weird defect running vertically down the middle of the left lens that gives horribly fogged/unfocused vision . You ca n't tell until you put the things on , which is unfortunate . Other then that , I found it odd that I could not get the glasses to stay on top of my head when not in use - they seem to slide right off . Otherwise they look good , the mirror finish is nice .
 I was looking for a true aviator-style pair of sunglasses with a true to life mirror finish -LRB- like looking in a silver mirror -RRB- . These glasses are not those . The lens is very dark and reflective , but it is not a true silver mirror finish like you 'd see in a mirror in a store . Also , they are sort of aviator-ish , but not really . The nosepiece/bridge thing is straight , not curved as in the photo . I am returning these and will continue my quest for real mirror-looking sunglasses . The photo of the item is very misleading .
 The glasses look fine , but the frame was bent and the lens popped out the first day . The glasses are way to wide to fit my face . I do n't like them .
 I recieved this product so scraatched and beaten up that I was n't able to use them . Would not recommend nor buy again .
 I did n't except such a bad quality of sunglasses . Glass quality is very poor . Even I did n't received Sunglass cover and sunglass pouch which is shown in product description . I did n't expect this kind of poor quality product from Amazon.Product Link
 I 'll be honest , they look pretty nice . This concludes the positive portion of this review.These glasses are about as sturdy as a paper hat . One of the lenses popped out as soon as I took it out of the box . I managed to get it back in , but it 's an ongoing problem . Also , the spring hinges do more bad than good ; they 're too weak , and when you wear the glasses , you feel like they 're going to fall off your face because they sit too loosely . No amount of bending and reshaping of the frames fixed this problem for me.The lenses are perhaps TOO dark . When I drove while wearing these glasses , I found myself unable to read my own speedometer , even when I set the numbers to light up.I 'd pass on these glasses if you 're going to use them for anything other than a Halloween costume .
 I got what I paid for for 4 bucks but they are not good at all . You can see ouut of them and tfhe mirror tent fadded already .
 The lenses are way too dark . Only if you 're at the beach on a bright , sunny day will they be useful . And if you do n't have to look at any particular object for a long time . For everyday use , you have to strain your eyes to see and they end up giving you a headache . I 've worn them three times and all three times I 've ended up with a headache . They are very good-looking shades and very `` cool . '' If you 're only interested in the fashion factor then these are for you . In terms of utility , they fail .
 These are VERY small and low quality -LRB- of course , get what you pay for -RRB- . Do n't buy unless you have a small face to go with the small budget .
 I do n't expect much for a pair of sunglasses under $ 10 . I bought it mostly to block light while I am sleeping on the bus . When I first wore them , I felt dizzy . I thought maybe they were dirty so I cleaned them , but I still felt dizzy wearing them . I was baffled for a while until further examination revealed that my right lens were slightly darker the the left , causing my brains to go out of whack . I did n't bother returning them since they were too cheap
 The frame is crooked . I look silly -LRB- er -RRB- wearing them . I guess that you pay for what you receive . If there is a chance for you to get another pair of glasses instead of this ones , go for them .
 the glasses are taking forever ! they are already about a week late so ... I am just going to buy a good pair of sunglasses because they will probably get here before these sunglasses do if they even get here . .
 They were really nice sunglasses that blocked out the sun really well . But , they are very fragile glasses and broke when they fell off from the top of my head , and I 'm only 5 ' 5 ''
 The sunglasses arrived in the time specifed . The glasses were opened by an Adult and put on and the lens fell out . After replacing the lens several times the sunglasses were throwed away . I would not purchase these again . They would not even make it one day let alone one minute . I am dispointed in the product . I expected cheep due to the price but I could have purchased a pair from a dollar store and they would have at least lasted that day . Between the cost of shipping and the cost of the glasses this was diffinatly not a wise decision .
 Purchased the glasses to have a second pair . Wanted inexpensive sunglasses in this harsh , dusty environment of Afghanistan . Very low quality . One of the lenses came-out out on the first hour ; worthless . I threw them in the garbage three hours after I received them.If you need a second pair of bargain sunglasses ' the SWG UV400 - Unisex Aviator are much better choice . Take my advice and do not waste your money .
 We received the product and they looked pretty decent and the price we paid was justified . My husband left them in the car one afternoon when it was 77 degrees out . When we got back we saw that the plastic/lens had melted and smeared downward . Now they are in the garbage . They would n't have been worth $ 1 if I had only known .
 I wish I would not have lost the box and return slip . They were broken when I recieved them . In fact , they looked like they had been previously repaired . On the `` ear piece '' there was what looked like dried adhesive -LRB- i.e. JB Weld , or something like that -RRB- . If I had paid more than $ 4 for them , I 'd have spent more time digging through my trash for the return slip . But it was n't worth the hassle .
 Very thin , flexible , cheap , and irregular !! I would NOT recommend these sunglasses to anyone . I had a hard time giving them away to friends & family . I still have a pair to throw away . Waste of money ...
 Do not order these ! I got them just because they were cheap but not even worth the 3 $ I paid . There were big dark spots in the lenses that do not come off and there would be no way to wear those around without those spots driving you crazy . Also there were scratches everywhere on them . Pile-o-crap .
 The sunglasses are not as good as they look on the website , they do not have good quality plus they are too big .
 Yeah the sunglasses lasted for a little while , but they eventually BROKE one day as I was holding them in my hand the plastic piece that rests above the nostril just fell off due to one of the screws randomly falling out which lead to the demise of the entire product . YOU SUCK !
 They look exactly as pictured . Very cool . Very cheap though , and too dark to wear and be able to see . They are a bit large for a woman .
 I got these sunglasses in almost perfect condition -LRB- a little scratched -RRB- but in good shape , they were perfect , everyone was jealous and they were dark enough for my liking but about 5 days after I got them , I woke up to get them but they had weird black dots on the lens on the other side of the lens , they were clear so it wasnt a sharpie or anything . I was really disappointed . I asked my parents and they said the mirror lenses dissolved in my sweat or something O.o the nosepiece also fell off . They are really cheap and I would reccomend buying some for a little higher price at an actual store .
 these look nice but are of poor quality . Very small fit . I am rough on my glasses so these lasted about a month
 I was looking for some old school mirrored sunglasses and they are that . Heck , I think you could weld in these as they are that dark . I can not see anything unless I was in a severely bright sun .
 You can not even see through them . Even outside they are just horrible . These are the cheapest thing I have ever seen .
 very cheap but I should n't have been suprised based on price - took a chance and big failure . Would not recommend .
 I found this product to be too flimsy and cheaply made . I ca n't even see through the lenses properly because they are a bit fuzzy .
 I loved these glasses until I was wearing them and the lens popped out . I tried and tried to pop it back in but it did n't work . All in all they are good glasses but you really have to be more than careful with them .
 Although the frame is very attractive the lens are too dark . You will not be a very defensive driver using these . Maybe for a short stroll through the park ... maybe not .
 I was very disapointed when I recieved these ... they look cheap and are made cheaply . The frame was completly bent and the nose pads where completly mis-matched . What a joke ! These went in the trash right away , did n't see the point in waste money to send them back . Do n't waste your time on these !
 If I could select a ZERO star , I would . These sunglasses went straight from the packaging box to the garbage bin . I would not give these away , much less sell them . Do not waste your $ 1 or $ 2 , not worth it .
 Poor quality . They get loose the first time I wear it . By the price , at least I dont loose yo much money . I give it away and no longer will buy this from this place .
 Buy these from Private Island on Amazon instead of this seller . They are much better quality and are packaged properly for lens protection.These sunglasses came in a large carton , with little protection material . They were floating around the box in a plastic baggie.I ordered two pair . Both came with scratched lenses and a damaged frame hinge . I do n't know if it was because of the way they are packaged . They may be just poor quality from the manufacturer .
 NOT HAPPY ... probably the second , possibly third time I 'd wore these glasses , -LRB- which is only in the car on my way home from work -RRB- , one of the lens ' popped out . it goes back in , sort of , but does n't stay in . I will neither purchase anymore items from this seller , nor will I recommend them to anyone else . Not worth the shipping fee to return them . Chalk it up to lesson learned ...
 Hi guysbought these a few days back from amazon . Highy pathetic and already broken with scratches.I dont recommend them even if u get them for 1 $ .
 These arrived , looked pretty cool . Felt damn flimsy . Lens popped right out the second i put the shades on my face . These are novelty glasses , not something you should wear longer than 30 seconds .
 Broke 1st day . Lense came out . Also , The lenses are shaped a little strange to me . They are kind of elongated , that just look a littel strange compaired to all the other pairs of aviators ive had . I ordered a good pair but they would not make it in time for me to go on vacation . Im leaving today and my good pair comes in tomorrow . For the price i figured these could hold me over for the week im gone . Well , The lense popped out and the center bridge has come apart after 2 days . I know they are $ 5 but was hoping for atleast a week . They are not very reflective and not very dark . Even if they had not broke , I dont how good they would of been .
 Found this `` deal '' onlineThe glasses have a defect in the cheap lenses , and I feel the frame bending when I tried to put them on.I 'd give these away for free , but I do n't think anyone would take them .
 I was very displeased with how the sunglasses were shipped . The box that arrived at my doorstep was mangled and mostly open . The glasses themselves were not in any better repair . The crossbar was broken off one side , the lenses are two completely different shades , and they were bent nearly irreparably.I am very displeased with my purchase .
 Scratched upon arrival , not wearable . The glasses looked alright but worthless with scratched lens . Seems to be swirl marks on left lens . Replacement would be appreciated .
 When I got these I liked the way they looked , so I bought a couple more pairs to save for later . Within 3 months every pair had broken or fallen apart in some way . Save your time and buy a different brand from somewhere else
 I Had Bought This Product Because I Thought These Were Very Stylish ... I THOUGHT ... When I Got These Cheap Glasses They Came With Nothing To Carry Them , And Also The Metal Was Very Cheap Aluminum And Very Bendy ... DO NOT BUY THESE
 Maybe I got a big head , or maybe I got a small pair of sunglasseseither way to small to fit me . All well 4 bucks I 'm not heart broke about it really . I do got ta say it shipped quickly , an the saler did a good job , just wish I knew the size beofre I bought
 I bought a pair of these aviators from Private Island . I do not recommend it at all . The glasses were crap . They scratched up , and doing so took off the reflectiveness . There were no hinges , no spring , and the glasses were small . They could n't lay with the bottom of the lenses on the ground , they just fell backwards onto the top of the lenses . The glasses came low on your face too . The reason why I say came is because one day , I was putting the glasses away and with no effort accidentally snapped of an arm . This was only a week later btw . Terrible , but I have heard other sellers are better . Hopefully ?
 These glasses arrived today -- packed in a box with large bubble pillows , the glasses in a cellophane bag at the bottom of the box where they could scoot about freely during shipment , the glass lenses of course on the bottom of the box . Everyone should know that cardboard is abrasive , and sure enough , scratches on the mirror lenses . Additionally , these glasses are so cheaply made that they will not last long if you are fortunate enough to get a pair without scratches on the lenses . Additionally , they charged me more for the shipping than the glasses cost , and I ordered these cheap glasses -LRB- intended for work outside where a good pair of glasses could be damaged -RRB- on a combined order with another very good pair of Ray-Ban glasses -LRB- $ 109 -RRB- that qualified for and with the free shipping option selected . The cheap glasses arrived separately , alone , the good glasses are yet to come . But , someone added shipping charges to these cheap glasses . I would not recommend these cheap glasses to anyone , even at this price . Do n't waste your money and get hammered with shipping costs that are more than the glasses .
 There are visible marks and scratches all over the lens that wo n't come off . Should have expected it for only paying $ 5
 Very cheaply made . They broke the first time I wore them . If you are a person that is very easy on sunglasses and treats them delicately they might work fine but they were not for me .
 The sunglasses I received are very cheap , flimsy and non-durable - my local convenience store carries higher quality sunglasses . This will be my last shopping experience here . The sunglasses also fit very odd - they cover more of your forehead than they do your eyes . This makes these sunglasses uncomfortable , and it is an odd appearance when worn .
 These broke within a week . One of the eye sockets just popped out and the frame was snapped in half . Spring for a more expensive pair .
 I just got these sunglasses in the mail . The seller was Private Island . I saw these were about 4 bucks so I figured I would throw them in with my purchase . I would not recommend them . They 're not worth it . They came in a nice small box and when I opened it the sunglasses were in a small baggy so I was thinking they should have been safe but it turns out it has a nice large scrape on one lens and the other has circular scratches around it . The adjustable nose pads are completely misaligned ! The frame is bent on the top of one lens so it 's at the point of popping out . Overall terrible construction . The lenses are dark like others have said but they hurt your eyes to look through them . Some say `` you get what you pay for '' I say they 're definitely not worth it even at the low price .
 Length :
 Put these actually fairly nice looking shades on for the first time , 15 minutes later , noticed something was piercing my nose . Low and behold the nose piece was gone , and along with it the $ 3 I paid for them . Piece of crap , but hey , what did I expect . Derp !
 I love the look of these glasses , and the shipping was expedited BUT they were so scratched when I recieved them I cant even wear them : -LRB-
 the are not worth buying save your $ 3 and go buy something betteri knew i was buying cheap sunglasses but i did not expect them to be that bad
 I bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday . When they arrived I was shocked at how crappy they are . They are pretty much plastic ... the cheapest plastic I 've ever seen . I gave them to my boyfriend as a `` gag gift '' when honestly they were meant to be a real gift . I was very disappointed . Especially after all of the nice reviews . Unbelievable .
 These aviators are pretty good at blocking the sun ... and just about everything else . I 'm pretty sure they were designed for actual aviators , or maybe cloud enthusiasts . I have to admit , even though I ca n't see my speedometer while driving with these , the clouds in the sky look awesome with these . I 'm not about to become a weatherman because of these glasses , though.I ca n't in good conscience recommend these unless you meet one of the following criteria :1 -RRB- You fly airplanes and have a cool nickname like `` Goose `` 2 -RRB- You routinely leave work at sunset and drive west for long periods of time to get home3 -RRB- The eye doctor dilated your eyes and you hate those dark roll-up `` glasses '' they give you4 -RRB- You do n't like seeing other cars while you drive5 -RRB- You never pay attention to details and just care about an object 's outlineFor $ 5 it 's hard to be too disappointed . I did n't get the same pair of glasses as any of the pictures , but they more closely match the first pair of sunglasses from that one guy 's video review . They still physically look great , although I guess it really depends on your style .
 I received my glasses on time but thats no surprise with the quality of the glasses . I would ship those out as fast as possible just to be rid of them too ! I opened the package , put the glasses on my face and a couple walking steps later the lens fell right out . Lasted a whole 3 min -LRB- thats including the time it took to open package ! -RRB- Worst purchase yet .
 `` Aviator Sunglasses Silver Frame Mirror Lens `` This item is look good and cool in the photo.However , I think it is suitable with its price .
 These sunglasses were made very cheaply . When they arrived , the lens were n't even placed right in the lens holders . No time to review or contact seller concerning this as we were leaving the next day for Disney . So my son wore them anyway on the trip in hopes that the lens would not fall out of the frames . Well , he was n't that lucky cause out it came . When he tried to put the lens back into frame the frame then broke ! In the garbage can is where they went . Wo n't try and get off cheap next time ! And I would advise everybody the same .
 Pros
 I got these for my bridesmaids this past summer -LRB- June 2010 -RRB- and they were great ! They came with cloth cases and everything . They were just the right size and were great quality for an even better price . Since I lost my pair and have the tendency to lose sunglasses somewhat regularly , I recently decided to grab a new pair and two back-ups . -LRB- May 2011 -RRB- BAD IDEA . The price was still low but it was no wonder . I got three cheap , crooked , not even good enough to be costume quality sunglasses and not surprisingly , no cloth bags . The next time I need a new pair , I will NOT be buying them from here . BUYER BEWARE !!!
 I purchased a pair of these aviators knowing they would n't be of the highest quality rim wise , but at least as the picture presents them to be . Not mirrored lenses at all . And to top it off the seller emailed me after I left a poor review saying to fix the mistake they would send 2 pairs of glasses as they were as described if I removed my negative feedback . After seeing their willingness to correct their poor product , I removed my feedback . H2W never followed through with their promise . DO N'T LISTEN TO THEIR LIES , CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SELLER .
 i was actualy exited about getting these sunglasses ... they looked awesome on the picture but when i got them ... one of the handle bars on the side looked a little bent . . i opened them and they BROKE rite in my hand ! HORRIBLE !
 These pair of sunglasses look very cool until you wear them in water and the tint starts to dissolve ! And not to mention I snapped them in half with the force of a 6 month old . But you get what you pay for , after all , they 're only a couple of bucks.haha
 i think it can use only blind person , because it is so dark that you became blind ! it is not usabale !
 Actually these glasses are a piece of junk . You can get a better pair of cheap sunglasses at the Goodwill Store . As soon as I opened the plastic wrap and took the glasses out , the nose piece bent . You get what you pay for and if you want CHEAP CHEAP SUNGLASSES these are for you .
 the aviater glasses were very poor quality . I would not order them . But the did n't cost much either . . i wish the almost free website would not promote products they had not previewed .
 the glasses i recevied had a few scratches on the lenses that were visable from the inside of the glasses an the nose pads were all bent up i had ordered some before from this dealer an they were perfect no scratches nothing they fit snug idk what happen this time but i dont think i will be buying any more glasses from this dealer do to the condition that the glasses were in this last time
 These were so bent up and out of shape when I got them . They were shoved inside a box the size of , and I kid you not , a little bigger than a toilet paper roll . The plastic ear covering on one side is cracked and pulled out longer than the other side that no matter how much you try to reshape them , they are still crooked . If I could have given 1/2 star , I would have . And then they were suppose to come with 2 pair of complimentary sunglasse , I only received one . But since the 2 pair where in such a tiny box , maybe I should be thankful the seller did n't try shoving a 3rd pair in there .
 when i recieved the glasses the lens fell out of the frame , and they didnt fit my face at all . they were really a waste of money . i wouldnt recommend them . this is the first product i have ordered off of amazon.com that i was absolutely dissatisfied with.order at your own risk .
 I am now 39 years old and the only person in my entire family that does n't wear glasses . In fact , at the latest , everyone in my family wore glasses by the age of 27 . I am now 12 years past that age and my eyes are just as good now as they have ever been . I contribute a lot of this to the fact that I religiously started wearing high quality sunglasses at the age of 13 . It was actually my family eye doctor who told me to do this when I asked him if I too was going to have to wear glasses some day as I recognized very early that everyone in my family wore them . He told me that it comes down to 2 things , genetics and how you treat your eyes . In other words , some people are just screwed and genetically have bad eyes and some people wind up getting bad eyesight because they simply did n't take good care of their eyes . He told me that there was a very good chance that I would have to wear glasses someday as bad eyesight obviously ran in our family . He told me the best thing I could do to put that day off as long as possible was to buy a pair of high quality sunglasses , one that protects against ALL UV radiation and wear them every time I went outside and that includes cloudy days . Most people dont think ahead health wise , at least not at that age . We think were infallible when were young , that nothing will happen to us , but for some reason I listened to what the eye doctor said that day and I wound up purchasing a pair of Revo 's with my paper route money . That was 1985 and ironically it was the same year that Revo started making sunglasses . I still remember going into the sunglasses store and seeing this huge cardboard REVO advertisement that focused on UV radiation protection , exactly what my eye doctor had told me . So I wound up going with Revo and have been buying sunglasses from them ever since , over 25 years . It was a LOT of money for a 13 year old kid with nothing but a paper route but I purchased them anyways -LRB- Probably one of the reasons why I so vividly remember it , lol -RRB- . Anyways , it kills me when I see cheap sunglasses like this being so popular as they do very little in regards to protecting your eyes from UV radiation . I have done a lot of research on this topic since I first purchased those Revo 's and make no mistake about it , that eye doctor was spot on . UV radiation damage may be very slow , but it does happen each and every time you go outside without proper sunglasses on and again it does n't even have to be sunny out . You add up that damage over 30 , 40 , 50 years and it quickly becomes significant . So do you and your eyes a favor and stick with quality sunglasses that block 100 % of UV radiation . On top of UV radiation you also have high-energy visible -LRB- HEV -RRB- radiation . High energy visible radiation is actually in the visible spectrum and is located at the violet or blue band ranging from 380 to 530 nm . The best way to block HEV radiation is buying lenses with colors such as bronze , copper and reddish-brown as those colors significantly block blue light.If your one of the people that have purchased these sunglasses then dont fret , you only paid a couple bucks for em . Drop em on the ground and stomp on em . As for the people that think these sunglasses look cool ... well , trust me on this one , a quality pair of aviator glasses from companies like Ray Ban , Revo , etc. look a 1000 times cooler than these do . They may cost more money but ask yourself what value you put on your eyesight and you will quickly realize that such sunglasses are worth every last penny and then some.Again , do your eyes a favor and just say no to cheap sunglasses . Make no mistake about it , you will eventually pay the price for wearing cheap sunglasses .
 When I Bought these I thought do to several reviews I thought that I was buying from a respectable seller instead when I open my mail box what do I see a cracked pair with some small scratches and dirt covering the edges with a dirt encrusted smudge on the left one did not include the tag like most reviews said . I have had two other pairs that from experience I know they are very hard to crack and to scratch them you need to rub it in a silicone based substance -LRB- sand , concrete , hard plastics , etc -RRB- My first pair i dropped them from the third story of my aunt 's apartment complex into the parking lot and one lens was very badly cracked and scratched part of it broke out the other lens was cracked the other pair my kid brother lost . I dropped the second pair several times on hard surfaces even concrete from a 2 story balcony and it only had a few Small scratches . If you are reading this make sure you do n't buy anything from private Island they are horrible sellers i made an effort to contact a person to discuss exchanging for another pair and they have n't contacted me even though I sent an email awhile back I am horribly discussed with their attempt to make a quick buck if your a customer who expects good service for your money do n't buy even if it was cheap
 i never thought this product will be like this , i feel sorry for the money i paid on it , the finish of the painting is bad and the lens was scratched , think several times before you try to buy it , it was out of expecatations .
 I believe I ordered these in late June or July of this year . Never got them . If they were n't so inexpensive , then I 'd actually care but oh well , I guess I wo n't buy from these people again .
 For the price , the sun glasses seemed like a bargain . Unfortunately , you pay for what you get ... I can safety say they 're the cheapest sunglasses I 've ever purchased .
 Not only was the sunglasses the opposite of what I ordered , but it was sent to the wrong address and it didnt even get to that address in time .
 yeah i know i only paid 6 bucks for these glasses ... but still , for being brand new they should not have came out of the packaging scratched . They had tiny scratches on the lenses by the nose bridge , - pretty noticeable too . Totally not fixable as the mirror finish was scratched . Otherwise good buy if they send you ones that are not scratched . I bought these after reading all the reviews of people who had bought these and were happy with them . They fit the face well . The mirror finish is perfect for looking at people without them knowing you 're looking at them.To the makers
 Thought that these glasses were perfect for my trip ... took a pair of glasses that looked good and thought it would survive throwing in and out of a beach bag . The glasses were not ruff n tuff , it broke easily .
 USELESS , PLASTIC , TWISTED , DEFECTIVE , THE WORST QUALITY , SELL THESE GLASSES IS A LACK OF RESPECT TO THE CONSUMER ... DO NOT BUY this crap , THE TRUTH IS THAT I SUGGEST TO AMAZON EXECUTIVE NOT SELL THIS CLASS OF ... CRAP !!
 this item is cheap i kno but wow i ca n't believe i bother wasting 3 bucks on this poop aviators i could got me 3 whopper juniors instead of this wow what a wast when i got these glasses i got it out of the cloth and bam there 's a fatty scratch on one of the lenses off the bat wow u serious are u guys selling use junk and passing it as new u cheap son of a gun i 'm never buying anything from this company u suck seriously selling broken and used products to people
 i havent bought this item but it looks like ice cream with king kongs throw up in it . so do not buy item
 THEY MAKE IT SEEM THESE ARE ACTUAL `` AVIATOR '' SUNGLASSES THEY 'RE NOT THEY CHEAP KNOCK OFF PIECES OF CRAP DO N'T BUY !!!!!!
 We bought these for our wedding . We purchased 10 pairs and the were misdelivered by UPS . Amazon tried to track them down , but could n't . Apparently , they will maybe get sent back and credited . After that , Amazon would not help send a replacement order . So after an hour and a half on the phone , I 'm still without glasses and only got voicemail for H2K . Bottom line , when something goes wrong with Amazon , Amazon and UPS can do nothing ...
 I just got these sunglasses for a 12 year old and he is 5 foot 9 and these glasses look like a joke . Now i know that aviators are supposed to be big but these are just rediculos and not only that but it took a week or more to get to my house . it might not be a lot of money but it will definetly disipoint you like me . please listen to me . DO NOT BUY THESE GLASSES OR SHOULD I SAY GOGGLES >
 i looked to wear this so badly but it was such a mess to try and get it out out the cardboard tube which is bnot well protecting it . it arrived scratched but i was happy to see them refund my money .
 You get what you pay for with these . UV protection is not 100 % . They keep falling off of my face when I put them on .
 These sunglasses are HUGE !!!! they fall off my face as soon as i put them on . Also the frame is scrap metal and easily breakable.However the uv protection is great and the shipping was fast . If you are looking into buying these sunglasses you are getting what your paying for , trust me ...
 Brought these glasses for my Halloween costume for which was fine.Glasses are not well made and would not last with frequent wearing .
 lens quality - poorframe quality - acceptableframe initial bend - poorglasses arrived bent totally ridiculously so they did n't fit my face at all , it was n't in issue to re-bend them as the frame is made of a reasonable material , although it did n't work out of the box . The lens quality is quite poor as it darkens the incoming light very significantly -LRB- it 's difficult to see my radio during mid-day in Arizona -RRB- and at the same time does n't feel like it 's blocking much light.Overall if you are wearing them for style they take some work to get right but work fine , if you are using them as actual sunglasses they 're not the best
 They were cheap , and that 's the only thing keeping me sane . Poor materials , poor design , and poor manufacturing . Enough said .
 This product did not last long . I simply kept an optomistic view to it as `` You get what you pay for . '' they did not fit well anyway and broke in no time . Never again .
 not impressed ... I would not ever buy this product again even though they are so cheap . Good luck and keep looking .
 After finally getting the package from the mail -LRB- Because of Labor Day -RRB- I opened it up and found the sunglasses inside a cloth case . That 's was a plus , however the sunglasses themselves are cheap , you will get what you pay for . The frame was crooked , and the arms were not sitting at the same level . One was higher than the other . The lenses are pretty good -LRB- not completely mirrored -RRB- .
 I bought these thinking they were silver , like it says , but they are n't silver and are barely mirrored.Also they broke after I first opened them.I 'm never buying from Private Island again.EVER!Honestly , they took more than a week to arrive , and if I could have given it no stars , I would 've .
 they arrived scratched and i was very disappointed , so be careful when you order them , they are not expensive so there is no point in returning them at all when the shipping will cost you as much as these sunglasses cost ...
 I bought them to be part of my Lt. Dangle Halloween costume . The price was dirt cheap and so was the quality . Which was fine with me , I only needed it for my costume and had no intention of ever using them again . It was funny , when I got them in the mail there was a tag on them that said `` High Quality . '' They were everything but . If you 're just looking for something cheap , this is exactly what you want . If you 're looking for a pair of aviator 's to actually use and wear on a regular basis , I 'd find something else .
 I bought these to replace a previous pair from a different company that was starting to look its age . I saw these and figured that they 'd be cheap and poor quality , but not the utter piece of trash that I received . It arrived in a box with no protective packaging , with fingerprints and hairline scratches all over the lenses . When I tried them on , I found that the hinges were stuck shut due to a manufacturing error and I had to force them open to even get them on my face . Once they were seated on my nose , I noticed that the lower wire of the bridge was completely crooked with one side about 1/8 of an inch above the other . It flat out looked ridiculous . When I was putting them back into their cheapo provided case to ready it to ship back to Amazon for my refund , one of the drawstrings pulled out . They had n't even taken the time to tie the drawstrings to make sure that did n't happen . The case is cheap plasticy velvety material with ICED OUT graffiti-ed on the side in white . Looks like a piece of trash . From what I read of the other reviews , it seems that you can expect your lenses to come pre-scratched and covered in fingerprints , because what customer does n't want that , right ? I 'm sure not every pair of these sunglasses has a bent bridge/frame/whatever , but its kind of telling of the overall quality of the product that something this messed up is let out of the Chinese factory from whence it came . Hate to say it , but just buy a $ 10 pair from WalMart.To the manufacturers
 When I saw these sunglasses I was thinking okay , pretty cheap , so ordered them , but when I got them I was completely wrong to thinking they would be awesome . To start they were very flimsy and uncomfortable , they were very dark and you could n't see a thing , and even worse off after only 2 days of using them the mirror on the lenses started to come off , so now there is this big giant splotch on one of the lenses where the mirror used to be . I recommend you save that 2 bucks these cost not including shipping , and go buy yourself a candy bar , you 'll get more satisfaction with that !!
 I was not satisfied with this product beacuse the lens was scratched it made me very mad that it was like that
 The item have the quality of a corner store . Also the item arrive broken , this is the worst buy in my life !
 I bought a pair from seller named Yagoozon since they had prime shipping , bad idea . I did not get the great aviators that all the good reviews are about , or the ones pictured in the description . Instead I received a child sized pair of sunglasses which nobody in their right mind would allow a child to wear . The sunglasses are flat they do n't conform to your head whatsoever so the middle will be against your eyebrows but the edges are jutting 2 inches away from your head , The arms of these sunglasses are tiny little metal sticks which only open 70 degrees unless you bend the hell out of them , so essentially unless your head is the size of a tennis ball you will have to bend them right from the box . The part that the arm connects to is just a little screw which is actually rusted out and brown , unbelievable . Also , I would n't trust the tinting on these things either . When you look at the back of the lens it looks like your looking into a puddle of dirty oil , all I see is rainbows . I 've never seen a pair of sunglasses anywhere near this cheap in my life , even the $ 8 ones at any gas station are leaps and bounds better than this joke I just received , I 'm actually heading to the gas station now to pick some up cuz these pieces of junk are getting returned tomorrow .
 THE DESCRIPTION SAYS SPRING HINGES THESE ARE THE FARTHEST THING FROM SPRING HINGES POSSIBLE . HOW COULD AMAZON LET THESE PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH SELLING SOMETHING THAT IS N'T ACTUALLY ADVERTISED . HOW ABOUT SOME PRODUCT CONTROL PEOPLE .
 This product is cheaply made . It did n't come in a carry bag it only came in some sealed plastic with tons of fingerprints all over the lens . You get what you pay for .
 First , the build quality is n't bad . What you see is what you get . They are very reflective.However , they 're so dark , even under full noon sunlight , it becomes a problem . And it 's not just that they 're dark ... they seem to remove a lot of contrast , making everything look very ` flat ' . I tried driving with these on a very bright day and had to take them off ... it was becoming dangerous . It makes it difficult to pick out details on the road . I bought two pair of these , and never wear them . I wo n't buy them again .
 I was a little disappointed with this product . Rather than being a silver mirrored finish they are a black mirror finish and that was not what I really wanted .
 I bought a pair of these sunglasses a couple of months ago from WorldWideDynasty Inc and absolutely loved them . I cam back and ordered a second pair last week using the same Amazon page and this time they were sold by Yagoozon . The Yagoozon glasses came with a broken frame and a scratched lens even though they were supposedly new . My previous pair were good quality glasses , but this pair was cheapest of the cheap . The frame is just really cheap wire .
 They arrived all bent out of shape and the lenses fell out within the hour . Waste of money . Just go get some at the gas station , at least you can try them on first .
 You get what you pay for . These sunglasses are no good . Bought them because it looked like a good deal . Do n't make the mistake I made .
 I got these for my husband after he 'd sat on yet another pair of sunglasses . -LRB- His butt is the destroyer of eye-wear -RRB- They were very flimsy , but he looked like he could have been an `` extra '' on top gun . He wore them mostly to make me laugh and `` look cool '' . But they have also already been broken .
 I ordered these 8/14 . Have worn them 3 times and the lense has alreay fallen out . Disappointed i really like these glasses.Will order somewhere else next time .
 Pretty useless , glass practically popped out as soon as I got them . The lens are very dark to see through . I guess , what did I expect for under $ 3 . I gave them to a homeless guy .
 The same day I received these glasses they broke . Not by my negligence but a bad product . I have sent multiple emails to this company and no response DO NOT BUY !
 not just bad , DANGEROUS . previously bought these and they were fine the new shippment the lenses are so dark its impossible to see ! THATS DANGEROUS
 Sometimes inexpensive is just cheap and these glasses fit this category ! You ca n't even see through these glasses , they are so dark . Would not recommend to anyone .
 HORRIBLE PRODUCT i REPEAT DO IT GET THIS AT ALL , i got it and the left side of the ear part was messed up was for the right side . Is completely cheap and flimsy
 These aviators suck . They are shown as having spring hinges ... which they do not . They are of poor quality overall and are worse quality than you would get at the 99 cent store . They are going back to where they came . Overall hugely dissatisfied . I would not recommend these .
 These aviators are not very reflective at all . They do not have a silver look to them either . They came all bent up . These glasses do n't look like the pictures with the aviator logo displayed . They have more of a black look to them than silver .
 I love aviators and all , but the first time they slipped off my face they broke , and not the lenses but the arm broke off , not gon na buy from these people ever again .
 The aviator sunglasses I received are too large and keep falling off my face . Also there seems to be an alignment problem . The glasses look crooked when they rest on my face.The lenses look good though and they cut off a fair amount of light and UV.Highly disappointed with the overall product .
 The video review of this is item is dead on . I bought a pair of these sunglasses from Gravity Trading and they were amazing . They fit great , looked awesome , and felt like a quality product . Unfortunately , I lost them on vacation , so I decided to order another pair -LRB- why not ? they 're only 3 dollars -RRB- . I saw the video review of this and wanted to avoid Private Island , but for some reason , they were the only ones who came up for this same product the second time around . I decided to take a risk and buy from them , and I regret it . The shades feel cheap , the glasses are huge , and they fall down my face -LRB- I have a fairly large head , so this is rather impressive -RRB- . I do n't plan on ever wearing them . I finally found Gravity Trading 's page and bought another pair from them -LRB- the price has since gone up to about $ 5 , but it 's still well worth it -RRB- . I should be getting those in the mail within the next few days . Until then , I 'd rather go without sunglasses than wear the ones from Private Island.UPDATE
 After reading all of the glowing reviews for these whack glasses I have come to the conclusion that the reviewers are either from 3rd world countries or have never owned a pair of sunglasses before . You get what you pay for . And for 3 bucks and some odd cents , ya do n't get much . These are basically sunglasses that you win at a carnival during a game of balloon pop . They are extremely poorly made , mine came scratched AND they sent them in an envelope with ZERO protective casing !!! It should also be noted that the glasses you get are NOT the ones pictured . The ones in the picture are silver looking but the ones you get are its ugly twin , dull and flat gray . Sure , these may be cool for Halloween if you 're going as a hipster or Tom Cruise in Top Gun , but if you seriously intend on wearing these regularly , you will look like a complete d-bag . Seriously . Do n't buy these , they are not worth the paper the money is printed on .
 THERE IS NO WAY IN A HELL A NORMAL PERSON CAN RATE THIS 5 STARS ! The glasses creek when you open them . They feel like flimsy plastic able to break at any given moment . I could see absolutely NOTHING ! There is no use returning them because it cost you more than twice as much the cost for shipping both ways . I have no idea why the rating is five stars , maybe for people who wanted to wear them ONCE then throw away but if not DO NOT BUY
 Lousy functionality , in my opinion . They filter out much too much light . I work outdoors and the first day I wore them I had to remove them because I could n't see what I was doing . Not bad in full sunlight but when one gets in any kind of shadow it 's way too dark . The same with driving wearing them .
 These glasses are scratched all over and on the lenses . They also appear to be used . Do not order these . It will waste you money .
 These glasses were cheap in price but even cheaper in quality . it 's not even worth it , the lens were warped where the tinting did n't stick and the arms are sharp at the ends and hurt your ear
 it took them two weeks to get here and they are not the ones that the show in the picturesother then that they work i guess
 These aviators are cheap for a reason ... they feel very flimsy , the lens is much smaller than real aviators -LRB- which I compared to my own -RRB- and most importantly , while the lens is mirror-finish , you can still see through them at your eyes . I wanted something where you could not see through at my eyes ... a true mirror lens . Upon inspecting them for less than five minutes I tossed them in the garbage . Oh well ... $ 4.00 down the drain , who cares ...
 I will NEVER purchase anything from Amazon again . The glasses were broken and Amazon refused to send me another pair . The glasses suck and made very cheap . Lesson learned .
 They 're pretty , but flimsy . Very light construction . The lens is not really mirrored , so if you attempting to hide your eyes , forget it . It would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap Chinese knock-off . Gave them two stars simply because they are good looking , but cheap -- and they feel that way on your face .
 Unfortunately I did n't listen to the reviews and it had alot of bad reviews . I took a chance and there .
 These sunglasses arrived in the mail today , far under my expectations . I was anticipating a cheap pair of glasses , I 'll give them that , but not horribly disfigured . The two lenses are almost a centimeter out of line , one bends inwards as well as outwards , and one of the lenses are tilted downwards . The two ` tear drops ' are not symmetrical , and the two arms are n't at the same height . Unless you want to look like you 've lived in Mexico your whole life , or you tried to make these yourself , do n't buy these glasses . They are also not of ` Aviator ' brand . They look nothing like the pictures ! Do n't even ` try ' them - shipping them back will cost more than the product itself . They are generic , and extremely bad . For you 're own good , Do Not Buy These ... ` things ' .
 Received these glasses fairly quickly because I use Amazon 's Free Two Day Shipping.However , these glasses are huge . When we put them on , the sides of glasses barely touch the side of my head !
 These glasses look and feel great for the price , but glare on the lenses leaves them almost useless in the sun . Visibility and contrast are so greatly reduced that I would not feel comfortable walking in these glasses let alone driving in them .
 I read many reviews saying that these sunglasses were made with very good quality considering the price . I guess thats true , but if you want some sunglasses that are actually meant to be worn , dont purchase these . they look similar to the sunglasses in the picture but are not exactly the same.Not only is the quality terrible , but as I took my sunglasses out of the wrapping i noticed a scratch on one of the lenses ! I dont care how much you pay for a pair , they should not arrive already scratched . If it was small and unnoticeable , i probably wouldnt care as much . But its not , its big and right in the middle of the left lens.The only reason i give the product two stars is because it shipped very fast , and came in a small thick cardboard box . I honestly think the box was made with better quality than the sunglasses . Overall , NOT A GOOD PURCHASE .
 Avoid at all costs ! Cheap material . Reminds me of the crappy party favors you get when you 're 8 ; will bend and break easily , and shame on you if you wear these on -LRB- Airforce -RRB- duty .
 The glasses were great ! although the arm did break on my first day of use . But it would cost more than the sunglasses are worth to send it back .
 Lenses very dark and very big . Good build quality , but the nose cushions are tiny -LRB- way too small for the large size of the glasses -RRB- and I find them uncomfortable , and not a good fit . Good for a cheap secondary pair of sunglasses I guess
 got these for my bf to play softball , good price but less than dollar store quality for sure . the lenses came out with in a week of getting them . guess i cant expect much for this cheap /
 For a couple bucks you ca n't expect these glasses to be of any quality . And they are not . They arrived with some rust on the frame and the lenses are wonky , they do n't sit evenly on my face and they are painful to wear . In short , these glasses suck big time . Live and learn I guess ...
 I was really excited about these . They are really cute and they were on sale , well as my title states you get what you pay for . I wore these for 1 day and the lense popped out . From then on it would not stay in place and would randomly pop out . I ordered a second pair for my husband and the same thing happened . Very dissapointed
 It 's so DARK you ca n't drive safely with these nonpolarizing lens and even worse , bits of sun glares reflects off the back of lens into my eyes . But for fashion , EPIC MEAL TIMES , BABY ! lolI 've learned my lesson . Spend more and get POLARIZED lens , which are worth every penny , compared to this .
 The lens are very dark to see through . Poor but You get what you pay for.P.s . Worst sunglasses I ever bought !
 The sunglasses I received do not have end pieces , as shown in the picture . The temples are connected directly to the frame
 Glasses arrived broken . Hinge completely bent , glasses unwearable . They were a little surprise christmas gift - I 'm completely embarassed . Do n't recommend at all .
 These broke after like 2 seconds . What a waste of money it was to buy these glasses ! Wish I had n't .
 Just like so many other people on here have said , these glasses are not &#34; mirror &#34; at all . They are relatively dark compared to other cheap sunglasses but when you buy something online you anticipate the item to be as described and shown in the pictures . I 'd give one star but for the price I 'm going to keep them and try to get a different pair that is actually mirrored .
 Even on a sunny day these glasses are so dark you can barely see through them . You get what you pay for .
 cheap piece of crap , broke instantly . i bought this for a halloween costumes , but it didnt make it past the first few minutes of the party .
 The bridge was not aligned correctly and gave me a lopsided look . When I tried to fix it , the frame bended , rendering it useless . I guess I paid for what I got .
 Awful purchase . Glasses were cheap , flimsy , lop-sided , and generally uncomfortable . They do n't even really off up much in way of sun/glare protection for your eyes . Do n't buy .
 I bicycle alot and this product ca n't handle you moving your legs the way you do when your bicycling and it ripped at the seam in the crotch putting it on for the first time and then it became far worse when I started peddling . I ca n't say I would buy this again since it is of such shoddy quality .
 this product seems very cheap and the sizing is way off . 3x more like a large I returned the item immediately and I do not recommend this .
 I bought this for my boyfriend who has a 30 inch waist and they blow out when he tried them on . He never even got to wear them in the rain The worst part is I ended up giving him the set I bought for my self which were larger but now I do n't get one and I will not order another because I should n't have to pay shipping when the origional product is weak and 3 sizes to small I was very dissapointed .
 This suit would be a great value if the size were true.I ordered a 4x and it was about the size of a 2x . length would of worked , but the jacket was super tight in the back , shoulders and pit area . Overalls would not go well over any cloths really . Honestly the material seemed to be stout and overall the suit was of good quality , just WAY undersized .
 I purchased this in 3x and TRIED to wear it this past weekend . Everything I wear is 2x , so I ordered this in 3x so it would fit over my clothes and possibly a jacket . It is at best a 1x . I could not get the jacket over my arms or shoulders and the pants I had to squeeze into . The first time I sat down they ripped right up the crotch . I had 2 guys on my boat that said the were large and 1x and the other two suits I purchased were 2x and neither of them could fit into them . These are way smaller than the described sizes.I just wasted my money on the three of these rain suits .
 The pants ripped after first use and the straps kept slipping . This is an awful product .
 Not sure if it is really Prada ... it is way too small ; even for a child that is 10 . I got it for pre-tween , and it 's like a little pouch . You ca n't even wear it on your back like a normal backpack ... the straps/handles are not like a regular backpack . If you are looking for something for school or even to walk around the mall with , this is NOT it .
 I bought this as a gift the picture on the website is misleading , they need to put dimensions on the site when they said small they were n't kidding . If your lucky you might be able to fit a pack of cigarettes in there . No woman I know carry that little in their purse , I am very unhappy with the lack of dimensions on the site and the picture of it makes it look large enough to actually carry something useful other then a pack of gum .
 I WANT TO RETURN PRADA BAG !! NOW . . NO USEI THINK PRADA BAG IS A BIG BUT VERY SMALL.AND NOT GOODSSO , I WANT TO RETURN PRADA BAG !!
 SPEND YOUR MONEY on a NON-REVERSIBLE ! I will NEVER buy another reversible . I thought that Tommy may produce a better belt ... no different then the Walmart versions .
 I ordered a t-shirt for a young Marine who was deploying . It was to be a send off gift . The shirt arrived on time but it was not the one I ordered . All of the paperwork identified the correct shirt but the item sent was wrong . I was tremendously disappointed and all efforts to correct the error have been unanswered . I will no longer purchase from either this company nor Amazon in the future .
 I ordered my normal bra size and the cups are too big . I would suggest if you order this bra go down a cup size .
 I ordered my normal bra size and the cups are too big . I would suggest if you order this bra go down a cup size .
 Not what I wanted . I should have researched it better . Mostley my fault , you get what you pay for .
 BUY brown belt and I am very dissatisfied with the product because it THE PRODUCT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PICTURE OF THE AMAZON , TO THE BEGINNING BECAUSE THE COLOR ME LLEGO MAS IS A DARK BROWN TO THE IMAGE OF WHAT IS THE SECOND TOMMY LOGO ON ANYTHING NOT APPEAR IN THE IMAGE OF THE MIO HAS THE LOGO OF METAL AND THE IMAGE TO SEE A SAMPLE LOGO D AMAZON WEB . There is no doubt that the material is excellent BUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRODUCT ARE NOT . Please note this comment to buy a belt of brown
 I 've received this item and I was shocked that it is not the same as the picture , the belt has the same model number as described but the buckle and the leather keeper loop are different .
 I bought a belt like this about two years ago , I was really happy with the quality of this product , I decided to get a new one to have a spare but I was surprised because the quality is not so good as the quality from the previous one . I do n't recommend to buy this item anymore .
 I bought this for my husband and it was short for the length , compared to other 36 '' belts it was only 34 '' long . we returned it .
 I 'm not a big product-reviewer , but when I feel strongly enough about an item , I feel obligated to let others know.The quality and look of this belt are both just fine . No issues there . My issues with this belt are the results I have from wearing it for just about a month ... This belt single-handedly ruined 3 of my best , brand new pants -LRB- 2 were dockers premium , one was Jos. A Bank -RRB- . How 'd it happen ? Well I did n't figure it out until it was too late . The beltloops were stretching and eventually the colored fabric -LRB- one pair was chocolate-colored , one was blue , and one was khaki -RRB- stretched to the point of breaking , revealing white fabric underneath . The white fabric is sticks out and is easily the focal point of the pants now , rather than the sweet fabric and color that used to be . This happened to all the beltloops on the back of the pants in all 3 cases.It happened because the belt is about .5 cm too wide . For whatever reason , pants are not MADE to fit belts this size !! I 'm about a 33-32 , so pretty average , and this freakin belt has cost me way more cash than I spent on it.For jeans , I 'm sure there would be no problems , but khakis and casual pants - STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS AS YOU CAN !! I guarantee it will ruin your dockers .
 The item was delivered earlier than the estimated date of delivery . about the belt itself ? I 'm not very happy with it . I 've only been using it for about three weeks and there are already signs of wear and tear . I guess it 's not for everyday use .
 dear SirsGood day!Pls note one of the products is not the one i ordered , pls let me know to whom i can contact in order to solve irThanks

 This belt appeared to be a very cheap quality in reality , it looks and feels more like a plastic rather than leather .
 I wore the belt for about three months before it disintegrated into two pieces . I do not know what material they use , but it is of low quality . Do not buy this belt .
 BELT LOOKED GREAT WHEN I RECEIVED IT.IT FELL APART AFTER MINIMAL USE.IT LOOKS LIKE TWO THIN STRIPS OF LEATHER ON THE INSIDE AND OUT SIDE , WITH FELT IN THE MIDDLE .
 This belt looks nice , but for $ 20 + it should not fall apart on day 3 . The belt buckle is hardly secured , and the strings holding it in place have fallen off with little to no use . The leather loop also falls off , very annoying .
 I bought the biggest size , and guess what , it 's seems they are small size .
 Just do n't feel comfortable in this item . The material is n't very giving . Cost is prohibitive , also , so think twice before buying .
 the product sent was the wrong size and the company will take care of it if i pay to ship it back . they made the mistake they should take care of the problem at their expense but they will not i would not shop at this company .
 This hat is not worth the amount they are charging for itwhen I got this hat I tried it on the top of the hat the material is so thing you can see day lightInstead of wasting money to return I just put it in the trash can . * I used a gift card to purchase this item .
 I ordered my normal bra size and the cups are too big . I would suggest if you order this bra go down a cup size .
 This hat was well made , just not the stle I was looking for . Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars
 I was looking for a new bag to carry my Macbook Pro . For daily use , I also carry several files and my lunch to work . When I travel , I would use my computer bag as a purse , so I need room for a wallet , small make-up bag , keys , water bottle , etc. , and maybe a sweater . I liked the company 's story , as it appears to be started by a young woman social entrepreneur who is providing employment opportunities in her native Thailand , where the bags are manufactured . This is the widest of the McKlein bags that are not on wheels . It also appears to be made of a softer leather than the other McKlein women 's bags . The drawbacks are
 This turtleneck would have been given 5 stars except that the mock turtleneck look does not maintain its shape when pulled over the head , and looks awkward and disheveled , and there seems no way to correct it . To make matters worse , washing the shirt does not return the neck to its original shape . Other than this -LRB- which I consider crucial to the look of the shirt -RRB- , the material is soft and the rest of the shirt maintains its shape . The color is just as it appears in the ad . The sizing is accurate , and it is a very comfortable shirt . I just wish someone would create a mock turtleneck that retained its shape when pulled over the head . It 's really a shame .
 In order for me to tie my daughters costume i had to cut off one of the ties and tie both of them together . It did n't really give me the look i was going for . everything else was fine but tie was a pretty big issue if you would see it . However my five year old did love it : -RRB- oh and the dragon stuck to gether i had to pull it apart and part of the dragon ripped off it was minor but still and issue .
 I ordered my normal bra size and the cups are too big . I would suggest if you order this bra go down a cup size .
 OK quality . Sized 1 1 1/2 sizes too small before washing . Not near size recommendation . My wife has a new sleep shirt .
 I bought the white undershirts . Very poor quality compared to others I have bought . like Jockey , Kirkwood , Hanes .
 This costume is poorly made and was quite disappointing for my six year old 's birthday . The helmet is two pieces of cheap plastic that attach together with velcro . My child can hardly see out of the eyes.The unit we received had already been torn open by someone else - who probably had the same reaction we did to the quality and returned it . I 'm not happy Amazon sent it to us .
 My son is a HUGE Star Wars fan and really liked the Jango Fett character . This was more expensive than any other costume we had ever bought for him but felt it would be worth the investment since he really enjoys dressing up and playing Star Wars with his friends.Unfortunately the helmet is very cheaply made , the costume was poorly sewn and ripped after two wearings . The back did not even have a zipper to keep it in place . We had to tie it in place like a hospital gown.Save your money on this item .
 bought this for 8 yr old son not deluxe as advertised looks like cheap costume from flea market and defniately not worth the price !
 Do n't waste your money on these `` Goggles '' . They have them under the Cyber Goth section of the site and these are far from it . The goggles are HUGE , it looks almost comical and not practical at all and would not work well with ANY Cyber Goth attire , all the antisipation and waiting was for nothing , the biohazard images are n't even symmetrical ! They 're made out of really cheap plastic and shoddy foam lining and wouldnt last a single night at a club . And again I will warn you , they are HUGE , I 'm a pretty big guy and if they look huge on me they will look ridiculous on anyone else . Do n't waste your money on these things , try Cryoflesh.com which is a site linked with amazon , sure you might pay a few bucks more but the quality is outstanding .
 I should start by saying that my daughter and niece love playing with this makeup set , and both were thrilled when it came out of the box . That said , they also love playing with my makeup ... Also , neither of the girls had any allergic reactions or problems with the product -LRB- I do all the applying with cotton swabs to prevent cross-contamination . -RRB- However , three of the `` lipsticks '' were broken upon receipt , all of the little tubes are nigh impossible to remove from the package/kit , which is strange because the plastic is so flimsy . I do have concerns about hte actual contents of the makeup as well ... one of those lead tests came up negative though.Overall , the product quality was pretty shoddy . But , then , the girls still loved it .
 PURCHASED THESE T-SHIRTS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE TAGLESS . THEY WERE NOT . AND THAT WAS AFTER WAITING ALMOST 2 WEEKS TO GET THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE . SO I HAD TO PAY $ 11 TO PAY FOR IT TO GET SHIPPED BACK AND IM STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND AFTER 2 MORE WEEKS . DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE TAGGED SHIRTS AND DONT NEED THEM RIGHT AWAY !
 Sorry but I got never got the Merchandise ordered . I need to call and speek to someone at the company
 The vendor was fine , but the product was way too large in the ankle and fell down . I was hoping for an above the pants ending , but not a knee high . This sagged down to my shoes . I tried two pairs from the bag of 12 . Then I washed them and tried again . Either too short or not enough elastic to stay up above the ankle .
 Sunglasses are okay . The gold and black ones are clearly different/of better quality than the silver one . They 're not even part of the same set , which is clear . Overall , not bad for the price , but disappointed on the silver pair being so shoddy .
 When I received these , my husband was upset because 2 of them was a little bit damage -LRB- there was a crack on the lens and the other one has a scratch -RRB- . I think , before they pack or send it , they should have check the products so that the customer wo n't get disappointed . I know its cheap , but at least , the customer can use it first than not use it at all .
 I bought these expecting 3 pairs of aviator sunglasses as shown in the picture , and received 3 pairs of `` john lennon style '' sunglasses . very disappointed and waste of money . they are also bent so much that if i did want to wear them , which i will never , i would not be able to . would give zero stars if possible , deceptive advertising and poor quality
 The lenses are extremely bad . One can hardly see thru them and put a lot of strain on my eyes . I had to return them .
 I purchased two of these after seeing them in a local department store . My son is a North Carolina Fan and the blue was perfect . I was very disappointed . After washing it in cold water ... the XXL became a L. ... both sweater shrank ! VERY DISAPPOINTED ! IN THE PURCHASE ... WILL NOT BUY CLOTHES FROM YOU AGAIN ... BOBBI JO JOHNSON BARNESVILLE OHIO
 If you are looking for a quality pea coat , go look somewhere else . I ordered this coat and was very disappointed in the quality and weight , not to mention the major flaw in the fabric on the front . So , I returned the coat and asked for a refund . Instead , I received a nasty e mail accusing me of tearing the coat and then washing it to hide the damage ! Needless to say I have received no satisfaction to this date , and I am out $ 65 and the coat.There are plenty of quality coats out there , just not this one .

 I ordered this product thinking it was for LONG PANTS as my school does n't allow shorts . I got the product and it turned out to be shorts . Thought maybe I made a mistake . So I reordered and did n't realize until the product was IN MY CART that it said shorts . Everywhere else it said pants and the picture was of long pants .
 The preemie size of these suits looked like they 'd be great for our 4 lb son who arrived a little early . We first put one on him when leaving the hospital and even the nurses commented on how much they liked it . But over the next week or so we realized how tight these were . First we noticed that he ate less -LRB- had to be formula fed -RRB- when wearing these compared to a regular snap shirt . Then we noticed that they were putting pressure on the top of his diaper and pushing it into his umbilical cord stump - even causing small amounts of bleeding . Not good at all . If you 're considering these for a preemie , you 'd be better off with just a basic snap shirt -LRB- e.g. Gerber -RRB- , diaper , and then swaddle in a light blanket .
 I bought these based on the product description that the cotton is extremely soft and because of the unique design that does not go over baby 's head . However , the cotton is not very soft . In fact , it 's scratchy , even after I washed it and used extra fabric softener . The cheap onesies someone gave me from Wal mart are softer than these . The spa silk onesies are way overpriced for what you get . The softest onesies we own by far are the organic gerber . Unfortunately , they only go up to size 3-6 months . The spa silk onesies do have a great design that you do n't need to pull over the baby 's head , but be warned that they are made short for their size . My baby is not large for his age but these are too short on him . Save your money !
 These look like they were designed by a blind man with no sense of proportion for babies . This is definitely you get less than what you paid for . Skip this product .
 It 's hard to tell from the white on white picture here , but the bottom flap snaps in a weird way -- the snaps are very high up . They also seem to run very small -LRB- or they shrink in the wash -RRB- . My baby is 3 months old and at his most recent check-up was only in the 25th percentile for height ; I bought the 9-month size thinking I would get a few larger items to be prepared ahead of time and they are too short ! He is chubby -LRB- about 14 pounds -RRB- and generally wear 3-6 month items , but this is a little ridiculous .
 I did n't care for the styling of these in person . The look like they are on backwards since the large bottom flap secures in the front , and there are some REALLY wide gaps at either leg making them very awkward on our son .
 I purchased this costume along with 2 others in the sailor category . All were shipped with buttons falling off . I spent a lot of time reinforcing every button on all 3 costumes . One button fell off and I was unable to find it . I contacted the seller with my grievances and was never contacted .

 The ad claimed one size fits all but there is no way this is true . The hat did not even come close to fitting . I returned it for credit almost 3 weeks ago and I still have not received the credit due me . Unless you have a small head I would not recommend purchasing this hat .
 The skirt is way too long for my 5 ' 3 ' frame . It has a faded streak through it . The color in the photo and the color of the skirt is different ; the photo color is much more vivid and prettier . I 'll keep it and take it to be altered , but not pleased about that .

 This Item was never received and when I contacted Costume Craze they gave me the UPS code and did nothing further to locate the missing item . I will never buy anything from them again and I hope that Amazon reveiews the poeple in which they do business with . All items taht I have bought thru Amazon has been done so with excellent service . your affiliate Costume Craze was not .
 The costume is not nearly as nice as it is pictured . It was only a shirt with attached belts and the sizing was way off . I could n't get the size 7 over my 6 year olds chest . Too many extra assessments needed to make a good costume . Not worth the money .

 The material is very very thin . The hat does not have ventilation and therefore traps heat . I saw a similar hat at a flee market -LRB- in a size medium -RRB- for $ 3 .

 This hat seems to be made for those aged 12 and under . This is not something an average adult can wear and was a complete disappointment .

 I was very dissapointed when I washed -LRB- according to instructions on on the label -RRB- the shirt and most of the paint on the lettering washed off . I would never order again . The shirt was a good quality -- it was the painted on stenciling that was poor .

 delivery time , pay the shipment of 1 to 3 days , do not comply with it , buy it a day 18 and arrived 25 to the hotel . Of course my flight back to Venezuela was 24 , Bone that the article did not get to my hands and I must now pay $ 100 to get me to venezuela

 Bought the toddler size -LRB- 2-4 -RRB- my daughter is 3 , even double checked it with their sizing chart . It was huge , huge , huge . No way I could make it work . Must be some kind of screw up in manufacturing or something . I did n't listen to other reviews on other sites , so be aware if you buy .

 The company that sells these hats did n't have the color I wanted when I ordered , but less than 7 days after I did order , the color I wanted shows up on Amazon . It was too late to return . Also the hat is not truly for a guy as it looks more like a woman 's bonnet due to the `` floppy '' rim . The tie string is also uneven and not very giving . It hangs crooked on me . I will chalk this up to a bad purchase and loss . Another reviewer said they ordered a size larger to be on the safe side . The reviewer must have an extra-big head . XL and XXL are probably too large for the average person 's head whether big or slightly above big.Would I recommend buying this product ? No , I do not recommend buying this hat and not from this company . Do your shopping research before buying and you will likely find the right color , right fit and right price elsewhere . The only plus with this particular merchant was that the order arrived promptly . Other than that ... I give the product and the sales tactics 1 star .

 Ripped immediately while trying to put on suitcase . Save yourself the trouble and dont buy this flimsy worthless piece of paper .
 The tags are cute and colorful , but not very durable . I do n't think I noticed in the product description that they are one step above paper . They barely made it through our 10-day trip .
 These tags are cute but I thought they were plastic , not laminated paper . So flimsy , they made it round-trip on our spring break getaway but are n't likely usable for another trip . Bummer !
 I was so excited to get these , but when they arrived they were n't at all the ones shown here . The ones I received have pictures of sporting equipment along the top band which I do n't care for . I 'll be returning them .
 My preschooler was super excited about his new underwear , it 's a shame I have to return them because they are n't what I ordered . As a previous reviewer noted they have exposed elastic with sports images on them .
 I wish I would have read the reviews . I did not received this item as pictured . They have a white waist band with sports balls
 The underwear had been opened , and were not the original set . They did n't appear used , but you expect to be ordering a new product not something that has been shifted around . It was supposed to be assorted color and was n't , it was all one color . The item is not new or as described .

 The only complaint I have is that the belt that shipped was the wrong color . It was a dark royal blue and I had ordered the Columbia blue . It was labeled Columbia blue but that 's not what was in the package .
 A real bust . Not what was described at all . I completely wasted my money on this purchase . It was too cheap to justify the postage necessary to return it . Live and learn . I wo n't buy a belt like this online again . I needed the color we saw in the description , like the photo above , but received brown .
 No problems with the seller . The package arrived quickly and the price could not be beat.Unfortunately , the Cardinal Red belts I ordered , which should have been a bright vivid red , and which appear on the website as such , are hardly that color at all . The belts are dark , cranberry sauce red , which , unfortunately , does n't come any where near matching our true Cardinal Red uniforms . Oh well . They will be relegated to practice belts and I will keep searching .
 If you were expecting Gold to be yellow , as in uniform yellow , the base color axiomatic regular old sunflower safety tape yellow - look elsewhere . The belt is orange . I do n't know how they sell an orange color that could look more orange than this.Also , if you have dark pants , this belt 's inside lining shreds like toilet paper and it will get all over your pants each time you put it on.The buckle is exactly what you 'd expect for this price.But , tt holds up my pants and the elastic works just fine . It was cheap and functional . Two stars for that .

 These dog tag silencers do perform their function , but they are very cheap looking and poor quality . They fit incredibly tightly and it seems like they will probably rip soon . My dog tags are n't oversized or anything like that . If you want something that does silence the dog tags , these will work , but I ca n't say how long they 'll work for .
 These are round . I expected them to be shaped like dog tags . Were too small to be useful to me .
 these are the worst dog tag silenecers i have ever owned the holes dont even line up with the dog tags themselves cheap rube quality looks like recycled rubber do yourself a favor and buy from rothco instead i regret buying these . . i mean what did they do to make these rob some kind for his bicycle so the could steal the rubbe from the intertube of his tires ?

 The handle broke off on my husband 's first overseas trip . The quality of this bag is below my expectations .
 I ordered one -LRB- 1 -RRB- Warner 's Bra 1218-BLK-36C and received two -LRB- 2 -RRB- . I only wanted one -LRB- 1 -RRB- - was this taken off the total Amazon Gift Certificate ??? Kindly advise the balance on the gift certificate .
 Unfortunately , this shirt can be a little misleading . I was in a club with a couple of pals and saw a gorgeous woman out on the floor doing the Macarena . Instinctively , I sprinklered my way over to her and gave her that look of , `` I know '' . She received my advances very well , and we left holding hands . I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world , so I asked her to marry me . We got married in the forest , and released a cadre of swallows to signify our union.Our wedding night , which was set to be the best night of my night , turned out to be a huge disappointment . I wanted her to keep the swallows t-shirt on , to show our love of swallows , and that was when she dropped the bomb ... she does n't like swallows . I was horrified to realize that I had just made the biggest mistake of my life by marrying a woman who hated my beloved birds.I give this shirt a 2/5 because I 'm now in a horrible divorce .
 I was looking for non-binding socks an thought the turn cuffs meet my needs . These are too heavy and tight for my liking .

 The hat was a cheap price - but the delivery fee was way too much ! The item was disappointing too - this was really just a costum hat that would fit a child and not an adult . I ended up using another hat to complete my outfit .
 Had to die the hat blue to match costume . there was no band or anything to use to attach the hat . Hat kept falling off .
 This hat was too small , looked cheap , and completely unusable ! I was very disappointed when I anxiously received it in the mail .
 I was trying unsuccessfully to replace a really nice white Columbia fleece jacket that I bought some years ago which resisted stains amazingly , looks really nice on me , and goes with everything . This is not it . This -LRB- Benton Springs Style Number 209 WL 6114 -RRB- is a cheap imitation of my old fleece Columbia jacket -LRB- style number 207 WL6114 -RRB- . I bought three Benton Springs jackets on 1-27-2010 at Sports Authority and I 'm returning at least the two white ones , where the difference in quality is really noticable . I 'm going to keep a navy blue one where the inferior cut , styling , workmanship , and quality control is not as noticable . In white , mine look cheap and slightly flawed , workmanship wise . I have another white fleece jacket from Walmart with the same problem that came as a liner with a -LRB- cheap -RRB- white raincoat.Another difference is that the new ones are fuzzier , softer and thicker and the white is pinker . That would be fine if it hung and fit nicely like it 's predessor.It 's so hard to replace women 's clothes when they wear out , even in classic styles . Often I have to go to another brand to get the same thing since it 's `` out of style '' in the brand I start with . Are they assuming it never wears out ? The zipper eventually broke on my original Columbia fleece jacket , not before I got a lot of wear out of it , and a white jacket can not stay stain free forever even though this fabric was very stain resistant .
 I ordered this item through Amazon from The Fashion Rack on December 8 , 2010 and never recieved it . I have ordered many things from Amazon and have always received them , but did not recieve my order from The Fashion Rack or a response from The Fashion Rack . I watched the USPS tracking as it came to my state then went to a totally different state . I emailed The Fashion Rack through Amazon and never got a response to my email . I have emailed a second time still waiting to hear something .
 I ordered this columbia fleece in a size small . I received it today and it was a medium . The tag on the inside of the jacket says medium , and the sticker on the bag it was packaged it said medium , but the price tag said it was a small . The jacket is way too big for me , and I would like to return it . I am hesitant though , because I 'm worried that if I return it and order from this seller again I will receive another jacket in the wrong size . Has anyone else had this problem ?
 I ordered This almost 20 Days Ago And still Havent recieved it.So Im Completely Done With this seller.If you Expect it a Certin Time Dont Bother .
 Although I ordered the size I usually wear , the sleeves were much too long and it was n't large enough around the bust even though it was advertised as being loose fitting . Apparently this item was designed for tall , slender women with long arms . The advertising is misleading .
 I owned a similar Columbia jacket years ago -LRB- not sure exact style -RRB- but I know that even then I would n't have spend an arm and a leg on it , so I figured it was reasonable to compare the two . This jacket feels incredibly cheap ! It 's ok , keeps me warm . A nice light fleece , but I was expecting something a little heavier and more durable . Hanging this over the back of my chair , I was worried that the posts on the chair were going to pop a hole through ! They are n't pointy and are a good size , at least an inch , and this was n't by exerting any sort of force on the jacket.The seller shipped me the wrong color anyway , and I 'm supposed to be getting a full refund . Otherwise , I 'd likely return it and fork some money out for something worthwhile .
 This shirt is too damn big . I ca n't wear this to school ! DUDE i 'll look FAT .
 I ordered this product thinking it was for LONG PANTS as my school does n't allow shorts . I got the product and it turned out to be shorts . Thought maybe I made a mistake . So I reordered and did n't realize until the product was IN MY CART that it said shorts . Everywhere else it said pants and the picture was of long pants .

 I can never find jeans to fit , but these fit in the waist and behind very well . But their idea of straight leg and my idea of straight leg are 2 different things . Instead of hugging the leg and tapering all the way to the ankle like `` straight leg '' would imply , they are about 2 inches wider than my thigh and stay that way all the way down . I suppose if I were 30 years younger that could work , but I 'm not , and it does n't . Guess it 's off to my zShop for these !
 size was misleading . after having tried on the jeans locally , I purchased these jeans at a great price but the same size was very tight . I like the jeans but wiery of buying online

 What a disappointment this was ! First , you have to have extremely long bra straps . I slid the adjustment all the way down on the bra to make the straps as long as I could and tried it again and it still tightened up so tight it was ridiculous . I tried again on a stretchy strap bra and same thing . They just do n't work . I was really hoping that this would stop my bra straps from sliding off my shoulders & give me the ability to wear more of the T back tshirts but this product definitely wo n't help me with that . -LRB- Had I really thought about it before I bought it , my bra straps would have had to be at least the distance from strap to the middle of my back in extra length for these things to work . My own dumb fault on this purchase ! I think I 'd have to have a bra that 's at least 2 sizes too big for this to work ? -RRB- The Strapper Bra Strap Holder Three Pair Pack
 I was so excited to get this product ... and I was so disappointed after using it.My issues with it are 1 . you have to push it way down your back so the strap does n't show at your neck . So it does n't work with v-neck and that type of shirt . 2 . After wearing all day , it made my skin raw where the straps were hitting.Definitely would not buy again . And if I had kept the orignal wrapping , I would return them .
 this product worked somewhat , it is hard to use . Hard to put on and feels tight when worn .
 This makes your straps very tight and uncomfortable even after loosening them . I also had to have someone else put it on for me as I could n't do it myself . These will sit in my junk draw .
 I read the reviews on these and thought I 'd found the answer to falling bra straps -- at last . These things are only good if you have someone to help you get dressed in the morning . If not , you can only hook them on at the top of the straps , thus pulling the straps so close to your neck that you can see the straps in the neck opening of your top in the front . A waste of money as far as I 'm concerned . Unless , of course , you 're planning to wear a turtleneck , which just does n't work for me in the summer in Massachusetts .
 I dislike because it is difficult to do by myself also alot of my bras straps dont unhook also found that it was to tight so I was very unsatified with your product Nora Lantz
 They sent it , i received it 2 weeks late , and it wasnt even the same accessory as i saw in the picture . And they were miniature like . They would n't even go on the back of my bra . Well ya know what they say , you buy cheap , you get cheap . I would not recommend this to anyone .
 I would not reccomens this idem . They are nearly impossible to get on and there was PEN INK or something of the sort all over them . Needless to say I did not see it at first and it ruined me brand new $ 40.00 nursing bra .
 I thought I would like this item and that it would give me a `` racer back '' type bra . I was wrong , ca n't get it on without help and then it 's placement makes it uncomfortable and makes the straps dig into your skin .
 I did n't like this item . It seemed like a great and helpful idea , but when I got it -LRB- which I got it really fast , so points for that ! -RRB- , I tried it out immediately , and it was so dorky ! At first I could n't even figure out how to put it on my bra straps ; finally I got it to work , but it was so far up my straps that it was uncomfortable ! I got this product to wear my regular bras with my halter tops , but when I tried it with one of my tops , it still showed my straps plus you could totally see the clip on my back because it was so high up ! Then I realized I was putting it on wrong , so I tried it exactly as shown and described on the packaging and I never could figure out how to make it work , as it kept falling off . This product was cheap though , so you get what you pay for as they say . Easier to find a bra already designed for halter tops I think .
 Hopes dashed . only way I could get it to work is to turn it sideways . then the shoulder straps on my bra get pulled into a halter configuration & show in the neckline of a v-neck tee . Now I know why there 's no pic of the front view . Considering there is approximately 10 cents worth of plastic in the 2 clips , that 's quite a profit , especially for an item that does n't work . Do n't waste your money .
 I thought I would like this item and that it would help me out . I was wrong , ca n't get it on without help and then it 's placement makes it uncomfortable and makes the straps dig into your skin . If anything it hels with clevage more than anything .
 I have narrow shoulders and I ALWAYS have trouble with falling bra straps . I thought this product would be the solution for me , but I 'm very disappointed with it . I was completely unable to get it on by myself unless I put it up really high and then it felt like my straps were choking me since they were almost around my neck . Once you get it on you can not slide it down like it shows in the little video . My husband put it on for me and then it made my bra feel tight and uncomfortable . It basically turns every bra into a racer back.Don ' t waste your money !
 You have to be a contortionist to use this product . I returned it , but it slipped out of the box to `` who knows where '' -LRB- my credit loss -RRB- . Therefore , did not get my credit . So , if you order & return , put them in a padded envelope so they do n't get lost & you receive your credit .

 This bracelet fell apart as soon as my daughter put it on . I contacted the seller via Amazon 's email contact and got no reply whatsoever . It was n't expensive or anything , so it 's not that big of a deal , it 's just the principle .
 This costume was cheap so thats the positive thing about it . The negatives are that it is cheap . The mask is unusable because the way they package it causes it to be wrinkled and not spherical . The mask is also hot and hard to hear in .

 Ordered these thinking it was the shorts and instead received the tank top . Should have known by the description but the picture is deceiving . Other than that , the product is decent , will probably buy elsewhere next time though .
 The quality of the product is good , however the sizing is WAY off . I ordered a 2X and it is barely a Large . I would not do business here again , it was a waste of my money . If you need a large , buy the 2X it will be perfect and probably last a good long time .
 Too pricey for a cheap costume . Was expecting something more durable than a flimsy foam mask with printing on the front of it . The jacket is thinner than my bed sheets and I am overall unsatisfied . The product description made it sound worth the money . The product description was deceiving . I suggest you look somewhere else for a decent costume cause I am extremely angry that I spent my hard earned money on this piece of crap .
 Having been a Jason fan since i was 8 , i could n't wait to get this costume . Unfortunately , the mask looks really fake and the machete is made of cheap plastic and wo n't actually kill anybody . But what do you expect for $ 30 ?

 I never got a chance to send back so now I am stuck with two hats that dont fit . Im tring to find someone with a small head to give them too .
 Wanted something I could carry on the motorcycle and cover my ears , still lookin ' . Does n't look at all like the pic , the brim flops right in front of your face so you ca n't see where you are going . Looks like a girls hat .
 Another made in China rip-off , could have gotten the same thing for less than $ 5.00 at the local flea market

 I was hoping the wig would look something like the picture but it really does n't . Maybe if you 're a professional wig styler you can make it look like that , but that 's definitely not the way it comes out of the package . Oh yeah , and while I was trying to style it to make it look acceptable , it shed like crazy .
 I bought 2 pair s/s bodysuit & legings -LRB- sweatpea & you are my sunshine -RRB- 6-12mos , when I receive the package after waiting one week of shipping I can not wait to put the dress on my baby , only after one day the fabric is loosing at the leg , and so as the bodysuit the sewing did not do a good job for this product and the material is not stay in the same shape after one wash .
 I 'm not crazy about the feel of the material . They make my feet sweat .

 Looked like a nice shirt , but comes out wrinkled from the dryer.I do n't recommend this shirt unless you want to iron polos .
 I 've been wearing XLs from all the other retailers for years , but this last order - they literally choked ! Not good at all , had to discard the two I bought .

 Beware ! These are not Seven for All Mankind Jeans ! You can tell by the fake logo and the pocket design in the pictures .
 `` T. Griffith '' is wrong -- Seven7 is not the original brand , and is instead a ripoff made by the company `` Express '' . In fact , `` Seven For All Mankind '' sued Express for the copyright infringement over their sub-brand , `` Seven7 '' . You can read about it here
 The description for this item says , `` dark indigo denim , '' but they are not dark . They have that faded dingy dirtly look . I personally ca n't abide that . They seem true to size , but they are LOOOOOW . If I had known that , I would not have ordered them . If you like showing your behind when you sit , you 'll just love these . Since I had to return the lousy things , I did n't even try the tank top on . It just looks pretty ordinary , probably okay.The pockets and stitching are not as flattering as Levi 's . For $ 50 , I 'll get two pairs -LRB- almost -RRB- of truly dark demin Levi 's instead and spare the public a scary rearview .
 When you order these jeans , you are led to believe that they are manufactured by `` Seven Jeans '' -LRB- as seen in finer department and specialty stores -RRB- . THEY ARE NOT !!! They are not made by `` Seven for all Mankind '' , do not resemble SFAM jeans and are made in China . I am very disappointed . This is clearly deceptive . They are cheap imitations that have the word `` Seven '' printed on them . Buyer Beware !!!!
 these are NOT 7 for all mankind jeans if that 's what you are looking for - those jeans go for $ 125-200 a piece . the people who make these came up with their `` similar '' name to trick you into buying them - they probably figure its a numbers game and `` some '' will just keep them . . dont be fooled - if youre looking for real 7 's - go to eluxury.com and you 'll find them there .

 This was absolutely the worst service I have ever had from your stable of vendors . From date of order to receipt of my shirst was three weeks . The vendor PPS -LRB- Presentation Products & Solutions Apparel -RCB- neverresponded to my e-mail or phone inquiries . BAD BAD BAD . Thanks for asking . Thomas B. Wie
 OK quality . Sized 1 1 1/2 sizes too small before washing . Not near size recommendation . My wife has a new sleep shirt .
 I bought the white undershirts . Very poor quality compared to others I have bought . like Jockey , Kirkwood , Hanes .
 Bugs do n't even have to slow down to fly through this stuff . I bought it because it was cheap intending to make new companionway and hatch screens for my boat . It 's still taking up space here because I 'm determined to find something it 's good for .
