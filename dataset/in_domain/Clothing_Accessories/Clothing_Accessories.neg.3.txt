 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .

 I ordered a size 32 -LRB- my regular size is 31 -RRB- and they felt like a 28 when I tried them out so I had to return them . Just ensure you ordered several sizes bigger . I wish they had more accurate sizing .
 The size advertised -LRB- `` 36 '' -RRB- , and delivered -LRB- 36 '' -RRB- as evidenced by the label , did not match the actual small waist size of the product -LRB- approximately 30-32 '' -RRB- . Was this the reason this product was so inexpensive - improper labeling at the factory ?
 Bathing suit is good quality . Using the bathing suit every day at an indoor pool , the suit requires a through rincing because evenutally the colrene in the pool causes fading of the material and snaging .
 other reviewers mentioned the poor fit . i had to return the bathing suit , too . i wear size 30 slacks and size 32 underwear , but this size 32 bathing suit fit like a tourniquet . it was way too tight ! that said , it was high quality .
 How lame ... 30 days later , no shipment , no delivery.Very disgusted.Information about shipmentShip Method
 I am a regular swimmer and I have been buying that same reference from Speedo for several year -LRB- 70800 -RRB- . Usually they are lasting 6 to 7 months , 3 swims a week , clear water rinsing and air dried.Last July I bought several suits of that reference here and I immediatly noticed a change in the construction of the suit . I started to use one in September and after only 2 months the suit is falling apart.The impression at reception was confirmed . Some savings are made by Speedo in their manufacturing process but they did not warn the customer or change the item reference .

 The title kind of says it all . If you 're going to wear linen , it should be comfortable and these were not . If you are going to buy them , get them in white because the stone is hideous

 Seemed to fit just right and be well constructed . However after the initial wash following the manufacturer 's care instructions , they shrank width and lengthwise . Had to pass them on to someone smaller than myself .
 I ordered a size 34x32 . I received 32x34 . So , I returned them and a week later received replacements ... size 32x34 . After 2 weeks of waiting for pants and not getting anything I could use , I returned the WRONG size for a refund . Too much frustration ... I will just find a local store where I can go in and get the right size .

 I should have taken a clue from the price , but these fishnets were not quite what I expected . The threads were too thick and not at all attractive on my legs .
 was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable .
 I wore it once and never wore it again . It makes my `` girls '' look pokey and weird . And it was a bit small .
 for the price and customer service on this item , i was very pleased and will reorder when the time arrises . GREAT PRICE , GREAT PRODUCT !!!
 I purchased this item as a gift for a baby shower . What an embarassment !!! First of all it was n't what I expected as being ` chenille ' . She washed the blanket and IT LOOKS HORRIBLE !!! The ` chenille ' that was n't really there to begin with is TOTALLY GONE , and when you hold it up you can see bare spots throughout the fabric . I 'm not only out on the price but also shipping and will definitely not pay to return the item . She can just use it as a rag , but then it probably wo n't even hold water !
 I received this blanket as a gift after registering for it . I washed it once -LRB- following wash instructions -RRB- to prepare for our upcoming new addition and it is already off grain , not perfectly square as it was to begin with . I can see that the chenille is not going to hold up well either .
 Here in Atlanta the Vick jersey price has been slashed drastically.Authentic go 's for $ 75.00 Replica is $ 25.00
 People should be selling Vick jerseys for next to nothing now ... they should PAY people to take them off their hands ... not charge for them ! Slash the price more than half and I 'll consider buy one or two ... so I can burn them !!!

 While this costume looks really cute , it is not made correctly . I expected more from Leg Avenue . The top will not sit right on you , and makes the whole costume look funny . The skirt is ok , just really flimsy . The only reason I even put 2 stars is because the thigh highs are really nice and sexy .

 Washed the shirt one time and it shrunk to an unwearable size . I paid for a shirt I will never get to wear . I got taken .

 I purchased these because they are organic and neutral . Simple and absorbent , but the satin frayed and the terry tore at the seams after a few uses and washes . I am quite particular about my laundry , so this was not me being careless and tough on the fabric . I am very disappointed with the quality of these bibs and will be printing out my return label when finished with this review !
 I washed these in Dreft on the cold cycle and the satin came out picked and unravelling . The bibs themselves are soft but they look terrible after one washing .
 This bib -LRB- neck area -RRB- shrinks like crazy . The velcro stuck to my other garment and ruined it . Do not buy this product unless you want to put it on to the Barbie doll .
 Length :
 My son has been using these since he was a newborn . He 's now two years old and , unfortunately , still need to wear a bib to keep his shirts dry . These are the most absorbent bibs I have seen in the market and he can soak these through three of these in day . After a year of use , the first batch I bought were stained and I wanted to buy new ones to replace them . But the new ones I bought after August 2010 are nothing like the old ones . They are less absorbent , the velcro stick to my other clothing and itself during laundry -LRB- despite I religiously close the velcro before putting them into the laundry -RRB- and they fall off my son 's neck . Totally useless piece of junk if you ask me . All I can do now is to go back using the original ones I bought two years ago that are yellow . It 's not pretty but at least it does the job .
 I registered for these for my baby shower and received them . I liked the fact that they were made organically because babies like to chew on anything they can get ahold of , bibs included . Once I received them though , I was disappointed at how thin they were . I had hoped that an organic product , obviously lacking a plastic lining for the back , would have been nice and thick . These , not so much . They are very thin . I know there are better organic bibs on the market and I stupidly thought 3 organic bibs for $ 11 was a good deal . And it was ... too good to be true !
 When I first got these they looked and felt great , but after only one washing one of the bibs fell apart and the other two shrunk up and do n't look all that great anymore . I would not recommend these bibs .
 These bibs are expensive , but extremely cheap . The velcro does not work after one wash and they fall apart after two washes and then look like a rag . I would not recommend nor buy any more of these products .
 I bought the Bumpkin bibs with the -LRB- blue -RRB- silk trim and they were pretty awful . The trim began to fray after one washing , attracting every piece of velcro in my baby 's wardrobe -LRB- other bibs , including Bumpkins -RRB- in the dryer . A pretty disappointing purchase . The cloth itself held up well , but the trim became so frayed I did n't want it near my infant . For a company that touts itself as being `` finer baby products '' it may want to look at the quality of its fabrics .
 I bought these before my daughter was born and found them extremely useful at first . My three month old is a serious spitter upper and needs bibs to keep from wearing 10 outfits a day . These were the perfect size and really absorbent but they did not survive the washing mashine . They fell apart and now I keep them as back up but only at home because they look so beat up . Too bad .
 The cotton fabric is nice and absorbs liquids just fine , but that 's the only positive thing I can say about this product . The satin fabric on the edges is poor quality and we had loose threads hanging all over right after the first wash in the laundry machine -LRB- gentle cycle , mind you -RRB- . Also , the opening for the neck is very small - my daughter is 6mo . old -LRB- average size -RRB- and it 's already too small for her . Would never buy anything from this brand again .
 I am giving these bibs 2 stars for the following 2 reasons
 Like many have mentioned , this is made in China . And it started to peel just after the first wash - very disappointing . It 's also tight around the neck , which is not very comfortable for my baby . Good thing though is that it is thick and can really absorb lots of drool . Given a choice , I would n't want to buy it again .
 During the first wash , the velcro tabs came open , and the satin edges on the 2 green bibs began to fray from contact with the velcro . The terry cloth-like body of all of the bibs also developed pulls . We have now used these bibs for 3 months and they are a frayed mess , and the velcro no longer stays closed . Note
 The quality of fabric is very very poor . The material is fluffing and too much lints come out of it . Difinitely , causes the breath problems for infants .
 These bibs are a good size for a newborn , especially a bigger newborn . My son was 8lbs 10oz and it was a great size to start him off with . Out of the package they are good looking too but after a few washes they started falling apart . They still do the job but look terrible . Now , I could n't take him out in public in the condition that they are in and my baby is only 4 weeks old .
 These bibs are tiny and poorly made - the trim has frayed and come completely apart after only two washings , and is of course synthetic . Save your money or spend a little more and get muslin bibs . There 's no point in paying more for what end up being used as -LRB- supposedly -RRB- organic rags .
 nothing wrong with these bibs but they are made in CHINA ... I was looking for organic and I was thrilled to find these , didnt think to see if they were made in China ...
 Washed the shirt one time and it shrunk to an unwearable size . I paid for a shirt I will never get to wear . I got taken .
 Although these bibs are attractive and organic , they do not actually prevent moisture from seaping underneath to clothing ... which it the purpose right ? I would not purchase these again nor would I recommend to a friend .
 At 34 '' around I just did n't feel like I was getting the support I needed . It feels like a cheaper bra and wo n't even stay flat against my ribs because it does n't seem to fit right -LRB- I recently just got a measurement done , so I know what size I should be wearing . To be fair , bras are all different and ordering online is difficult without being able to try them on . I would not buy this again and I wo n't be wearing mine .
 Ok , it 's a pretty bra , the color is nice & it 's overall pretty . Here are my issues
 Quite flimsy . Doesnt give any support.The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt .
 Very pretty and well made for sure , however , the bra is very wide so not good for narrow backs . Straps cut into tenter skin near under arm area .
 The underwire fit well , but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive . I had to send them both back .
 I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross . This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night . Also it fit kinda weird . For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast . -LRB- It was probably only noticable to me , but still , did not make me feel sexy .
 The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to . They are a bit roomy , I 'm disappointed .
 unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt . : -LRB-
 It 's comfortable and soft , but priced high compared to the duration of validityUsed only three times in the last time was outdated and very badI purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two yearsDislikes
 Online this Bra looks Delicious ! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable . The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old &#34; Felina | Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra . &#34; They , I , did n't feel comfortable , nor safe walking or playing around in it . I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies , cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady ! YOu dig ?
 This bra is gorgeous . Unfortunately it does n't fit terribly well . It 's an odd size that 's neither a balconet or a demi and pinches in weird places . Also , the underwire digs in painfully after about two hours . The wide lace band is wonderful but for the less chesty , I 'd recommend passing on this one .
 I read the other reviews and based on those purchased this bra with high hopes.I am a 36 full cup D.This bra didnt cover anything !!!! Every time you move or particularly bend over everything is out.Yes it is very pretty but not practical , wish I could send it back but I wore it for a few hours . . what a waste of money !
 The fit was okay , it is pretty , but not very soft or comfortable . I like the balconette -LRB- balcony -RRB- style because it flatters a larger busted woman . The straps on a balconette bra set further apart than other bras -LRB- straps are more toward your underarm than in the middle of the cup -RRB- which I prefer , but with this bra the straps set way too far over nearly at my underarms . The underwire on the sides is one of the most uncomfortable I 've ever worn and keeps poking me . I ca n't wait to take it off when I get home ! I should just throw it away . For the price it should have much higher quality -LRB- aka softer -RRB- lace . Hope this helped !
 This was a great product for about 2 weeks . Looked great , fit great , but the underwire poked right through the material on both sides and it is now simply unwwearable . I have n't attempted to contact the manufacturer yet .
 The fit is terrible . The narrow straps cut into my shoulders , but if they are loosened , the cups do n't provide the proper amount of support . You must be the exact right size to wear this bra ... comfortably .
 I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with . I did this because of the price and it was money wasted . The bras fit as if it had been worn . Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right . So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist . Useless . Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill . Bad purchase . Bad fit . Pretty but not practical . I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well , this was not made for D + women .
 I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long . I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose . I 've probably only had that problem with 1 % of all the bras I 've ever bought , and sadly this was one of them . The cups run generously sized -LRB- which for me , as a D/DD usually is a positive thing , but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down -RRB- . The overall design was cute , but the odd sizing made it a no-go .
 I write this review for the DDD 's , this bra is pretty but no support for big bust , I guess that 's what you get for the price !
 I did not like the seam placement in the cups ... it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though .
 I almost liked this bra , but the straps wo n't shorten up enough . Even when I adjust them to their shortest they 're much too long for me . This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking ! Maybe I 'm just built strangely , but I was n't able to wear this bra . It is pretty though .
 I really wanted to like this . I put it on and looked great . I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already . Maybe be good for smaller chest but did n't work for my 36DD bust .
 I wear a 38C Bra size , and this bra fits the bill !!! Love it ! I just ordered another one . I would highly recommend this bra . It is very sexy , and comfortable.Update : After wearing this bra for a day , it 's NOT comfortable . I would not recommend it all , and I have returned the other one that was ordered , and the one I kept goes in the `` Not form fitting , and comfortable '' draw . I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead , so far it is very comfortable , and fits nicely to the breasts . I will be ordering another pair !
 does not appear as in pic . it is more of a `` curly '' hair type fro . ie
 You get what you pay for . . not what I expected ; hair too wirey , not easy to manage , probably best for costume use ; I gave it away
 I ordered the brown wig a received a black one . Didnt look like the photo shown , it looked more like a black clown wig .
 I had ordered the brown color hair and I received black . To add insult to injury , the item shipped slower than projected -LRB- I used Prime shipping and received it in three days -RRB- . The quality of this product is good , I 'm not 100 % confident in the company packing the order .
 The wig you receive in the mail is not the wig in the picture . It is more of a curly afro instead of a more frizzy , puffy afro . However , I did alot of cutting on the wig and it turned out just fine for my purposes . I used it for a Lamont Sanford halloween costume .
 This is not the same product as the one shown in the amazon site . I 've received a poor quality wig instead . Quite disappointed
 not only did my order come late ! the hair falls out of the wig when you touch it ! I would not order from this company again .
 I bought these for a birthday present and was sadly disappointed -LRB- as was the birthday girl -RRB- They are cut like hospital scrubs and had a very stiff feel to them . The seams were also exposed and rough . They did come in a cute bag according to my wife , but she had me return these as soon as she took them out of the bag .
 It seems to be nice as far as silk goes , but I was surprised about the plain look . It is nothing fancy . It had little pieces of thread that needed to be cut . But it seems to wear and wash well . Also , it can be condensed to a small and light size for travel . The orange color came off onto the sheets !
 My daughter has ezxema and i needed organic cotton bibs , so I bought these . First the lining , which makes contact with her skin , is polyester and that was n't mentioned in description . Second after two washings the product has begun go completely fall apart . A terrible product !
 I am so disappointed that these bibs are fraying and pulling quite a bit after only 3 washings . The binding is not overlapping the main fabric enough on one of them , which is already making a big 1 '' gap that is fraying . The tags are fraying , and the terrycloth has many `` pulls '' where the yarn loops have pulled out to 1/2 '' and 2 '' long strings , making the once adorable bibs look very scrappy . I have washed with the Velcro fastened in regular cycle warm and tumble dry on medium heat . I 'll give 2 stars because they are so cute and soft .
 I received a set of bibs with a trim made of a different fabric than the rose satin pictured -- it 's a pink and white flowered print in a non-satiny fabric . I also have this set in sage green , which came with the pictured satin fabric . The green satin trim completely frayed in the wash and pulled away from the terry cloth as other reviews have described . Oddly , the white satin bibs are just fine . While I 'm happy with the way the rose set has held up over the past 3 months , I would n't order this product again because the quality has been so inconsistent . If I received another set with satin trim , I would send it back immediately .
 agree with the other reviews that the satin trim is falling apart and fraying after only a couple washes . would not buy again
 I ordered a pair of these a few weeks ago , and althought they fit fine , the material is not the same as it used to be . It appears to be thinner and lighter in weight . It wrinkles badly in the wash and feels more like lightweight canvas than denim . Visually it 's different too . These have vertical white threads that do n't show in the online pictures . I would not buy these again .
 I ordered 3 pairs of these Wrangler jeans and have been very disappointed with the quality . All 3 pair seem to fit differently even though they are all the same size . Two belt loops broke off the first time wearing them . I have Levis and Wranglers over 20 years old with all the belt loops intact . Yet another brand losing it 's reputation of quality by cheap material and cheap labor . Will no longer buy Wrangler and I was a long time fan of them .
 I ordered a pair of these which arrived today . I have other pairs of Wrangler jeans , and figured the sizing would be the same , boy was I wrong . These jeans arrived today , and compared to my other Wrangler jeans , these are nearly 2 sizes SMALLER in the waist for the SAME SIZE on the tag . I know they are cheap jeans , at only $ 17 , but , they should size the same as all of the other pairs I 've bought . Needless to say , I will not be buying another pair of these worthless jeans ever again .
 This product did not meet my expectation . It was supposed to be a regular rise but feels like a low rise . It is too tight for jeans that are labeled as relaxed fit jeans and is rather shorter than the expected length ... all these unwashed . Only God knows what will happen after the first washing . This particular product is disappointing for a wrangler jeans . If you need to order this product online , order a larger size than you need , and stay away from the blasted indigo . It actually looks awful !
 I bought three pairs of these jeans , and all fit perfectly and looked fine . However , on the third wear of one of them , the fabric started ripping along the edge of the back left pocket . There is now an enormous hole in on the seat of the pants , rendering them unwearable . I knew these jeans were cheap , but I got them because I 'm losing weight an planned on fitting into them for only a few months . That they delivered only a few days is extremely disappointing .
 I 've bought these at Walmart for a couple of years now . I do n't know why I keep buying them . They all do the same thing after about maybe a month . First thing is a hold starts on the left side of the crotch . About the same time the material starts tearing on the right thigh . It looks cool and all if I was 20 but I 'm not . It not a fashion thing with these it 's just poor material . A few more washes and both holes are too big to get away with wearing in public . I do n't want to be the guy that is known for letting lefty hang out for all to see.Time to break down and pay the 40.00 for a pair of real Wrangler mwz I think it 's called and see if they last longer .
 These are not wranglers . I am not sure who makes them . But everything about them is not wrangler . The stiching is all wrong even the leather patch on the rear waste is n't even right . The denim is alot thinner than any other jeans I have purchased . So if you want a cheap pair of jeans these are ok , but not wrangler quality .
 I have been buying this exact wrangler jeans for years and I could n't believe the poor quality of my recent purchase . The material is so thin you could almost see through it . This will be my last wrangler 's if this is the kind of jeans they are now producing .
 Maidenform 's bra was labeled the correct size , but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length , and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .
 i was dissapointed with this bra , it was 1 of 2 that i ordered the other bra -LRB- wacoal -RRB- fits extremely well , however this one is not comfortable to wear because the underwire comes up too high under the armpit and tends to dig in , most uncomfortable . the top of the cup also cuts into cleavage slightly .
 I owned other bras with this style number , and assumed this one would be the same . But somehow the cups are cut lower . Otherwise it 's fine . Also the picture does n't show the leopard print .
 I had purchased a bra of this same exact model and size in the store , yet the one I ordered online did n't fit me well . Also , withina month , the wire circles that attach the straps to the bra became crooked .
 This is definetely not for the medium to big chested . Very uncomfortable , almost no support .
 i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size . when it got here i was about two sizes two big . just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast .
 Maidenform style # 7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape . I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price . I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store . This new style is an oddly molded half bra that does n't look natural under clothing - creating points where there should n't be any . I 've worn the same size and style for many years , and this product did not live up to the standard .
 I have purchased Maidenform Bras for years and lately it seems that the underwire breaks within a few months of purchase . Total waste of money , in my opinion
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 I could not recommend this product unless changes are made . I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great . However , I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing . The lengths were almost four inches shorter . I just wear them around the house now . The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar . The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar . So , they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations . Not very good product quality control . I have ordered more shirts , but from a different manufacturer .
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 I wear a 38C Bra size , and this bra fits the bill !!! Love it ! I just ordered another one . I would highly recommend this bra . It is very sexy , and comfortable.Update : After wearing this bra for a day , it 's NOT comfortable . I would not recommend it all , and I have returned the other one that was ordered , and the one I kept goes in the `` Not form fitting , and comfortable '' draw . I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead , so far it is very comfortable , and fits nicely to the breasts . I will be ordering another pair !
 I write this review for the DDD 's , this bra is pretty but no support for big bust , I guess that 's what you get for the price !
 I almost liked this bra , but the straps wo n't shorten up enough . Even when I adjust them to their shortest they 're much too long for me . This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking ! Maybe I 'm just built strangely , but I was n't able to wear this bra . It is pretty though .
 I really wanted to like this . I put it on and looked great . I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already . Maybe be good for smaller chest but did n't work for my 36DD bust .
 I did not like the seam placement in the cups ... it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though .
 I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with . I did this because of the price and it was money wasted . The bras fit as if it had been worn . Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right . So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist . Useless . Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill . Bad purchase . Bad fit . Pretty but not practical . I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well , this was not made for D + women .
 I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long . I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose . I 've probably only had that problem with 1 % of all the bras I 've ever bought , and sadly this was one of them . The cups run generously sized -LRB- which for me , as a D/DD usually is a positive thing , but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down -RRB- . The overall design was cute , but the odd sizing made it a no-go .
 It 's comfortable and soft , but priced high compared to the duration of validityUsed only three times in the last time was outdated and very badI purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two yearsDislikes
 Online this Bra looks Delicious ! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable . The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old &#34; Felina | Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra . &#34; They , I , did n't feel comfortable , nor safe walking or playing around in it . I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies , cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady ! YOu dig ?
 The fit is terrible . The narrow straps cut into my shoulders , but if they are loosened , the cups do n't provide the proper amount of support . You must be the exact right size to wear this bra ... comfortably .
 This bra is gorgeous . Unfortunately it does n't fit terribly well . It 's an odd size that 's neither a balconet or a demi and pinches in weird places . Also , the underwire digs in painfully after about two hours . The wide lace band is wonderful but for the less chesty , I 'd recommend passing on this one .
 I read the other reviews and based on those purchased this bra with high hopes.I am a 36 full cup D.This bra didnt cover anything !!!! Every time you move or particularly bend over everything is out.Yes it is very pretty but not practical , wish I could send it back but I wore it for a few hours . . what a waste of money !
 The fit was okay , it is pretty , but not very soft or comfortable . I like the balconette -LRB- balcony -RRB- style because it flatters a larger busted woman . The straps on a balconette bra set further apart than other bras -LRB- straps are more toward your underarm than in the middle of the cup -RRB- which I prefer , but with this bra the straps set way too far over nearly at my underarms . The underwire on the sides is one of the most uncomfortable I 've ever worn and keeps poking me . I ca n't wait to take it off when I get home ! I should just throw it away . For the price it should have much higher quality -LRB- aka softer -RRB- lace . Hope this helped !
 This was a great product for about 2 weeks . Looked great , fit great , but the underwire poked right through the material on both sides and it is now simply unwwearable . I have n't attempted to contact the manufacturer yet .
 Ok , it 's a pretty bra , the color is nice & it 's overall pretty . Here are my issues
 Quite flimsy . Doesnt give any support.The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt .
 The underwire fit well , but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive . I had to send them both back .
 I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross . This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night . Also it fit kinda weird . For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast . -LRB- It was probably only noticable to me , but still , did not make me feel sexy .
 The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to . They are a bit roomy , I 'm disappointed .
 unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt . : -LRB-
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 Whoever shot the photos for this bag did a great job - the bag was not as nice as it looked in the photos . It also did not fit the oversized laptop that it seemed it would . The wheels did n't seem like they would take much abuse , and the organizer pockets were cheap plastic . It earns points for color selection and for the handle . All in all , I sent it back despite the fact that the eBag policy is to only give a partial refund .
 The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months . The bag is now basically unusable .
 This beautiful costume was a birthday gift for my 5 yr old grandson . On Day 1 , the stitching started coming out . By Day 9 , the zipper was broken , the muscles were ruined and the costume had been mended three times . I strongly advise against this purchase . It is beautiful but not designed to be worn .
 I purchased this costume because it said it included shoe covers . That 's all my son talks about ... needing shoe covers ! When it came , it was a regular costume with no shoe covers . I 'm sure the costume itself is fine , but I did not get what I paid for.When I sent a complaint e-mail , I received no response from this seller .
 My son is 11-years-old and wears a 12-slim pants . The description claims they are for 11-14 but the packaging says 12-14 . At any rate , this costume is so tight on him it 's embarrassing even without using the spongey chest and abs insert . And he 's a skinny kid . Also , the mask is made out of some type of spongey material . I think an elastic cloth would 've been a better choice . He ca n't even wear the mask because he ca n't breath with it on and it smooshes his nose . If your child is maybe 9 - or 10-years-old , this might be a good choice , however .

 I have been buying this exact wrangler jeans for years and I could n't believe the poor quality of my recent purchase . The material is so thin you could almost see through it . This will be my last wrangler 's if this is the kind of jeans they are now producing .
 I ordered a pair of these a few weeks ago , and althought they fit fine , the material is not the same as it used to be . It appears to be thinner and lighter in weight . It wrinkles badly in the wash and feels more like lightweight canvas than denim . Visually it 's different too . These have vertical white threads that do n't show in the online pictures . I would not buy these again .
 I ordered 3 pairs of these Wrangler jeans and have been very disappointed with the quality . All 3 pair seem to fit differently even though they are all the same size . Two belt loops broke off the first time wearing them . I have Levis and Wranglers over 20 years old with all the belt loops intact . Yet another brand losing it 's reputation of quality by cheap material and cheap labor . Will no longer buy Wrangler and I was a long time fan of them .
 I ordered a pair of these which arrived today . I have other pairs of Wrangler jeans , and figured the sizing would be the same , boy was I wrong . These jeans arrived today , and compared to my other Wrangler jeans , these are nearly 2 sizes SMALLER in the waist for the SAME SIZE on the tag . I know they are cheap jeans , at only $ 17 , but , they should size the same as all of the other pairs I 've bought . Needless to say , I will not be buying another pair of these worthless jeans ever again .
 This product did not meet my expectation . It was supposed to be a regular rise but feels like a low rise . It is too tight for jeans that are labeled as relaxed fit jeans and is rather shorter than the expected length ... all these unwashed . Only God knows what will happen after the first washing . This particular product is disappointing for a wrangler jeans . If you need to order this product online , order a larger size than you need , and stay away from the blasted indigo . It actually looks awful !

 I got a hat covered in holes . There are no holes in the pictures . Would have loved it otherwise . Beware
 This military style hat is made in China . I saw a similar US made one in my local Army / Navy store , but they did n't have my size . I thought this would be the same , but it 's not . It has a strange line pattern in the material and just felt cheap . Although it 's only ten bucks , I just expected something of a little better quality for my money . I sent it back .
 I ca n't imagine who could pull off these clown pants . They 're unwearable ! What was Hanes thinking ?

 I sent an e-mail to seller asking if I could send back my Lipo in a box because the size was way too big to do any `` LIPOing '' and exchange it for a smaller size . They never answered the e-mail . Try a smaller size than you would normally get . The bra not much support - if you want to wear something sexy on top the bra will defeat all ideas of that .
 I bought two of these products . They are very comfortable , but definitely not `` firm control '' . They do smooth out the bulges a bit . Also , the `` convenience opening '' is far too small to be of any use . I have to undress to use the restroom . Sadly , During the second washing one of the underwires came out completely . It 's a lot of money , and not nearly as great as I thought it would be . Long story short , I 'm out almost $ 100 for an item I was able to wear twice .
 Product is hard to get on , and very inconvenient when you need to use the restroom . You have to take your arms out of your shirt to get this down for the bathroom . It did n't seem like it made any difference in body control . I am returning product and will not recommend to anyone .
 I bought this as a gag gift for a friend . As gag gifts are n't supposed to be completely functional , I was n't expecting much , but the hair on a wig should AT LEAST stay on the wig . It arrived in a box the size of an index and when I took it out to try and make it look some what like an afro , all the hair fell out . I believe that the statement `` you get what you pay for '' does not quiet suit this product . Save your money or invest in one that 's better quality .

 i was dissapointed with this bra , it was 1 of 2 that i ordered the other bra -LRB- wacoal -RRB- fits extremely well , however this one is not comfortable to wear because the underwire comes up too high under the armpit and tends to dig in , most uncomfortable . the top of the cup also cuts into cleavage slightly .
 I owned other bras with this style number , and assumed this one would be the same . But somehow the cups are cut lower . Otherwise it 's fine . Also the picture does n't show the leopard print .
 I had purchased a bra of this same exact model and size in the store , yet the one I ordered online did n't fit me well . Also , withina month , the wire circles that attach the straps to the bra became crooked .
 This is definetely not for the medium to big chested . Very uncomfortable , almost no support .
 i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size . when it got here i was about two sizes two big . just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast .
 Maidenform 's bra was labeled the correct size , but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length , and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 Be carefull with the seller Connie Elder because they messed up my address and wrote them three times and never got any answer . The product was returned to them and I have n't got any refund . Be aware .

 This wig was purchased for a child 's Cleopatra costume and we never did use it . We could not get it to flatten out so it looked like the picture ; it stayed kinked from the packaging , even days later .
 I had high hopes for this wig after reading some of the reviews but mine arrived with creases in the wig from being folded in the package . I could n't straighted the hair out so that it was wearable . Also the length was much shorter than the picture shows . I ended up returning it because the wig was n't wearable unless you were going for the creased lop-sided hair look .
 I ordered this robe based solely on it 's price . You certainly get what you pay for , poor quality ! It is thin and sized as one size fits all but after one wash it shrunk to maybe a womans medium . Luckily I am only 5 ' 2 and can still wear it , however my boyfriend who is 5 ' 9 certainly could not ! It also shed a great deal in the washer and the dryer ! If you are looking for a cheap `` disposable '' robe then this is the one for you .
 This item was not delivered in the condition that it was advertised as . I was specifically looking for a bathrobe without a folded collar , the photograph appeared to not have one , and the item description was vague . The robe was said to be unisex , but was clearly a woman 's article . Based on the quality of the robe , I also feel that I over-paid . This company wasted my time and money , I do n't recommend them to anyone .
 I was not expecting this to be so cheap in quality and for it to feel like an elderly 's shirt -LRB- you know what I am talking about ... the material that is thin and itchy -RRB- . I am not a busty lady at all -LRB- I ordered a 2x and I wear a small C cup -RRB- and it was super tight . I thought by the picture I would feel sexy but instead I feel like Goodwill would not even want this reject . So much for feeling sexy on my honeymoon .
 I like the look , but the material is itchy - not so enjoyable for my wife .
 It 's not pink , it 's more of a dull red . The worst part is when the emergency lights -LRB- almost the same color -RRB- go on in the ISS you are practically invisible . Vyacheslav told me that I could n't wear it back the next time , for safety reasons . Right , like there are a lot of other space stations I can wear it on . I was going to give it one star just for that , but it gets two because the air connector is really easy to disconnect .
 Maidenform style # 7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape . I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price . I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store . This new style is an oddly molded half bra that does n't look natural under clothing - creating points where there should n't be any . I 've worn the same size and style for many years , and this product did not live up to the standard .
 I have purchased Maidenform Bras for years and lately it seems that the underwire breaks within a few months of purchase . Total waste of money , in my opinion
 i was dissapointed with this bra , it was 1 of 2 that i ordered the other bra -LRB- wacoal -RRB- fits extremely well , however this one is not comfortable to wear because the underwire comes up too high under the armpit and tends to dig in , most uncomfortable . the top of the cup also cuts into cleavage slightly .
 I owned other bras with this style number , and assumed this one would be the same . But somehow the cups are cut lower . Otherwise it 's fine . Also the picture does n't show the leopard print .
 I had purchased a bra of this same exact model and size in the store , yet the one I ordered online did n't fit me well . Also , withina month , the wire circles that attach the straps to the bra became crooked .
 This is definetely not for the medium to big chested . Very uncomfortable , almost no support .
 i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size . when it got here i was about two sizes two big . just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast .
 Maidenform 's bra was labeled the correct size , but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length , and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 the quality of this product is fine , however it runs on the small side ... if you normally take a medium be sure to order a size large for comfort ...

 Bought pants at a local store on 3 May 2011 and they fit well . I went back to the store the next day wearing the new jeans to buy 2 more pair . When I reached to get my wallet out of my back pocket I heard something that sounded like a tear . I told the cashier I hope that was n't the pocket tearing and looked but could n't see anything . I went home and checked the pocket , sure enough it had torn . The pants were just worn 1 day .
 i bought them cos of the description `` button fly closure '' but had to return them . there is one button at top like any other jean but the rest is a zipper . ouch . why do n't they fix the description ?
 Beware -- when buying these reduced price Lee Jeans , the colors that Amazon shows on the website are WAY OFF and returns to Amazon are a N-I-G-H-T-M-A-R-E !!!!
 The pants I bought didnt look like the one 's on the website ... I gambled and lossed ... what can you do ?
 I have inserted a picture in the customer picture area so you can see what I am talking about . http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0008G282E/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allWhen I was younger , I used to love Lee jeans because they were comfortable and lasted a long time , so I bought two pair of these . Unfortunately , the quality is not what it used to be . Both pair ripped at the rear right pocket where I keep my wallet ... one in 3 months , the other in 4 . These are a bit expensive to be replacing every 3 to 4 months . I would guess it is a result of using lighter weight denim , but until I see evidence to convince me to try again , I will no longer purchase Lee jeans.Buy these if you do not carry a wallet in your rear pocket . Do not buy them if you do as they will rip very quickly .
 I have been trying to replace my Victoria 's Secret carpenter jeans for awhile . While these are very good , sturdy jeans for a real carpenter , even though they fit , they are HUGE . Very baggy and basically clown pants . I will be donating them .
 Based on other reviews , I ordered a size larger than I needed , and it is still way too small ! It seems like too much of a pain to return , so it is a total waste .

 I purchased these a few days ago . I was not impressed . The colour is not as white as it looks on the photo . It 's more of an off white colour as though its been washed a few times . The material was also off putting , similar to track suit material . I much prefer the pro stretch range .

 Ordered weeks ago and order was canceled today as it was suppose to be shipped . How do they not know what their inventory is , cancel an order after weeks and then continue to have this item on the website as available ! Check out their history as a seller in general-AVOID at all costs . Could have ordered from another vendor and had weeks ago . Too many places to spend your dollars to tie them up with these folks .

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .

 Just broke another flimsy arm on the sunglasses for the second time in a year and a half . I 'm pretty careful with my stuff . If they did n't break so easily -LRB- thin and brittle -RRB- , I would be happy with them . Because of their fragile nature , the $ 20 or so pricepoint is too high . They are probably worth more like $ 5 .
 Really disappointed in the quality of my second pair of Solarshields fits over sunglasses . Let me say that the first pair I had lasted over 2 years . Unfortunatly I lost them . I tried really hard to find the exact same pair with no luck . I purchased the smoke colored pair and I could not be more disappointed . The coating they put on the glasses started peeling off after had them for 2 weeks . I have now had them for 6 weeks and they look terrible . They are also too flexible and cheaply made . The lenses are the only thing I like about them . .
 When my large Polar Shield `` fit-over '' sunglasses finally broke -LRB- my fault -RRB- I looked for a replacement pair . Polar Shield no longer makes the same model -LRB- the newer Large model is more stylish but smaller -RRB- . Two other brands looked identical on the Amazon site - Solar Shield and OverxCast . I bought one of each and they are far from identical . The Solar Shield glasses are inferior to the others . The optical quality of the lens is poor . There are cloudy spots and the clarity is poor . The frame construction is also poor - appears very fragile . Due to the poor visibility of the lens I wo n't be wearing them . To make matters worse , the Solar Shield glasses cost more ?! The Overxcast glasses are terrific . It game with amber lens , which I was a little concerned about , but they 're terrific . The optical clarity is terrific and the frame construction is solid . No comparison . I 'm going to buy another pair of the Overcast just to make sure I always have one on hand .
 If the temple arms did n't break off because of cheap brittle material this product would be rated very good . For this kind of money I would look elsewhere .
 I have worn Solar Shields since my eye surgery 7 years ago . The first ones I had were just fine and lasted many years . I replaced them and the bows lasted less than a year before one broke . I guess I am a slow learner as I have 4 pair , all with different shaped bows or the same bow broken so I ca n't even make one of 2 . The last ones lasted 4 months .
 I have bought two pairs of Solar Shield `` Fit Over '' glasses . The first pair broke rather easily after just a few weeks - one arm -LRB- or `` temple '' in eyeglasses terminology -RRB- snapped midway between the frame and the ear portion of the arm . Thinking it was a fluke , I bought a second pair of Solar Shields . This time an arm snapped while just holding them in two hands and raising them to my face . Since that pair was ruined too , I carefully applied light pressure to the other arm and it snapped at the same point - midway to the ear . This is indicative of very poor quality materials / workmanship . Too bad they break so easily , as they fit well and I had high hopes for them . At $ 19.99 , they about 10 times as expensive as they should be . I am trying another brand now .
 I have had about eight pairs of Solar Shields and they all have broken -- most at the left ear piece . The plastic is brittle and cheap , even by current standards for eyeglasses frames , which in general are incredibly over-priced and flimsy , and a major consumer rip-off . In my opinion they are engineered to fail . I picked up a pair of Solar Shields at a Fred 's store that were discounted down to $ 2.99 , which is about the price they should sell for , given their cheap quality and lack of durability . They were made to end up in the landfill , along with mountains of other throw-away products -LRB- junk -RRB- produced in China for international corporations who take pride in how efficiently they can rip off millions of customers , over and over again .
 The sunglasses are comfortable and function well but break easily . I bought one pair that lasted about a year before the temple arm snapped . I thought that specific pair might have been defective , so I tried another . I was very careful in handling not to stretch or strain the temple , but after about six months this one snapped as well . Otherwise a good product , but I wo n't buy another.The manufacturer should be reading the multiple reviews & comments noting flimsy temples . I suspect it would only add a dollar or two to the price to incorporate metal reinforced temples .
 As an owner of 6 or 7 pair of Polar Optics / Solar Shield sunglasses , I 've experienced most every problem this brand is capable of having . The lens quality is excellent , but earpieces are very fragile . So why continue to pay 20 bucks each for so many pair ? Well , until about two years ago , warranty was great . A simple email was all it took to get an exchange pair , no matter what the problem . Then the emails went unanswered -- maybe they changed ownership , or fired the `` good '' warranty lady . So I tried the new customer service contact info . Oh sure , no problem , just send them in prepaid -- with proof of purchase -- oh yeah and be sure to include $ 5 or so for `` handling '' . The old lifetime guarantee is now a year -- and for sure , the earpieces will be shot before the warranty expires.Solar Shield Polarized Glasses
 My wife and I both have bought the Solarshield twice and both of ours broke in the same area from cheap plastic . At 20 bucks a pop they are too expensive to continue . Will look for American made .
 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes .

 I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good , or as in this case other shoppers need to beware . Now ... Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product , I went ahead and purchased two . I did n't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description . The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets . The fit is okay , but I 'm still not real satisfied with the purchase . I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality . Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better !!
 Russell Athletic Men 's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts . When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms . Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing . The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent . This may have been a problem with one assembly organization .
 Sure the shirt is good , but if I was n't a big fatty , I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T 's for the price of one big fatty T . But it 's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater - they can charge what they want because you 're stuck .
 Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in , kept giving me the run around , and I still do n't have them . do n't count on a refund either as long as they are `` on the way '' what a joke .
 Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and can not be worn again . The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China . The black one did not shrink . Would not order these again .
 I 've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now . I 'm 6 ' 2 '' tall , and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds ; they used to fit , not shrink , and have neck room.I 'm down to 230 pounds , but as soon as I wash the shirt , it shrinks - even in cold water wash , and delicate dry . The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to `` stretch '' / pull the shirt to be able to wear it ; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up -LRB- although the neck size is smaller than XL -RRB- . All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it 's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S. , with no real quality control in place.Gary
 i bought 5x 's . and they fit like they are 3x 's . i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt . i would not recomend them to any one
 every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day . how about american made products .
 Maidenform 's bra was labeled the correct size , but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length , and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .

 I ordered a jacket from Amazon . I selected the size and color that I wanted ; however , I received a jacket in the same style but another color . The tag on the sheet still said the color I was supposed to get but it was not correct . Item was returned .
 I have loved my HP 's in the past . I had numerous pairs and wore them often . I bought the big 5 pack because they were so great . I am 5 ' 5 '' and 125 lbs and they are just rotten baggy ... ugh , what a pain in the neck -- going to have to send these back ... why in the world they do n't offer sizes is beyond me ...
 I purchased 4 reclining beach chairs w/canopy . Every single one broke . When the metal frame is inserted into the webbing on the arms , the frame ripped right through the webbing . The company replaced the four chairs and they , in turn , broke the same way . The company states that this is a known problem but offers no help other than to replace the chairs once more.To add insult to injury , within three days of using the chairs , the elastic cord required to hold it in the upright position snapped , the zipper on one of the pouch came off , and the loop on the canopy cover tore out . All this happended within the first day or two of use .
 The product literature says it holds 250 lbs . I am 225 lbs and used this chair once at the beach . After sitting down slowly , the stitching ripped apart where the cloth arm rest meets the front metal pipe . I would not buy if you weight over 150 lbs .
 This chair is comfortable and convenient . Easy to tote , no doubt.However , the `` auto-reclining '' claim implies that the chair has multiple angles for the back . That perhaps the `` auto '' means the more pressure you apply with your back , the further back it goes , or at least provides some range of motion and more than one setting.Sadly this is not the case . The back has one position . It is a comfortable position , but only one position.If you are looking for added convenience , great range of motion / reclining in the back , and even a handy cooler , I would recomend either theRio Ultimate Backpack Beach Chair w / cooler - Blue Textilene , Tommy Bahama Backpack Cooler Chair with Storage Pouch and Towel Bar , orUltimate Backpack Beach Chair with Cooler - LayFlat 5 position . All are comfortable , portable , backpackers with more than one back position .
 I bought the Reclining Backpack Outdoor Chair for my seven day camping trip . I needed something comfortable , portable , and light to carry on my backpack . This chair seemed to fit my needs . It worked great for the first two days of use and I was extremely happy with it . But on the third day , the hand strap broke when I was sitting on it . What a disappointment ! When I got home , I have tried everything to fix it . No luck ! The hole that hooks the handle is ripped . Now , it sits in my garage and I may have to throw it out . The only reason that I gave this chair a two star rating is that it was comfortable for the first two days .
 I read the reviews before purchasing . It arrived with the loop that holds the arm rest to the frame unattached . After looking at the other side , it does n't appear that there 's much to hold the loop on anyway . I tried sitting in it to see how comfortable it was . It 's not hard to set up and it 's lightweight . But , I 'm 5 ' 8 and am really pretty skinny -LRB- size 8 jeans are loose -RRB- . The chair felt too small even for my skinny backside to be comfortable in , so I ca n't imagine it working on a normal adult . My guess is it would be fine for a kid if you could get the arms to stay on . Leaning back in it is uncomfortable for me . Maybe it 's having no padding of my own , but the way the back angles up cut into my back.Glad I only ordered one to test it out . As soon as I can figure out how to return it , it 's going back . It arrived in a defective condition with the loop detached on one arm , but even if I stitched that piece down , it would n't be comfortable .
 I was very disappointed to find that this vest was n't the same thickness I have purchased in the past . I ca n't imagine this layer will be able to really keep me that much warmer as it 's intended . What happened to the Columbia quality of old ? My husband also received a vest for Christmas , and we were equally disappointed with that one for the same reason . His vest that I bought him 4 years ago is much thicker -LRB- aka much warmer to wear in below freezing temps -RRB- . We were very disappointed .
 Although the Hanky Panky thong is more comfortable than any other thong or g-string I 've ever worn they 're still not as comfortable as regular underwear . Not really sure they 're worth the money . I could be uncomfortable for a lot less money .
 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .

 i ordered the small for this shirt and it looks like an x-large . if you 're considering buying this shirt pleas order a size smaller or if you wear a small , do n't buy it because it will swim on you .
 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it . It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue .
 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange -LRB- boxy almost -RRB- cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !

I am 5 ' 5 '' and 125 lbs and they are just rotten baggy ... ugh , what a pain in the neck -- going to have to send these back ... why in the world they do n't offer sizes is beyond me ...
 I purchased this as a piece for my Playboy bunny Halloween party . It is extremely thin and flimsy . I do n't feel comfortable wearing it at home let alone to a party . It can not cover even the smallest of breasts and the boning is practically nonexistent . Save your money and buy something more reliable !
 This outfit looks good on the model but it was very short over all and the legs are cut low and unflattering ... the leg cut doesnt seem to match the picture.Not sure who could fit the outfit . Maybe somebody with a short waist .
 I thought this outfit was classy and pretty nostalgic like a pin up or something . . That 's why I bought it and that 's what I was going for . . but ... Idk . . I expected the material to not look so cheap ... it fit nicely but I wish I would 've purchased something else ...
 This products stated in the products features that accessories were in cluded . I notified the seller when I rceived just a leotard for 35 dollars wondering where the rest of it was . The seller advises the product does not come with accessories . The ad for the product under the EXACT same place I pasted the exact description from was magically changed overnight . Horrible service !!!
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .
 Even though this is a very nice looking and roomy tote , it is not in fact leather as specified . If you do n't have a problem with that , you 'll love it . I just like getting what is described .

 Although the Hanky Panky thong is more comfortable than any other thong or g-string I 've ever worn they 're still not as comfortable as regular underwear . Not really sure they 're worth the money . I could be uncomfortable for a lot less money .
 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange -LRB- boxy almost -RRB- cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !
 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it . It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue .

 These bags are of the cheapest quality . All of the zippers are either broke or is missing after using it for only over a year ; and I travel only 5-6 times a year .
 The shipping box was slightly crushed on arrival . One side of the large piece of luggage was also slightly bent , which showed how poorly made the luggage was . Very little side support .
 I bought this luggage for our destination wedding and honeymoon , to be used for 3 weeks . I bought it for the low price and the recognizable color , as I have had strangers mistake my old luggage for theirs before . They arrived in a very timely fashion , and I immediately noticed they are of very basic design on the inside , but I thought they would surely function . I made sure not to over pack them as I wanted to leave room for purchases from our trip . On the first flight , the main handle broke on the largest piece , which ended up being a hassle for anyone who tried to carry our luggage . The 2nd largest piece had seams ripping on the outer pockets . Then the second flight there was a large hole torn/punched into the back fabric of one if the pieces . 3rd flight , one wheel was barely hanging on for dear life on another piece . Not to mention they did n't hold their shape very well and looked terrible long before our trip was over . My college luggage from Target is still in better shape than these , and used much more . Plus , I expected these to have a more butterscotch/black color , but are very Crayola orange/black . I could care less about the actual shade of orange , but while I am writing this review I might as well mention it .
 I read the reviews and thought , they ca n't be that bad . Well I should have listened . The fabric is nice , however the zippers get caught and you have to back track a lot , and the pull bars do n't come out on all of them . this company sent the product with no invoice and no return label . These suit cases are only used for overnight trips now and will never see the inside of an airplane . I will never buy form this company again .
 Do not buy - they delivered the bags 10 days after the precribed time , and the product was sub standard , with bad zips . They did not send me a recipt and a retunr address so I dont know how to ship this back .
 Ordered this LAST week . They would be delivered by the 14th / 19th . TODAY I got a email that they cancelled . NO reason and OO my creditcard was not charged . -LRB- tsjaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa -RRB- Never will buy from this one again
 I ordered these for my boyfriend . The sizing chart online was incorrect . While the first pair was beautiful , they were too small . So we sent them back , waited almost 10 days -LRB- the first pair were one-day shipping and still took three days -RRB- . We were disappointed when we opened the replacement . It appears that the coveralls were folded and left in the sun . The top 2/3 were faded several shades lighter than the legs with a noticeable fold line . Since it was such a hassle to exchange the first pair , we opted not to return . But for the money , we should have received something that looked brand new and not something that was sitting somewhere fading away .
 I wear an 11.5 but of course no one makes size 11.5 shoes so I 've always worn 12 's . I ordered these after my old boots had fallen apart and started letting whatever moisture I was standing in seep into my socks . Working on an ambulance I 'm sure you can imagine what kinds of moisture I was standing in ... Anyway I ordered these in a size 12 , which let me remind you is a half size too big for me ALWAYS , and when they came I tried to try them on . I could n't even get my foot into them they were so small . I thought maybe Amazon had shipped the wrong size but no , the box said 12 . I checked out the boots thinking maybe the wrong boots made it into the box but again no luck . The tongue clearly said Mens Size 12 . I was so irritated . I shipped them back and went to the local uniform outfitter and bought a pair.I told this story to the guy there and he told me
 My wife bought me these boots as a Christmas present . She ordered them about a month before Christmas ; when I opened them and tried them on I found them to be too big . Of course we could n't exchange them for a smaller pair because they do n't take returns after 30 days.So I stuffed them with insoles to make them fit . I only wore these boots for about six months before I had to throw them out . I am a police officer , so the boots get used pretty hard , but I 've had Wal-mart boots that lasted longer . BOTH soles had completely worn down ; it 's a good thing I had the insoles in them because that 's what I ended up walking on ! The zippers had broken , one heel had split in half , and no amount of waterproofing agent would help keep water out . Terrible boot for any amount of money . Will not buy Western Chief product ever again .
 The Bra squeaked loudly until after multiple washings . Now the wire has poked through and I can no longer wear it , after only several months . I would like to return .
 This item states 54 on tag but it is really a 42 or 44 . The pants might be a 32 '' . Either way it is to small and should a average junior high student . Do not buy .

 It seems like a good sturdy hat but the color of the band that goes around the hat in the picture is Dark Brown-Blackish . The color of the band on the hat I got was a plain brown , it does n't look like the same color as in the picture . I like the hat in the picture better , is the hat in the picture the same hat I got ? or was it like the main model hat used to sell all the other hats ? Looks like the front Brim of the hat in the picture is longer than the one I got too .
 This is one expensive toy . I now have a better hat and I payed half the price . This one does not look like the one in the picture . I does n't look like the one indy wore . It looks fake ... Why is it so stiff ? Is it possible to change the shape of this thing ?
 DO NOT BUY THIS!It 's not worth $ 50.00 ... let alone over $ 100.00 . I picked one up years back for about $ 30 . It 's a nice kid 's hat at that price . It 's robbery at $ 100 . The material is very thin and it will shrink , especially if it gets wet at all . The shape is even wrong , especially the shape of the top dent . -LRB- bash -RRB- Watch the movies , at no time did Indy have a teardrop shape dent on the top of the hat.Just because it 's `` official '' does n't mean it matches the item in the movie.For the same amount of money shop around and get an Akubra Federation IV hat .
 Look . I have this hat in my collection and I wish I had never bought it . If you want to buy a hat that actually looks like the Indiana Jones hat , do NOT buy this hat . The quality of the fur is atrocious . It feels and looks and acts like wool . Worse , it 's not remotely similar to the hat that Ford wore in any of the Jones movies . The crown is quite tapered , totally unlike the real hat and the bash ... or dent ... in the top of the crown is triangular shaped , which is nothing like the original Jones hat . And these are two features that you can not change due to the stone hard stiffness of this monster . Even steaming it wo n't work . If you 're truly looking for realism , only the Christy Adventurer or the Akubra Federation IV or the Adventurebilt ... at an admittedly obscene price -LSB- my principles wo n't allow me to buy a hat that cost twice what my leather Indy jacket cost -RSB- ... are in the running . If you must buy THIS hat , buy the wool felt model . It will feel exactly and look exactly the same and when you realize that it looks nothing like the Jones hat , you 'll only be nicked at half the price . Here 's the good news
 The Bra squeaked loudly until after multiple washings . Now the wire has poked through and I can no longer wear it , after only several months . I would like to return .
 We had this prodcut 2 days and the white feathers came out and the tinker jewel picture fell off . Would not purchase again .
 These are yet again not durable at all . As they say `` one size fits all '' is a lie . These are sized for probably a 8 year old or older . I 'm glad that I bought them when they were only 3 dollars instead of 7 or $ 11.99 . I would NOT have purchased these for anymore than 3 dollars . They should be a simple dollar because that 's how cheap they are . They are pretty much useless for our almost three year old daughter . They do not fit her at all but she will still try to wear them . I can wear them very tightly it 's pretty sad and I 'm 18 years old a size 7 1/2 in womens . DO NOT buy these . waste of money .
 I wanted this to complete my daughter 's costume - she could get a splinter walking in the house these are so cheaply made .
 There was no size listed so we too a chance and we failed they were too big almost a size that would fit a LARGE child . Too much hassle to send back .
 Shortly after receiving these slippers , one of the pendants fell off the foot . Looks like it was tacked on with elmers glue . Horrible construction , cheap product . Shoes were supposed to be for a toddler , but they were WAY too big for my 4 year old .
 I bought these slippers for my 3 1/2 year old grandaughteras they stated one size fits all for 3 years and up ... WellUp is the key word ... These slippers could fit a girl from8 to 10 years old ... Very misleading !!!
 The slippers are cute but they are way too big for a four year old - even a big four year old . They do have a non-skid bottom , which will be good if she can ever keep them on her feet .
 While this product can not be described as traditional ballet slippers as they are paperthin . They have withstood the test of time . You can not wear them in the street , they are made for inside use only and then only sparingly .
 We bought these shoes to go with our 4 year-old daughter 's tinkerbell outfit for Halloween . Unfortunately the shoes are soft fabric with non-slip soles similiar to house slippers , so they can not be worn outside - the sole is so thin that any object -LRB- stick , rock -RRB- would be felt on the foot .
 I bought these because it said the shoes were `` One size fits most '' for 3 + . I figured they would be a little big but it should really say for 6 + . These shoes are closer to fitting me than my three-year-old , and her feet are bigger than other girls in her class !

 Maidenform 's bra was labeled the correct size , but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length , and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .
 i was dissapointed with this bra , it was 1 of 2 that i ordered the other bra -LRB- wacoal -RRB- fits extremely well , however this one is not comfortable to wear because the underwire comes up too high under the armpit and tends to dig in , most uncomfortable . the top of the cup also cuts into cleavage slightly .
 I owned other bras with this style number , and assumed this one would be the same . But somehow the cups are cut lower . Otherwise it 's fine . Also the picture does n't show the leopard print .
 I had purchased a bra of this same exact model and size in the store , yet the one I ordered online did n't fit me well . Also , withina month , the wire circles that attach the straps to the bra became crooked .
 This is definetely not for the medium to big chested . Very uncomfortable , almost no support .
 i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size . when it got here i was about two sizes two big . just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast .
 Maidenform style # 7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape . I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price . I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store . This new style is an oddly molded half bra that does n't look natural under clothing - creating points where there should n't be any . I 've worn the same size and style for many years , and this product did not live up to the standard .
 I have purchased Maidenform Bras for years and lately it seems that the underwire breaks within a few months of purchase . Total waste of money , in my opinion
 I had read all of the reviews and thought I would get a quality product . This hat was made of cheap felt like fabric , and will not stay upright . Not worth the price at all .
 I could not believe the price I paid for this hat . It is thin , generic looking and hard to keep on your head .

 I just got these leggings and am sorry to say I am disappointed.The photo is deceptive because it does not show how the waist and hems look.The rubber band is not comfortable around the belly , and my butt looks terrible in them -LRB- you know how they show the crease ? -RRB- ! The textile is also of a poor quality.Also too expensive ... I expected something of a better quality for this price .

 The High Sierra Colossus Duffel appears to be a well constructed , attractive bag . I have only used the bag a few weeks so I can not attest to the overall durability . Too often , I have purchased gym bags -LRB- i.e. a number of CalPaks -RRB- only to find that they fall apart within a year or two . The term Colossus led me to believe that the bag was quite large and would be an ideal bag for the gym . When looking for a new gym bag , I was looking for a bag that had the size and compartments of my CalPak Patriot but that was better constructed . The $ 80 CalPak is falling apart after 2 years of very careful use.Though the Colossus has many compartments most -LRB- both sides & bottom -RRB- are designed for wet storage . This design severely limits the storage capacity of dry items . I do like that the bottom storage can be accessed from inside the main compartment . Additionally , the main compartment is quite small . After putting a pair of men 's gym shoes and average sized toiletry bag , very little else will fit in the main compartment . I often find myself carrying items in my hands that should fit in my gym bag . This is not only an inconvenience but increases the chances of leaving items behind.This is a good bag that could be great with a few design tweeks which would not increase the overall size of the bag . I personally only need one wet storage area not three . The main compartment needs a few more cubic inches of space .
 The Bra squeaked loudly until after multiple washings . Now the wire has poked through and I can no longer wear it , after only several months . I would like to return .
 This will keep you sucked in but it was way to thick and bulky to wear under my dress , I ended up buying another plain strapless Wacoal bra .
 The cup size fit perfectly , but the waist line did not . I have a long normal torso , but the material gave me pooched out hips and the boning was sharp in the back .
 I bought this bra to go underneath my bridesmaids dress . It was by far the most painful thing EVER . By the end of the night I had huge welts in my back from the side wires digging in to me . The support was wonderful though . Beauty is pain I guess !
 Way too thick . I bought this to go under a bridesmaid 's dress and it was just way too thick . Instead of pulling you in it actually expands you ! My dress was a little big and this thing made it impossible to zip ! I bought a regular Wacoal strapless instead which worked out perfectly , but this was a waste of $ $ $ .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I purchased this bag only to have the plastic handle used to pull the bag crack on the second day of my trip . Very disappointed and I would definitely not recommend . I purchased the bag because of the good reviews but I am regretting this now . It could be a fluke but I am going to simply try to return it and get a different bag .
 I travelled back to the UK with my new bag , and faulty stitching down one corner has already resulted in a gaping hole . This is very shoddy workmanship , and I feel like I was ripped-off . Now we have the hassle of my partner taking the bag back to the USA before it can be returned for a refund .
 This bag is spacious and durable . However , I do n't recommend it for the simple reason that it it does n't stand upright . There is nothing more inconvenient or annoying than a piece of luggage that constantly falls over and wo n't stand upright when you let go of the handle and put it on it 's end .
 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .
 As soon as we removed it from the package , the yarn was falling from the hat .
 Ow.And ugly under clothes.The search for a really good strapless bra continues .
 I bought this bra because of all the good reviews . I am returning it . It was too tight and the cup size was too small . I know my size , I bought another bra in it today at the mall . Besides being to small it was just uncomfortable and painful . I wear a 38D so I need support and this was not providing it.However , today I went to JCPennys and got a great strapless made by ambrielle . It 's comfortable and supportive I recommend it if you need a good strapless that is comfortable and supportive . Also the victoria secret bio fit is pretty good but more expensive .
 the bra is not true to its size and since there is no padding , it creates a see-through effect under the sun
 Simply put , it was almost as if I had not worn anything . This did not provide enough support even though it wrapped well around my breast .
 We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length -LRB- the 36 was more like a 34 -RRB- , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it `` mostly '' fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way .
 Not too sure if I like this bra.If you are over 60 and have a 38D cup , the support should be greater than a young person whose breasts have not fallen , do not think that this bra could perform this miracle of supporting so much flesh
 I was gon na use it for a merida costume but when I got it the thing was as red as a tamato i was really mad !!
 Wash it once and it fades , snags , and buttons fall off . Also this color looks like the draperies in a cheap 1950s motel . Get the Izods instead .
 This item states 54 on tag but it is really a 42 or 44 . The pants might be a 32 '' . Either way it is to small and should a average junior high student . Do not buy .
 These are the cheapest thigh highs I 've ever purchased . They got snagged as I was simply and gently removing them from their package . The material is not soft ... it 's actually a bit itchy . Would not purchase these again . The rhinestones are sparse and would more than likely fall off if I were to hand wash them . Bottom line
 I 'm only giving these 2 stars because of sizing and fit , not because of quality of the coverall . I would suggest trying these coveralls in the store to find the correct size and to see if they will even fit right if you are tall ... and then buy on Amazon , since the price is so much better . My husband is 6 ' 5 &#34; with an average build -LRB- too skinny for Big & Tall -RRB- . While these claim to be tall , they must have forgotten to make the arms for tall men and the legs honestly . I read on the sizing chart that the tall size has an inseam length of 32 &#34; , but decided to try it anyway . They were way too short in the legs and arms especially -LRB- at least 5 inches above his wrist -RRB- . Also , even after looking at the Carhartt sizing chart , go up at least one size if not 2 or 3 of whatever you are thinking . My husband wears 36 &#34; waist pants , I got him a 44T and they were way too small.Pros

 If I pay $ 20 + for an official MLB hat , the only logo want on the outside of my hat is my team 's . I ca n't believe '47 brand had the balls to put their own logo on the side of this hat . Ruins that hat for me . What a stupid decision and I ca n't believe MLB allows it .

 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .

 Disposable shirt , wear once and throw away . Washed it and it literally began to fall apart and unravel . Not worth even the $ 5 bucks I paid for it .

 black band at top was super tight , and within 1 hour of wear the socks got a run in them from the top down . Had to throw away after wearing once . But they were for a halloween costume so it was n't a big deal
 The black band is a little too tight . I like the stockings but for an average size witch this creates a little problem . I have to wear them as socks .

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .

I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June .

 My son received this as a gift for his 4th birthday in the Child size Small which is meant for boys ages 4-6 . He is tall for his age , but this costume is huge on him . It is too long and there is no way to realistically make it smaller for his size . Also the belt falls off of him because it 's so big and there 's no way to make it tighter.He is so disappointed because he wanted to wear it for Halloween this year , but it bunches up at the knees . I 'm disappointed by their sizing standards and wish that I could figure out a creative solution for him .
 I purchased a clone trooper costume for my grandson ... It came as discribed and was in wonderful condition . It was a brand new costume and was the costume he wanted . As for me . . I feel it was very cheaply made and not worth the high price I paid ... but then again . I 'm an old woman and what do I know about costumes ... except that i 've made several of my own for many years and was very dissapointed in the cheap quality of the product . And he will have a terrible time being able to see through the slit they have on the mask of the costume ... Which he 'll probably end up having to take off to see and then he wo n't look like a clone trooper . But a kid in a one piece pajama outfit ... but welcome to 2008 ... As long as he was happy and does n't know the difference ... so be it ...
 We sent this back the day after receiving it . Cheaply made , yes , but we expected that . We were disappointed mainly in the fit , which was not even close . Size runs much smaller than stated . Helmet is poorly done . It is more like a mask which was uncomfortable and did n't fit properly either . My boy could n't see out of it . Amazon was excellent about taking the costume back . You can get this at Target too . Go check it out and see for yourself . This is n't worth half the money they 're charging . Wish we could find good star wars costumes that did n't cost a ton . That would make a lot of little boys happy .
 Too short and too trasparent , does not cause the desired effect , it will be better to invest in a more expansive model .
 HUGE ! Like the other reviewers said , the mask is flat on the inside and pushes on their nose , so my son did n't wear the mask much .

 Very itchy and the second it snagged on something -LRB- the day I first used it -RRB- a lot of yarn got pulled out and bunched up . I never wore it again . Do n't waste your money !

 Just got this costume today and it looks NOTHING like the photo I relied upon in purchasing it - the mask is tiny , with straps in the back -LRB- not desc with no hair -LRB- as shown in the photo -RRB- and the slits for the eyes are huge and ON TOP OF/OVER the actual eyes of mask . The robe and sash are not the same color depicted in photo and the quality is shotty , at best . Do n't buy this . Even worse , is that Amazon says it can only be returned if unopened but you can not find the deficiencies without opening the package . I am glad I opened it in time to realize this and get a better costume for the price . I even purchased hands and light sabre separately . My son and I are SO disappointed !

 This a nice looking and perfect sized little bag . However , the interior coating peals off and flakes like little grey snowflakes almost immediately after buying the bag . It will get all over whatever you put in the bag . Not worth buying !!!!
 It is light and have enough capacity for bike commute if you are not carrying a laptop . But , it slips from back to side quite often and therefor not suitable for relatively long and serious bike commuting .
 Not particularly spacious , and literally began to shred within three months of use . If you plan on using this more or less daily -LRB- like I did as a gym bag -RRB- you 're definitely better off giving this one a pass . There 's absolutely better to be found .
 Pissed off ! I have two major issues with this bag . Ordered this just over a week ago as my first messenger bag for cycling . Was pissed as soon as I opened the package because it arrived as a left dominant person bag . It rests on my right shoulder and sits on your left hip or side . Not normal . I never requested this and not sure why this is ? So I was just getting around to writing to ask for a other shoulder replacement this week . Is it even available?To make matters worse , twice my phone dropped to the ground today after closing -LRB- loosing using the word -RRB- the cell phone pouch on the shoulder strap using the velcro closure . The second time it fell my phone screen busted and cracked into a million pieces . Now I need a new glass screen that I need to spend $ 49 plus tax to replace . If it 's possible , otherwise I had to buy a new phone . The velcro closure does n't work and I 'm out $ 50 bucks for the repair and my time . I was trying to go cheap , but your better off buying a quality product.K-Cliffs I would love to hear from you .
 Broke on me after one month and a few days recomended for light !! loads of weigh not for anything intense .
 This bag is very cheap but the $ 15 would be far better spent on some takeout Chinese food.As I guess you would expect , cheap materials , very flimsy design , the strap is adjustable but not long enough for an adult over 6 feet tall.All in all . . basically worthless . I threw it in a closet never to be used or looked at again . Not worth the trouble to send it back . This was an impulse purchase that just did not work out for me .

 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange -LRB- boxy almost -RRB- cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !
 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it . It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue .
 I bought this cami for my mom but I had to return it . Was not as expected . The color was perfect though .

 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it . It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue .
 I ordered this costume in the toddler size for my 3 year old and the costume came with toddler size on the tag but is way too big for her . My 7yr old tried it on and it is too big for her as well .
 Dickies - Girls ' Flat Front Pantsi found the same pants at walmart.com for $ 12 each . Why would i pay more in amazon.com ?
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 The bagpack looks great online but its not very sturdy . The liner on the bag keeps hanging out while you 're trying to drag the bagpack . It 's very narrow , which is very hard to put books and folders in . Theres only one big compartment on the outside so everything is mixed up in there . . so unorganized !!!
 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much .

 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .

 I bought several shirts in different colors in 2XL . However , their idea of 2XL was not mine . 2XL looked more like a large plus the cotton is thin so shrinkage would have made them a medium . Needless to say , the shirts were returned .
 I thought Ultra Force is a good company with quality products , but now i know and i am not going to buy another Ultra Force product in my life.These pants were not available in any other european online shop ... so i had to choose an american online retailer who can ship to Eastern Europe.I paid a 35 $ postage fee for a 35 $ cargo pant ... ca n't wear anymore , the black colour looks 15 years older just after 5 washes.I am definitely going to post pictures ... to warn others

 These pants are an excellent fit and look very nice . I have had difficulty since putting on weight in finding slacks that look as well as feel good . These have suited me perfectly . I would recommend them . I also bought the black stripe in the same style.Douglas Tallant
 For some reason the sizing on these seemed too small . I have ordered , and I 'm still wearing , the same underwear and same size . They fit fine . These seemed to tight .
 They were made of flimsy material that you could see through . They shrank about two sizes when washed in warm water .
 Hanes cotton briefs have always been my favorite undies to wear , so it actually pains me to give them a horrible review . I ordered 12 pairs of these , and out of the 7 pairs I have tried on so far , I ripped 4 of them off and threw them directly into the trash . Something has gone very wrong with the quality control on this product . Maybe they are making them with an unskilled labor force overseas , I do n't know . But what I was sent were four packages of very obviously irregular briefs . The very first pair I tried on , they felt screwed up so I looked in the mirror . The side seams were noticeably different ... one side was about 1/4 -1 / 2 inch longer than the other side . I attempted to get through the day wearing them , but they kept twisting and giving me a wedgy on the shorter seam side . After wearing them for an hour , I took them off and threw them in the garbage . Unfortunately , I have now had the exact same experience with three more pairs . I had assumed that I could n't return underwear , so I had thrown away all the packaging . Now I regret that . At least 50 % of my order is defective product.I have to admit that this is not the first time I have had problems with this product . Years ago they were very high quality , but they slowly have gone downhill . The last time I bought them , a few years ago , I noticed then that a few pairs were not made quite right . They also did n't last years like they used to . After about six months , all the elastic started warping and little pieces of rubber started to stick out of the waistbands . Also a string would stick out of the waist occasionally , and if I attempted to put it , it would unravel around the whole waist . I chalked it up to a fluke batch , and ordered them again . I can see clearly with this recent Amazon order that this product is no longer the high quality product that it used to be . It is now complete crap , and I have spent my last dollar on them.Sorry Hanes ... you lost a longtime customer .
 the packaging had different graphics and the content , 6 pairs of hanes Cotton Briefs , also was different . briefs were smaller than previus prurchases of the same size of Hanes Cotton Briefs .
 I am disappointed in the quality of these panties . I 've worn Hanes for years and tried to replace what I have with these new ones . . The fabric is thinner that the old ones , the size runs small , and they seem to be cut a bit short . I will keep them because it is not worth it to spend the money to return them , but I will by the Fruit of the Loom next time .
 Bit the bullet and ordered size 7 -LRB- have been a size 6 forever -RRB- . They fit great and come in those lovely packs - so suitable for travel ! Hanes really are the only briefs anyone should buy .

 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .
 I too , had the same problem as another customer . After a month the seams in the pants ripped , in the front no less . The jacket is still holding up but the pants are useless . Very disapponited in my purchase . My best advice , read lots of reviews and shop around .
 This rain suit kept me dry , but the seams connecting the arms ripped after a month of wearing it during our rainy season . I was using it for yard work , but it should last longer than that ! I am very disappointed with this purchase .
 The sizing chart is off and these shirts run many sizes too small . I measured as a 2X , usually am a 3X , but ordered a 4X for extra room . The shirt was skin tight , closer to a Large . Maybe the regular sizes are correct , but the plus sizes are way too small . I would have liked them if they fit . I never would have ordered them if the size chart was accurate .
 Very disappointed in the quality for the price . Cheaply made . Face mask and shin guards made out of brittle plastic .

 I just got this item in mail as my little girl is expecting this from Santa . Xmas is only a few days away and I can not even imagine going to another store looking for an alternate . I really wished that I would like this item but as soon as I opened the box , I could n't help but be stunned with a disappointment . It is poorly made with poor quality thin fabric . If my daughter runs around in this item , I wo n't be surprised to see it ripped . The first thing came to my mind was that it is probably worth only about $ 15 the max . I paid $ 29.99 at Amazon . Anyhow , I do n't want to let my girl down so I guess we are keeping this for Xmas . I am so unhappy with the quality that I am secretly hoping that my girl would dislike it so that I can return it right after Xmas . I know that this sounds terrible but for those who are considering this item , hope this review helps . The sad thing is that I could n't find any other better looking items in the similar price range .
 I was expecting that this dress would be at least of the level of the gowns sold in Target , if not the Disney store . But the material is this very thin , cheap satin with no underlayers or extra skirting . I wanted to return it soon after I 'd compared it to the ones at the Disney store but had already thrown away the external packaging -LRB- just a plastic bag , but still it was gone -RRB- . And I could n't bring myself to spend more money on top of it , so this is the junk my daughter wore last Halloween . Please , wait for a sale at the Disney Store and buy one there instead .
 The bib is cute and waterproof , but the pocket to catch the crumbs lays flat and does n't do a great job .
 I bought this for a baby shower gift . But it 's so thin and sad looking I do n't know what to do with it ! It 's really light . I can see the food flying and dropping everywhere rather than staying on the bib as it 's supposed to . I totally thought this would like the vinyl ones I got from Target previously . If you think I 'm picky , just go to a store yourself . I later found this same kind at Target , Walmart , and Ross . I 'll never buy this thing again . I 'll shout out a few extra bucks to buy the vinyl ones , any day !
 I do n't absolutely hate this bib , but it 's definitely not what I was hoping for , especially since it 's over-priced and I paid so much for it . Although it is very easy to hand wash and reuse for each feeding -LRB- which is why I wanted it - I did n't want to have to do laundry every time my baby ate -RRB- , it does not accomplish its job as a bib fully . The neck is so big that most of the food gets on my daughter 's neck and clothes . So what is the use of wearing it ? My daughter is six months old , and her height and weight are in the 95th percentile , indicating that there is a problem with the actual size of the bib . I tried tightening it as much as I could by closing it at the end tip of the velcro , but that did not work either . I do n't see her growing into it any time soon.On a plus note , I do like the material this bib is made of . Like I mentioned earlier , it 's really easy to wash . I just run some warm water over it and hang it for our next use . However , I do need to find another alternative . So far , I have found the normal cloth bibs to work best , but washing them is definitely a hassle .
 Will never order this belt again ... At least I was given a prompt and full refund . Belt did n't last 1 day before breaking into pieces ...
 The gloves were quality gloves . I order these gloves for the men at the church I attend . A couple of the gloves would not fasten . Also some of gloves burst between the thumb and pointer finger . They did not fit like shown in the picture . They were not happy . So now I have to try and find them some better gloves . I was disappointed .

 The head piece looks so cheap , and the mane lays flat , no matter what you do . Its very cheap , and they wo n't give you a refund either . I really think they are misleading us by putting a picture of a nicer costume but actually selling you the super cheap one . Amazon should step in and say the picture must match the product recieved . Regardless of price , you should get whats pictured , or clearly state its not .
 Material is too thin , would be good for a warmer climate . My baby wears size 12 months but this barely fits him . Have to return it .

 The material is polyester but it is the stiffest polyester ever made . You ca n't really tie this scarf appropriately because it is so stiff and awkward that does n't sit well . It 's basically useless and does n't look good at all . I would certainly not recommend this product .

 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it .

 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange -LRB- boxy almost -RRB- cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !

 Way too small for a scarf , can not be used neither as a scarf nor as an ascot . The material is okay .
 I ordered a 45 inch Mens scarf . It arrived in a plain envelope . It may or may not be one hundred percent silk , but is quite thin in any event . The seams are the usual mass produced Asian import seams
 I bought this scarf as a gift for a friend but had to return it . The photograph does not show how bad and uneven the stitching is . In addition to that the scarf had creases all over , most likely from already having been returned and repackaged . I contacted the seller but received no reply in over a week .
 I did n't feel as though this worked as advertised . It 's okay for shaper . but I 've had others I like much better .

 Customer service is worse than awful , especially a gal called Kim . I did n't get a 2nd chance to give purchaser 's name & she refused to talk to me further , no matter how much purchase information I gave to show I 'm the actual purchaser . The irony is that it was they who got my records wrong ! So , do n't sigh , nor cough , nor say `` what ? '' . She 'll count these as buyer 's name misquoted too . The consolation is that the product is of good quality for the discounted price .

 These stockings are beautiful , and exactly what I wanted in place of the pair I really wanted . The problems were as follows
 Do n't buy this belt !!! I thought this was going to be one of those regular belts that alreadys had a buckle on it , I was totally wrong . There is no way to wear this belt , you must purchase a belt buckle to wear this belt . I do n't think that really is a way to hook on a belt buckle on this belt . ~ Very Disappointed

 wig is matted and twisted up , looks nothing like the picture . The beard is too uncomfortable to stand ! But , I guess you get what you pay for , this is a cheap product so you cant expect much
 These boots , I guess , were not made to be worn everyday for work . After 2 1/2 weeks the footing inserts are falling apart and the leather is splitting . If you want tough work boots do n't buy these . These are made just to look good .
 More than a month later I have not yet had the pleasure of using this item . I ordered boots and received shoe . The return process was cumbersome and ineffective , till this date this issue had not been resolved . I have had to pay out of pocket in order to return this product .
 The bow tie fell apart and could not be used . Had to return the set for refund . Cummerbund would have worked out fine .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in .

 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 These gloves arrived and they are huge and ugly and dont look like the picture .

 Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange -LRB- boxy almost -RRB- cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !
 The shirts are fantastic . I wear dickies pants and shirts and they hold up great . My reason for the 2 stars isthat the wrong size was sent . I ordered a 2xx and received a 1x . Not a big deal but I did n't check the size before I removed the tag so i could not return it . The first time i found out that the size was wrong My wife and I went on a trip and when I put the shirt on I almost ripped it . It was my fault for not checking the size but if the right size was sent in the first place it would not have been an issue .

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 A week after buying this product , the leather came loose!Very disappointed ! Never experienced this with Kenneth Cole products . I hope I get a discount for this !
 The belt is nice , however the buckle broke after a week of use . Also , the brown side of the belt is a bit too dark for my taste .
 This nproduc is not original , it is not lether it is synthetic . Actually i have the same belt and you can tell the diference right away IT IS FAKE .
 Belt seperated between the black and brown side after one month of normal use . Did look great while it lasted .
 I do not care for the buckle and prefer a flip type of reversible belt buckle . The description did not provide enough info about the type of buckle . I would not have bought the belt if I knew the type of buckle
 I ordered a size 32 and received one that is at least 5 inches short ! Frustrating . Quality seems good though .
 IDurability is a concern , the leather started to separate within the first week of wearing it . I was disappointed !!!!!!! I have bought other Kenneth cole belts and they were quite durable so was not please with this one , given the usual standards i 'm accustome to with kenneth cole brand .
 The leather feels supple and soft . The buckle design is cool . I received compliments on the belt.No problems to report.Update - When I first received the belt and the first several times I wore it , I was happy with it.But after wearing the belt several times using both sides , it has separated right in the middle between the black and the brown sides . Since it is out of the return time window , Amazon wo n't do anything . It is cheaply put together and comes apart easily . I have owned other reversible belts in the past , but Kenneth Cole Reaction is the only one that has separated , especially so soon in use .
 The belt looks neat because of it simplicity . However the quality is awful . The belt split into two layers . I suggest not buying this belt .
 I purchased this as a gift for my dad . The durability is a concern . The buckle is broken after a few months use .
 I have been purchasing belts for a long time and various KC belts through the time , this one is by far the worst belt ever . The belt started to separate right down the middle and it just looks awful that I 'm just going to trash it ! I have three other KC belts and they are great the leather is very different and way better , beyond the quality of this one . I Will Not Recommend anyone Purchasing this belt .
 After 4-5 wearings , the belt started to separate -LRB- the black side from the brown side . SAVE YOUR MONEY - DO N'T BUY IT !
 If you need a belt for 2 maybe 3 occasions this is a great belt , received many compliments when it was wearable . After wearing the belt 4-5 times it split from where the holes begin to where they end much like other reviewers . Poor build quality and unable to return a defective product earns this belt 1 whole star .
 I just used it for one month but the belt start to separate . -LRB- the inner brown face and outre black face are detached -RRB-
 Fit was poor , quality was poor , will end up at Salvation Army . I expected more from K. Cole and was quite disappointed . Will not buy any other items from them , DCW .
 I guess anything with `` Reaction '' in the item name begs just that . Maybe ok for some , but it 's not my style at all .
 Compre este cinto de hombre , que segun la descripcion del articulo esta hecho en cuero.Pues debo decir que eso no es verdad ! La Correa esta construida en un material plastico SIMULANDO ser cuero.He sido enga & ntilde ; ado por la descripcion del articulo , por el Comercio que lo vende , o por el fabricante .
 Was wrong with this order , first is being delayed for more than 2 months and you already charged it on my credit card and I do n't have any anwers from you guys ! The least I 'm expecting of you guys is that you send me the products as soon as posible and make it up for the unusual wainting time .
 I wore it twice , the belt buckle broke off the tiny screw holding it together , I look at it today trying to fix it , and the belt is SPLIT down the middle between the leather , two pieces , it peels back like a banana , its INSANE how CHEAPLY built it is . I would do ANY BELT but this one ... STOP ! ITs NOT A GOOD DEAL ! Since AMAZON SUCKS and will not return it , after 30 days , it was a gift , I am very disappointed in AMAZONS return policy . NO WARRANTY , sickening really . I think I will write the manufacturer for warranty issues . Dont do it , NIGHTMARE BAD DEAL . Shame on Amazon . I used to be a very satisfied customer , now I may come back , but I will totally be watching them like a hawk . Dont sell lemons that you cant even fix into lemonade . Shame on Amazon for a bad deal , bad policy on warranty returns . They dont have a warranty return section . Come on ZAPPOS would take this back , I think I will start shopping there more . Customer Service . NONE at Amazon . I couldnt even find a telephone number to call them and discuss it . Strike three . Your out , for now . !
 After a few wearings , the belt started to separate -LRB- the black side from the brown side -RRB- in the center of my back , Is not practical to use reversible .
 The worst belt i ever had bought.the belt was split two parts when i put it in my body just two days .
 This belt split in half after wearing it for only 1 week . Definitely a waste of money . Do not buy .
 The belt is very nice , but in the colored part of brown has marks or scratches , i.e. it is defective .
 I like how this belt looks , but the material is shoddy . I 've bought two of these -LRB- hoping that the first one was a mistake -RRB- , and both had the same problem . After a few months of once or twice a week wear , the leather starts to split . The seam where the black leather and the brown leather are glued together comes undone . I 'm sure it could be fixed with some leather glue or something along those lines , but is that what you would expect from a Kenneth Cole belt ?
 very nice stylish belt but very bad quality it broke after two weeks of normal use , i will not recommend it .
 After purchasing this belt in less than two months it started to separate in two . Not a very good purchase and im very disappointed with this product .
 The holes become stretched and the belt wo n't stay closed . It looks nice for about a month and then it 's pretty much useless . No complaints about the quality of the materials other than the hole gets too big for the pin and I find myself fixing my belt all day , and I 'm overly skinny so it 's not like I had a nice size gut pushing on it ever . I would not recommend buying it .
 This belt came apart within about 5 days of buying it . It looked great new , but it immediately started to come apart . It is n't even stitched it 's glued . I would not recommend this belt to anyone who planned to use it for more than a few days .
 It 's the worst belt i ever i hab see . Just a month using it and looks like if i had years using it .
 La correa se ve muy bien , pero en menos de dos semanas de uso la correa se ha comenzado a abrir en 2 , lamentablemente ya no puedo usarla m&aacute;s por que no se ve nada bien .
 The seams have come apart after just a few months . not very durable , looks good but feels cheap and came apart way too easily .
 The belt split into two pieces after a couple months of light use . The black side split away from the brown side .
 I really liked this belt , but it broke after 2 weeks when the glue holding the fastener into the leather came undone . Sent it back for a refund , but I 'm going to china and ca n't get a new one . Maybe that 's for the best .
 It looked nice when i received it . But it started to split into two parts within few days . Nothing but waste of money . Now i need another belt as it is going into the trash
 As several other reviewers have noted , this belt separates in the middle after a couple of months . If you must replace it once every four months , might as well buy something more expensive that lasts longer .
 The belt split and is falling apart after little use . Maybe I got a defective one , I thought kenneth cole made better products than this . .
 wearing this belt , without umbrella , a sudden heavy rain . the other day i found two sides of the belt separated . really disappointing quality .
 Now , I have become certain that Kenneth Cole Reaction belts suck . I wore it a couple of times and noticed that the belt started to show signs of worn out . The belt is reversible that means there two pieces glued together , after a couple of times wearing it the glued parts started to open up . Kenneth Cole should think about a different way in making these kind of reversible belts last longer and of a good quality . I am really disappointed and I will never buy these kind of products again .
 I bought this belt 2 months ago . The belt is great at first , but after a while the two leather pieces will begin to separate and you 'll end up with two fully separated leather strips . I came here to buy a second -LRB- identical -RRB- belt thinking mine was an oddity , but seeing that other customers complain too I 'll look for another model .
 The belt material is synthetic and the fraying ends in each use , you almost have to put with tweezers to prevent from falling apart !
 The belt has a nice outlook appeal but what made it not satisfied after a week it un-stuck ... i did n't make a fuss stuck it back and kept on using it and it did n't hold out ... was n't pleased at all .
 When I Bought this belt . I checked the specification the material , but when I received this belt I was waiting for a great Kenneth Cole Belt , The material look like plastic , For me this belt is not good.I ` m disappointed of this stuff .
 the belt look very cheap and like fake one do not buy it made from china , i think this belt worth about $ 2.00
 This belt literally fell apart after owning it for 3 months and with very infrequent usage . The made in China belt -LRB- though supposedly leather -RRB- appears to be a man mad plastic like material . The seam between the black and brown strips started separating in several places . Looking inside these openings , you could see it was n't leather ! I would avoid this and similar REACTION belts . A waste of money .
 The product was damaged , because lacks one of the screws holding the strap buckle , so that the buckle is bent at any time can break . I had very good expectations about this product , now I am very dissapointed . I had very good expectations about this product , now I am very disappointed .
 Well it arrived fast , thats the only plus ... the belt was suppose to be black and brown reversible head obviously . . the brown is somekinda . . mustuard ... totally not brown in any way or fashion ... then the belt had the audacity to spoil in less than a week it swelled overnight because it took some tiny rain drops by my window ... could you belive that the belt sweelled and it looks awuful now . . worst product i have ever bought ...
 Poor quality , it looks good but was broken after 2 weeks of use . DO NOT waste your money on it !!!!
 When I got the belt , it looked pretty nice . After about 2 weeks of wearing it , I noticed that it had started to split apart in the middle . I have n't ever owned a belt that 's done this , so it 's clear to me that the belt must be at fault . Looking at the other 1 star reviews for this belt , this seems to happen a lot.Could I get it fixed ? Perhaps , but that does n't change the fact that this is a poorly constructed belt . It 's a bit sad that Kenneth Cole can push out crap like this with such impunity .
 I enjoyed the styling of this belt while I owned it , but it 's not nearly as durable as the typical belt design . If you plan to only wear it for certain occasions and not day to day , it should work for you .
 The belt buckle arrived with scratches on it and the belt itself had a depression in it ... not very good service Amazon !!!! I specifically wanted a reversible belt black/brown ... the brown on this belt is so dark there 's really no distinction from the black side ... so I guess now I 'll have to go hunting for a brown belt !
 I bought a kenneth cole belt several months ago at macys and can not beleive how cheap the belt is . My first thoughts on the belt were that the leather was a little stiff and would eventually flatten out but it never did . The leather is so hard and unflexible its almost like its made out of 99 % plastic and 1 % leather . After wearing the belt ONE TIME . I take it off and it looked like my 4 year old dolce and gabbana belt that i 've been wearing every day for the past 4 years , old and wornout . The black finish was wiping off revealing a light tan color around the hole i buckled it into . I then look at the back of the belt after i took it off and the leather was tearing in half by the hole . I am not a big guy -LRB- 125lbs -RRB- and i do not wear my belts tight at all for them to do this . I always wear my belts not to hold my pants up but really just as an ornament to accent the pants im wearing . The last thing you want to happen is to be on a date etc. . and your Brand new kenneth cole belt just split in half all of a sudden . Hands down the poorest quality leather -LRB- plastic -RRB- i have ever seen in my life . If you want a good belt , go to a high end department store -LRB- i.e. saks , neiman marcus -RRB- and buy one there . They may cost $ 200-400 but are going to last you forever . You get what you pay for.Note
 I ordered this belt as a Christmas gift for my 29 year old son . It arrived smelling moldy and mildewy ! Then , I reordered the belt assuming that Amazon would pull the belts that were a smelly mess and I was wrong !!! The second belt arrived with the same horrible smell . They are a true health hazzard to anyone like me with a mold allergy , or asthma . It should be sent back to the manufacturer !!!!!
 i never even rcieved my belt in the mail and when i complained to amazon i never got my refund . more than 30 dollars down the drain . amazon left a bad taste in my mouth because of this .
 La verdad es mi culpa porque revise los comentarios y no le hice caso , es de mala calidad se abre por el medio se pela , lamentable por este producto porque he comprado zapatos , reloj y otros articulos y son de muy buena calidad
 This product is a bad product , the leather is a rubbish !! I was used two months and this product break down.Es una porqueria esta correa , la use como 4 o 5 veces y el cuero se cuarteo en seguida , se da & ntilde ; o increiblemente . No sirve , esta marca KENNEHT COLE no sirve y no volveria a comprar nada con ese nombre de porqueria.En la parte de atras se abrio , ya que ni es cuero puro , es malisimo .
 Despues de dos semanas de uso ya empez&oacute; a romperse . No es de cuero , est&aacute; hecho de pl&aacute;stico y goma . no recomendado . proucto de baja calidad .
 I was seeking a `` Sherlock Holmes '' Cap and Pipe combination . I was presently surprised to find such an item displayed at Amazon.com.That 's where the mystery ended . The displayed showed a mannequin 's -LRB- Adult Male -RRB- head on which was fitted a `` Sherlock Holmes '' Cap and in it 's mouth the traditional pipe.My counterpart at BSA , upon my request ordered all that was in stock -LRB- a total of 87 -RRB- -LRB- see ZOWIE -RRB- and I , 2 weeks later ordered another -LRB- 30 -RRB- -LRB- See Rock Ridge Sales , Inc -RRB- strictly based on the pictured item.To our displeasure , although the the items look great , upon receipt , we tried one of the hats on our youngest youth , our first graders , and realized that the caps could not even fit them . Yet the hat featured , was on an adult model 's head.That we see as false advertising , since it was ordered for participants at a Day Camp . As a result , we are attempting to return these items , and so far , we have only been allowed to return thirty , and if the rest is not accepted . We lose a lot of money that is desperately needed for our ` Not-For-Profit ' youth group .
 The detective hat is just what other people are saying
 I was not impressed and I regret not buying the hat seperate . The hat is way to small . Even for a child . It does n't have enough room from the crown to the side to work .
 We bought this for my fiance to wear for Halloween , but the hat is too small for any adult to wear . It is definitely a child-sized hat . The pipe is really nice though . Unlike other costume pipes , it does not have writing on it . So , if you just want the pipe , this set is fine , but if you want the hat to fit an adult , look elsewhere .
 The hat is way too small to wear , and the pipe really looks cheap . You can get a better product in a thrift store , really .

 it is not even a `` clothes '' made of fabrics . the materials are like those for elastic leggings ... very disappointed ... . returning it
 The product has a cheap feel and was unraveling in spots . The sewing was poor and the material was not good . The clasp that closes the robe in the front is too heavy for the cheap fabric , so it never looked right . This robe was a terrible buy . I would have happily spent more money for a better made one if I had known what this one was like . Utter garbage . Also , the lining of the inside of the hood is mauve . It really clashed with my accessories -LRB- scarf and tie -RRB- that were the actual colors . Do not buy this robe .
 This robe has an unfinished -LRB- un-hemmed -RRB- bottom , and the side hem stitching came out on the first day it was worn ! It 's a piece of crap !
 Very thin , stretchy material . Misleading photograph . I would n't waste my money on this as it does n't come close to looking authentic .
 The shirt ran a little big ... and this merchant does not allow for returns or exchanges ... I will not purchase from again .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 i thought this thing was gon na look good on me well it does n't It seems you have to be pen thin for it too . I am not heavy but I do have curves and I have a butt , so I do n't recommend this if you have a rear cause it 's not going to look good , I ca n't even ware it around the house till I loose my butt .
 You have to be super short to wear this or it just turns into a shirt ... very unsatisfied with item .

 I purchased these socks based on the positive reviews , but my experience with them was very different.WrightSock Anti Blister Double Layer Coolmesh quarter socks are sized , which I usually love because my feet are small and `` one size fits all '' socks are generally too big and bulky for me . However , with these socks , I really dislike the sizing because they are not sized correctly . I wear a ladies size 5.5 -6 shoe , so I purchased these socks in the small size -LRB- advertized to fit ladies sizes 4-7 , so they should have fit me perfectly -RRB- . I washed before wearing , following the instructions . When I put the socks on for the first time they were really snug and seemed low , especially in the back . I should have paid more attention , but I went out for my run as usual . After 6 miles or so , the back of my ankle -LRB- right where a running shoe hits - above the heel , below the achilles tendon -RRB- was rubbed completely raw because these socks hot too low to offer adequate protection . By the time I finished my run my ankles and my toes -LRB- due to the tight fit -RRB- were blistered and bloody . Definitely not anti-blister for me , although they might have worked better in a size or two larger . I will not be wearing the socks again and am upset that I purchased them . For me , every other brand I have tried is better -LRB- and that includes cotton socks ! -RRB- I suggest trying SmartWool PhD running socks , Pearl Izumi Elite Wool Socks , Asics -LRB- especially Kayano -RRB- socks instead - they can be a little more expensive , but at least you do n't risk minor injuries by wearing them .
 I found these socks a little thin and flimsy for good work out socks , had wanted some with a little more stretch and ones that fit more snugly .
 The instructions state to order a size larger than you normally wear . My husband wears a men 's medium , so to be on the very safe side , I ordered a men 's extra large . Too sizes larger than recommended . He could not even stretch it over his body it was so tight . I also was not impressed with the material , as it did not have the same water shedding ability as the shirts he currently owns .

 I thought when I first got this cap it looked good until I turned it inside out and where it was tied off the strings are left hanging and the strip of elastic that 's woven into the cap is hanging on the outside of the cap by at least an 1/8th of a each . This will definitely not be given as a Christmas gift . I 'm really disappointed .

 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I never wear this top after having purchased it . The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them . The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly . I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and , therefore , is n't very flattering . I think I 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon . Generally , I have been pleased with Adidas products , but this shirt did not work for me personally .

 This device is good for your everyday appliances , perhaps , but when it comes to sophisticated electronics -LRB- e.g. cell phones , portable video game systems -RRB- , this adapter can not fully transform the voltage and frequency of an Indian power outlet to actually make the device work . I found that this was a problem with older outlets . I had to search throughout an entire house just to find an outlet that would let me use this converter to charge my Nokia cell phone . I could n't charge my Nintendo DS system at all most likely due to frequency differences or other discrepancies between American and Indian power outlets that this adapter was n't sophisticated enough to resolve . Particularly since such small and advanced devices are what people usually bring when they travel -LRB- i.e. nobody will lug around fans and toasters with them on vacations unless maybe it 's a camping trip -RRB- , this device has proven mostly useless for me .
 I was about to order this , until I saw shipping was more than the adapter !
 This adapter is poorly designed . It is impossible to push the plugs of any of my devices into the complicated socket of this adapter . To succeed at doing this one has to risk breaking either the plug or the socket . It is completely a waste of money .
 Hat was OK but color was supposed to be PINK for a lady to contrast with white hat for her husband . Did n't have time for a return as this was a Christmas gift . Ruined the point of the gift
 I found these socks not to be any warmer than any other cotton socks . I was hoping they would have a thick bottom to my dismay they did not . They also slide a little off my feet leaving a loose fit . I 'm a size 11 . I was very disappionted with these .
 I think the product I bought is old !!! It was Wrinkled and washed.I is so disappointed to it!I think it is not worthy for its price !
 I work as a yardener . I wear this khaki-colored -LRB- Amazon says I purchased the stone color , but I ordered and received the khaki-colored one -RRB- sun hat daily in the Florida sun . After only 6 weeks the color has dramatically faded , it 's discolored to an orangy color on the brim and after only a single run through the delicate cycle in the washer , the grommets rusted . I am really disappointed . I want to stay safe from the sun , but look professional while doing so . The hat just makes me look like I am wearing some dirty rag on my head.I liked the idea of ventilation , but there is none . In order to keep it on your head , you have to use the drawstring , which negates any possibility of ventilation , making this hat extremely hot.Perhaps if you 're just wearing this for a day trip things will be better , but if you 're wearing this on a daily basis , know that it is not comfortable , durable , colorfast nor washable in the washer .
 I ordered the hat for a hiking trip . My husband thought it 's very ugly . When I try putting a cold pack in the zipper pouch to simulate ice cubes , it felt very heavy and uncomfortable . I will just stick to using a neck wrap for now . Also I could n't tighten the hat enough that I felt it wo n't blow away in strong wind . I sent a request to return the hat . Had to wait 3 days with no reply from seller . I sent a message again and got a rude response from the seller . Anyway , once everything was sorted out , my refund notice was pretty prompt .
 Caution
 NICE BUT THE HEAT IST SOFT , AND ITS NO GOOD FOR HARD WINDSNICE BUT THE HEAT IST SOFT , AND ITS NO GOOD FOR HARD WINDSNICE BUT THE HEAT IST SOFT , AND ITS NO GOOD FOR HARD WINDS
 Great idea , but it did n't fit and look right on me . Looked for something else that was more my style .
 For the purpose of keeping the sun off your neck and face , this hat hardly fits the job description.It would be the perfect size for a toddler but the ~ 3.5 inch brim is simply not enough material necessary to block sunlight -LRB- a baseball cap is more effective -RRB- . The cloth sheet in the rear is also too small . You walk around awkwardly adjusting it because every time you turn your head it gets shifted about . If it were longer and weighted down it would stay put.Finally , I thought the material would be nice -LRB- looks like canvas -RRB- but really its just a cheap nylon/cotton towel shaped like a hat . It looks like something you would win at an arcade.If you think these are exaggerations keep in mind the hat is priced like an expensive piece of sports gear ; these things should uphold worst case scenario weather performance standards.I returned mine immediately after receiving it .
 these clothes are pretty cheaply made , which i guess should not really have been a surprise . the thing i did not like the most was the tags are super stiff and scratchy , like they are made of plastic or something .
 I purchased several of these shirts from Tractor Supply Co. last year and they were very comfortable and fit great . These shirts were not as well made - you could feel the difference and the weight of the material was not as heavy or soft . The fit was not very comfortable either . These were much tighter in the chest and sleeves . Something definitely changed at Carhartt . The labels show them being made in Honduras , Belize and Mexico . Cheap labor , cheap materials . Not happy .
 I bought two of these . Sent one back cuz it was mis-labeled , about three sizes smaller than labeled . Kept the other but now realize it is an inch and a half shorter from neck to shoulder on one side than it is on the other side . Also I thought it was generously large but it shrunk like crazy the first laundering . It 's now not large enough . Very disappointed , especially for being a carhartt .
 I know you might often read people saying things in reviews like `` Order a size down '' or `` Order a size up '' etc etc. . Maybe you have realized these suggestions tend to be wrong a lot of the time ... but let me tell you , with this shirt you ABSOLUTELY have to order down a size unless you are happy with your shirt being oversized -LRB- could be ideal for overweight individuals -RRB- . I would go even further and suggest maybe even order down TWO sizes.My size is technically a XL reg , which for most shirts , fits me just right . So I ordered an XL for this shirt ... what I got was labeled as an XL regular but fit like it was a XXXL tall , it was ginormous ! To say I was swimming in the shirt would be an understatement.Being this is Amazon with their awesome services , I quickly went online and initiated an exchange for a Large . I got my large shirt , and I am happy to say it is a decent enough fit , still a tad big , but I 'm sure a run through the wash will take care of that.So yeah , this is no joke or understatement , order a size down ! Also for reference , the shirts I got were made in Mexico.As for the quality of the shirt , it is top notch ! Nice and thick and feels like it will last a lifetime . Most shirts you get nowadays are thin -LRB- practically see-through -RRB- , weak and barely last a month because of companies skimping out on materials to save a few $ $ , but no expense is spared with this shirt , and you definitely get what you paid for . Also this shirt is pretty long , more so than I personally like but it would be ideal for tucking in . And since it is plenty long , if you go untucked you can rest assure that you wo n't be getting any wise-cracks every time you bend down to pick something up.EDIT 1/10/12
 I bought two items Carhartt and the quality is too bad . After washing were deformed and the fabric is of poor quality . I 'll never buy this product and never use this seller . For me is not original item because I have other t-shirt and are excelents .
 I own way too many Carhartt T-Shirts . I love them . They may have changed producing companies/countries because this one is poorly made , does not fit well . and I ca n't even shrink it to make it work better . I am so disappointed . I 'm off to my local supplier to see if they have any old stock . Good company 'till they kept cheapening the product .
 I have yet to receive this product but have been charged for it . It was ordered at the same time as the blue one .
 OK shirt , but it runs really large ! I typically wear a medium -LRB- 38 chest/32 waist -RRB- , but this shirt in MED is actually a Large , and did n't look like even after a washing would it shrink enough to become an actual MED !
 I ordered two of these Carhartt long sleeve shirts , one in `` Ash '' color , the other `` Navy '' blue . I 've had some trouble finding real cotton long sleeve T-shirts -LRB- I mean NOT cotton/algodon which is thin and rough feeling -RRB- the reason I bought them at Amazon was I 've returned so many bought at JCP and Macy and thought I read the description to trust Amazon . ok , the shirts arrived and right away I notice the Ash shirt has that rough feel . Each is made in another country , the Ash is marked 99 % cotton and made in Dominican Republic ; the blue one is 100 % cotton made in Honduras . The Ash shirt shrunk in the first wash so much the sleeves are too short to wear it unless I push up the sleeve . The Blue shirt is fine quality shirt all around . So I 'm saying be careful ... we just do n't know nowdays what we will get for our money .
 I bought an XL , but when I got it in the mail , The shirt was HUGE !!! The shirt was either labeled incorrectly or just huge . The shirt was more like a 3X , not XL ! Very dissappointed . It was supposed to be a Christmas Present so I didnt have enough time to return it .
 When i ordered this shirt , i ordered a size down since alot of stuff online runs bigger . -LRB- I ordered a small -RRB- . When i got the shirt it was SO big ! it looked like an XL . I would hate to have seen a medium ! I normally wear medium size shirts but apparently carhartt doesnt make that size !!
 all i can say is that you get what you pay for . doesnt look as sexy as in the picture , the material was not so good , i think it gave me a lil rash ... fast shipping though ...
 I am 5 ' 1 '' and 110 lbs , so I ordered an extra small . When I tried it on , the top was huge around the bust and waist , but the arms were super tight . The length was as expected , but unless you have an unusually large torso , skinny arms and short body , this will not fit you .
 This is a terrible costume ! Poorly made and extremely cheap material . I did n't expect alot since the cheap price but I could 've made it nicer myself . I 'm 5 ' 8 '' and 130 pounds -LRB- size 2 -RRB- so I ordered the extra-small but the costume was very very wide and very short . Also , the arm band around the sleeves was tight so I could not move my arms around well . Needless to say , do not buy this , it 's not worth $ 1 .
 The product was packaged poorly and arrived bent . I was able to use pliers to bend it back into shape because I did n't want the hassle of the return . Plus , I saw the same product at the Halloween store for $ 2 less .

 The bra stash I had from Austin House was very handy on a recent trip to Italy . However when ordering more for gifts the quality seems to have diminished . Mine has quality fabric and an understated warm neutral color . The new order , also made by Austin House , is a bright white satin -LRB- not the neutal color on the box they came in -RRB- and the quality of the fabric is marginal . Perhaps the old one can be made available in the future . Thank you .
 The fabric is too thin and the color too light . It rides up and right out of my blouse , even with the weight of the credit card , license and cash .

 I bought an XL , but when I got it in the mail , The shirt was HUGE !!! The shirt was either labeled incorrectly or just huge . The shirt was more like a 3X , not XL ! Very dissappointed . It was supposed to be a Christmas Present so I didnt have enough time to return it .
 I own way too many Carhartt T-Shirts . I love them . They may have changed producing companies/countries because this one is poorly made , does not fit well . and I ca n't even shrink it to make it work better . I am so disappointed . I 'm off to my local supplier to see if they have any old stock . Good company 'till they kept cheapening the product .
 OK shirt , but it runs really large ! I typically wear a medium -LRB- 38 chest/32 waist -RRB- , but this shirt in MED is actually a Large , and did n't look like even after a washing would it shrink enough to become an actual MED !
 I ordered two of these Carhartt long sleeve shirts , one in `` Ash '' color , the other `` Navy '' blue . I 've had some trouble finding real cotton long sleeve T-shirts -LRB- I mean NOT cotton/algodon which is thin and rough feeling -RRB- the reason I bought them at Amazon was I 've returned so many bought at JCP and Macy and thought I read the description to trust Amazon . ok , the shirts arrived and right away I notice the Ash shirt has that rough feel . Each is made in another country , the Ash is marked 99 % cotton and made in Dominican Republic ; the blue one is 100 % cotton made in Honduras . The Ash shirt shrunk in the first wash so much the sleeves are too short to wear it unless I push up the sleeve . The Blue shirt is fine quality shirt all around . So I 'm saying be careful ... we just do n't know nowdays what we will get for our money .
 I bought two of these . Sent one back cuz it was mis-labeled , about three sizes smaller than labeled . Kept the other but now realize it is an inch and a half shorter from neck to shoulder on one side than it is on the other side . Also I thought it was generously large but it shrunk like crazy the first laundering . It 's now not large enough . Very disappointed , especially for being a carhartt .
 I know you might often read people saying things in reviews like `` Order a size down '' or `` Order a size up '' etc etc. . Maybe you have realized these suggestions tend to be wrong a lot of the time ... but let me tell you , with this shirt you ABSOLUTELY have to order down a size unless you are happy with your shirt being oversized -LRB- could be ideal for overweight individuals -RRB- . I would go even further and suggest maybe even order down TWO sizes.My size is technically a XL reg , which for most shirts , fits me just right . So I ordered an XL for this shirt ... what I got was labeled as an XL regular but fit like it was a XXXL tall , it was ginormous ! To say I was swimming in the shirt would be an understatement.Being this is Amazon with their awesome services , I quickly went online and initiated an exchange for a Large . I got my large shirt , and I am happy to say it is a decent enough fit , still a tad big , but I 'm sure a run through the wash will take care of that.So yeah , this is no joke or understatement , order a size down ! Also for reference , the shirts I got were made in Mexico.As for the quality of the shirt , it is top notch ! Nice and thick and feels like it will last a lifetime . Most shirts you get nowadays are thin -LRB- practically see-through -RRB- , weak and barely last a month because of companies skimping out on materials to save a few $ $ , but no expense is spared with this shirt , and you definitely get what you paid for . Also this shirt is pretty long , more so than I personally like but it would be ideal for tucking in . And since it is plenty long , if you go untucked you can rest assure that you wo n't be getting any wise-cracks every time you bend down to pick something up.EDIT 1/10/12
 I bought two items Carhartt and the quality is too bad . After washing were deformed and the fabric is of poor quality . I 'll never buy this product and never use this seller . For me is not original item because I have other t-shirt and are excelents .
 I purchased several of these shirts from Tractor Supply Co. last year and they were very comfortable and fit great . These shirts were not as well made - you could feel the difference and the weight of the material was not as heavy or soft . The fit was not very comfortable either . These were much tighter in the chest and sleeves . Something definitely changed at Carhartt . The labels show them being made in Honduras , Belize and Mexico . Cheap labor , cheap materials . Not happy .
 I have yet to receive this product but have been charged for it . It was ordered at the same time as the blue one .
 This T-shirt , while still of Danskin 's always-wonderful quality -LRB- that 's why I gave it any stars -RRB- , is unfortunately not a good replacement for the # 3735 tees I used to purchase as my only nightshirts -- I loved the sturdy but lighter , loose and comfy , and very nice , high-quality 100 % cotton of that older `` model '' -- the fabric in this t-shirt is considerably heavier , and because it 's made with a bit of Spandex , it is n't light or cool -- it is -LRB- to me -RRB- stretchy and bulky and consequently does not have a nicely flowing shape any longer -- not attractive if one is disguising a little extra `` heft '' ... I was MOST disappointed to see these changes , and I dearly hope Danskin will consider re-introducing a plain 100 % cotton , cooler and lighter , good basic tee-shirt again .
 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 I used the nubra to wear with a halter style chiffon dress for a summer wedding . Since they are ` plasitcky ' and do n't breathe , my skin started to sweat under the cups in the august heat and they would n't stick-on ! I REALLY did not want to go braless to the reception , but I drew even more unwanted attention to myself trying to wiggle and squirm to get them back in place every 5 minutes!I agree with the review who said they do n't offer much in the way of ` lift ' . They pulled the breasts together at the middle , but the profile effect was more of a ` cyclops boob ' then attractive cleavage .
 This is a great bra if you do n't need any support . But I am 35 and have nursed three children , and even though I do not take a large cup size , this bra offered almost no support or lift .
 i ordered an original NuBra days ago and it arrived faster than i expected . however , when i opened the box , i saw a dead ant stuck in the adhesive layer of its left cup . sooooooo disgusting ! i need to wear it soon so i tried to removed that thing by myself -LRB- instead of contacting the seller and asking for replacement -RRB- . this is my first time dealing with NuBra , apparently i did n't know how sticky it is ... the ant got dissected so i had to use an eyebrow clamp to pick out the parts and eventually `` punctured '' my new bra . in conclusion , not a very pleasant first experience with online shopping and NuBra : -LRB-

 had a hard time using this thing . first it tore the loop off my tie trying to fit it in the clip , then it cut my button off the shirt sliding up and down the shirt . I went back to using my tie bar and tack .
 This has two clips at 90 degrees to each other . One goes on the little loop on the back of the tie , to other goes on your shirt . The part that goes on my shirt always falls off , so this has n't really worked out for me .
 The tie lock is difficult to use . The spring clip is so tight and small that I have trouble getting it open for the tie or the shirt . I have tried to use it three times now and gave up on it because I became frustrated with getting both sides of the clip attached .
 I was looking for tie tack under accessories . I came across this thing along with tie chainRope Style Tie Chain for Men , `` the tie thing '' The Tie Thing Tie Stay by Necktie Accessories - White Cotton , `` Tiedown '' which is a clear plastic alternative to the cloth `` the tie thing `` Tiedown , the Alternative to Tie Tacks and Tie Barsand offcource my original search tie tack Sterling Silver Knot Tie Tack . Although Tiedown and the tie thing are MUCH cheaper -LRB- and comes in a very cheap package -RRB- , they work better and are useable on a daily bases . On the other hand this Tie Lock is VERY diffecult to attach on both the shirt and on the tie . It is very fiddely and has a great potential to damage both parts of dressing as mentioned by a previous reviewer on Amazon.Save your money . Either go for the low cost `` the tie thing '' The Tie Thing Tie Stay by Necktie Accessories - White Cotton , or its alternative in clear plastic `` Tiedown `` Tiedown , the Alternative to Tie Tacks and Tie Barsthis will give you functionality or spend more and go for style using tie chainRope Style Tie Chain for Menor tie tack Sterling Silver Knot Tie Tack .
 We 've bought other brands of disposable bibs before -LRB- Sassy -RRB- and loved them . These were a good deal on Amazon so I thought they 'd be the same . These were too easy for my daughter to just give a slight tug and pull off . She 'd whip it off as soon as I had it on her neck . Returned to Amazon hassle free .
 although its few dollar cheaper than pampers bib but never go for it.pampers can be used for more than one time if not dirty but this is not.would not recommend .
 these stay on with sticky adhesive , not velcro like other brands , and always sticks to my daughters ' hair . needless to say , it causes a lot of discomfort and crying when the bib is removed . will not buy this product again and definitely do not recommend to others .
 Honestly , thought I would use these while going out to restaurants but they 're more of a nuisance than anything.Convenient for sure -LRB- when you have time to plan -RRB- but just not practical in a working parents world .
 Scratchy ... tends to strangle -LRB- one 's self and others -RRB- with its long strings ... ends in the worst spot -LRB- top of mid-hip ... make up your mind ... are you tunic-length or a top ? -RRB- My Cuddle Dud long underwear are sexier than this .

 Cancelled my order.I recommend buying your product from another of Amazons connections.Garage-Toys / MyPatient Education does not seem reliable .
 When I got this mini dress the first thing that I saw was some discoloration on the back of the dress , like the dye or color did not fully cover the dress . The second thing was how short it was , I know it is a mini dress but it looks like they left something back at the factory . Granted it is a small but not sure it will be wearable .
 This was a nice sweater however the color was a light coral . I would not call it RUBY . If it had been real red or dark red as in ` ruby '' it would have worked . However the color did not go with ny skin tone.Devon & Jones Pink Stretch Everyday Cardigan Sweater , XL , Ruby
 I did not expect this top to be skin tight . The other Armour exercise shirt I have is a comfortable fit . It is partly my own fault because I did not realize the significance of &#34; compression &#34; fit .
 Nice shirt but runs really small . I understand they are to be worn tight , but my 14 year old could n't get it over his head . Have to return it .
 The picture and description is of a shirt , what was sent was a sleeveless tank-top , open at the arm pits . Do n't order this if you expect a shirt or plan to use it for submission grappling .
 Great shirt in most respects , but way too small . I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son , who is 5 ft even , 115 lbs , and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it . I 'm exchanging it for the non-compression version .
 I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large . The shirt fit fantastic . I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large , different color . The shirt arrives on time , open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders ... . I contacted the vendor for an exchange . They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt . If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it ... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place . If you pass 30 days , there is a restocking fee of 20 % which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit . The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts . That just did not make sense . How are you to buy a product with `` floating '' sizes.So , I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee . There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering ... . only 1 chart for Under Armour . I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits , and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size , the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts '' just does n't fit ! '' . I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit , seemingly was ordered correctly , and then had to be mailed back .
 This is the first thing I 've ever gotten from under armour . Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective . After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling ... wishing for a refund , bad luck I guess .
 Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .
 This is the first time I 've had anything negative to say about Under Armour , and my complain is not really about the product , but the company , as the 2 shirts I ordered was to be short sleeved , and they arrived as sleeveless , It was a birthday gift to my grandson , and he assured me it was OK . I went along with him , but when I received this letter asking if I would rate the transaction , I had to tell you.I will think twice before I order again , this was a plain and simple order , and you messed it up.If I had had time I would have returned them for the right kind , but they were delivered on the birthday so I gave the package to him as it arrived , ibg1105
 thought the product worked great ... only problem had was first time was too small ... second was that not happy with cost to ship ... way overpriced
 I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $ 30 for it . It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it . When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle . The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew . Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings , which looks pretty girly . For a $ 30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it .

 You would think that for $ 50 dollars and $ 11 dollars shipping and handling -LRB- ouch ! -RRB- , you would receive a most excellent hoodie . NOT ! Even though Old Glory describes the hoodie as a `` high quality black sweatshirt , '' this is the most cheaply made hoodie that I 've ever owned . The material is so thin that it can pass for a tee shirt ! As for the hood of the hoodie , it is so small that if you actually wore it over your head , you would look like a Teletubby ! ... Not my Style.Also , the `` Olde English '' logo has that `` distressed '' look that some people find Kool , but to me means it 's just going fade faster . If you 're so enamoured with `` Olde English '' that you just have to own this Hoddie , please order it ONE SIZE LARGER , because it does shrink . But then you 're stuck with it because Old Glory DOES NOT ACCEPT Returns on Items that have been washed . A Complete Waste of Money !
 I purchase silk underwear because of the durability of silk . These were terrible . I purchased 2 pair and they both fell apart within 3 months . In my experience , Hom and Bruno Banini both last years . Do n't waste your money .
 These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear .
 Not something you want to wear unless you were caught in bad weather without anything else . Not an `` everyday '' wear type of coat . I keep it in the trunk of my car for emergencies .
 There really is n't much to this ` jacket ' . If you want to stay warm in a chilly rain , you will need to wear something heavy underneath it . As they say , ` You get what you pay for ' . I believe the ` low ' price was a bit high for what I actually got . I will not buy anything like this ever again !
 this should have been sold as disposable clothing for emergency use only.worn twice.felt stupid putting it on because of its appearance.second time it looked dowdy and fabric did not breathe at all.the fabric is used in enviro shopping bags and $ 2 labcoats.i purchased a nike on ebay for same money . it is real clothing not costume .
 because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening . Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable .
 I do n't know why I always keep going back to Under Armour - I 'm left largely unsatisfied with my purchases . To say it directly , the quality of their stuff just is n't all THAT great . At least not for the prices they charge . I got this for $ 12 , which is fine , but much like their compression gear , it RIDES UP and NEVER stays in place . Ever.I do n't have this problem nearly as much with other brands like Nike , Adidas , Reebok , and even stuff purchased at Walmart -LRB- Starter -RRB- and Target -LRB- Champion -RRB- . The material of UA 's products is too thick and smooth , so it 's constantly riding up on me when I 'm doing anything.Sorry , but UA seems to be more flash than substance , and that 's coming from someone who owns a hell of a lot of it .
 I 've only worn it two times before it started coming apart at the seam . Total waste of money . If I had gotten this at a local store , I would take it back . Not worth the hassle trying to send back to seller . Do n't buy .
 This skully is way too big for the average person . I am 6 ' 3 '' and 230 lbs . and it is still too big . The only way to make it fit better is to pull it down over the ears , which is not the way most people will want to wear it .
 This looks like it was extremely cheaply made . To me forever to try and put the thing back together when i tried to put the battery in for the first time . Literally took me about an hour to put in on half a $ $ ... The light on this was not even bright enough to see . Even is it was pitch black , you would not even be able to see anything.Ended up going to Home Depot and buying a mini flash light
 unadjustable straps , this is more the size of a medium . Sheer skirt low in quality .
 My son was excited to get this for christmas . After we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed . The arrows launcher never held the arrows . As soon as you tried to load them they would fly out . The shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use . He pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it 's gathering dust in our closet .
 Does n't fit well on my son 's wrist . It is difficult to close , and when worn the thumb trigger only works 10 % of the time . I think he 's played with this once since getting it for Christmas .
 I bought another pair of footless tights from Luxury Divas and one of my friends bought these . I 'm 148 lbs and 5 ' 7 '' and I could NOT get these on past my thighs -- and NO -- ny thighs are n't fat!My friend bought these and she could not get hers on either -- and she is 5 ' 4 '' and 123 lbs . I returned mine -LRB- and was charged a 20 % restocking fee !!!! -RRB- while she made sleeves out of hers on her sewing machine -LRB- gives you an idea how thin your legs would have to for these tights to fit properly -RRB- . Also , the other reviewer is right
 the sweater was a little snug , I would order next size up , however , at the 2nd wearing I noticed a hole in the arm seam about an inch in length . Better quality control is needed !
 tThe saleaves totally cover my hands . Sent email to them ... interested in seeing how theyre gon na screw me on this deal .
 Here 's the scenario
 The bag I received is half the size of the one shown in the photo . The handles on mine will not fit over the shoulder of a woman the size of the one in the photo . It 's not `` evening '' elegant but it 's too small for a useful casual daytime bag . It 's inconvenient if you expect to shoulder your bag to have your hands free for shopping , holding your children 's hands , etc. . My advice is to skip it . I 'm returning mine .
 I bought these to use on international trip . The size combinations are not great and the bags were awkward to use . Decided against using them as I could pack more without the compression bags . Would be good for organizing but a little too flimsy for bulky items .
 Difficult to use . I was not satisfied with its performance ; I ended up not using them .
 I am completely baffled by all the positive reviews for this product . I bought these compression sacs because of the positive reviews as well as positive experiences I 've had with Eagle Creek products in the past -LRB- their luggage , in particular -RRB- . However , these bags are truly worthless . They are like big Ziploc bags made with slightly thicker plastic . As I was testing one out , eager to find out how well it would compress some clothes for an upcoming trip , the yellow slider thing that closes the bag at the top popped off . I thought , `` Perhaps I overpacked it , '' so I took some clothes out and tried again . But the slider kept popping off . For $ 18 this should have worked A LOT better . I do n't know , maybe I just do n't have the magic touch that the other reviewers have . If so , please show me the error in my ways and I will try again , because it is too late for me to get my money back : - -LRB-
 Great for suitcase travel but if you 're just looking for something to store away clothes , blankets , etc. around the house , save yourself some money and buy Ziplock 's Large , XL , and XXL twin-zippered resealable bags . Seriously!I 've used these Eagle Creek compression bags for travel for years -- they work great but as reviewers point out , they eventually lose their ability to hold a good seal . Another issue for me is that these only come in mixed packs of small/medium bags or medium/large bags but I tend to only use the large bags cause they 're MUCH easier to pack and they 'll squeeze up just as small once you push all the air out.In my search for large-only compression bags , I found the ziplock kind I mentioned earlier . They 're not specifically designed to compress like the Eagle Creek ones , but anyone who 's ever put leftovers away knows how to seal a ziplock almost closed and then squish the air out before sealing completely.Well , you can TOTALLY do this with giant Ziplock storage bags , too ! I had been concerned that with bigger bags/items I 'd have a hard time compressing them but not at all -LRB- just do n't be afraid to use your body weight -RRB- . Great for car camping ! My sleeping bag , towels , blankets , etc. are now neatly squashed down to tidy packages -- protected from odors/moisture to boot.So ... sorry , Eagle Creek . Your compression bags are no better than giant ziplocks , which are cheaper and I think even sturdier . Time will tell how long these 'll hold up -LRB- will try to remember to post a follow up -RRB- .
 Given the high cost of checking bags , my husband and I wanted to use just one pullman for our recent trip to the Caribbean . So I bought this Eagle Creek compression sac kit so I could squeeze more clothes into our bag . I ended up returning this set . When I put the clothes in and tried to roll out the air , most of it would roll out , but it would NOT roll all the way to the end . I tried numerous ways -LRB- rolling , squeezing , sitting on it , placing the clothes in there differently , you name it -RRB- , and my husband tried as well . I checked the packaging -LRB- the instructions were minimalistic and did n't help -RRB- , and I checked reviews here for any tips . Found nothing . No matter what we did , or what/how much we put in it -LRB- and not much fit -RRB- , we could not flatten the entire sac . Since that is n't very useful , I sent them back . I 'm sure some folks who loves these things will comment on my review and either helpfully -LRB- or insultingly , lol -RRB- tell me how to do it , so hopefully that helps someone else and this review will therefore be of use to you -LRB- since this product was n't to me -RRB- .
 I purchased this after christmas so I know that I got a great deal on it , but if you are paying more than $ 5 for it , you are WASTING your money . The fabric is very thin and cheap . If you were to spend 25 , I 'd say spend 40 and get it directly from disney where it 's actually a much heavier robe .
 It 's JUST the robe . Not the whole costume like the picture would lead you to believe.The robe IS NOT the one pictured and does not cinch in the front .
 This order only comes with a very thin robe , yet shows a complete costume . The material is junk and I wo n't make the mistake again . I am returning this junk product .
 Misleading description & picture . The color is correct but it is does not have the neck closing and cape form . It actually bring long sleeves which are not depicted at all in the photo . First time ever -LRB- and I 've been an online pruchaser for a while now -RRB- I feel lied by an Amazon product .
 Its a piece of fabric to simple , to expensive for what you get , you can do a better cape in your house , not whort it ! Bad choice .
 As previous reviewer said , this is ROBE ONLY . Not a full costume . Very cheap material -LRB- granted most kid costumes are -RRB- but thought there would be a little more to it .
 Looks great on the picture but when you open the pack the costume seams are not sown , the fabric is so thin as not to be there and is totally useless as a Jedi robe as there are no arm vents .
 I gave this to my 9 year old on her birthday as she was having a Star wars party and wanted this costume this is NOT a costume !! Its just a robe the photo is misleading ! Way to spoil a kids birthday guys ! the value and quality on this product is about $ 2 worth
 I was very disappointed that its not the robe shown and it has no closure . Be warned when purchasing its not what 's pictured
 Be warned . The robe is not the one shown in the picture . It does not feature the closure in the neck area . It is fully open in front and has long loose arms , unlike the picture . The material is very light weight and cheap so when the hood is on it does not drape nicely . It will serve our purpose for Halloween but without the neck closure your child will have to have the sleeves on which will cover the costume sleeves unlike the image on the packaging . I personally feel duped but my son will still have fun with the robe .
 I am not one to write bad reviews but this robe was not at all like the picture shows . First , it has sleeves -LRB- which are pretty long but I understand this and tried to shorten them myself -RRB- and second , it does not tie at the neck . There was no way to secure it so it kept falling off . In hindsight I could have used a safety pin but I did n't . I ended up tying the sleeves around the neck so that it would n't fall off as he ran around trick or treating but it looked pretty bad .
 Well add my name to the list of people mislead by the photo on this product ... it 's only the brown robe . The picture on Amazon & the picture on the package both show a robe and a costume , but again
 It was misleading ... it is ONLY a robe ... they go to the trouble to say light saber sold separately , they should have said COSTUME sold separately too !
 Thought this costume would come as in picture , with the pants , tunic , belt and boots . The picture is very misleading . It was a disappointment both for me as for my 11 year old son .
 It is not as good as looks online . Neither does it feel like Cashmere .
 I 'm sending it back ... I ordered the green sweatshirt based on the picture color which I would call a Kelly Green . However , what I got was a dark forest green , almost to the point of being charcoal colored , sweatshirt . Be aware of what your ordering .
 I liked these a lot but if you have a little bit of thigh do n't buy these . I am tall and about average weight and these were a little tight on my thighs . Another issue I has was that they fall down , they start to roll at the top and fall . These were ok but I would n't recommend them for these reasons .
 I 'm not a big girl at all , 5 ' 2 '' , average size . A little bottom heavy but not crazy . These things were SO tight on my thighs I could n't wear them . They fit fine except for a very tight band around the top . Could n't wear them at all , very disappointing .
 These claim to be `` seamless '' but they are n't really.They are three parts
 My son loves Spiderman and this costume looked great . When we got it we were all excited about how it looked and fit , but within 24 hours of receiving it , it literally began falling apart at the seams . It 's made of a nylon material and there are several spots where major runs are happening . There are two sizeable holes at the waist and the shoulder seams are coming apart as well . I am very , VERY disappointed at the shoddy workmanship , and am NOT looking forward to taking it away from my son . But I am not going to spend money on a product that ca n't even last one day , so I am going to try and return it . PLEASE , do not waste your money if your child wants to wear this costume for more than a few hours on Halloween .
 ... maybe we just got a defective product . I do n't know . But future buyers should be aware . Within two weeks , we have a hole around the waist big enough to put your hand through , and the material around the neck and Velcro closure at the back is just falling apart.Also , FYI , it does n't come with the feet shown in the picture .
 This costume runs bigger than the true sizes , therefore my grandson could n't wear it . Other than that the costume was as good as any of them are and he would have loved it .
 My son loved the costume but it started falling apart after one wear . It 's been sewn countless times , still has holes appearing . It 's a mess . Do n't buy this unless you want a very sad kid .
 too small for my son who is a size 7-8 i was very disappointed on the materials he cant have fun in it
 EL RELLENO DEL PECHO -LRB- LOS M&Uacute;SCULOS SE SALEN LOS HILOS POR EL DISFRAZ Y DAN PICAZ&Oacute;N -RRB- Y VEO QUE LA TELA NO ES DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD Y PROMOCIONA COMO ES MEJOR DE TODOS
 Please save your money . It 's a cute item , but it 's made so incredibly cheaply . From the moment we removed it from the packaging the seams began to unravel . The material is so thin that there 's hardly anything to grip with a needle , so I 'm not able to fix the problem myself long-term . The back only attaches by velcro and is perpetually coming undone . Our six-year-old son loved it at first but quickly grew tired of it coming unfastened and falling off his shoulders . Big disappointment .
 I never write reviews but I 'm so unhappy with this costume that I have to . My 3.5 year old wanted to be Spider Man for Halloween so this is the one we got . The stitching started coming apart well before Halloween ever arrived . A month after Halloween and my son had worn it a few times for pretend play and the fabric in the back next to the velcro has stretched so much that it 's white and fraying , and the stitching on the legs and an arm have come undone so there are huge holes in it and my son is no longer interested in wearing a broken Spider Man . Ca n't really blame him . Totally do n't recommend this costume . It 's VERY cheaply made and not durable at all .
 The zipper broke off within the first hour . The mask was way too small and the back of the costume started come apart at the rear seam by the end of the night -LRB- after only 2 hours -RRB- . It would be a great costume if it was better quality .
 I was looking for something to protect my dress clothes while putting on makeup . Although the sizing was fine and the construction seemed adequate , the fabric was a faded print and different base colors than the picture . The print looked cheap and I was very disappointed . Sent it back for a refund . Amazon made it easy . .
 This was suppose to be mens but I gave it to a small 14 year old child and it fit small on him !
 OK hat but not as useful as I wished . Material is very light weight .
 I 'm allergic to sun so am constantly looking for better working gear as I 'm outdoors 90 % of my days working as a farmer and restoration carpenter . This hat is a great concept but needs refining.Flap is too light so in the slightest wind blows up like your a Nun taking a vow . A flying Nun I 'm not . The result is that your neck and temples get burned all to easily . The long bill is nice . Does not stand up to multiple washings . Would not buy again .
 I ordered these in white . I was expecting them to need a garter , but they did n't . However , they were n't flattering . They 're not lace top and I think the intention was for them to be worn with a garter . The tops dug into my legs and I had to cut them and fix them . More work than they were worth . They 're also a very thin fabric , not high quality . Snagged easily .
 These stockings look good but do n't last long . My wife wore them one time for 2 hours before they got a run in them . Next time will look for a better product especially after paying almost 15 for these you would think they would last longer .
 I do not like the way these lasted for one day . They will stay up with a garter and feel extra silky.Sheer Thigh Hi Stockings - Available in One Size , Plus Size , and Colors - By Leg Avenue
 The stocking were very lovely . The pic shows an elastic on the thigh area which is false . I bought these for my wedding and did not even open the package until the day of . I was very upset to learn that I needed the elastic straps to hold the stockings up .
 These glasses are made out of cheap plastic and did not fit my face.Essentially a piece of junk , at a ridiculace price .
 These pants are really just canvas civilian cargo pants that have been dyed with the ACU pattern . The style of the pants are not really consistent with the military ACU pants that are associated with the digital camo pattern and the colors are slightly off ... the actual military pants are a little less pronounced . I ended up buying a pair of `` Propper '' ACU digicam pants and cutting them at the knees . While it may seem excessive , the build of the military grade pants is significantly better -LRB- in my opinion , anyway -RRB- in quality and cut . FYI - `` Propper '' makes the uniforms sold to the military , these are definitely not the same .
 It is really a BIG set . My son was so excited to open such a huge box . And it had plenty of items in it ! But the hat was n't able to be fixed on the head ; the vest was torn in first half an hour ; sword were broken till the end of a day ... . So the set is VERY undurable . My son did n't break or tear anything on purpose , he was just playing - and still this set did n't survive even one day ! So do n't waste your money - kids will be sad ...
 These are perfect if you do n't plan on wearing them . The instant I put them on , they started snagging on my dry skin and now look terrible . Not impressed with the quality .
 No order acknowledgment , no notification of shipment , from time of order to receipt was over two weeks .
 This hat hurts ! The `` soft '' band inside -- where is it ? My hands feel it but my head does n't . Hmmmm ... . On my head it 's pretty tight and hard . I got it to match my pink cowboy boots-which I love but this hat is not what I expected .
 I like the shirt and it 's design , but unfortunately the latex print is starting to seperate after only a few washes . I would recommend finding one that has a better quality print .
 The socks I received are not 100 % cotton . I do n't know yet if they sent me the wrong item or if they have incorrect info on their website . So , if you really want 100 % cotton , I recommend checking with somebody before purchasing .
 We bought these gloves to give as a stocking stuffer to a granddaughter . However , after looking at them , we decided they were n't even up to the standard of a small add-on gift . The fabric did not look new ... like it had been in the bottom of a bin for a couple of years . The construction was comparably second rate . It was like the retailer figured no body would ever buy them off the shelf , where they could see them first , so they figured they could dump them through Amazon , These are definitely not up to Amazon 's standards .
 The gloves arrived and had a strong smell of mildew.I washed them , but that did n't work . Nothing will take out that smell.Consequently , I am not using them and threw them away . Waste of money
 i only recieved one pair of gloves and i ordered two pairs so not very happy
 Measure your kid 's head before you buy this product ! I bought this for a 16 mo. old , but I could n't get it over his head and it did n't have much `` stretch . '' If your kid has a big head , consider rash guards that zip up or use velcro .
 Hat purchased said `` one size fits all '' . This may be true as long as you are a child or a small woman . The hat was too small for me and I am 5-11 and 170 pounds . Too small and the flap part did not cover my neck . Ad says the flap is 8 inches long and it was only 6 inches at most . I contacted the company and their customer service guy needs some training . He called me a lier and said `` that 's too bad , the hat fits and the flap is long enough . Why are you bothering me ? '' They would not refund the shipping cost , so now I am out the $ 6 they charged to ship a little girls hat .
 I was quite disappointed with this product . It came in a timely manner , but the condition it came in was terrible . The lenses were scratched up so badly that your vision will be impaired if you dare don these glasses ! I know Superman had X-ray vision , but I did n't know Clark Kent was blind as a bat whenever he wore his glasses ! The best you can do is to pop the lenses out and just use the frames . Then you 'll be like the Clark Kent that George Reeves played on TV back in the day . : -RRB-
 the photo for the white shirt shows an all white shirt . But in person , the white shirt has a tan stripe inside the collar . I had purchased this shirt for my daughter to wear with her school uniform , but I will have to return it and be out the shipping costs due to the tan stripe . I 'm irked because had the photo above shown the tan stripe , I would not have bought the shirt.Aside from the tan stripe , this shirt is a quality shirt . Well made , quality fabric that is not too sheer , and a feminine fit . Seems like the type of shirt that would hold up well after lots of washings .
 the trousers never arrived to Venezuela , I have no information about where it can be
 This case is much too big for Palm Zire , and also cheap looking . I do n't like it at all and will not use it .
 There is no picture of the inside of this case becase there is nothing there - no slots for businsess cards , credit cards , extra pen , etc. . This carrying case is good for a little extra protection and that 's about it . But I would suggest going with something that gives you a couple more convinces if you are shopping for a carrying case .
 The Sumdex Padded Palm Wallet ia great for protection but where is the wallet where to put money . It is totally empty on the inside . No pockets no nothing .
 this cheap sad looking jacket was supposed to be a gift for my bro ... i hated it the very sight . . worse i had no time to return it as i was making a trip ... and had to keep it .
 since I have arthritis and it 's difficult for me to hook a bra in the back , thought I would give this one a try . It does not fit well ... cups are loose and the band is tight ... it actually cuts into the flesh . I bought it a size bigger than I normally wear because I had been told by a friend that Glamorize is cut small . I hate this bra and it is going into the donation bin at our local thrift shop in the hopes that someone will like it and get some good out of it .
 Have other Glamorise bras that I love . This one was thrown in the trash the 1st day . It was a poor fit and actually pressed my breast like I was having a Mammogram . Was n't worth the effort to send back . Sorry Glamorise , hope you can do better than this .
 I heard such great things about this bra , and its a really nice bra but did n't fit right . I even tried exchanging a different size but no luck . It gives off a ` pointy ' look if you know what I mean !
 This bra runs incredibly small . I am between an F and G , so I ordered size G cup and it was as small as DDD . The band size was okay and it does technically fit . The support is average at best for my size . Somehow , it manages to give the pointed torpedo shape and uniboob at the same time . The band rolls up and there is only about 1/3 inch of adjustment in the band . I 'm incredibly disappointed and will never wear it again , let alone buy another one .
 I bought two Glamorise bras , they fit well and at first I was delighted . I treated them extremely gently , washing in gentle cycle and with cold water only . Within just a few months , the hooks on the bra literally began to disintegrate . You could n't get them to go through the eyes.Another drawback is that the fabric is cheap and scratchy and becomes more so with repeated washing . Despite the stiffness and scratchiness , the fabric does not hold it 's shape -- the great fit deteriorates along with everything else.The bras were great at first but became progressively less so with each washing and became completely unwearable when the fasteners disintegrated.Sorry , I really wanted to like these bras . I wish somebody would take the basic design and use good materials -- that ought to make a great bra .
 I bought this for i believe over 5 dollars i am a deere fan but this was a complete waste of money wasnt gon na send it back it would have cost more then i paid for and the real kicker is i found a bunch local in a hardware store for a buck50 each From my experience the company plasticolor makes many diferent products and not a one that ive seen or used was worth the selling price what ever they make is certainly out there and available from different manufactuers and would not purchase another product from plasticolor
 Soft plastic/rubber keychain , adequate if you do n't want to scratch the finish of your lawn mower , but not a high quality product .
 DO NOT BUY THIS BRA or anything from this company . I bought the bra for my wedding to see if it would work . The bra is terrible . The boning in the front buckles and pokes outward right below the bust -LRB- and not just a little bit -RRB- . Furthermore , the company is scamming you if you are reading this on Amazon.com . This bra is a `` final sale '' item which they do not tell you on amazon . So when you purchase it and then decide to return it you ca n't . NEVER BUY THIS !!!!! By the way , I wanted to give it zero stars and the site wo n't let me .

 It was really cute but it did not fit my little boy very well . I got the 18 month size for my son who was about 12 months old at the time and it was to short and the snaps around his chest pulled . If you order this get a much-much-much larger size for your child .
 Material felt rough and uncomfortable . I returned item . Spend your money on better quality pajamas .
 I just received these pajamas yesterday and was so disappointed . The blue on the screen looks pretty but in person these are a sensational metalic blue . Yikes ! They are way too big on me even though I bought the right size according to the merchants chart . They are so stiff & scratchy . I thought they 'd be softer like the ones I buy at Target from Gillian & Malley . I 'll be sending these back .
 My husband bought me these pjs . I had n't worn them but packed them in the bag to bring to the hospital after my daughter was born . Did I mention he got them a size to big to accomodate my pregnancy bloated-ness . I wore them for the first time at the hospital and they ripped . They are un-wearable after half a use . They 're flimsy and I actually was n't very fond of them anyways because the fabric made me feel like I had a plastic drapped around my body -LRB- it did NOT breathe ... even a little -RRB- . So do n't waste your money . These are not worth the packaging they come in .
 I bought 2 pajama sets , size small , for a xmas present . Both tops were like extra large and both bottoms were like extra small . I returned them at my cost -LRB- $ 10.00 -RRB- . Intimo did not correct the problem as promised or phone me back as promised . One month later , they emailed me that the sizing was correct . WHAT ??? Intimo issued me store credit . NO REFUNDS . Would you have faith in buying here again with the strong potential for the same result at your return cost ? Credit card disputes did not help . Do n't shop with Intimo !!! I regret it . I give this item one star because they don tallow 0 . Intimo Women 's 100 % Silk Pajama
 I got these pants along with the matching hoodie a few days ago . I ordered a size large because according to their size chart for these items , that was my size . The sizing runs very big I feel . I think for these to look fitted and sleek like Juicy Couture suits and the way the photo represents them here on amazon , I 'd need a SMALL . These are huge , not nice and lowrise like the photo and just REALLY ill fitting . I 'll pay a little more next time and get Juicy .

 They had a great idea , but for day to day use this keychain is too large and too floppy . It 's easily going to be torn and disfigured riding around in your pocket or purse . Give it a pass and look for something more practical .
 as husband put it on 2 buttons came off right away and on further inspection alot of the buttons were very loose , so he chose not to wear it for a wedding
 cheap cheap cheap ... VERY thin would never buy again ... Men 's Light Green Dress Shirt w / Convertible Cuffs sz 17 1/2 34/35 ... ca n't recommend ! ~
 My daughter is 7 months old . Her head is on the bigger side and has plump cheeks . This sun hat is not able to efficiently cover her face unless I pull the hat very low on her face -LRB- covering her eyes with the head part -RRB- just to cover her cheeks . I love this hat and it does provide some sun coverage , but not completely .
 Do NOT buy this bag . I bought this bag and within a month the zipper on the top flap came right off . The bottom 4 plastic pieces that are there for protection started pulling away from the bag causing the bottom to rip less than two months after I got this bag . The top flaps leather is ripping after two months . This is NOT leather and if it is than its really bad leather.Of the two clips that come down from the top flap and attach to the bag , there is one that comes apart right after I put on the bag.This back pack will not last more than a Semester . If you want a leather back pack then you will have to spend money for it . A Nylon back pack is by far better than this . I do n't usually say something is bad if it is OK but I wrote this review because I think the public needs to know that this is NOT a good buy .
 1-star rating because the product was not as advertised . The product I ordered was supposed to be leather ; however , the product I received was vinyl . I do n't know if it was because they purposely did a `` bait 'n' switch '' or if it were an honest mistake on the part of their product support/product fulfillment but I am very disappointed with the product -LRB- if I wanted vinyl , I would have ordered vinyl , as there 's nothing wrong with vinyl/plastic but I wanted leather and ordered leather but did n't receive what I ordered -RRB- and have already tossed it into the garbage and gone to a brick and mortar store to purchase a genuine leather product .
 The leather is rock hard , and the description says the lining is suede , but it 's the same leather as the outside . I would not recommend this item . It feels very cheap .
 DO NOT BUY THIS BRA or anything from this company . I bought the bra for my wedding to see if it would work . The bra is terrible . The boning in the front buckles and pokes outward right below the bust -LRB- and not just a little bit -RRB- . Furthermore , the company is scamming you if you are reading this on Amazon.com . This bra is a `` final sale '' item which they do not tell you on amazon . So when you purchase it and then decide to return it you ca n't . NEVER BUY THIS !!!!! By the way , I wanted to give it zero stars and the site wo n't let me .
 I bought these hoping that they could replace the Gripper Jams I used to love and that CK does n't make anymore . They had good reviews and decided to take the plunge , but I 'm disappointed with the purchase . They ride us as soon as you move , and it 's not because I 've washed them . I bought for pairs and they all do the same . They get two stars because the material is very comfortable and it indeed feels like you are n't wearing anything when they do n't ride up . These would be perfect if they made a 9 '' version .
 I was hoping the great fit as the cotton version of the boxer brief . This version stretches too much and seems to wear away within just a few washes . Pay more and get less value ... seems to be the the purpose of this product . Sorry but true .
 Although I did follow instructions for sizing the product , it was still way too tight . In addition , there were no return or exchange direction including in the package . I have attempted to email the company and have not received a response . It has been about 2 weeks . I am not sure what to do .

 I searched for Levi 511 jeans and orderd the first pair that came up . Come to find out the first pair that comes up is Lee !! So I 'm sending back and can you better filter you searches when I type a specific item the competitor does n't come up first
 See i ordered a 34 x 32 if this jeans and i receive a 32 x 34 this size does not fit to me ? please contact me !
 Legs are n't straight as seen on photos . Size is n't tight or slim as I read on other reviews , these are very baggy . Maybe I received a wrong item , or they did . Fabric seems to be good . The worst jeans i have ever had ...
 A very dissapointing quality . Since I bought same brand and model last year -LRB- March 24 , 2012 -RRB- I expected same finishing details.Even though I bought this year a bigger size -LRB- 36 -RRB- it did n't fit me as well as the one I bought before -LRB- 34 -RRB- . Could anyone explain it to me ?
 I buy pretty much only Lee -LRB- hate Levi -RRB- and also had just recently bought some Lee jeans this size at Kohl 's and they fit great so felt I had a good shot for a fit with these . Bought 2 pair and both turned out to be much too tight at the waist and also while they had all the right tags just did n't seem like ` new ' , they had a washed kind of rough/bumpy/unoressed look and feel that you do n't see with a new pair from the mall .
 This is my second pair of Lee jeans . The first were purchased in a store and these were bought online . The size is listed the same for both jeans and they look identical except for color -LRB- I ordered a different color -RRB- . This pair seems much smaller than the first and I had to check the sizes to see if I had ordered them wrong but they both read the same.I guess I will have to order them in the store in the future to be sure they fit .
 The photo show belt loops over the rear pockets to give a little more support when you receive them they are not there only 5 and not seven . Someone needs to update photos for their product .
 El 10 de Febrero se realizo la compra y a&uacute;n no llega al casillero en miami , increible como fue enviado en burro
 Too small for me , too tight as well.I want to change it , exchange.My other Straight jeans are the same 33x30 , but not too tight on me .
 Leg length short compared to same size in Wrangler or Elwood jeans ordered at the same time . Color and waist fine
 WHY SO LONG TO SHIP . IF i KNEW THAT I WOULD HAVE NOT ORDERED THIS ITEM . SHOULD LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT ITS GOING TO TAKE LONG TO RECEIVE .
 Yo siempre uso esta medida de pantalones y estos me quedaron estrechos no los puedo usar perdi la compra . c
 I was disappointed that after wearing these jeans for a day , my white shoes and shoelaces have permanently turned blue where the pants had brushed against them .
 Really liked my 1st pair of Lee regular fit jeans , but like a lot of things this order seemed rushed.Two different sizes and no packing slip or invoice.So what is my recourse but to go shopping elsewhere.If Jeff Bezos is the Fortune Man of the Year some of us are not getting our vote
 I bought my last pair of Lee 's jeans 43 years ago . After buying them and when they were still new I bent over and they promptly split open right at the butt . I promised myself I 'd never buy another pair again . Well , I did . I bought two pair , one in color `` delta '' , the other in green . Right out of the package , without washing , the green pair are tight . I washed the `` delta '' color before putting them on , the fit was about right but did n't feel right Just feels wrong . When I sit down the waist slides down , which necessitates a belt . When I stand up I have to pull them up . My attitude toward Lee 's Jeans has n't changed . I 'm not going to throw them away but if I have another pair of another brand I 'll choose the other .
 The 34 X 29 Lee jean is enormous - the seat is huge - the thighs are huge - so , if you 're a big guy these jeans are made for you . If you 're a skinny guy , save your money .
 These jeans hug your legs almost like women 's jeans . They 're also uncomfortable to sit in . If you really want to try them , I recommend buying one size larger than you normally wear .
 I bought these lee Jeans over 2 years ago . The reason I gave these jeans a 2 is because they shrink . No , I have n't put on weight because the Levi 501 's I bought at the same time are still exactly the same fit . At first these jeans were a good fit . I always needed a belt to keep them up and they were easy to move in them . I am still around 185 lbs in weight and 6 ft plus tall . I noticed that these Lee jeans did shrink a little with each wash . I use reasonably hot water to wash them but no other brand jeans shrink like the Lee regular fit . I did buy Lee Dungarees a month ago to replace these in my normal size and they are a little big , but the Lee dungarees do n't shrink . I have 4 pairs of Lee regular fit jeans in different colors . I like the style , color choice , and the heavy weight of the denim . I 'm going to try for the next size up and see if they shrink down . I want Lee dark blue denim jeans that have n't been rubbed or bleached and by the look of the Lee range I can only get them in Regular Fit straight leg . I will let you know if this size change works . These jeans do shrink so remember this unless you buy them big in the first place they will shrink and may be tight on the legs and the waist . They did also shrink in the leg length . Great jeans Lee but fix this problem .
 I should have paid more attention to the fact that some reviews of this item call the fit very large and baggy and others call it extremely tight and skimpy . What they agree on is that when you order this item in any particular size , the size of what arrives is a crap shoot . It 's the same problem as with Levis . I was hoping Lees were more consistent than Levis . I was wrong .
 I the first time ordered Lee jeans . Before always bought Levi 's . I was waited by disappointment as jeans appeared less for the size from declared .
 Ca n't review the product as I never received it on the date span I was promised . Asked for a shipping tracking # and got a back order notice . Was billed on my Discover account , questioned and then was promised a refund which I 've yet to see .
 la calidad de este modelo no me gusto primeros bolle que uso y se descolora y pela la montura si no fuera por los cristales diria que es una imitacion
 Shipper was terrific , however , I do not recommend these leg warmers for the following reasons
 At first I was excited about these leg warmers , the longer ones are hard to find in stores . When they arrived I was nothing but disappointed . The knit is definitely a smoother , smaller , tighter knit , not the traditional larger , chunky cable knit , and nowhere near what is in the picture . Also , the page claims they are 80 % acrylic , 20 % nylon . The leg warmers definitely contain a decent percentage of wool , which I happen to be allergic to , making them itchy , scratchy , and unwearable even if I were willing to tolerate the change in appearance . I ended up giving them away .
 I was cold so I ordered the leg warmers . However the yarn does not hold it 's shape , it just keeps on stretching out . Oh well !
 This was the worst thing I have ever bought . It was so cheap . The first day I got it I took out the sizzors and they dont even cut paper . The little pin holder is just two fuzzy balls glued together . My caddy does n't even hold the tins it came with . It broke when i opened it and now they will not go back on . The thread is on a paper and you do n't get enough to do anything . I was extreamly disappointed in this product . DO NOT buy this product . It is a waste of money .
 This item is too small for any type of sewing storage and the items that come with it are super cheap
 Bad product , came on time and was poorly made . packaging was ok . I would never order again from this company . Who does not know the product they are selling .
 I know this isnt a zippo but it doesnt even work as a decent one Not very happy with it

 I 'm very disappointed because of size . I ordered size `` M '' . It seems that tag is incorrectly attached . I 's obviously `` L '' or even `` XL '' size.Was not expecting such stupid mistake from Outer Banks.Quality is good and color , but size ...
 This band isnot comfortable and the back velcro is just too weird to even understand ! It 's not adjustable and it 's overpriced ! I highly recommend another elastic band over this one

 I could never quite figure this one out ... either the baby seemed squished up in a ball , or I was uncomfortable . Maybe I just had the wrong size .
 THe previous poster said it all . I ended up using this maybe 2 times and I had to wait till my daughter was older than a newborn due to it eating her whole as it seemed!UpdateI still can not seem to use this with my new baby . She is uncomfortable like she is being squished . She hates it , and I do not feel comfortable wearing it . Off to sell it on ebay !

 I have always loved this pullover and used to buy this item every few years because I would literally wear them out . Now I understand why Kohls has discontinued selling this item though , because Columbia keeps making this item cheaper and cheaper . I recently bought two to replace the ones I had . They now cost more and the material is pretty much see-through -LRB- just hold it up to the light -RRB- . I have previous versions of this item and you can definitely see how much cheaper they 're being made . The thin fabric makes the collar look terrible and the item just sort of hangs on you . As well , a few washes pretty much destroy these `` new '' versions . Columbia please make these the way you used to even if they cost a few bucks more - your reputation is at stake !!
 I 've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son . I just ca n't get it to work so that he seems comfortable . He usually cries when he is in it . He fell asleep in it once , but he looked so contorted . It 's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way . And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head . And I know I got the correct size . I 've given up and am looking for a better sling . Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day , and he loves it , but it 's a little cumbersome , and I want him to be able to recline .
 This sling is really uncomfortable , both for mom and for baby . I kept trying to figure it out , thinking that I must be doing something wrong because it was just so uncomfortable . I had the right size , and I kept going back to the instructions to try to figure it out . Finally my husband said , `` Stop trying ! Use your other carriers ! '' . I love my two other carriers ... very comfortable for me and my baby falls asleep in them . With the New Native , he would scream and cry as I tried to shove him in , and then once he was in there he looked all contorted and his neck was bent in a funny way . I could wear it for about 5 minutes and then it felt like it was digging into my shoulder and the weight was unevenly distributed for my back . There are some really awesome carriers and slings out there -- I recommend getting a different brand for your own comfort , and for the well-being of your baby .
 I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son . When I put him in it , he looked so uncomfortable . I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit , but it still covered his face . So , I decided to shell out the $ -LSB- ... -RSB- for the infant support pillow , expecting that to make a difference . It did n't . He still looked uncomfortable and squished , only now I wasted MORE money . My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz . I ca n't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all . A big disappointment . If you 're looking for a carrier , try the Bjorn . A million times better than this .
 Rather than this sling ... I recommend you check out -LSB- ... -RSB- for your sling . They are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors . This is a far better buy than the native baby carrier .
 When my daughter was tiny , she enjoyed being in this sling ... on the one or two occasions I managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes . The cotton fabric does n't offer much support for the baby 's weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly . It also did n't feel as secure as some of the padded , over-the-shoulder style slings . I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times , which defeats the purpose .
 I 'm sure most new parents and parents-to-be have read or heard about the CPSC warnings regarding positional asphyxiation of babies in slings . This is precisely the type of sling they are warning about . This sling has a deep pouch that is not adjustable making it very difficult to correctly position a newborn or small baby . The picture of the woman in orange holding the baby in this sling is showing an incorrect position !!!! This baby could suffocate in this curled position with his head to his chest . The baby is also so low on the mother it would not be comfortable for her shoulders or back . A baby should always be able to be placed upright , tummy-to-tummy in a sling and should always be well above the wearer 's bellybutton close enough to be kissed ! I love wearing my baby , but always do so safely and would never purchase a sling like this . If you want to wear your baby in a sling , buy a good ring sling -LRB- like a Maya or Ellaroo -RRB- and makes sure to search for online resources on how to correctly position your child . Good ring slings have a shoulder that can be spread for the mother 's comfort and have no elastic or gatherings on the rails that would make it hard to adjust the depth of the pouch -LRB- though they may have lightly padded rails for baby 's comfort -RRB- . Please buy a good , safe sling for your baby and take the time to learn to use it . These cheaper slings look inviting and some look easy to use , but they are dangerous , difficult to use , and uncomfortable !
 This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap . There are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddler

 These do not stretch well . They stay stretched out after you take them off . They also ripped putting on the first time , but they were n't too small , the fabric just was n't sturdy . Normally I love Berkshire hosiery but this specific product was a real let down . If you want something that will not rip , go for their silky hose with lycra .

 My son was really excited to get costume ... took several days to receive . As soon as my son put it on and I tried to zip it , it ripped and the zipper fell off . My son did not want me to send back because he waited so long to get it , so I just added some Velcro to the back and a safety pin . He still has fun playing in it but for the price it could have been made better

 For a jacket with an original list price of over a hundred , this jacket is dead cheap . Every component of this jacket is bad ; the zipper is bulky , the lining is roughly done , the down filling is thin . It does n't have a warm/cozy feeling as one can expect from its puffy look , instead it is thin . I was very unsatisfied with this purchase . If you 're looking for a winter jacket that will perform well at below freezing temperatures , DO NOT BUY THIS JACKET .
 I bought one of these hats after 9/11 -LRB- I lived in NYC from 1994-1999 -RRB- and am SICK to my stomach after watching the crackdown in NY . I feel like burning it now .

 I tried to find out if this cami had a built in bra . It did n't explain what type of bra it had , but from my experience camis of this original price usually had a very good built in bra so I was very disappointed with my purchase and will never buy another Jorden product again

 This top was really uncomfortable . I had to tie it really tight for it to cover `` everything '' . The knot in the front was annoying too . Comfort defintaley did n't even come close .
 The gloves are really thin , and the symbol is already peeling off.Wouldn ' t have bought them if I knew .
 If I 'm not mistaken the item in the picture is solid black . The glasses I received have a clear tint at the bottom which I was not happy with . Will be returning this item . They did fit nicely , but as I mentioned I wanted solid black all around not just on 3/4 of the shades .
 The glasses I received have a clear tint at the bottom which I 'm not satisfied with . I will be returning these back .
 this was a complete buyers remorse purchase . I have never had such thick greasy filmy glasses . do NOT buy these

 Made with cheap construction , did not look like the picture at all ... sent it back the same day . . not worth the money .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 My son is on his 3rd and last Awestruck bag.The 1st one -LRB- ordered in 2009 -RRB- lasted 2 school years . So we ordered the same model as replacement for the 2011-12 school year since we were happy with the quality then.The 2nd one lasted less than 3 months . The base broke and it would n't stand upright . We thought it was a fluke since the 1st bag lasted a long time . So we ordered another one.His 3rd bag lasted 3 months . The base broke again , in exactly the same place as the 2nd bag.We now know it was n't a fluke and that it is a design flaw in the bag . Browsing at some of the newer reviews for the bags , I noticed other people have the same problem.Calpak must have used cheaper materials on these newer models . The bars at the base are made of plastic rods and both times , it broke off on the same spot -LRB- where the rods are connected -RRB- , so the bag would tilt and not stand upright anymore.This bag has a 3-yr warranty , but that warranty 's a joke . Calpak requires $ 14 + service charge for each bag on top of the shipping fee . That comes out to almost the price of the bag .
 Purchased this for my 4th grader on August 1st . We were n't able to put the handle down easily , but we decided to overlook that as my son liked the backpack and school was already underway.Then , last week , I noticed that the backpack would no longer stand up . It seems that the braces along the bottom have broken and the backpack must now be leaned against something in order for it to remain upright.Definitely one to avoid , unless you 're only expecting a 3 week useful life .
 Amazon really needs to start allowing zero star ratings ... Purchased two Awestruck rolling backpacks in August.These units have two plastic crossbars on the bottom that allow them to stand upright . After less than 6 months of use , crossbars on both bags snapped -LRB- turns out these plastic bars are hollow and very fragile , when they COULD have been solid at the cost of about 5 additional cents per unit -RRB- . The result is that neither bag will stand upright anymore.But wait ! These bags came with a 3-year warranty . Sounds great , right?Well , Calpak puts so much `` faith '' in their product that all you need to do to have them honor the warranty is send the unit in AND PAY A $ 14.95 `` SERVICE CHARGE '' -LRB- per bag -RRB- . Oh , yeah , and hope they decide the failure was not due to `` normal wear and tear '' ... So please keep in mind that in the event you need warranty service on your $ 35 rolling backpack , you will need to pay $ 14.95 + shipping to get a replacement . Not much point , when shipping will be close to another $ 12 . You need to figure these bags cost Calpak about $ 5 each , so they even make money from warranty returns . Great racket.If you are shopping for a rolling backpack , I suggest looking at one from Pacific Gear . While I can not speak as to their durability , their warranty does not come with a service charge attached -LRB- at least the warranty tag that I saw did not mention a charge -RRB- . That implies that they do n't expect people to ever need to use the warranty .
 This bag is good but not great as many would have you believe . I did not want to write a review but noticed that CalPak has good reviews even for a bag like this and I figured that people should know what they get based on the stars is not really great . I waited my time for the judgement .1 . The bag wheels are good for some and not so great for others . My son does not spend much time on the side-walk so the wheels are ok . . But another kid in the neighborhood uses the same bag walking to the bus and the wheels are almost gone .2 . The handle breaks - yes . It just comes off . The two rivets not top that connect the bag with the handle are flimsy and last night I had to fix them with screws of my own . I had to drill new holes and get the bag in a usable state till I get another bag . The metal rods get stuck and you have to force them out and that breaks the plastic holder .3 . The material is thin and the mesh-net bottle holder tears open . If it can not hold water bottles then what good is it?Help yourself . Save your $ 26 and get something else .
 After only 2 1/2 weeks of school , the bottom crossbar and stand broke off while my daughter was pulling it . She started crying because her new backpack was broken . I was so disappointed . This product is not worth the money . The zipper pulls broke too . Please do not waste your money on this .
 I normally do not write reviews for products I purchased if its quality is decent . This pack was purchased for my son -LRB- 7th grade -RRB- and used for only three times and the middle support on the bottom is broken in half and about a week later the handle came off . Considering the price , this pack is NOT sturdy . Extremly poor product , do not buy !
 We have purchased this bag from Ebags , the maker is CalPak.The 1st month our child used the backpack , it got broken . I did ask for a replacement and both companies did not agree on which one had to replace it.That happened in March , I have sent the photos ... ebags says that we are out of warranty , CalPak says to send a piece of the bag with a 14 $ check so they can reimburse us a $ 25 bag.Since we do not feel we are been treated fairly we are going to write negative reviews on both amazon and yelp.We have even offered to purchase a more expensive , $ 80 bag , so ebags had to ONLY give us the credit towards the new purchase . Did not do the work for them . We ended up loosing the bag and the $ 25 we paid for it!If you want to be selling your products online , speed up your processes and CUSTOMER is ALWAYS RIGHT !
 This bag was for my 9 year old son to use during his 3rd grade school year . After two months , the bottle holder broke . One month later , the full lower bottom support broke off . A couple of weeks later the zipper gave up . One month before his school year was over , the handle broke off . I contacted the manufacturer and after providing photos of all side and broken items , they decided it was not covered by the warranty . Make your call and decide if this product is for you ... . it is defiantly the worst backpack I ever purchased .
 Do not buy this bag . It is a waste of money and will fall apart shortly after purchase . Warranty ? Go look it up . . they make it more of a hassle than it is worth . You need to call , drive to the post office to mail it to them , pay them 10 dollars `` processing '' fee , and then you must spend a ton of time to argue with them on the phone . They know they can make money selling a poor quality product . Most people will not make them replace it.NEVER BUY A CALPAK
 We ordered backpack on August 11 , 2011 to be used by my 7th-grader son . He started using it in the beginning of September and after only three months of use the backpack is in full disrepair
 I purchased this for my son and was very disappointed . The bag appeared to be of good quality and had several compartments . However , after two weeks of use the cross bar under the bag broke on both sides . It tilts forward and it ca n't be used anymore . I had better success with bags I purchased for alot less money . This is not worth the money and I do n't recommend this product . I ended up buying him another bag for school .
 My 10 year old grandson used this backpack for less than a month when one of the feet cracked off and the bag will no longer sit upright . I have had no problem with ebags return procedure but in trying to decide what type of bag to buy as a replacement , I re-read all the reviews . ALL the `` one star '' complaints are for the same problem and total almost 15 % of the reviews . I guess 85 % odds are pretty good , that must be what I thought when I read the reviews prior to purchase , but when you are in this minority it 's a real let down . That one piece of this bag IS very poorly constructed . There is a seam between two very lightweight sections of plastic and that is the point that failed . If this one area was constructed differently I believe this could be a very good bag .
 I bought this wheeled backpack for my 7th grader . Looked to be sturdy from pictures . After using it for just carrying his school books and folders , the handle broke within the first month ! He has only used it for 2 months and I am now looking for a NEW backpack . This one fell apart ! Literally ! Guess $ 40 was n't enough for a middle school backpack ...
 I purchased the Awestruck backpack for my daughter . After only 3 months , the bottom wheel support cracked in half . I paid $ 26.99 and now CalPaks wants $ 14.95 to process my warranty claim !! The backpack has a 3 year warranty so what good is it if they will not replace the item for free . I submitted pictures of the backpack by email and then they wanted my to cut an 8 '' x 11 '' piece of material from the backpack to sent it in along with $ 14.95 . Really ??? You would be better off purchasing a different brand .
 I purchased this backpack for my 10 year old son at the start of the school year . The plastic cross bar at the bottom of the pack was broken by October . You can still use the pack but it will not stand upright any more , very frustrating . My son is , admittedly , very hard on things -LRB- but what 10 year old is n't -RRB- . I would not recommend this product .
 I decided to give a chance to this backpack a big one because I have 11 year old triplets !! I took about a week they start crumbling down ! Here Im buying three more , not even two month passed !
 The bag base broke after just 1 month . And its for a 4th grader who doenst have that much to carry around either .
 I bought this product for my 2nd grader , the bag seems durable and rolls well , but the handle already jams and will not go all the way down . Also the mesh net holder on the outside for bottled water has already torn . He has used it about 6 weeks at school.Okay we are now in our last 2 months of the school year and I had to order a new backpack . The screw came out of one of the poles that connects to the handle . It falls down inside the pole , like over time the hole wears to big . I put it back like 5 times then finally threw the backpack in the trash ! Such a waste of money !!
 I purchased this for my fourth grader who has a large 4 ring binder to carry everyday . After just 2 months the bottom hard plastic broke completely into . Looks like we 'll be purchasing a new $ 50 + bag and see if it lasts . I could have sworn there was a warranty but I ca n't find the details anymore .
 I ordered this item on a Sunday , paid nearly $ 20 for 1-3 day shipping . The item shipped on a Monday , and I did n't receive it until the next Saturday ! Costume is of poor quality , the hat is not as pictured , looks more like a witches hat than an Abraham Lincoln hat . Hat was actually compressed to fit in a package and the company should be ashamed for their lack of responsible shipping !!!!! I am returning ASAP .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .

 I bought this sunshirt for my daughter and within a week , it was all stretched out and and it has lost all its elasticity . Not worth the money I spent on this shirt .
 I am very disappointed with the quality of the material as after the FIRST wear -LRB- in a salt water pool -RRB- the material had loads of bobbles and instead of looking brand new , it looked like it had been worn and washed several times.The swim wear did protect my daughter from the sun as expected and I would recommend it for that purpose it 's just the actual material itself did n't look great . So I do n't think the product was worth the price -LRB- even at the sale price -RRB- as after a short holiday the swimwear now looks old.I 'd also recommend getting a bigger size - my daughter is slightly taller than average and is aged 12 . Luckily I ordered swimwear aged 13-14 and that fitted her well .
 I did n't even receive this rash guard . They sent me another top without any explanation . I wanted this one because it was a full length sleeve . What I got was a three quarter length sleeve -LRB- my baby is tiny so I know it 's not because it does n't fit -RRB- . The neck is not the same material as the sleeves and the piping is lower on the sleeve . It 's frustrating to feel like you did n't get what you ordered . I did n't have time to send it back and get another one before her swim class started and since it is winter it is hard to find baby stores that carry a good swim top .
 These glasses were not up to my expectations , the lens resembled plastic instead of glass like what was advertised . Would not recomend to buy .
 I bought this for my husband , he could n't use it because of its unpractical design ...
 Plain and simple , i bought this wallet with money clip brand new . When it arrived , the money clip on the outside of the wallet had rust on it . Rust on it ! on a brand new wallet . I 'm still using my old wallet .
 I bought this top for my 2 year old after reading reviews and seeing people thought this one was ok . I am here to tell you it 's not . This top has nothing of interest except the train and you have to pump this about 30 times just to get the train to go half way around the track . How many toddlers do you know with that kind of patience for a minimal reward ? The clear dome spins but what 's the point if you ca n't really see it ? The train sounds are ok but there are plenty other toys out there that make train sounds . If I had actually seen this in person in a store I never would have purchased it . This is going back ASAP and maybe I will try a choral top . Then again , maybe not ...
 My children received this toy for Christmas and I found it to be a poor value for the price . The yellow knob kept coming off -LRB- I finally glued it back on -RRB- and it is very difficult for a child to spin .
 An OK toy , but interest in it wore off fast . I think a regular top would hold interest longer .
 I was very disappointed . My mother had a top similar to this as a child . We purchased this one and it did not live up to expectations . The top has to be pushed down very hard and fast for the train to make noise . It is difficult for small children and the fun fades very quick . It is a toy that will be used once or twice and then discarded .
 I ordered the same size I all ready had . When they came they were way toosmall . The shipping was good price was good but they were sized wrong Iregifted then as a gift to my son .
 I tried to purchase warm heavy sweat pants on the web ... When they arrived , they were very light weight . Too light to take camping in spring or fall . I was dissapointed . Carl-Russell power Propel pants .
 After ordering the Los Angeles Angels T-shirt , Amazon delivered a Texas Rangers t-shirt . They still show the picture for the Texas Rangers shirt , yet the description is the Los Angeles Angels . Amazon even charged me the shipping cost , even though I returned the product and requested a new one.Very unhappy customer
 these are made of like a rough lace material , too scratchy probably wont even wear them ... shipping was fine fast enough . will try washing see if that helps but doubt it
 This item did not really work that well for sweating . It had a nice feel but did not fell like it was drying out well . I do n't think it was wiking out well . Almost felt like it was trapping heat .
 I bought this item for an upcoming cycling event . It seems to be a nice enough product that will keep sweat out of the eyes etc. . The reason for the negative review is that the picture advertising the wrap is not the same as the item shipped . Note the picture is an all black wrap . The item they shipped me is a purple head wrap with lightning bolts i.e. `` brainstorm '' . I should have realized by the name , but I go by the picture advertising the item . If you want a purple wrap with lightning bolts I suppose this would be a satisfactory product .
 The design on this shirt is actually larger than shown , and is all in SILVER SEQUINS , not embroidery . Sequins were not mentioned in the description or discernable from the picture . When I lifted it from the package , several sequins fell off . I was very disappointed .
 I bought these for a wedding and had to buy new ones at the last minute . First of all , they were too short for my legs . And why is that ? Not only were they too short , these things have absolutely no stretch and get runs VERY easily . I am NOT ordering nylons online anymore . I would prefer to see what kind of material they are actually made of before I buy ! I got better nylons for half the price at another store !

 I bought this wallet for a gift . When I received it , I was shocked at how poorly and cheaply made this wallet was . Although made of leather , it reminded me of a wallet made at summer camp by kids -LRB- maybe it was ! -RRB- . There is no room for credit cards , more than five $ 1.00 bills and some change . And being so cheaply sewn together , I doubt it will last long .

 the cut of this coat was weird , even though it was my size , the shoulders were ultra wide . The coat felt cheap , you get what you pay for.Amazon lured me in with an e-mail advertising a large discount .4 weeks later they discounted the price another 30 % -LRB- probably because they could n't get rid of it -RRB- . Probably wo n't buy clothes from Amazon again .
 This coat fit very strangely . The shoulders were too broad and I found that I could not lift my arms up without the entire jacket shifting upwards . It almost felt as if they expected my shoulders to be about four inches lower than they are . I returned this thing almost immediately .
 This coat definitely runs big , and has strange cut . When you wear it , it feels like you ca n't lift your arms to 90 degree angle . You get what you pay for -LRB- 70 % discount probably the reason for it -RRB- . I am returning it !
 I really wanted this coat to fit . It was nice material and weight and the stitching was good . I 'm 6 ' -4 and wear a 43 long with a 37 inch sleeve . The sleeves on the Large size were almost right , just a little short . But the chest size was huge , fit more for Arnold Schwarzenegger , not a normal person.Sadly , I returned it . If you 're a wrestler , boxer or weightlifter , this coat might work for you .
 Way to big compared to normal sizekinda old fashion styleDefinitely return it
 the sleeves are way too short and its way too big in the body , terrible cut .
 This belt looks nice and if it was just for show it would be nice to buy , but if it is meant to hold your pants up then it 's not for you.The leather pealed back after initial use.The secound star is for the looking nice part .
 A couple of flaws on the suit . The trim in some areas were stained pink instead of being white . The button on the back to fasten around the neck fell off as soon as I touched it . The Santa hat was way to small . This suit is not worth the money .
 This is n't a wallet . It 's a card case with a money clip in the center when you open it up . No place for receipts . Maybe someone else will appreciate the money clip gizmo . I found it clumsy and insecure .
 Too small for my 3 year old and the white of the hat were unraveling before wear . Color was as good as the picture I guess that &#8217; s a plus .
 Not great ... we have only been using this bag since January 3rd and it has already torn . Very disappointed .
 I thought , due to the picture , I was going to get a whole set of long johns , but all I got was the pants . This was a huge disappointment to me , as I needed the whole set for a ski trip and had to make due with wearing an extra shirt instead . If there 's one thing I hate , it 's false advertising !
 The description is deceptive and incomplete , you are purchasing the bottoms ONLY . What is the point of long johns if you have toasty legs but your arms fall off due to frost bite . The picture makes it look like you are buying the whole outfit . I will be wary of this vendor .
 When I looked at the picture of the long john before I purchased it I thought it was the whole set . The only thing I received was the pants . I was very disappointed that I only got the pants for over twenty dollars . I felt deceived .
 I ordered a Large top - I received a Small Petite !!! I had ordered it for my son who is in the military . He gets really cold under his uniform and I can not afford to spend a lot of money . This was on sale - it was back ordered - which I was okay with . But , when I received it a month later , it was the wrong size . What was the point of sending one ? My son was home on leave and I had hoped to be able to send him off with a warm top to wear under his uniform . That did not happen .
 i am upset at the seller that you would sale this product with the mask of the costume being broken . putting clear tape inside of the mask trying to hide the torn mask .

 I have previously bought a lot of these shirts . Over time , a peculiar problem surfaced . Shrinkage -LRB- natural in a cotton shirt -RRB- affected one side of the front of the shirt , in the up and down direction , more than the other . As a result , the button holes in the placket increasingly became farther apart than the buttons , causing the shirt to have extensive wrinkling on the button side . I am not a tailor , but what I suspect happened is that the Banks buyers failed to specify how the warp and woof of the fabric were to be matched -- an expensive mistake.A second problems arises from product sizing . When I moved from a 16.5-34 to a 17-34 , the shirt suddenly became a tent.I have not had these problems with other manufacturers , notably Eagle , Land 's End and Enro .
 Bad fit for an ordinary guy . I ca n't imagine who they design such shirts for!I had luck with one of their Traveler shirts - really nice , and attempted to get another twice - no more !
 I placed a phone order for 4 pashmina scarves - I emphasized my expectation of a high quality pashmina consisting of 70 % cashmere and 30 % silk - what I received was `` pashmina wool '' that is scratchy and not wearable . I returned all items unused , in the original packaging with all tags intact - but a 20 % re-stocking charge was levied against my credit card , even though I asked about any additional charges when I placed the order ! No fun ...
 I knew I was taking a risk because this item was only $ 20.00 , but what I got was n't worth the shipping . It is simply an itchy piece of wool . It is not even pleasing to the eye .
 Weak product . I am very disappointed . Goes back to the old adage
 They sent me the wrong color scarf and then expected me to pay shipping when they sent me the correct color ! They also charged me a 20 % resocking fee even though I returned the items within the 2 week timeframe required to avoid the charge . Some of the scarfs are very nice - depends on the color . Was planning on buying more but bad customer service has put me off .
 I purchased for special party and I was gently pulling the stocking up over my calf and a run appeared . I had to wear tights instead . Flimsy material dont buy .
 only get one pair not all 4 pairs as shown , expensive for one pair , unable to choose color , therefore I returned them , I did n't get the full purchase price reimbursed and had to pay for shipping the item back . Will NOT buy from them again .
 These are not as shown . They are cheaply made and fall apart easily . The die runs , so wash them by themselves . Cheap knock-offs .
 Socks were great , but I thought there would be more then one pair ... grim sauce . They should advertise that a wee bit more !!!!
 These socks are warm and fuzzy and warm and comfy . But , beware . I purchased the blue and red ones . I washed them first in a dark wash , and there was blue and red lint all over my other clothes ! So everything went into the dryer , and it took two cycles to remove the lint from the clothes . Believing the worst was over , I thought It was safe to wear the socks . I wore the red ones with the white crocs I wear in the house , and still more lint ! A trail of lint everywhere I walked . The lint came through the holes of my crocs . When I took my crocs off , the inside of my crocs was red ! Have n't tried the blue ones yet ... . fearing the Blue Lint Monster !
 pretty , fuzzy socks , but not soft on inside . Felt coarse to soles of my feet .
 I ordered a 36D in this bra/camisole , which is usually a perfect fit for me . But the cups were unusually large in circumference , far too big for an average D fit . That said , the fabric certainly would provide firm support , and it was very well-made .
 I did not like it because I am heavy chested and too much of my chest is out . It would give great support but to much shows for me .
 fail to see the universal appeal of this brand . The designs are poor copies of classic Ray-Ban styles like the `` Balorama '' or `` Clubmaster , '' at twice the price . All I can think of is that Ray-Ban is too `` retro '' or `` your Dad 's sunglasses '' which of course , they are supposed to be . `` Maui Jim '' will always remind me of $ 5 `` Panama Jack '' available at any drugstore .

 Not comfortable , no support , I thought they were the new style pouch type but they are not .
 This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men . If you just want underwear look on ; however , if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less . At is unless the view is everything
 THIS ITEM WAS OVER 2 WEEKS LATE . I TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE COMPANY AND I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM . AND WHEN I DID THEY AVOIDED THE ISSUE . THEY BASICALLY SAID WELL IF YOU RECEIVE IT AT ALL THEN OUR JOB IS DONE . DOES N'T MATTER IF IT WAS NOT THERE AT YOUR HOME IN THE PROMISED TIME . THIS COMPANY DOES NOT CARE AT ALL ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS !!!!!!!!!!!!

 Babylicious Groovy Pink Circus Stripe Basic BibThe descriptive image provided on the website shows 4 bibs , but what you get is a single ordinary bib that would cost less even at a premium price store . Certainly not worth the price . returning this item ASAP ... -LRB- make that returned it within an hour of receiving it -RRB- .

 it works . period . but it is like wearing a plastic bag ... no breathing at all . You get very sweaty when it is closed up ... it is only good for heavy rain protection , but nothing else . Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes .
 The good thing about this parka ? It is waterproof . Do n't buy this parka if you plan to active . It does not breathe and it retains moisture . Sizing is not true to size . Buy one size smaller if you are still considering a purchase .
 This rain jacket is not breathable . They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket . Right where my backpack shoulder straps go . I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain . I put it on and I was drenched inside . This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store . Absolutely not for any serious outdoor activity like hiking .

 Costume arrived with an unsewn seam in the crotch . Appears to have been a quality defect from the factory . Returned to Costume Craze at my expense . Apparently because of the halloween rush , lots of returns and my refund continues to be delayed . I should have purchased a costume locally . Several weeks waiting , still without my refund processed is unacceptable .

Was planning on buying more but bad customer service has put me off .
 Not comfortable , no support , I thought they were the new style pouch type but they are not .
 This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men . If you just want underwear look on ; however , if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less . At is unless the view is everything
 it works . period . but it is like wearing a plastic bag ... no breathing at all . You get very sweaty when it is closed up ... it is only good for heavy rain protection , but nothing else . Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes .
 The good thing about this parka ? It is waterproof . Do n't buy this parka if you plan to active . It does not breathe and it retains moisture . Sizing is not true to size . Buy one size smaller if you are still considering a purchase .
 This rain jacket is not breathable . They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket . Right where my backpack shoulder straps go . I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain . I put it on and I was drenched inside . This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store . Absolutely not for any serious outdoor activity like hiking .

 I hate these sunglasses . They do not fit well at all and hurt your ears .

 Do n't recommend these pants if you are trying to overcome wave drag or supersonic flow . My wife received a pair of these for her birthday and her movement has never quite been the same . It takes her at least 8 times longer to go from the spice cabinet to the microwave and 5 times longer to walk from the mailbox to the lawn gnome at our front door . On windy days , I do n't even let Helen out of the house even to pick up the newspaper . Before purchasing these ` Stretch Gaucho Pants ' , I recommend using the drag equation to calculate the force experienced by an object moving through a fluid at relatively large velocity -LRB- i.e. high Reynolds number , Re > ~ 1000 -RRB- , also called quadratic drag ... THEN make your decision ...
 I honestly never felt comfortable in the bra . Maybe if I had the right size I would n't complain . It did n't fit properly -LRB- I 'm a 36 C and that 's what I purchased -RRB- so the cups dippled in the front . Also , it was very uncomfortable to sleep in . My breast did n't ` stay ' when I slept on my back and they actually felt constricted like I was wearing a too tight sports bra . The arm holes were too high so it rubbed against my arm pits . I wore it for about 2 hours and have never put it on since . Very disapointing for such an expensive bra .

 I usually do not write reviews maybe because I 'm usually pleased with the product since I rely on product reviews before I buy anything . However , despite the high reviews , this dress , for the high price I paid of $ 29 , is of HORRIBLE quality ! I bought this costume for my daughter 's 5th birthday and within 2 hours -LRB- no rough playing at all -RRB- the ribbon around the waist was unraveling . Also , as my daughter was dressing in and out of it throughout the day , large holes ripped in the outer netting in a few places . The feel of this dress is also very bad . I would n't have minded so much if I paid $ 10 for it , but definitely not worth $ 30 !!!!! I am very dissatisfied .

 Belt lasted about a month . Grommets started falling out causing belt to tear apart . `` leather '' cracked within a week of use .
 i was not happy with this purchase . the item has an odd cut/shape to it . . would n't buy again . ended up giving it to my girlfriend
 I do n't see how this got USMC approved . I have tees that are over 10 years old , washed many times and still have better fabric thickness than this . I can see my hand through it ! Not worth the postage to return . Semper Fi
 the shoulders are a really weird fit and it runs small ... basically the only thing i liked about it is that it said marines on it lol oorah

 I bought 2 belts that were size 48 . They were too tight . Well , I should say the buckle fit in the middle of the holes with only two holes left . They fit more like a 46 so I exchanged them for a size 50 and I need to draw it up to the tightest hole for the belt to fit . I am confused . I took them to a local store and they did n't carry that style so I now have two belts that I really do n't use and it cost me $ 116 . Nice belts and if they sent me the true size 48 , I would gladly return the size 50 in the box the new ones came in . The belts are nice . Thank you

 THE `` NO `` HEADACHE VISOR ! GAVE ME A HEADACHE !!! THE DAY I RECIEVED IT , I TRIED IT ON . IT LOOKED REALLY CUTE , BUT WITH IN A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A HEADACHE ! NOT TO MENTION IT LOOKED USED . BECAUSE I WORE IT OUT SIDE TO SEE IT IN THE SUN , IT SEEMED LIKE IT HAD STAINS ON IT , ALSO IT HAD LITTLE BALLS . LIKE WHEN SOMEONE HAS ALREADY WORE IT ! AND ITS BLACK ! IT SO MUCH GROSSED ME OUT!I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN !! I ALSO TRIED EMAILING THE COMPANY AS SOON AS I RECEIVED IT . AND AS OF TODAY , I HAVENT HEAD FROM THEM !! THEY NEED TO BE REPORTED TO BBB ! THEY NEED HELP IN CUSTOMER SERVICE . I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM OR REFER THEM TO ANYONE !!
 I own at least 5 or 6 golf visors . I bought this one because I am constantly in search of a more comfortable one . This one had such great reviews I felt that this must be super comfortable - NOT !! No Headache Visor ? YES , BIG headache !! By about the 4th hole it felt like my head was in a vise . I guess I always thought I had an average sized head , and no one has ever told me otherwise , but maybe not ? All I know is that I 've never had another visor , or any other hat for that matter , fit as tightly as this visor - this thing was just plain awful ! I wo n't be wearing it again !
 I bought this vior because it was written NO HEADACHE . That is not true It gives me such a headache that stayes with me for a long time it was really waste of money . behjat safavian
 The reason the visor does not cause headaches is because it does not stay up ! It falls down my face as soon as I put it on ! Did n't the maufacturer try it on first ???
 The visor is so big on my head it wo n't stay on . I went and bought one at Walmart for 1.99 which fits much better . Would n't recommend this unless you have a very very large head .
 I bought three of these no headache visors , now they are just a waste of money . I honestly tried to wear them several times for varying times up to about an hour and a half.Within minutes of putting one on I would start feeling uncomfortable because of the hard plastic square that hits right in the middle of the forehead , leaving an imprint , which eventually feels uncomfortable . I both the minimal ones becaue I had read in other reviews about the hardness of the plastic , so the smaller ones seemed less like that . I still wo n't wear them .
 Very disappointed in this product . Cheaply made with a very prominent point -LRB- bulge -RRB- in the front of the visor which digs into the forehead , causing a headache ! Material is very cheap with no padding or lining around the inside which touches the forehead . Shipping at $ 5.99 was entirely too high for a product around ten dollars . Not worth the bother to ship it back , it went in the trash !

 This Seller 's images lie!They provide only white , black , heather grey , and oatmeal colored socks .
 I reviewed this item a while ago and was very pleased with this product , but ... . These socks are not cheap -LRB- price wise -RRB- but I wanted the quality so I pay . I ordered the `` deluxe '' slouch sock so I would get the thicker ones that do not wear out or get holes after a few months . I got the same ones that were being sold as a cheaper version , are very thin and not as good . So basically I got ripped off . Last order for you Barry .
 I bought this for my 5yo , since it said kids medium . It is a baby sized hat . Nowhere in the description does it say for babies . I was very disappointed in this . Please update the description.The hat looks good - just not marked well , size-wise .
 I received this item in a timely manner . The item looks good and you 'll get compliments but the scarf is losely knit and does not keep my head warm enough - the wind blows right through it . Not a `` cold '' weather item .
 The picture does not look like the product unfortunately . The faux fur trim is skippy , not full as you see in this picture . The material is thin and this does not look good on -- does not look like the model .

 I 've been wearing sunvisors for years and this happens to be one of the most uncomfortable and poor-fitting visors I 've ever worn . It definitely gave me a headache . Going back to the Town Talk visors ... they 're much better , especially for golfing or sailing .

 When I ordered the bag I assumed I would at least be able to hold my wallet in it , however , even that made the magnetic button hard to clasp . I do have a long clutch type wallet , but if this product was pictured better I would have known that it was too small to actually fit anything .
 I bought this so because it was/is like a back pack . I 've only had it for a short time and I already have to replace it because a strap broke from the top stitching .
 The craftsmanship was not good.It was only ten bucks since it was on sale . I guess I got what I paid .
 I was disappointed with the barbie size bag . I thought it was going to be much bigger . It 's child size , I wish Amazon would show each purse with a mannequin or a wallet anything that we could see how big or how small the thing is . Anyway it 's way too small for me .
 It is of good quality ; the leather is real . The price was very cheap so I was wondering what I would get . When I opened the package I actually laughed . Shame on me for not looking into the dimensions when I ordered it !! It 's like a little girl 's purse , the size of a Hello Kitty or something . I mean , if you want a little backpack for just a few items , it 's great , but for me , I was looking for something roomier . NO fault of the seller , mine for not checking size . I will be giving it to a young lady for school ; but her notebooks wo n't fit -LRB- lol -RRB- .
 The bag in the picture looks much bigger than the actual size , its horrible I was furious to see this !
 Very disappointed !!! Looked like something for a child , so I gave it to a child to play with . . and they looked disappointed too !
 I did not realize from the posting how small this backpack is ... it looks like it is for toddlers !!! I would not recommend this unless you are buying it for a 3 yr old .
 I did not get a backpack . I received a very small `` weekender '' bag . It is more like a miniature laptop bag , which could be useful if I had a 10 '' notebook . I do n't . Unfortunately I had this shipped to someone , who in turn traveled to my location . It is not worth the cost of returning the bag to seller . Very disappointed .
 This bag is much smaller then i was expecting . the zippers do not open/shut easily . I was very disapointed .
 The sewing was crappy and the strap came right out . I was also able to pierce the so called leather with my nail when I went to pick it up off the table . Now there is a huge whole in the side . I got my money back , less the shipping , but it was the worst buy I have found on here . There is nothing geuine about this so called leather !
 This product was not what the image made it appear . It is to small fro practical use . It took forever to get here and the shipping and handling cost more than the product .
 From the picture , this looked like solid pieces of leather . It is actually small pieces of leather sewn together , which looks cheap . The strap is thin . The nylon inside is not durable and was torn when I received the purse , so that items could fall through the hole and get caught between the lining and the leather . The front pockets , with the zippers going all around the pockets , are not well designed to hold anything .
 I bought this purse because I though it was really cute and since my hands are always full , I needed a bookbag for a purse . This purse was so small , I could only fit my wallet and my cell phone . The pockets were so small that I could n't even fit a pack of gum . The quality looked great though , I just wish it would of been bigger .
 The purse was smaller than I thought it would be . It hardly holds anything . I was not impressed with it .
 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .
 I had high hopes for this bag . Disappointed . The ball portion of the bag was awkward . It was not easy to put the ball in or take the ball out . Returned .

 This coat arrived smelling literally like a chemical waste dump . I tried hanging it outside in the wind and spraying it repeatedly with Fabreeze . The seller has refused to reply to emails so it appears they know they are selling a dangerous and horribly smelling product . I would suggest you avoid this seller just as you would a chemical waste dump . They both rate the same on my scale . I would n't have given this product and seller a &#34; 1 &#34; but it was the only way to let the public know how awful this product is .
 This ring is a weird shape and it is too heavy to wear . There is no exchange option to wer so i '' m returning it .

 it works . period . but it is like wearing a plastic bag ... no breathing at all . You get very sweaty when it is closed up ... it is only good for heavy rain protection , but nothing else . Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes .
 The good thing about this parka ? It is waterproof . Do n't buy this parka if you plan to active . It does not breathe and it retains moisture . Sizing is not true to size . Buy one size smaller if you are still considering a purchase .
 This rain jacket is not breathable . They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket . Right where my backpack shoulder straps go . I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain . I put it on and I was drenched inside . This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store .

 This ring is a weird shape and it is too heavy to wear . There is no exchange option to wer so i '' m returning it .
 i wanted this bag cause i carrie a lot of stuff , but the first time used it the little strap broke clean off ! and i almost lost all my things.then the next time i put the big straps on i knew i was gud then . i put the bag across my body the next thing i know i 'm being paged at walmart cause the straps broke agin and the security person found my bag the fake leather is so thin and cheep my keys poked a hole on the bag i wish i had my money back but you get what you pay for !!!! And I Only Used Thid Bag 4times dont waste your money !!!
 it 's a bit crinkly and does n't really absorb anything , it 's just like wearing an extra shirt but less comfortable . Also , the price does n't match the quality . The size is pretty big , which might be good for some people , but it 's not great at locking in moisture or anything of the sort . It 's made from cheap cotton and is n't stretchy at all ... so ... I did n't care for it .
 Quite frankly I was more than apauled to have paid the amount of money that I did for the quality of shirt I received . I have extensive background in textiles -LRB- and even if I did n't I could tell the difference -RRB- and can honestly tell you that the material that was used for the shirt purchased was less than or equivalent to something purchased at Wallmart . Granted that the name `` Prada '' carries great weight and prestige . I personally would investigate my textiles and manufacturers before ever putting my designer name on something this patheticallyconstructed .
 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .

 I have several different Calvin Klein bras that I like a lot , however this style is not very comfortable . I like the lightly lined cups that provide some support and shape . However , the underwire comes up too high in between your breasts and can be uncomfortable by the end of the day .

 I completed the order on Monday and received it Wednesday with standard shipping . I would recommend buying from the vendor.With that being said , this item is basically a poncho . It feels like a heavy trash bag , i 'm concerned it 's going to rip very quickly . The logo looks like a decal that will peel soon . I wouldnt have bought this if I saw it in a store . I 'd send it back but I 've already paid the $ 8 to ship it here , plus it would be another few bucks to send it back and $ 5 for a restocking fee . So my choice becomes $ 16 for nothing or the $ 36 ive paid with shipping . My recommendation is just buy a poncho .

 I wanted a down stadium parka with a fur trimmed hood like the one I have now which is an extra large . When I tried this parka on I could barely close it over my chest . There is no way I could have ever worn a bulky sweater under this coat . The sleeves were short also .
 This coat is not as fashionable as it looks online . I sent it back and found a Michael Kors for half the price .

 This tie is much too short ofr a boy of 13 years old . i expected it to be better quality and to fit the intended young man . I was disappointed in paying for such an item .

 cheap fabric . not worth what they are selling it for . worth about 5 bucks , tops . junk . i sent it back .
 This sweater is much thinner then I expected . The photo shown to advertise it looks like the sweater is pretty thick or at least medium . When I got it , it was very thin & even looked stretched , the front design was very open . In the picture it looks like the design is stitched tight and therefore well made but the one delivered to me was n't . Also , the arms are way too long . I ordered size Medium knowing the length of the sweater is kind of long , that 's ok but when the sleeves are way too long , then it 's not practical . No wonder the women in the picture has one arm held up and the other in her pants pocket.I have ordered before from National & it was all good , but not this time .
 I used this every day for about 2 weeks before it cracked up the middle . The plastic material is n't flexible enought for this type of application . It 's cheap enough but not durable .
 the title says it all . i had one of these earlier -LRB- i stepped on it and cracked it -RRB- and it was way better . the newer ones are made out of extremely brittle plastic .
 Omg ! This wig was worst than sonwthing i could have picked up at the dollar store . . i put it in the trash . I didnt return it because i didnt want antone else to end up with it
 I tried and tried to make it look nice and ... no , it does n't work , look like the one in the picture at all . . it is just less than ok .
 This is the sheerest cashmere I have ever seen . Looses it shape after one wearing . Huge seams . TRULY a disappointment .

 False advertising - said made in USA , but the socks I got are from China . I try to buy things made in USA . I can buy Chinese socks at WalMart for a lot less money .
 Up until this purchase I have been completely satisfied with every single gold toe product I have ever purchased . I would only wear gold toe socks . I can not fathom that Gold Toe would destroy their brand by producing this product . They are the worst socks I have ever purchased , do not buy this product !
 These are all Christmas gifts . I will have a better idea at that time and will reply as time permits .
 The title of this says `` 3-pack '' . Then , the description says `` three pairs to a pack '' . I was expecting to get what is advertised
 these socks wear out in the first day . the first pair had a hole in the toe before the first day was out and the soles went within a week .
 Facts - Purchased 12 pairs , have worn 4 pairs.Pros - They are socks , the blue socks have light blue seam near the toe.Cons - Thin , fall down , blue is too close to black , uncomfortable.Speculation - Will only get worse over time.Recommendation - Do n't try these at home .
 I ordered cotton socks . You sent me 99 % nylon socks . I am allergic to nylon.I love gold toe socks but these are virtually useless to me . To top that , returning merchandise to you is so laborious , and your mistakes in selling softline goods are routine enough , that I do n't see how I can keep buying merchandise like this from you .
 I bought these socks based on other reviews . Although I followed the manufacturer 's recommendations for laundering the socks , I found that they shrank with the first washing to the point that they were tight on my calves -- and I am a woman with slender calves ! They attract lint like crazy and feel thin and scratchy . I bought them just after Christmas and now only wear them when I do n't care how I look . Still on the lookout for a decent trouser socks !
 Chose these socks because of a supposed warm rating , they meet the minimum warmth for me to be satisfied there , but as for being socks , let alone dress socks pass these up . while they are tight they do not stay up at all , as others have stated they sag , ridiculously so , not a little bit , they fall all the way to the bottow and not because they are not tight .
 The Metropolitan socks are thin and fairly comfy , but they sag on the calves very easily . I pulled them up all the way and wore them for about 3 minutes walking down the street . They were already sagging down to my ankles ! They are not tight at all.I 'm 5 ' 8 '' and bought the `` one size '' sock . I 'm in good shape and my calves are neither fat or sculpted.For $ 15/3-pair , I might as well have gotten a $ 5 3-pack of saggy dress socks at Walgreens .
 I have been wearing gold toe socks for about 15 years now , but as other folks have pointed out , they do n't seem to last long at all anymore . They do n't get holes , but the heal seems to wear away pretty quickly -LRB- I just use them for work , no running or anything -RRB- I did notice that with this last set of socks I bought that they are no longer being make in the USA . I think they may have changed up the material being used at the same time .
 I have worn Metropolitan dress socks for many years and have been very satisfied . I recently bought some more and am dissatisfied . There is a deterioration in quality . The socks sagged very badly .
 I loved everything about the shirt -LRB- fit , lace , length -RRB- and received many compliments while wearing it . However , the shirt was made of fabric that picked up every particle of lint within a twelve mile radius and was , unfortunately , black . I stopped wearing it after only a few times due to this problem.Were the shirt made of another fabric . I would purchase it again .

 I 've been meaning to give this mask a review . And now , I shall!I got this mask as a gift . And it really sucks that I ended up not liking it . I do n't know what went on in the shop/factory/place that made this but it does NOT look like the picture . After hoping for awhile that I 'd get a nice bright white and cute mask , I got a white mask with some cream colored areas and a weird pink mole on the upper cheek . This mask looks half-assed , basically . I wish whoever made this would have put in more effort into it because it would n't have taken much to make it look the way it 's supposed to look .

 Be warned all you Gold Toe Men 's Cotton Fluffies fans - things are not what they used to be!I have worn G T 's Men 's Cotton Fluffies in oatmeal for over 20 years . I loved the quality , comfort , color and durability . These were outstanding socks in every way.Alas , they are no more . I should have been warned by an earlier reviewer -LRB- Beware ! Wrong Color Wrong Price -RRB- who suggested that Gold Toe had found another manufacturerin a different country -LRB- Pakistan -RRB- to produce their product and that the quality and color were decidedly inferior - but I proceeded to purchase anyway , although not fromAmazon Prime as usual but from Shoe Buy an outside Amazon vendor who now appears to be the only source for them . BIG MISTAKE!If any Gold Toe executive is reading this please take note - your new product can not hold a candle to the earlier version . Please bring the original back!You will lose your faithful customers with this inferior shoddy product . What is the world coming to ? BUYER BEWARE !!
 I 've been wearing `` oatmeal '' colored GoldToe Cotton Fluffies for years , and bought some of these here online because my local store is out of stock.How hard could it be , the picture looks exactly like the socks I wear , and the color matches the saved label . Two seconds later , the socks are on their way . A short three days later , the socks arrive , and . . Wait a minute , these do n't look anything like the socks I ordered ! These are n't the varigated two-color `` oatmeal '' I was expecting , they 're just off-white tan . I can live with that , but the kicker was they came with stickers announcing the price was less than what I paid!The socks have an attached very legit-looking GoldToe labels say `` Made in Pakistan '' , style 565S , color 027 `` oatmeal '' , and also have a cute `` 3 Pair , $ 16.00 '' sticker -LRB- I paid almost $ 7/pair with shipping -RRB- . Either GoldToe 's quality is slipping , or these are some kind of overstock/reject/odd-lot . Buyer beware !
 I am very unsatisfied with my purchase . I was led to believe that I purchased two 6pk of socks and when I received my order , it was only two pair of socks .
 Once the tops of these socks get stretched a little , they 'll no longer stay up . They 'll simply fall down around your ankles .
 I also was shocked when only one pair of socks arrived . Normally there is three pair to a pack . What especially confused me is that the price was $ 9.95 -LRB- which is what one would pay for a three pair pack at a TJ Maxx 's -RRB- . When I opened them , the sticker price was only $ 7.00 . What a deal . Normally I am happy with Amazon . This time I feel they won .
 I 've worn the very soft cotton Gold Toe fluffies for years . Probably decades . These are not them . These are stiff cotton socks made in china . How they can call them fluffies is beyond me . The material is completely wrong .
 I would have lost more money in returning these / Unfortunately I received the wrong quantities of the two different colors of socks I ordered . This followed a previous order where one of the socks had a large hole in the heel . Not Gold Toe quality . Not Amazon service .
 I wore Gold toes years ago and remember them as very high quality durable socks . I discontinued using them because i started wearing different styles than the crew/white/standard . Now after trying these fluffies i think i remember why i stopped liking the gold toes . perhaps they sold the co. or came under new management . in anyt case these socks have no stretch in the elastic , making them basically worthless . yippee .
 Received one pair of socks . Wish I had known that before ordering . Seems that others people received different number of socks . I guess I will be buying socks from physical stores .
 It 's sometimes difficult to find socks that fit my husband . He likes these socks , but they 've been riding down from day 1 .
 The denim heather sock is a grayish color and not the same as pictured . It is pictured as `` blue '' . So , if you want the socks to match your jeans , they wo n't .
 Prospective buyers beware!I thought I was going to get a package of several pairs of bikini panties.All I got was one lousy pair .

 If you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washings then this is the shirt for you.Be aware that Amazon has a $ 3.99 plus $ 0.99 -LRB- per item -RRB- return shipping fee.Is all Bill Blass stuff this `` quality '' ?
 I have this in all 3 colors , and only the blue color looks fine . The other two colors , I do n't think I would like to wear to office where I am a mid-manager level . Reason being that the fabric is a blend hence thinner than the normal 100 % cotton shirts that I prefer . Looking at the retail price of the shirt , I was expecting something better .
 Nice fit but the plastic thread used to sew together is exposed . This will rub a whole under your arms when running . I returned .
 This bra -LRB- at least the style number -RRB- was my favorite sports bra . I ordered by the style number off of my old ones , however there has been a major change in this bra . It does not support well during running and Zumba and I do not wear it at all . Very disappointed .
 Grrr . This goes into the category of should have known better . I have enormous boobs , and the Champions have never worked . On this bra , the cups were smaller than expected . But what surprised me was that every bit of the bra was stretchy . That means that even with a smaller than needed cup , my junk was flying around everywhere . Colossal fail.Exercise care , ladies , because when I sent this thing back , Amazon assessed a 50 % restocking fee ... which they graciously and quickly refunded ... but it required my catching it and making the call .
 I ordered this one because I love the support of the Champion Powerback , but hate having to pull it over my head to get on and off . I was hoping this one would offer the same support , but be easier to wear . No such luck . Both versions fit well in a 34DD , but this one just does n't have any support in the cups because they are too stretchy .
 After having this Champion bra recommended to me by a friend and reading the positive reviews on Amazon , I decided to give it a shot . This was promptly returned after I tried it on . I did not feel like this bra provided enough support for a high-impact activity like running . I ended up purchasing the Fiona bra by Moving Comfort and now I believe a sports bra without adjustable straps will always be inferior .
 I needed a new sports bra for running.I am not flat chested , so i was looking for support , specifically for HIGH IMPACT activity.What a disappointment when i open my package and the tag reads : MEDIUM IMPACT ACTIVITIESWalking , Pilates , YogaMedium SupportI like the bra , it feels good and i may keep it , BUT the point is : DONT TELL ME I 'M GETTING A HIGH IMPACT BRA WHEN REALLY YOU ARE SENDING A MEDIUM IMPACT BRA.Not cool Amazon . = -LRB-
 I 'm a big woman who can go into any store and try on all the bras , yet not find one that 's comfortable and supportive . Champion is the only bra I 'll wear . I like this model , it 's the only underwire I 've ever worn and forgotten I 'm wearing it , but it 's not built as solid as I am , and a strap broke after I 'd had it fewer than 30 days.Champion , if you 're listening , please retool this one to be as sturdy as the rest . Thicker straps in the back , and stitch those straps so they 'd survive a hurricane .
 This bra is comfortable , but definitely NOT for high impact activities like running . I got the 36-38 C/D and wore it for a run this morning - painful , to say the least ! Of course now I 've worn it so I ca n't return it , so I guess I 'll wear it for lower impact sports like yoga , pilates and maybe walking . I also ordered the Champion 360 max support bra and that one is MUCH better at providing support while running . Overall I am disappointed with this bra , as it definitely does not provide maximum or even high support .
 I recently bought one with the understanding that my purchase was for an authentic escada cow leather purse made in Italy with an authenticity card . Instead , I received a knock-off vinyl material without any security tag and authenticity card . Hardwares are tacky imitation .
 ordered the spa bathrobe . the material is very thin and i am glad to use it onl in the sumer months . i do n't think the material would last a year of washing .
 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .
 I did a quick add to cart based on the image above , looks white with a bit of charcoal gray maybe , it 's actually olive green .

 I 'm not sure if I should blame Samsonite or the shipper , but the case arrived in bad condition . The handle had a series of scrapes on one side that cut through the leather . The top was also not aligned properly with the bottom . This meant that when you closed the case , you had to slightly pull the top to one side in order to correctly line up the latches . I returned this product and purchased a different case . I was very disappointed as Samsonite usually has great cases .
 I bought one Feb 2011 and have to send it in for warranty service less then a year later . To be fair , the unit looks great when you first get it . Once I started to use it the problems came up .1 -RRB- From day one the unit opened on any combination code . It just opens easier on the code you set . Why have a combination . I should have sent it back for this reason alone when I first got it but I already disposed of my old one and decided to live with the lax security .2 -RRB- The leather around the handle has completely worn away .3 -RRB- As of the writing of this review , one of the latches snapped in half.I 'll be sure to update this review after I experience the warranty procedure .
 I purchased this briefcase mainly due to the Samsonite brand name expecting the quality that this brand stood for in the past . Unfortunately , I was very unimpressed with this briefcase . It has no metal piano-type hinge to hold the top and bottom portions together , having just a leather flap which was totally insufficient . Some of the interior covering also came completely off of the wood structure . My previous briefcase lasted over 15 years and this one did not last 15 days .
 My wife found this product on Amazon , and it seemed the perfect costume for my daughter 's 5 y.o b.day . Shipping was fast , then came the big day . We did n't expect the highest quality , but at least something that would last maybe 10-20 uses ... unfortunately within half an hour of use -LRB- my daughter is a very girly-type ... no rough play at all -RRB- , the metallic blue in the skirt started rubbing off . Then the same with the cape . By the end of the evening , the costume was ragged , and unusable . The blue and red sheen on the skirt and cape had worn off in big patches.I emailed the company at their website -LSB- ... -RSB- not once but 3 times now . No response . I 'm frustrated more at the lack of response from the company than the costume itself . I realize sometimes your just going to get a cheap `` made in China '' product , but to dodge accountability for you product is unsatisfactory .
 This costume was so cute and looked wonderful , BUT the shiny blue on the skirt started wearing off instantly . A slight touch scraped off the blue to reveal a dusty gray color . I checked other of the same costume and all of them did the same thing . Good costume for a short time , one day only . Not something that will last .
 I went out of my way to pay more for these thinking I 'd get a better product . My gloves were shipped in a plastic sleeve in a cardboard envelope . The envelope got soaked en route and was quite damp and flexible like wet cardboard is when it was delivered . So the gloves got wet too . The plastic sleeve they were in was open on one end so it was no protection . The gloves must have been wet for days because they had a strong mildew smell when they arrived . I emailed the seller ; asking how they recommend to get the smell out and THEY NEVER RESPONDED . The gloves still smell of mildew too . I guess that will never come out . So much for spending $ 90 . I would never buy from this seller again.Had they not been wet and smelly , they 'd only be marginally better . The leather is nice but the stitching is weak on the left glove and pulling when I put them on . Also , there is n't as much fur in the fingers as I expected for the price . In short , not recommended .
 Made of feathers . Does n't look like a flower , not sure what it looks like . If it would n't be more trouble than its worth , I 'd return it .

 This umbrella looks great but given a good gust - folds like a little paper in front of a freight train . It says it 's wind proof but the 2nd time I took it out last winter , it folded through and bent the shaft !! It 's no better than a 5 $ hunka junk you get at the pharmacy.Save your money and look elsewhere .

 For the price , the quality was very poor . I was extremely disappointed and would not buy another or recommend this product to anyone .
 The amount of money paid for the item was far past it 's worth . The material was very thin . I expected thick luxurious material as it looked on the advertsiment and instead I received something that could have been purchased at the local kmart . Very disappointing .
 the quality of the fabric is extreamly poor , it hasshoddy stiching . The style looks like something a grandmother would wear with foam curlers and cold cream .
 The fabric is too flimsy , you can see right through the gown . Perhaps someone would want that in a gown , I did not . Not worth the price .
 Returned this nightgown because it did not look like the picture . It is shown with a cap sleeve , but it is sleeveless .
 I 'm the 42 year old son of a 1x mother and I 'm a little embarassed to give her a sheer gown for Christmas . The write up did n't say sheer and the pictures do n't depict this as being sheer or see through . I confess , I tried it on for my wife to see how revealing it truly is and in the right light it 's revealing . I like the style , quality and color -LRB- although it is n't my style -RRB- . I would have given this 5 stars if not for the sheerness .
 The gown in the picture is not what you will receive . I was so excited to get this for Christmas and was very disappointed . The gown I received was sleeveless and the top part was completely see through sine it was completely lace . Unfortunately I could n't wear it and tried to find a way to return it but no paperwork was in the box . I will never order from this company again .

 First I was very exited when the bag arrived . It was very cute . However after carrying the bag for about a week with my schoolbooks enclosed , the straps began to tear away from the bag leaving holes where the straps connect to the bag . This was very disappointing since the reviews suggested that the bag could withstand a reasonable amount of weight . I would not recommend this for someone who plans to carry anything heavy !

 I bought these expecting a decent pair of sunglasses , I have a Fossil watch so I am familiar with the quality of their brand . I am very careful with my sunglasses to avoid damage . After approx . 2 months of use one of the arms snapped . I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement pair under warranty . Things were mostly OK after that -- the screw in one of the hinges worked itself loose causing the arm to fall off -LRB- easy to fix though I should n't have to -RRB- , and part of the frame chipped somehow . Then shortly after the warranty expired the arm snapped again . Perhaps I just had bad luck , but I wo n't buy Fossil brand sunglasses again .
 Did n't like the feel . Too small for my big head . Gave it to my kid .
 I rate a one star because the jeans , my son likes , BUT the rivets on the back pockets have ruined my dining room chairs and my leather recliner AND my car 's leather seats !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thought anyone who plans on buying them should be AWARE !!!
 One pair of pants had an ink stain on the back of the leg . I did n't notice it until after I had put them through the wash so I could not return themVery disappointed !
 After three weeks of wearing the pants broke down . Not recommended to anyone , the material it 's very weak . thank you
 I always felt that Lee was a good manufacture of men 's pants . However after buying four or five pairs of these pants my opinion has greatly changed . I have found the material to disintegrate especially in the crotch area , in some cases in as little as two days of wear . This is not just the seams comming apart but the material itself pulling apart reducing it to threads . I did have one pair last almost a year but that was the exception . Another problem is that the size I ordered in one case was not the size stated . It indicated the correct size on the tag but the pants themselves were at least one size too small . I need a large size waist and the reason I tried over and over to make these pants work was they were reasonably priced and available in larger sizes . However I will not waste my money further . I have no problem with Amazon in general , I have always been happy with their service , it 's just that this particular product is nothing better than junk . I gave it a one star rating but if it were possible I would give it a negative star rating.In summary DO NOT buy these pants . Even if you have to spend more , in the long run you will probably be saving money . I found another brand of pants on Amazon that I am trying out and hopefully they will be fine .
 their 34 34 was not . They are more like a 33 33 . Liked the color but they are definately going back .
 It 's cut fine , but the material is scratchy and would probably grab a lot of lint . Perhaps , a really good wash and fabric softener would help , but I did n't want to risk it and make it non-returnable . I returned it right away .
 These pants are very comfortable and water just rolls off of the surface . However , after only a month of use , I got a giant rip in the groin . It 's not even on the seem ! The seem itself is fraying though . All I do at work is wash dishes and drive around on deliveries . This should not have happened .
 If you 're looking for trousers remotely stylish , these are not your pants . Block looking , machine made , rough fabric , and pretty darn ordinary.If you 're looking for a great pair of pants , I just bought `` Louis Raphael '' recently at Belks . I 've seen other Louis Raphael pants at other stores like Macy 's and they are incredible . Well made , interior linings , soft fabrics , much more stylish , and deep pockets . And cheaper than these .
 Bought 2 from Kohls . Did n't last 5 months ... I had better experience with Dockers , Ralph Lauren.I had some bad experience with Haggers . But this one is the worst of it 's kind . Something that you do n't expect from a brand like Lee.I am never going to buy Lee . The durability of the fabric is questionable !
 I ordered these for my husband for work , within two weeks the seams had split . Can not return , will have to sew and patch pants . Next time will spend the money on a higher quality pair . His Dockers have lasted years .
 I ordered black pants , but when they arrived , they were not a true black . More like a dark navy blue , but definitely not black when compared to other black pants I own . But I wore them anyway , until this week when they tore for no reason . They were definitely not too tight , but they just did n't seem to be as high quality as the last pair I had , and the fabric was quite thin . These used to be great pants for everyday business casual wear , but I guess it 's time to change brands .
 I have good experience with Lee casuals through Essential Apparell in the past but something has changed . Orderd the same style as I wear now but the fit is inconsistant ... not sure if I 'll stay with the ` tried and tested ' or look for a new label .
 You 'd think pants designed for big , less face it fat people with fluctuating waists would have more than a thin piece of thread holding a button at the waist to fasten them
 When I received the box from Amazon , pants was smelling like rotten fish , I returned them immediately .
 Obvious too baggy for me.However , the material is good value for the money . . If you like this style , it is worth every penny .
 I bought these pants for my husband less than a month ago , and they have already shrunk TWO INCHES in length , its like I wasted my money . Do NOT buy these pants with your true inseam , they will be too small in a month !
 nice pants but are cut small for a 34 x 30 . i usually wear a 33 or 34 in the waist but these are exceptionally tight . order a size larger .

 Someone told me about Skinny Cami and I 'm loving it . I can go for that layered look and it expanded my wardrobe and I love the fit . Go to their website at -LSB- ... -RSB- and see for yourself . I 'm so happy to find a cami that works for me . I feel like I 've lost 15 lbs when I put it on . I can step into it and feel comfortable all day and I do n't worry about my tummy roll . The Spanx cami was only tolerable for an hour or so . I can wear the skinny cami all day and feel good . I highly recommend it !
 Thank you `` Reesie '' for your posting about the skinnycami -- I googled it to find a great shaper ! Too Late though , I 'd already wasted my money on the Spanx Cami . Do n't like the Spanx Cami.I really like the skinnycami alot beter . And the lady was soo very nice and fun . I 'm going to order a black skinnycami too . Her site is -LSB- ... -RSB-

 I have cashmere lined leather gloves from neiman 's which i love , and wear all the time when i want to be a bit dressy in cold weather . So I was excited to find these for about 30 percent less $ , as they should be for an online source -LRB- I think -RRB- . However I was disappointed because the cashmere is of a poor quality , so they are a bit rough , like regular wool . The leather is good though , so at least they look good ! I have the silk lined from this source as well , and i like them , though they are not for really cold weather .
 These are beautiful gloves , but for $ 80 you would expect the liner to last past 2 winters in North Carolina . My wife does n't use them to shovel , etc. , but the liners need replacing . The leather hardly looks used.We have no idea how to get them re-lined , so I guess they get tossed as they are now uncomfortable to wear.Not a good value .
 I ordered the red gloves thinking they were a ` normal ' red . When they arrived they were very bright , almost orange in color . Just not my style .

 The only good point is1 . -RRB- Good Color -LRB- I bought Brown -RRB- with good quality.But so are other cashmere scarfs certainly not worth more than $ 10 . I bought it for around $ 20 .

 Ordered these socks and they were shown as white . I received them and they were blue !!!! It took many attempts , but I have finally received my full refund -LRB- in no less than 3 installments !!! -RRB- from Amazon . Shipping costs are ridiculous . 2 pairs of socks cost < $ 4 ... shipping cost nearly $ 6 !!! If you are paying for them yourself rather than via a gift voucher , I would shop elsewhere .

 This product emphasized invisible ribs and none in the front . When I got it there were two ribs right in the front and they were not invisible .
 I ordered my normal bra size and found it to be too small through the torso -LRB- I 'm not overweight but I do have a little bit of a tummy -RRB- . I also found this bra to be too short and I got the dreaded end-of-bra bulge at the bottom . I ended up returning the bra and ordering a different bra -- larger size of a style that was longer .
 I purchased these for my mom as she loves this scandinavian style . The lining is very soft though they feel a bit thinner than I expected . They are &#34; one size &#34; which generally means they wo n't fit me as I have long fingers , but these fit me quite well . Each mitten was sewn very differently . One was nice and rounded on the top and the other was sewn with much more of a point on the top . It was very obvious and I had to resew the pointy mitten to match the other before I felt comfortable giving it as a gift . Over all these are cute and soft , but I would not recommend them based on the lack quality for the price .
 Disappointed with hat . In all the pictures that brim is flat . Mine on the left side began to curl immediately . Used leather products to try to have it remain flat , but to no avail . The left side in now almost 90 degrees .
 There are better glasses out there for the price . The ear pieces on this model crumble . This causes the glasses to slip off your face . The warranty wo n't cover the glasses if they slip off your face and break even if it 's due to faulty ear pieces . Buy something else . The `` Life Time Warranty '' does n't exist .

 The item I recieved was not at all the item represented in the photograph.What I received was a short sleeved womans t-shirt .
 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .

 Miss-marked -LRB- small -RRB- Way off on waist . I bought this pair and a pair of linen shorts and the linen was true to size and this on was n't even close .

 I was new to beanies so i got this one and another one with a visor . I would rather go with a dickies beaine because it feels better and is constructed better . Overall shell out a couple more bucks for a dickies beanie but if you cant or rather not then go with this one .
 I still did n't get it !!!! and i suppouse will never get it ! i 'm never gon na shop from this store again ! i 'm very disapointed of you !
 I bought this after reading the positive reviews here . Am disappointed . For the same amount -LRB- just shy of $ 5 -RRB- , I bought a beanie in store @ JCP . That one is way better , fits over my slightly large head and covers my ears well . This one is small , feels thin and barely covers my ears . This is not going to be enough for a mid-western winter . Be warned
 This beanie is thin , cheap , and generic . Do n't wast your money . Was not as long as it appears to be in the photo . mine also had a hole in it
 I bought this because in the Pictures it showed it was long . . When I received it , it was just another small beanie . Just wasted $ 5 on this crap , very disappointed in this product .
 I ordered one LONG-beanie black and when i got it . It was for a little kid or someone with a very super super small head . Do n't buy this unless you are a little kid .
 2 weeks of use and the seam has worn off . I mean , not that i care very much , its a freaking 2 dollar hat , cmon , but uh ... just so you know . And well i didntfind it that long , but again , whatever ... 2 dollar beanie , man .
 Good style but not as advertised . This is polarized but does n't change the shade of color according to the definition of photochromatic like a transition lens .

 The metal money clip -LRB- not the magnetic one that someone else speaks of in their review -RRB- broke on mine after about 2 months . I had a very similar Tommy Hilfiger wallet for about 5 years before the metal spring clip broke.Beware if you plan on using the metal clip .

 i ordered this for my son because the site said ships in 24 hrs . i ordered on dec. 16 it was shipped on dec. 23 and was received on dec. 30 . where i learned to tell time , it would have been shipped on dec. 17 . DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS BEFORE YOU NEED THE PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 I love jockey underwear . I 've bought this brand for years , because of the great fit , the long wear , and the fact that it 's 100 % cotton -LRB- I love natural stuff -RRB- . I bought a pack recently and was dismayed to discover that Jockey has added a very overwhelming `` baby-powder '' scent to the product -LRB- what 's the point of 100 % cotton when you add chemicals to the fabric ? -RRB- . Repeated washings have not removed the smell . I will have to dispose of the underwear . I am extremely allergic to anything perfumed or scented . MAYBE JOCKEY CAN LABEL THEIR PRODUCTS `` SCENTED , '' OR `` UNSCENTED ? '' -LRB- Regular bathing is a better alternative to `` scented '' underwear , anyway . -RRB-
 What is it about companies thinking women want harsh chemicals embedded in their clothing ?? I have worn cotton Jockey underwear for years as I wanted to wear more natural fabrics . I am furious at Jockey as the last 3 pack of underwear I purchased . They have a disgusting acrid chemical smell that does not come out in multiple washings . WHAT ARE YOU JOCKEY EXECUTIVES THINKING ?? How dare you sell us chemical laden undergarments ? I REFUSE to give my money to companies that treat women as idiots .
 This is sad . They are a great fit but are unusable due to the chemical scent that was added . It is a very strong baby powder odor that will not let up even with repeated washings . And whatever it is that makes it smell also irritates skin ... after many washings . So they are alas , unusable . They really should be sold as scented . That way we know what we are buying ... that is only fair .
 I 've loved this product for years . Recently I bought 2 3 packs and what a smell . I 've washed them 5 times in hot water and I still ca n't wear them with out a rash . They are headed to the trash today . What is Jockey thinking ? Chemical filled underwear ???
 For anyone that has been wearing women 's Jockey underwear for more than 5 years has to have noticed the recent drop in quality . The cotton is thinner and the sizing has become skimpy . I recently purchased 2 packs of the Elance Cotton Brief Bikinis and I was shocked at how much the product has changed . What a disappointment . And for you ladies who think the product is so great . . you should have had the opportunity to experience their underwear before they started cutting corners , the quality really was fabulous . Too bad Jockey felt like they had to compromise quality for the bottom line . I would have paid more to get the better product .
 I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time . The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching . Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them ! I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings . Given the cost of panties and other similar products , you 'd think the quality would be decent . However , Jockey is n't the only company out there with a substandard product . I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties , I 'm stuck . I will only pay sale prices .
 I love Jockey underwear . I have been wearing them for 6 or 7 years now . The past year or so I have noticed a horrible smell . As if I was not clean if you get my drift . My self esteem has been low because of this I did not know where this smell was coming from . I thought I had a medical problem . I have tried everything to get the odor out of my clothes . I have recently come to the conclusion that it is my underwear . I have them on for about 5 or 10 minutes before I notice `` the smell '' . By then , it is a pain to go and change them . I now put the smelly ones in a separate drawer from the others . My older ones do not smell as bad or not at all . I am so sorry this has happened because I just love this brand , but , will now have to look elsewhere for my undies . It is sad , because it sounds like Jockey is not `` listening '' to it 's customers .
 I , too , have bought Elance for years , but can not deal with the scent any longer . I complained to Jokey reps in the past , who said they should not be scented , but nothing ever came of it -LRB- this has been going on for several years , now -RRB- . They even sent me a free package , at one point , with the same scent . They speculated that maybe the scent was being used in a particular manufacturing location , when it should n't have been , but the scent is there , regardless of manufacturing location . I should note that this is a strong scent that CAN NOT be washed out easily -- but can take over 10 washings ; the scent also gets on other items in one 's drawer !! We have enough exposure to chemicals in our environment , and do not need additional chemical exposure in underwear -- !! I 'm very disappointed the Jockey 's never responded to complaints by removing the scent .
 I used to love Jockey products ... I have been suffering tremendously with an allergic reaction ... I tried 5 different soap products , rinsing my clothes 4 times , all different types of creams , 3 different gynocologists who all said I was having an allergic reaction ... and suggested those things . All suggested that I should wear cotton ... Jockey was labeled as 100 % combed cotton ... No where does it mention any chemical . Is there a lwayer out there who wants to take on a class action suit ? I have quit wearing their product and am improving . I feel validated thanks to your reviews . But I am angry over pain and suffering and wasted money . Where is the Federal Trade Commission ?
 I have been wearing Jockey for years , but the quality has been going steadily downhill . The cotton is nowhere near as soft or durable as it used to be and the sizing is often hit and miss . Still I kept buying them because it 's hard to find 100 % cotton underwear.But now , this horrible smell is a deal breaker . I will have to find another brand . Besides the odor , it is just not healthy to wear a chemically saturated item of clothing . Your skin absorbs toxins from everything it comes in contact with and at the very least it could cause an allergic skin reaction . Steer clear of these until Jockey addresses this problem .
 I 've been wearing Jockey for Her for years , and the quality is definitely not what it used to be . The fabric is now much thinner -LRB- actually see-though -RRB- -- and the size 5s are smaller in width than my older size 5s -LRB- which I still wear -RRB- . The cut is now more of a brief than a bikini .
 i think these may have been seconds . i 've been wearing jockey for women forever and the quality of these was very poor . the fabric was very thin and the stitching was scratchy.i complained to jockey directly and they sent me replacements which were obviously of much better quality .

It is sad , because it sounds like Jockey is not `` listening '' to it 's customers .
 I , too , have bought Elance for years , but can not deal with the scent any longer . I complained to Jokey reps in the past , who said they should not be scented , but nothing ever came of it -LRB- this has been going on for several years , now -RRB- . They even sent me a free package , at one point , with the same scent . They speculated that maybe the scent was being used in a particular manufacturing location , when it should n't have been , but the scent is there , regardless of manufacturing location . I should note that this is a strong scent that CAN NOT be washed out easily -- but can take over 10 washings ; the scent also gets on other items in one 's drawer !! We have enough exposure to chemicals in our environment , and do not need additional chemical exposure in underwear -- !! I 'm very disappointed the Jockey 's never responded to complaints by removing the scent .
 I used to love Jockey products ... I have been suffering tremendously with an allergic reaction ... I tried 5 different soap products , rinsing my clothes 4 times , all different types of creams , 3 different gynocologists who all said I was having an allergic reaction ... and suggested those things . All suggested that I should wear cotton ... Jockey was labeled as 100 % combed cotton ... No where does it mention any chemical . Is there a lwayer out there who wants to take on a class action suit ? I have quit wearing their product and am improving . I feel validated thanks to your reviews . But I am angry over pain and suffering and wasted money . Where is the Federal Trade Commission ?
 I have been wearing Jockey for years , but the quality has been going steadily downhill . The cotton is nowhere near as soft or durable as it used to be and the sizing is often hit and miss . Still I kept buying them because it 's hard to find 100 % cotton underwear.But now , this horrible smell is a deal breaker . I will have to find another brand . Besides the odor , it is just not healthy to wear a chemically saturated item of clothing . Your skin absorbs toxins from everything it comes in contact with and at the very least it could cause an allergic skin reaction . Steer clear of these until Jockey addresses this problem .
 I 've been wearing Jockey for Her for years , and the quality is definitely not what it used to be . The fabric is now much thinner -LRB- actually see-though -RRB- -- and the size 5s are smaller in width than my older size 5s -LRB- which I still wear -RRB- . The cut is now more of a brief than a bikini .
 i think these may have been seconds . i 've been wearing jockey for women forever and the quality of these was very poor . the fabric was very thin and the stitching was scratchy.i complained to jockey directly and they sent me replacements which were obviously of much better quality .

 I love jockey underwear . I 've bought this brand for years , because of the great fit , the long wear , and the fact that it 's 100 % cotton -LRB- I love natural stuff -RRB- . I bought a pack recently and was dismayed to discover that Jockey has added a very overwhelming `` baby-powder '' scent to the product -LRB- what 's the point of 100 % cotton when you add chemicals to the fabric ? -RRB- . Repeated washings have not removed the smell . I will have to dispose of the underwear . I am extremely allergic to anything perfumed or scented .

 What is it about companies thinking women want harsh chemicals embedded in their clothing ?? I have worn cotton Jockey underwear for years as I wanted to wear more natural fabrics . I am furious at Jockey as the last 3 pack of underwear I purchased . They have a disgusting acrid chemical smell that does not come out in multiple washings . WHAT ARE YOU JOCKEY EXECUTIVES THINKING ?? How dare you sell us chemical laden undergarments ? I REFUSE to give my money to companies that treat women as idiots .
 This is sad . They are a great fit but are unusable due to the chemical scent that was added . It is a very strong baby powder odor that will not let up even with repeated washings . And whatever it is that makes it smell also irritates skin ... after many washings . So they are alas , unusable . They really should be sold as scented . That way we know what we are buying ... that is only fair .
 I 've loved this product for years . Recently I bought 2 3 packs and what a smell . I 've washed them 5 times in hot water and I still ca n't wear them with out a rash . They are headed to the trash today . What is Jockey thinking ? Chemical filled underwear ???
 For anyone that has been wearing women 's Jockey underwear for more than 5 years has to have noticed the recent drop in quality . The cotton is thinner and the sizing has become skimpy . I recently purchased 2 packs of the Elance Cotton Brief Bikinis and I was shocked at how much the product has changed . What a disappointment . And for you ladies who think the product is so great . . you should have had the opportunity to experience their underwear before they started cutting corners , the quality really was fabulous . Too bad Jockey felt like they had to compromise quality for the bottom line . I would have paid more to get the better product .
 I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time . The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching . Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them ! I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings . Given the cost of panties and other similar products , you 'd think the quality would be decent . However , Jockey is n't the only company out there with a substandard product . I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties , I 'm stuck . I will only pay sale prices .
 I love Jockey underwear . I have been wearing them for 6 or 7 years now . The past year or so I have noticed a horrible smell . As if I was not clean if you get my drift . My self esteem has been low because of this I did not know where this smell was coming from . I thought I had a medical problem . I have tried everything to get the odor out of my clothes . I have recently come to the conclusion that it is my underwear . I have them on for about 5 or 10 minutes before I notice `` the smell '' . By then , it is a pain to go and change them . I now put the smelly ones in a separate drawer from the others . My older ones do not smell as bad or not at all .

 I had a event to attend and needed a 50 's top . I found a poodle top and had it shipped over night.That was Thursday and my event was Saturday . I paid $ 37.00 to get it shipped over night and it did not get here until Tuesday afternoon . I am very unhappy . If you ca n't get it here do n't have overnite as an option.Mary McMahon
 Poor Quality . Poodle did not look like a poodle , fabric very poor quality cotton and was styled as a bowling shirt . No problem with return and money was promptly refunded .
 I was really dissapointed with this purchase . There is no conversion table for measurements so I ordered a 2X and the shirt came in the size of a blanket -- so order small . The shipping was really expensive and I ended up having to get a refund because it costs over $ 20 in shipping to get a exchange since you -LRB- the customer -RRB- has to pay for all shipping . I was not happy because I ended up spending $ 14 on shipping for nothing -- by the time the company got the shirt back and called me for my credit card number for more shipping to send a smaller size , I was already tired of dealing with the high shipping . It is better to order the individual poodle patches from their site and hot glue them to a black shirt -- it is not worth the $ 40 buying the shirt online if you have to anticipate your size because there is not clear measurement table online .

 This bra looks pretty but makes a total madonna cone look . It 's comfy , just not great looking . I love playtex bras but not this one . Also , the toffee color is actually peach , go figure . Makes a nice sleeping bra !
 I am unable to purchase the same style bras that I got last year and I 've tried looking at other web sites and department stores.I have tried 3 other styles which do not fit well , have cheap stretch straps or very uncomfortable material to edge straps and front which cause itching and redness from rubbing .
 My teenage daughter was thrilled with her tshirt . I was pleased with the speed of delivery .
 I got this thing today what A Mess , when taking this out of the plastic the hair just started falling out , I noticed in some spots the hair was falling out . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS UGLY MATTED JUNK !!!!
 We did not use it at all
 Cheaper than I could have anticipated . It came out of the package with chunks of hair falling out . It 's also way redder than the picture , even in person the colors on the package and the actual wig are wildly different . Returned and got a refund .
 I got this wig for a Halloween party . It was pretty cheap and shipped real fast . It was tangled and weird when I opened it , so I tried to comb it out , but the hair falls out if you comb , so I stopped . It never looked OK after putting it on , in places there was no hair , and other places there was too much . Also it 's too small and kept sliding off my head the whole time . All in all it was OK for the price . It 's in the garbage now ... could n't wear it a second time .
 Needed a leather card holder / front pocket wallet.Only reason I bought this one was the the price and the overwhelming number of positive reviews it got . What came in the mail matched what was in the picture alright ... To put my disappointment mildly , calling this wallet genuine leather is like calling Charlie Sheen a role model . If I could give this Zero stars I would.Shopped around amazon a bit more and found this : Saddleback Leather Wallet Small
 This item is emblazoned with `` genuine leather '' but I doubt it 's actually leather . The material is about a half millimeter thick and gets its stiffness from a plastic or paper backing . The surface is simply folded over the edges of the pockets and inside of a week started to separate . Leather ca n't be made this thin so I think this is a faux leather-like synthetic.The product was inexpensive enough to toss but at least do n't advertise it as genuine leather when it 's really doubtful it actually is . I 'll keep shopping elsewhere .
 1 . Not sure if it is actually a leather , and even is , it has a terrible quality .2 . This thing is filled with a paper between `` leather '' layers .3 . Glue is all over the place4 . It has some white weird circle dirt on top5 . It just feels bad , I do n't even want to hold it with my handsThe maximum price for this `` leather '' card holder is about 1 dollarIn summary this thing is going right to the trash bag .
 Try the same product from saddleback leather company . Sure it 's $ 29 , but it 'll be the last one you ever buy .
 good - the size is perfect . Bad - the stitches came out after three weeks of light use . Ugly - well it 's not ugly , smells good , for tem bucks I am satisfied but not impressed
 First , this wallet is falling apart after virtually no use . Every time I pull out one of my cards , a leather flap pops out -LRB- see product photo that I uploaded -RRB- . Also , I was shipped a black leather wallet -LRB- not dark brown -- black , and definitely different than the picture on the product page -RRB- despite ordering a brown one , and they do n't even offer black wallets on this product page -LRB- at least , not as I write this.Based on the many positive reviews , perhaps I just had bad luck , but at the very least it looks like quality control for these wallets sucks .
 I bought this wallet specifically for my Army Temporary Duty -LRB- TDY -RRB- trips . It did n't survive even one such trip . The stitching began to unravel after about a week of normal carrying , and by the end of a 14 day trip , the cardboard backing had become visibly exposed , then frayed , , and finally torn , which made placing just a few bills in the center pocket a tedious chore . On this trip I wore mostly civilian attire , so I carried the wallet in the front pocket of my slacks or jeans . It was never overfilled , never got wet , or was ever utilized in any way outside the scope of its intended purpose . My ID , 2 credit cards , and some local currency were the only items I ever carried in it until the stitching came entirely undone , after which time I carried all of my wallet items in a ziplock bag -LRB- the bag is still intact , by the way -RRB- . I 'm a firm believer in first impressions and can honestly say that this product left me decidedly UN-impressed . I would not advise purchasing this particular wallet .
 My driving license barely made it in and almost never made it out . Maybe with time it becomes more flexible but I did n't like it or find it comfortable .
 This robe will work for a small child . NOT FOR ADULTS . Probably can only be worn once . I put it on and it ripped under the bust as I pulled it down .
 The wig was true to color , but it tangled so quickly and was not brushable . Had to throw it out after a couple of wears .
 I bought this bra in a pinch on a trip to the in-laws . I thought I could use it as a sleeping bra , hahaha . I bought the size I have been measured . It lifts great but the seem over the nipples itches.It made them poke out like a Madonna video . Are you kidding ? I did n't know they still made bras like this . My husband asked was I going to leave the bedroom like that with the material protruding out like missiles ? The cost of the bra w/o tax was $ 20.50 , ca n't Playtex make a more flattering bra for this price . I believed they used the same stitch pattern from the 20 's . . I do n't think they used female fit models .
 Rolls up in the front and pulls up in the back so that I have to keep pulling it down . Also , the shoulder straps sit too wide on my shoulders and keep falling . When will bra makers realize that `` full figure '' DOES NOT mean the woman has the shoulders of a linebacker ? This bra is irritating .
 I was looking for good support that also provided a nice shape , so I ordered the Playtex Women 's 18 Hour Airform Comfort Lace Bra . Unfortunately , this bra did n't stretch to my shape nor provide a nice bust shape . It was too tight around my rib cage -LRB- I was expecting it to stretch more -RRB- and forced my breasts into a strange pointy shape , flattening them across the top and mashing me down in the middle . I did n't need a minimizer bra , but it would be great for that purpose . I cut off the non-stretchable lace on the front surface , leaving only the stretchable material underneath and it was tolerable that way , but I would not order it again .
 The name of this bra is a contradiction . Not comfortable , gave me an extra breast and made them sag .
 I had to return this bra because it was so small that I could barely get it on . The straps were adjustable but very inflexible . It 's also very stiff and non-stretchy . I was looking for something really comfortable and this definitely was n't for me .
 The last time I was at my mom 's she had just bought one of these . It looked very comfortable and pretty so I ordered one in my size . I wear a 34D in other brands , but Playtex does n't carry that size , so I buy a 36D and wear it on the tightest hooks . This band seems to run small , the 36 fit me like a 34 in other brands , I could wear it on the last hooks . The cups , on the other hand , run big . The foam lining also makes them a little stiff and pointy , so under a t-shirt it looked like my breasts were aiming off to each side , really not flattering ! A very odd fit , which is too bad because it seems like a comfortable bra .
 this one ok so far ... last one the hook in the back came out of bra and twisted . . so ca n't wear bra . .
 The sizing on these is way off . Not even close . They run large , compared with other Playtex bras . I think I even went a size or too smaller than usual , after reading other reviews , and they were still too big -LRB- & super pointy ! yuk -RRB- . Do yourself a favor & try these in a store first . Thank you Amazon for free shipping & return on this product ! Make sure if you DO order this , that you choose one with the free return policy , because you 're going to need it !
 I had to return , the lace was bothering to me and the cup size was more Madonna and me ... Amazon was great , quick return and I bought another 18 hour smooth which I love .
 I bought several bras recently to accommodate my growing body -LRB- I 'm 5 months pregnant -RRB- . I 'm usually a strict Victoria 's Secret shopper but did n't want to spend a fortune for `` maternity '' periods . This bra was a disappointment . It 's bigger than the Playtex bras I 've bought in the same size . It 's MASSIVE so I have to be careful what I wear over it as you may see some of the massive panel/cup , and it 's just plain uncomfortable . The band at the bottom cuts into my skin and starts to fold over and bend . Maybe I 'm just too used to wearing underwire that I ca n't handle the method of `` support '' of non-underwire bras . Either way , I would n't recommend this one . Go with the Playtex Women 's Side Smoothing Underwire Bra or the Playtex Women 's 18 Hour Active Lifestyle ... those are much more comfortable .
 This bra looks comfortable in the catalog . It is not ! The cups are like cardboard , and the sides do n't stretch . I would never buy another one .
 Cups too large . Fabric is too stiff and upper part creeps too far into the armpit , making it not too comfy . The support is okay even w/o a wire , but the other issues negate that fact . Also , it does NOT put your pair into the best shape/silhouette for under clothing . I 'd skip this bra but if you must , I 'd suggest ordering your normal band size but 1 cup smaller . And then I 'd only wear it for around the house , not under clothes .
 My bra is a C cup , I am a D cup -LRB- I buy smaller to hold em in better -RRB- , and the cup of this bra is too big for some reason .
 The bra is really pretty but the fit is not right . The cup size is larger than normal and the placement of the cups are too close together .
 I can usually find something good to say about most products , but not this bra . I ordered my regular size , and the fit is way off . The band is too tight , the cups are too large . Not only are they large , but they 're too pointy . I 'm not a fan of cone-shaped boobs that stick out in opposite directions . If you decide to order this , I would consider going up a band size and down a cup size . Then again , I just would n't order it .
 This bra is itchy in between the breasts and underneath . It also looks like a fifties torpedo bra . I feel uncomfortable and self conscious when I wear it and I doubt that I 'll ever buy a Platex bra again .
 I received this bra and was very disappointed . The fit is awful , the seam that crosses the cup does n't lay correctly and it 's just ugly on your body.Generally I like playtex bras for everyday wear , but this one is just awful .
 These are disappointing . The cotton material is fairly comfortable . They are sized extremely generously , and even after shrinking in the wash they are still loose . I would recommend buying a size smaller than normal if you like a close fit.After three washings however the collar is already curling . I 'd put the overall quality at average , which makes the price overly steep and not worth it.I 'll be going back to 5.11 undershirts at a much higher price , and using these as sleeping shirts .
 Unfortunately , the fit was all wrong for me . The quality is good , but it was uncomfortable to wear .
 I had a event to attend and needed a 50 's top . I found a poodle top and had it shipped over night.That was Thursday and my event was Saturday . I paid $ 37.00 to get it shipped over night and it did not get here until Tuesday afternoon . I am very unhappy . If you ca n't get it here do n't have overnite as an option.Mary McMahon
 Poor Quality . Poodle did not look like a poodle , fabric very poor quality cotton and was styled as a bowling shirt . No problem with return and money was promptly refunded .
 I was really dissapointed with this purchase . There is no conversion table for measurements so I ordered a 2X and the shirt came in the size of a blanket -- so order small . The shipping was really expensive and I ended up having to get a refund because it costs over $ 20 in shipping to get a exchange since you -LRB- the customer -RRB- has to pay for all shipping .

 I had a event to attend and needed a 50 's top . I found a poodle top and had it shipped over night.That was Thursday and my event was Saturday . I paid $ 37.00 to get it shipped over night and it did not get here until Tuesday afternoon . I am very unhappy . If you ca n't get it here do n't have overnite as an option.Mary McMahon
 Poor Quality . Poodle did not look like a poodle , fabric very poor quality cotton and was styled as a bowling shirt . No problem with return and money was promptly refunded .
 I was really dissapointed with this purchase . There is no conversion table for measurements so I ordered a 2X and the shirt came in the size of a blanket -- so order small . The shipping was really expensive and I ended up having to get a refund because it costs over $ 20 in shipping to get a exchange since you -LRB- the customer -RRB- has to pay for all shipping .

 I read other reviews for this product and felt pretty good about ordering it . Service was great , no problems at all with the vendor . I followed the instructions to try it on over something else in case it needed to be returned and it fit fine in terms of size . But in actual use it was very disappointing and did not hide as I hoped it would . It may work for others based on their reviews but it does n't make things disappear for me .

 This runs super super small . My dd barely fit in it and she is a skinny 5 yr old . Fits like a Toddler sz 3/4 not for girl over 35 pounds . We were really disappointed with quality for the price . She was also mad that she could not dress herself in this cause she loves to do things independently now for dress up or fantasy play . It is like the cheapie Kmart type of custome quality . It has a velcro strip closure for the back of dress , waist is fitted and fabric cut in so not much give there . The Wings can be seperated from the outfit , they are also secured with vecro strip to the back of outfit so you could take them on and off easily . The velcro can snag the tulle skirt of the dress when taking on and off so be careful if you want this nice for pictures , take them right away :-RRB- this one gets low marks on quality , sizing , & ease of use -LRB- child wo n't be able to dress themselves in this for play -RRB- .
 I bought this for my sons 6 month pictures . I read the other reviews that it runs small so I got a 12 month size for my son who is 22lbs . It was n't right . Too small in someareas and too big in others . The shirt was so thin and did n't tuck into the pants and the sleaves were too long . He was so uncomfortable we had to take it off and use a white onesie . The pants fit the suspenders barely fit almost too small . The hat was a little too big and a disappointment as it was floppy with no firm brim . The clip on tie was a joke that did n't stay on for a second . Over all we were able to get a few pictures but I was hoping for something just a little better . If he were supposed to wear this for a whole day ot would never have worked out . The over all outfit seemedlike it was sewn for dollclothing not human baby clothes . I would n't buy this again .
 This outfit was perfect . My 17 month old son was a ring bearer in my sister-in-law 's wedding and this outfit was so cute . Per other reviews , I did order a size larger and the fit was good . My son is in the 50th percentile for weight and height , so I do recommend ordering a size up . My issue is with the suspenders . The clasps did not stay in place . The clasp for the back broke within the hour he had the outfit on before the wedding and as he moved around the other clasps would come undone . We had to use safety pins to keep them in place until the wedding was over . No one was any the wiser , but imagine trying to put safety pins on a very active , rambunctious 17 month old boy . Not fun .
 Disappointing purchase . Cheap fabric , threads sticking out all over suggest shoddy construction . Suspenders have gold thread -LRB- which is not apparent in the online photo -RRB- - they look feminine and tacky . Brim of hat has no support sewn into it , so it 's very flimsy . Neither the hat nor the pants are lined and the fabric is very thin . I do n't expect this outfit to withstand more than one laundering . I agree with the comments re : sizing . I ordered a size 3T , which should fit my son who is wearing 24-mo . to 2T . If you like the style of this outfit , you 'd be better off buying a good pair of trousers that fit your baby or child and have them tailored into knickers . I bought a nicer quality newsboy cap recently at Gymboree , but I 've seen them in other retail stores , too .
 I received the outfit just as pictured very pleased with shipment but the hat -LRB- which makes the outfit -RRB- had a small hole at top of the brim . Emailed Customer Service they said to send back the hat back which I did immediately . Emailed Customer service to be sure they received it they emailed back they did receive the hat , that was 2 weeks ago . No Hat , No Emails , No Customer Service , Now I have a $ 50.00 outfit without the Main portion the HAT ... If they do n't have it and have to order it or maybe never get a new one they should let me know , not just avoid my emails ... I wanted this for his 6 month picture which is in September ... Too bad for me .
 The sizes on this outfit really do run quite small . We had a wedding to go to and wanted our little guy to look cute . The outfit was on him , a little snug , but our son is in the 95 percentile for height so we are accustomed to things not quite fitting -LRB- we typically leave a button or two undone or something -RRB- . This outfit seemed fine while I had my son laying on his back and all buttoned up . But when I picked him up he started turning red in the face and could n't breathe . I ripped the clip on bow-tie off immediately and he immediately gasped a huge breath and started crying . Of course I felt awful for forcing the outfit on ... I layed him down to start taking the outfit off when he pealed into another scream ... the suspenders had come lose in back and the metal had dug into his skin -LRB- even through the shirt -RRB- . I should have bought the 9 month size for my 3 month old !! I felt aweful and my poor son felt worse .
 No doubt , the outfit is adorable . However , it is absolutely the worst quality of any clothing I have EVER purchased . I purchased this for my son to wear to Christmas Eve services . I waited to put it on him until we were ready to walk out the door to church . No joke , the child had the outfit on for only 20 minutes when the suspenders broke -LRB- which were made of an embroidered RIBBON ! -RRB- . His bow tie followed immediately after . The had had no elastic , so it would n't stay on him . 15 minutes into services , I had a child who was half dressed -LRB- he was being held , not playing around on the floor -RRB- . It looked great on him , and when I purchased it , I planned on using it for his 1-year picture session , but it 's destroyed now . I would NOT recommend this one unless you only need it to last for 15 minutes . Pure junk.NO problems with the delivery or packaging from the seller , I ca n't comment on whether they will accept a return , but I intend to find out .

 I have a lot of base layer stuff as I commute daily year-round on my bicycle . I got the underarmor as a gift so I put it in the rotation . I found that while it is good enough for against the skin comfort it does n't breathe as well as the wool garments I use . Also , it does a terrible job with odor control . I ca n't wear this more than once before it needs some cleaning whereas the wool will go as long as I care to -LRB- I mean forever -RRB- .
 Believing that i need protection from the elements of winter and having explored this garment -LRB- albeit a cursory exploration -RRB- at Dick 's Sporting Goods , i ordered this garment from Amazon.com.When this somewhat expensive purchase arrived , i tried it out . The sleeves are too long and it is difficult to put on and to take off . I would not order or buy it again .
 I 'm fairly new to masks so I may have bought the wrong ones . I do n't know . These do not keep smoke out at all!It 's also extremely uncomfortable . I bought a large because I have a medium sized mask that is slightly small . This `` Large '' mask was smaller than my medium one and digs into the bridge of my nose!If anyone can recommend a good comfortable mask to keep gases and smoke out I would appreciate it tons ! : -RRB-
 I am very disappointed with the lack of quality for the advertized &#34; velvet &#34; of Mrs. Claus 's costume . The price was rather steep compared to other costumes so I attributed that to the quality of the fabric , velvet . I was not pleased that the quality of this fabric was inferior . It 's not the shiny , soft to the touch velvet . It is more like a stiff , cheap fabric used for outdoor red Christmas bows . The lace was also inferior and the sewing of the apron was as well.Totally unsatisfied with this purchase .
 Not a great aviators kit bag . Seams and zippers were broken out of the bag . not as good as the issued ones from the military . Better off going to an army navy store and buying a used one , or buying this one knowing you will need to have it reinforced
 These pants are nothing more than long , baggy shorts , perfect for the `` sagging '' look and a drive by .
 supporting legs are much shorter than wheels . Does n't hold balance even when it is empty . impossible to use . would not recommend
 This seller is a distributor with Ardyss International and as such is most likely violating the terms and conditions of their resellers agreement . This company operates under a network marketing umbrella and they specialize in customizing your order . If you are purchasing your product as this ridiculously low price then you are taking a huge risk . The Body Magic and other body reshapers go for as high as $ 180 and they are worth it . The reports show that this seller has a reputation of not delivering the product and not returning phone calls . If you want to lose your money , then by all means , continue to support their business -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- . However , when you purchase with a real Ardyss Advisor , you will be walked through a thorough measuring to ensure you get the proper size -LRB- not all Ardyss Advisors have been properly trained . . think ` Mary Kay ' beginner consultant -RRB- . The company does not do returns so it 's vital that you have someone measure you properly . In addition , you want to ensure that you are getting a full needs analysis from your advisor since the body magic and other reshaping garments are extremely customizable and it 's not as simple as adding 20 to the size you wear . There are other considerations like hip size and the softness of your stomach tissue -LRB- for redistribution purposes -RRB- . I have worked with a highly reputable advisor in the Atlanta area and she will take your measurements over the phone . She is patient , thorough and truly knowledgeable about the 2 step process . She even gives you 50 % off of your first order . Be very wary of the online sellers because they are in most cases just looking to make a certain amount of production each month to maintain their status in Ardyss and this is an extremely unethical way to go about doing it . You are shortchanged and the company receives a bad reputation . -LSB- ... -RSB- She should be able to help out or find someone in your local city

 If you are bigger chested , these things do not work at all ! no way do they hold you up or anything remotely close to be up . mise well wear nothing at all . Do n't waste your money .

 We returned these because they were incredibly small . Also , the fabric was not nice and soft like I had thought it would be . They washed terribly and the overall construction was poor . Our Target-bought onesies are a million times better than these , you just have to remember to stock up on the sleeveless ones in the summer because you ca n't get them any other time of the year and they are nice to put under jammies and tops .
 Not true to size , after few washes fabric does n't stay nice . Shrunk in the dryer.First couple of wears were nice .
 These have such an odd fit ... maybe it is because my baby is long and lean but these are very wide and I ride up . I would n't buy these again .

 After washing I was unable to wear - had to throw away . So tight could n't stand . Totally useless .
 didnt fit , didnt realize i could not return to macys -LRB- even though it came from them -RRB- , return charges were almost as much as it cost , so now its in the trash ... no more ordering from a 2rd party vendor with weird rules . .
 The neck hole of this product opens up when the toddler moves around - so much so that the entire onesie falls down around the child 's chest . Gerber makes a superior product . Do not buy this .
 The snaps on all three of the onesies that we received do no stay snapped . A onesie is not very useful with defective snaps . Quality control appears to be lacking on this product . I would advise for others to look into other brands .
 I love how soft the fabric is on these onesies . But , I wo n't be buying them again for a few reasons
 cotton stretches out and does n't regain shape . Might be good for a rolly , polly baby but not good if you child is long and lean . Width is too big and length is too small .
 We returned these because the material was n't soft , the construction was poor , and the size was WAY off . I do n't recommend , at all .
 The shape was fine for my wide baby but the snaps would not stay snapped making these useless for me to use .
 Unlike other reviewers say , I found these onesies to be a terrible fit . They are short and wide . I bought the 12 month size for my average-to-short 11 month old and they were a tight fit length-wise . They are so wide , however , they they fall off my baby 's shoulders . I 'm going back to Carters .
 Probly the worst set of `` bodysuits '' that Ive bought so far . Horrible fit , they stretch , and dont wash well . Just spend the extra money and get Carters
 I bought these in a 24 month size . They seem like they are made for a disproportionate kid who is very round and very short . And , to top it off the neck is so wide it will barely stay on my child 's shoulders . I do n't use them unless I 'm in a pinch with no other clean ones .
 Very disappointed . These looked nice , but after an initial pre-wear wash and dry -LRB- cold water , medium heat -RRB- , these shrunk a TON . As in about 2 inches shorter than a 12 month Carter 's onesie . I do n't think these will even snap on her now . I might be able to still use them as a sleep shirt if I just cut the crotch portion off at the bottom , but I 'm annoyed . Also , the reviewers who mentioned the very large neck were right . Would not buy these again.It 's SO hard to find 12 + month onesies ! If you 're looking for smaller sizes in plain colors , I HIGHLY recommend the Disney Cuddly Bodysuits . I just wish they came in bigger sizes !
 These bodysuits fit terribly around the neck ! The neck opening is HUGE -LRB- my husband likens it to the `` bacon neck '' depicted in Hanes commercials -RRB- . Worst fit I have seen in a onesie / bodysuit yet . Returned them immediately .
 These are very soft would have loved them however the neck opening is very large and will not stay on I am constantly pulling back around her neck they are also very wide all around ... I prefer the Carter 's
 I 've washed these more times than I can remember , soaked them in vinegar for days -LRB- literally -RRB- , then rewashed them . They still have a chemical smell . I 'm not sure what 's going on . I had previously purchased some long-sleeve body suites from the same company , which did n't have this smell . I do not like putting something on my baby that smells so strongly of the chemicals used to process the fabric . If I can not get the smell out , I 'll have to donate them to Goodwill and hope that their laundering is more effective than mine . Other than the smell , the quality of the fabric seems good .
 I read many reviews and did my research before I purchased these . I read that the sizing was a little off , so I ordered a size larger . My daughter only weights 19 pounds and usually wears a 12 month onsie . I purchased these 18 month size . They barely fit . They are WAY too short . They barely fit her now , but they definately wont fit her when she is 13 months old .
 Material feels great ! That 's it . The neck line droops way low which causes the shoulders to be all off and the tag is quite long and annoying .
 My 4 month old is 90 % in height , he ca n't fit into the 12 month size with this brand , which is much shorter and wider than other brands . Very disappointed as i ca n't return these since they were washed already not knowing they would n't fit .
 Sure these are soft , but most cotton is . The neck is huge , and the shoulders do not sit well on my son 's shoulders . He looks like a baby linebacker when he wears it . Also , the white is an odd shade . It almost has a blue undertone to it , and does not match the other white items in his wardrobe .
 I have no idea of what happened with these pantyhose , but my impression is that the store had a bunch with some defects and had to take rid of them . Anyway , I bought a dozen or so , and most of them came with holes or runs . It is the first time this happens to me with this brand and specific kind of pantyhose . Too bad . .
 It is not reflection style . I am looking for something shining and have silk reflection effect pantyhose . But it is not right one .
 I was really looking forward to these pantyhose . They looked beautiful in the package , they are lovely and very sheer . The lace top with cotton gusset was also great . The problems began when I put them on . I usually wear stockings , so I own hosiery gloves . Because these are pantyhose , for some reason I did n't think to wear the gloves . I definitely should have . They ripped as soon as I stepped into them . When I tried to pull them all the way on , even the lace top of the pantyhose ripped . I do n't mean a RUN , they actually ripped ! I was pretty disappointed . Not sure if they ripped because of the sheerness , or because I did n't wear hosiery gloves . I 'd love to know if anyone else has had a similar experience .
 I purchased 5 pairs of panty hose from Hanes on line because I could not find the Hi-Cuts anywhere in local stores . I 've worn two pairs so far and immediately while putting them on they ran -LRB- one was for my wedding -RRB- . They seem less quality than I have been able to buy in stores -LRB- when I could find them -RRB- , and not worth the price I paid .
 This bag is well made , and includes strong handles , and attachment ringsfor a shoulder strap ... but the shoulder strap is not supplied.Sort of like selling an egg with-out the shell.For the cost , there should be one supplied.All my horn cases have straps for a good reason , so should this music bag.Bummer ...

My daughter only weights 19 pounds and usually wears a 12 month onsie . I purchased these 18 month size . They barely fit . They are WAY too short . They barely fit her now , but they definately wont fit her when she is 13 months old .
 Material feels great ! That 's it . The neck line droops way low which causes the shoulders to be all off and the tag is quite long and annoying .
 My daughter has wanted this hair streaker for 2 years , she got this as a Christmas gift and it was a BIG disappointment!The hair wand is very cheap it is hard to open and close , you have to squeeze the goopy hair dye from the tube onto a TINY sponge in the wand.Don ' t put too much on because then it gets all over the wand.The dye does not dry we had blue dye everywhere ... It was all over her clothing , face and hands , carpet and it does not come out !!! Do n't waste your money , this is a poor design !
 This was the thinnest coat I 've ever seen . Plus the sizing chart on the website is wrong . I ordered my husband a 38 and it was too tight . Yet I found another one for him in JC Penney of the same size and it fits perfectly . This coat is a you get what you paid for item . Cheap in price and cheaply made . And when you return it , they do n't return all your money . Horrible . The worst purchase ever from Amazon .
 If you buy this item or plan on buying it , make sure you see how it 's unhooked before you nurse . I just snapped it apart without looking at what I was doing and now I ca n't figure out how to get it back together . Plus the top straps that stay put when you unhook it do n't fit right .
 What I look for in a wallet is this
 Shorts seemed OK initially , but on the 2nd wearing the zipper pull tab fell off . Unfortunately for me , I did n't get around to wearing them until just outside the return window .
 I purchases 6 items for my first Amazon purchase all other items perfect . My dickie 36 inch short are not 36 inch . I think they are 38 inch . I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same . It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off .

 I wanted a shiny patent leather belt . That is what the product description claimed , but when I received the product I learned it is not shiny at all . It is also poorly made .

 I sent this product back at the day i received it . Because , although it seems that they will send shirt and short together , they only sent shirt . And even i asked for a medium , it was like an xxxxl ... too big . . So i do not recommend this product at all !
 I bought this so that I could tuck it away when not in use , so on the first rainy day , it was more like a shower , I thought I would give it a try , I must of received a defective one because mine would n't stay open , and when it did , it buckled under the smallest amount of wind and turned inside out , I am now attempting to return it but am having the hardest time trying to get the seller to email me a return code and hopefully a pre-paid label .
 A $ 9.24 shipping charge for one pair of pajamas precludes me from doing business with this company and perhaps , Amazon too , for fostering this type of overcharge . BTW shipping was standard , not overnight . Heaven 's knows what that might have been !
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 I hated these very sticky little things . I found no way to adhere them to garment without wrinkles . They were almost impossible to remove . They were also too small

 I was very dissatisfied with the two Le Mystere Dream Tisha bas that I recently bought . I have worn this model bra for the last five years and have been very satisfied but the wire support has already come out of one . Probably will not buy in the future . Not sure if this is typical of the construction/quality control but I will probably look at another brand .
 I 've been desperately looking for a new bra . My go-to bra is all worn out and it needed replaced . I 'm currently wearing a bra a size smaller than I should , because I can not find one that fits . I 've been fitted for a 36DDD and a 36F/G in the past . So , I thought that a 36F would be my best bet here . This is not the case . It fits so poorly , the underwire dug into my armpit and I had a severe case of `` double boob '' . I guess this one will be sent back and I 'll have to find another one !
 I ordered this in a 36G and a 36H . -LRB- I know I 'm a 36H ; I 've been professionally fitted -RRB- . The fitting on this bra is all wrong . The 36G was too small -LRB- `` quad boob '' -RRB- but the 36H was too big and gaps at the top and sides . I am short waisted and have more of the `` tear drop '' shape so I think it 's just not the best style if you 're shaped like that . It rides high so the wires are right there on the underarms and you ca n't lower the straps too much . Too bad it got lots of good reviews so I was hoping it would work.One thing about Amazon is they are wonderful and easy at returns and shipping so I highly recommend ordering thru them .
 It seemed to be made to last , very durable . Yet this makes for a very large bulky bra . It was hard to move in and was not very appealing to the eyes . It is practical and not pretty at all . The cup sizes run large , so I returned it and got another style from the same company that fit a bit better .
 I just received this bra today and after only wearing it for about 45 minutes , I can tell you that this is not a very comfortable bra . If you ca n't tell from the picture , this is the type of bra that holds it shape even when you are not wearing it . I have never really liked these type of bras , but if you have , then this bra might work for you . I will also say that this fit is not that great because the center of the bra is not laying flat across my chest . If you are used to buying a certain size , you might find that your size runs a little small with this bra.Pro : This bra is smooth and will not show lines under a t-shirt . Straps are comfortable -LRB- but also very wide so you ca n't wear a tank top -RRB- Cons : The underwire is very uncomfortable on the rib cage and near the armpits.Fit is not great , runs a little small.Straps are very wide -LRB- more comfortable but less versatile -RRB- All in all , I would not buy a bra like this again . If you like the type of bra that holds it shape , then you may like it . I have had much better comfort and fit from this bra
 Allthough it was comfortable , I ordered a 34E , and It was 4 inches too small around the ribcage . Plus the cup size was too small . It fit like a 32 DD . I could n't breath after I finally got it on .
 The manufacturer should n't make this bra in larger sizes . The straps are too flimsy for someone with my size -LRB- 42H -RRB- . No matter how many times I adjusted the straps , I still looked droopy . I returned it for something else .
 I ordered two of these in different colors and had to return both . I agree w / other comments re
 I purchased a size 44 , the bra extended on reached 32 inches , either it was sized in error or these run extremely small . Seemed like a nice product but I can not attest to how it feels on .
 I tried this bra at a store in the Bahamas and was pleased with the way it looked and how comfortable it was , but the price was too steep . So I decided to buy it on Amazon and although it is the same bra name and number , the fit is totally different . This bra is so uncomfortable , the band of the bra digs into your entire chest after wearing for an hour . I would not recommend it .
 I received this item today and was very upset to find that this is an older model of the bra , not the 2011 model . This bra has undergone significant redesign this year , so if you were sized in the 2011 model , the old model Amazon sends you will NOT fit . It 's as easy as pie to know the difference ... this year 's model does not have a fabric sizing tag attached . The sizing/bra info is printed right on to the bra fabric , on the inner side of the back closure . The old models have the fabric tag attached at the inside of the back hook closure . I called Amazon directly today and was told that they only know as much as is printed in the item description . The item description does not say that this is an old model bra so how is the buying public to know ???? Shame on you , Amazon .
 I was looking forward to this model of bra based on all the fabulous reviews ... plus Oprah 's approval seemed to make it a done deal . I was surprised to find out that while smooth in the front , it is far from smooth when you turn around to see your backside . I wonder if all these women who are reviewing this model of bra have actually turned around to see what their back rolls look like . I am basically a pear shape , so back rolls are not normally a problem for me ... until I put this bra on ! The band that goes around the body is made of very thick . tight corset material ... like the kind they use for girdles . So the least amount of extra flesh on your back pokes out over the top and under the bottom , accentuating your extra flesh back there . Then the cups are so stiff that when you try to cross your arm over your chest the cups push together and prevent you from fully reaching across your own body . I literally could not reach over my own breasts to grab something off the dresser ! This is one of the most uncomfortable bras I have every tried . I am sending it back after 3 trys in 3 different sizes .
 I have ordered this from another website and bought it in stores and it was always perfect . This one just never fit right .
 I have been purchasing this brand/style/size for several years . The quality is no longer the same , the sizing has also changed . I have the same style and size purchased a few months ago that fits perfectly this does not fit at all . This was , I thought the best bra you could find , I no longer feel that way . Will not be keeping this purchase .
 Sent bra back , I was very disappointed it has sooo much padding it was terrible . Why would any company make a bra with so much padding for someone with this size .
 Due to my breast shape this bra did n't fit well . I have a more bottom heavy conical breast shape . Unfortunately this bra is for a more fuller busted person with more upper breast than I have .
 I 've enjoyed this exact style bra for at least 10 years as it provided fabulous support and a smooth look under fabrics . The sizing has definitely changed resulting in the band being way too snug and the cups too small . -LRB- In the spring I ordered one of the same size worn for many years . It was way too small . . in all aspects . I then ordered a size up , and it too , is too small . -RRB- The straps also do not adjust as much as my previous bras.I do n't know that I will repeat this purchase which is VERY disappointing after having been such a loyal consumer for so many years .
 I have been on the search for the perfect bra for years now ! These bras are in the range of 50 + $ and are not worth the money . I was measured at Macy 's just before ordering and they were of course the wrong size . I reordered and the smaller bra is still the incorrect size ! They are incorrectly sized , painful in the armpits , the cups look crinkled and not smooth and the straps slide off constantly , no matter what the tension setting is . Oprah commendation for these bras is way off base and definitely proves to me it was a monetary endorsement ! VERY UNSATISFIED !!!
 This bra is odd . It pulls the breasts apart which makes a woman look upshapely . Very strange . The bra smelled horrible when I received it , too .
 I did not like this bra . The fabric and construction were nice , hence the two stars ; however , I had to return it because it was not true to size , and the straps were enormous ! Not only were they almost as wide as my shoulders , they are padded and puffy ! I tried it on under a sweater , not even a T-shirt , and they popped through the fabric . If you order up in size , and do n't need to wear tailored clothes , I can see the appeal of this bra . But ... if you do n't have the shoulder-span of a Chicago football team half-back , and actually like your clothes to fit , and your over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder to not show through , this is NOT the bra for you !
 I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago . It gave me great support , it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been . My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size . A year later , the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it . I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $ 70 for one bra . They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time . One year just does n't work for me .
 I discovered this bra at Nordtstom and loved it so I ordered a bunch more from amazon.com where the price was better . The bras that arrived were not the same . The cup came up way too high on the outside and dug into my armpit and the straps were about about 1 12 '' further out the shoulder so they kept falling off . I ended up sending the rest back . I assume that le Mystere changed the design but I do n't know which design was older and which was newer .
 For some strange reason Le Mystere decided to redesign the Dream Tisha . This is the redesigned version which has flimsy cups with no shape . So , if you are looking for the original Dream Tisha with the molded cups that keep their distinctive shape , this is not it . Shame on Le Mystere for ruining a great product . Very disappointed.Also , Amazon needs to take more care in how they ship bras . These bras arrived crushed and indented , there was nothing in there to keep the bra 's shape and prevent them from getting damaged .
 I ordered this bra because I needed a t-shirt bra . However , I ordered the smallest band size they had available and it was still too large . I have a small band size of 28 so I will have to continue ordering bras from the UK as they carry beautiful bras with small band sizes for slender women who have D + cups sizes . I just found a t-shirt bra on Figleaves.com and ordered a couple . I am waiting to receive them and hope they fit well.Besides being too large , this bra was very thick and oddly shaped . It also pushed my breasts up way to high and my breast tissue did n't fill the cup . This bra looks like a piece of sculpture as it is so moulded that the bra looks like breasts are already inside it . The bra cups stand erect on their own . :-RRB- If you like that type of shape then go for it.However , if you are slender with a small band size this bra is probably not the one for you .
 I really wanted to love this bra . Finding bras that are supportive when your full figured is difficult , not to mention expensive . I was fitted for this bra before I bought it , but the store did n't have my size so I started looking for the bra online . I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for , received my two bras , and the fit was terrible . The bra is too tight , and the cups do n't fit . I 'm not spilling out over the sides of the bra , usually the first indicator that the bra does n't fit , there 's all this extra material in the center of the cup.Aside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I 'd like to point out . Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests . First , a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it , this bra does not have that . Second , you need wide , supportive straps , again this bra does not have wide enough straps . There are better bras out there .
 Purchased the dream tisha 9955 two years ago ... havent found another to match the fit and comfort . Looked to purchase additional bras and found that the new style DOES NOT fit as well . The bra specialist informed me that the company changed the style to fit better . I DISAGREE . The specialist admitted also that this improved bra has not worked for many of their customers . I wish I would have purchased more than the one bra at the time - no matter what the cost . I have not found a bra that fit as well as this one has . I 'm sorry the new and improved hasnt worked for me ...
 I bought the dream tisha several years ago and fell in love , rushed to buy three more . Since my original purchase , they have changed the fit . I 'm a natural 34D , with narrow/small shoulders ... the straps are now too long on this bra and even at the smallest adjustment , there is no lift , `` the girls '' merely rest in the cups . I even went to be resized , to make sure I had not changed , it was not me , it 's the bra . I 'm very disappointed as this was a fantastic bra that gave lift and minimized at the same time , now I have to search for another brand .
 I bought this bra because of Oprah 's nod to the product . However , this bra is a minimizing bra . It mushes you until you look like you have a small overly padded chest . The worst part is the quality . I bought this bra less than a year ago and on both sides , under the arms the fabric has `` split '' . On both sides the seams tear out . Now I have to admit , I do not always wash my bra 's as recommended , sometimes they get thrown in with the wash however I do not wash them daily . I really was looking for a high quality bra for a full figure . This may be for a full figured person but it does not flatter . A plain old wonderbra in a large size works better . At least you look pretty and not like you are wearing armor under your shirt .
 I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on , but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm . I thought it was just a rare occurence , but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime . They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them . I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire .
 Too bulky ... When you have big breast the last thing you was is a bulky bra ... It felt more like body armor than a bra ! I know a lot of women like lined bras for nipple coverage how ever the lining in this bra much like most bras from this maker is more like stiff card board which does n't move comfortably .
 I bought the Dream Tisha Lace , Dream Tisha , and Tisha bras . I expected them all to fit similarly , but they did not . Here is my comparison : Tisha -- 2 hooks in back . Unlike Dream Tisha lace , cups did not keep their shape for me . Fits smaller than Dream Tisha and Dream Tisha lace . Works better than Dream Tisha or Dream Tisha Lace for lower cut tops . I kept 1 of these bras for lower cut tops , but the lack of cup smoothness is a problem.Dream Tisha -- 3 hooks in the back . Straps are wider than Tisha . Cups were flimsy and creased when I wore them . Looked terrible on me . I returned this bra.Dream Tisha Lace -- 3 hooks in the back . Straps are wider than Tisha . Nice and supportive for my 36D frame . Molded cups held their shape on me . Perfect fit for me . Only problem is that the lace comes up high enough to be seen with some tops . I will buy enough to wear this bra almost all the time .
 I have been buying this Myst&egrave;re 9955 for at least 3 years now . This last purchase was low quality . Same model but material changed and the width of the straps is a lot thinner . I bought two in the same purchase and both bras were not exactly the same . VERY deciving when we think we are paying for quality !
 I wear a 32F -LRB- same as 32DDD -RRB- in the Le Mystere Isabella : Le Mystere Women 's Isabella Memory Foam Bra - 2535I 'm generally a small DDD , so I ordered two sizes , 32E and 32F , to be sure I go the right fit . Unfortunately , I did not.The 32E was too small on my breasts , and though my breasts filled the cups , they also bulged out the top when I lifted my arms.The 32F fully encased my breasts , but the cups had a bit of extra material in the bottom when I `` scooped and swooped '' my breasts into the tip of the cup.Also , even when the straps were properly adjusted , the shape of the bra pointed DOWNWARD ! I do n't mind having some classic pointy sweater kittens , but when they point downward , it 's very unflattering . It could be because I 'm only 19 and rather perky for my size , so my breasts are less malleable than some breasts . Still , I 'm very disappointed with this bra , and I do n't think it 's a good style for many people .
 I really really wanted to love this bra because of all of the great reviews . Although it is true that it is best to try on bras before you buy them , and get a professional fitting , I wear a 36DD in every brand that I have tried on at a store , and I own dozens of bras from various makers , but this bra is the first one that is too small for me around the band . So , I bought a bra `` extender '' but then had a second problem -- I am 5 ' 3 '' and a little short-waisted and the hard sides of the bra poke me under my arms and distract me all day . It does `` lift '' tremendously well , but I do n't understand why this brand does n't size their bands accurately .
 I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas . First off , the noise it 's supposed to make when you bend it ... well , it makes it anytime it thinks you might even pick it up . Touching it , period , makes the noise activate . Also it does n't retain it 's shape well . A few bends , and it starts to stay bent . After several more , a crease starts to form where it bends that does n't look to be going away anytime soon.Just not a very high-quality toy , in my opinion ...
 Shorts seemed OK initially , but on the 2nd wearing the zipper pull tab fell off . Unfortunately for me , I did n't get around to wearing them until just outside the return window .
 I purchases 6 items for my first Amazon purchase all other items perfect . My dickie 36 inch short are not 36 inch . I think they are 38 inch . I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same . It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off .

 The product was listed with ball caps with velcro . The product came without the velcro application to attach to the cap . . very disappointing .
 I was misinformed I thought the product was 6 items . Only 1 set came in the mail . Please be carefull when ordersing . I know it is only socks but I would not have bought this if know it was only 1 .
 I bought one pair of these socks as a trial before ordering a bunch . I was impressed with how soft they really are . Almost plush . You feel as though they cushion your feet a little bit.Unfortunately , by the end of the day , they had fallen around my ankles.I 've bought Gold Toe over-the-calf socks for years and they only fall when they are almost threadbare . So , no matter how soft or plush , socks that fall down from day one get a poor rating from me.-John
 These are called over the calf socks - but they do not sta over the calf . They constantly fall down . Very disappointed
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 Based on reviews I brought this item in late August . It worked like a charm early , but the quality of the material started to show after a few months . It started losing its ability to clip my cards and money . Finally the metal cracked and broke . A money clip is something a guy should have for a long time , like a watch . Skip this product and invest in material that will last years NOT months .
 The neck hole of this product opens up when the toddler moves around - so much so that the entire onesie falls down around the child 's chest . Gerber makes a superior product . Do not buy this .
 The snaps on all three of the onesies that we received do no stay snapped . A onesie is not very useful with defective snaps . Quality control appears to be lacking on this product . I would advise for others to look into other brands .
 I love how soft the fabric is on these onesies . But , I wo n't be buying them again for a few reasons
 cotton stretches out and does n't regain shape . Might be good for a rolly , polly baby but not good if you child is long and lean . Width is too big and length is too small .
 We returned these because the material was n't soft , the construction was poor , and the size was WAY off . I do n't recommend , at all .
 I bought these in a 24 month size . They seem like they are made for a disproportionate kid who is very round and very short . And , to top it off the neck is so wide it will barely stay on my child 's shoulders . I do n't use them unless I 'm in a pinch with no other clean ones .
 The shape was fine for my wide baby but the snaps would not stay snapped making these useless for me to use .
 Unlike other reviewers say , I found these onesies to be a terrible fit . They are short and wide . I bought the 12 month size for my average-to-short 11 month old and they were a tight fit length-wise . They are so wide , however , they they fall off my baby 's shoulders . I 'm going back to Carters .
 Probly the worst set of `` bodysuits '' that Ive bought so far . Horrible fit , they stretch , and dont wash well . Just spend the extra money and get Carters
 Very disappointed . These looked nice , but after an initial pre-wear wash and dry -LRB- cold water , medium heat -RRB- , these shrunk a TON . As in about 2 inches shorter than a 12 month Carter 's onesie . I do n't think these will even snap on her now . I might be able to still use them as a sleep shirt if I just cut the crotch portion off at the bottom , but I 'm annoyed . Also , the reviewers who mentioned the very large neck were right . Would not buy these again.It 's SO hard to find 12 + month onesies ! If you 're looking for smaller sizes in plain colors , I HIGHLY recommend the Disney Cuddly Bodysuits . I just wish they came in bigger sizes !
 These bodysuits fit terribly around the neck ! The neck opening is HUGE -LRB- my husband likens it to the `` bacon neck '' depicted in Hanes commercials -RRB- . Worst fit I have seen in a onesie / bodysuit yet . Returned them immediately .
 These are very soft would have loved them however the neck opening is very large and will not stay on I am constantly pulling back around her neck they are also very wide all around ... I prefer the Carter 's
 I 've washed these more times than I can remember , soaked them in vinegar for days -LRB- literally -RRB- , then rewashed them . They still have a chemical smell . I 'm not sure what 's going on . I had previously purchased some long-sleeve body suites from the same company , which did n't have this smell . I do not like putting something on my baby that smells so strongly of the chemicals used to process the fabric . If I can not get the smell out , I 'll have to donate them to Goodwill and hope that their laundering is more effective than mine . Other than the smell , the quality of the fabric seems good .
 I read many reviews and did my research before I purchased these . I read that the sizing was a little off , so I ordered a size larger . My daughter only weights 19 pounds and usually wears a 12 month onsie . I purchased these 18 month size . They barely fit . They are WAY too short . They barely fit her now , but they definately wont fit her when she is 13 months old .
 Material feels great ! That 's it . The neck line droops way low which causes the shoulders to be all off and the tag is quite long and annoying .
 My 4 month old is 90 % in height , he ca n't fit into the 12 month size with this brand , which is much shorter and wider than other brands . Very disappointed as i ca n't return these since they were washed already not knowing they would n't fit .
 Sure these are soft , but most cotton is . The neck is huge , and the shoulders do not sit well on my son 's shoulders . He looks like a baby linebacker when he wears it . Also , the white is an odd shade . It almost has a blue undertone to it , and does not match the other white items in his wardrobe .

I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same . It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .

 The neck hole of this product opens up when the toddler moves around - so much so that the entire onesie falls down around the child 's chest . Gerber makes a superior product . Do not buy this .
 The snaps on all three of the onesies that we received do no stay snapped . A onesie is not very useful with defective snaps . Quality control appears to be lacking on this product . I would advise for others to look into other brands .
 I love how soft the fabric is on these onesies . But , I wo n't be buying them again for a few reasons
 cotton stretches out and does n't regain shape . Might be good for a rolly , polly baby but not good if you child is long and lean . Width is too big and length is too small .
 We returned these because the material was n't soft , the construction was poor , and the size was WAY off . I do n't recommend , at all .
 I bought these in a 24 month size . They seem like they are made for a disproportionate kid who is very round and very short . And , to top it off the neck is so wide it will barely stay on my child 's shoulders . I do n't use them unless I 'm in a pinch with no other clean ones .
 The shape was fine for my wide baby but the snaps would not stay snapped making these useless for me to use .
 Unlike other reviewers say , I found these onesies to be a terrible fit . They are short and wide . I bought the 12 month size for my average-to-short 11 month old and they were a tight fit length-wise . They are so wide , however , they they fall off my baby 's shoulders . I 'm going back to Carters .
 Probly the worst set of `` bodysuits '' that Ive bought so far . Horrible fit , they stretch , and dont wash well . Just spend the extra money and get Carters
 I 've washed these more times than I can remember , soaked them in vinegar for days -LRB- literally -RRB- , then rewashed them . They still have a chemical smell . I 'm not sure what 's going on . I had previously purchased some long-sleeve body suites from the same company , which did n't have this smell . I do not like putting something on my baby that smells so strongly of the chemicals used to process the fabric . If I can not get the smell out , I 'll have to donate them to Goodwill and hope that their laundering is more effective than mine . Other than the smell , the quality of the fabric seems good .
 Very disappointed . These looked nice , but after an initial pre-wear wash and dry -LRB- cold water , medium heat -RRB- , these shrunk a TON . As in about 2 inches shorter than a 12 month Carter 's onesie . I do n't think these will even snap on her now . I might be able to still use them as a sleep shirt if I just cut the crotch portion off at the bottom , but I 'm annoyed . Also , the reviewers who mentioned the very large neck were right . Would not buy these again.It 's SO hard to find 12 + month onesies ! If you 're looking for smaller sizes in plain colors , I HIGHLY recommend the Disney Cuddly Bodysuits . I just wish they came in bigger sizes !
 These bodysuits fit terribly around the neck ! The neck opening is HUGE -LRB- my husband likens it to the `` bacon neck '' depicted in Hanes commercials -RRB- . Worst fit I have seen in a onesie / bodysuit yet . Returned them immediately .
 These are very soft would have loved them however the neck opening is very large and will not stay on I am constantly pulling back around her neck they are also very wide all around ... I prefer the Carter 's
 My 4 month old is 90 % in height , he ca n't fit into the 12 month size with this brand , which is much shorter and wider than other brands . Very disappointed as i ca n't return these since they were washed already not knowing they would n't fit .
 Sure these are soft , but most cotton is . The neck is huge , and the shoulders do not sit well on my son 's shoulders . He looks like a baby linebacker when he wears it . Also , the white is an odd shade . It almost has a blue undertone to it , and does not match the other white items in his wardrobe .
 I read many reviews and did my research before I purchased these . I read that the sizing was a little off , so I ordered a size larger . My daughter only weights 19 pounds and usually wears a 12 month onsie . I purchased these 18 month size . They barely fit . They are WAY too short . They barely fit her now , but they definately wont fit her when she is 13 months old .
 Material feels great ! That 's it . The neck line droops way low which causes the shoulders to be all off and the tag is quite long and annoying .

 1st , the cups were a bit small , & I know I gave the right size . Then , the strap broke ! It 's pretty , & they had my size , which is a small miracle in itself , but I would n't buy this again !
 This bra is not true to size it is smaller than the 34 G bra I was replacing . The faberic is very ichy and uncomfortable . A very disapointing purchase .
 I think the fit of the bra is great , but I can only wear it briefly because it is so uncomfortable . The fabric is stiff and itchy and the metal adjustments in the front poke me on both sides . I have washed it several times to try and soften the fabric ; did n't work . I would love to be able to wear it because it give such good support and shape , but I just ca n't .
 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .

 Due to a problem with the order , it was never received -LRB- but paid for ! -RRB- . I contacted the vendor in good faith to resolve this manner and get my order . To date , they have failed resolve this and have since proven unconcerned , unhelpful and downright unwilling to help fix the problem . Bottom line

 I was wrong to think that these socks had cushions on heels and toe areas - they do n't . they are very very thin . . and lost its shape after just one wash .
 The first time I wore the socks I got a nice blister within 5 miles , and had to end my hike early . I like the sock in general for the gym or whatever ... but they did n't prevent any blisters ...
 5 stars for the socks themselves - I ended up wearing them myself ! I got them as a gift for my brother in law but the size Medium only fits up to men 's size 7 or so !

 We ordered a red crumpler salary sacrifice , instead we got a black one , which is considered cheaper.When you buy this item , pay attention , although the page contains other colors , like red and blue , they probably have only the black color , which is available at a lower price in other e-shops .

 They are already in the garbage . My daughter wore them once . Enough said .

 The size is wrong . I ordered my regular size and it 's much too small . Am returning for a larger . We 'll see .
 I have 5 Samsonite suitcases , and most of them are good.However , I used this suitcase 2 times and the cushion rubber fell off . I went to Samsonite repair center in Atlanta . They refused to fix the problem and basically said if the product looks fine out of the box , you 're on your own.I did not know Samsonite 10 years warranty does not mean a thing .
 Nice size and weight but not reliable . Mine broke -LRB- attachment point for handle -RRB- after first flight . Its pain to get fixed as Samsonite will not send replacement parts but instead you have to ship to a repair center .
 I was wrong to think that these socks had cushions on heels and toe areas - they do n't . they are very very thin . . and lost its shape after just one wash .

They refused to fix the problem and basically said if the product looks fine out of the box , you 're on your own.I did not know Samsonite 10 years warranty does not mean a thing .
 Nice size and weight but not reliable . Mine broke -LRB- attachment point for handle -RRB- after first flight . Its pain to get fixed as Samsonite will not send replacement parts but instead you have to ship to a repair center .
 I was wrong to think that these socks had cushions on heels and toe areas - they do n't . they are very very thin . . and lost its shape after just one wash .
 The first time I wore the socks I got a nice blister within 5 miles , and had to end my hike early . I like the sock in general for the gym or whatever ... but they did n't prevent any blisters ...
 5 stars for the socks themselves - I ended up wearing them myself ! I got them as a gift for my brother in law but the size Medium only fits up to men 's size 7 or so !

 This item is just okay . Not exactly as pictured but close . My biggest complaint is with the wings . They are so small on the actual costume and they do n't stand up like the picture . Also the tutu is made of very soft material so it does not puff up .
 I really do love the sound bag . What a great idea , and I use it alot , that is until about a week ago . It started distorting all the songs . Even when I had the volumne of my MP3 on 1 , it still distorted the song . I did email Cluthfield , but never heard anything back . What can I do to remedy this ? I feel that it should have lasted longer for the money . And , no , it was never dropped . I keep it clipped to the side of my purse.Please , advise me what to do . I do want the bag , but I think I should receive a new one.Thank you , Debbie Kelly750 Washington AvenueNiles , Ohio 44446Let me know how to return this for another.Thank you .
 I got a white , straight cotton version of this tank -LRB- no polyblend -RRB- . The shirt did n't have loads of reviews , but I took a shot at getting one . The cotton is cheap and nasty feeling . Abrasive like paper towel or something , washing did n't make it any better . I will be tossing it aside for extra . I tried wearing it as an undershirt , by the time the day was over I was itching -LRB- literally -RRB- to get it off ASAP . For $ 8 per I feel it should have been a little better quality , I will keep shopping around .
 Pros - Very cheap - as in affordableCons - Shrinks much more than the equivalent product by Champion . - Bottom of shirt curls upwards , very annoying . - Does not last long - holes start forming in about a year . - Cotton is also courser than Champion .
 I purchased a Russel workout tank on amazon and was seriously disappointed . It was not the same sturdy , medium weight shirts I have been buying in the department stores . I decided to try this brand , which was a couple of bucks more and I was fine with that thinking -LRB- hoping -RRB- it would be a quality product . It is not . It is the same tissue paper crap . In fact it has a spongy stretchy feel to the cloth . At least the Russel tank had a decent texture . Both these shirts developed holes the very first day at the gym . The Anvil also blew a hem seam on day 1 . I am not an animal in the gym . The wear through is from normal abrasion from the machines padded areas . Ya , pathetic . Keep looking folks . Me , I 'm back to buying at the department stores . You can not trust the name brands any longer . My thoughts , e-stores like Amazon , eBay etc. have driven the prices down so low that the top brands have dredged up cheaper online only product lines to keep them competitive.I gave the tank 1 star as it fit well although I did go one size larger than what I would typically buy from a brick and moorter . It has a good free movement cut and plenty of length . I will not buy again and do not recommend this product unless you can not stand any weight on your skin . Realize it will disintegrate after a short time .
 This obviously is n't a rating of the product itself , but I do n't know any other way to do it . Never wore the pants cause they were at least 2 sizes smaller in the waist than labeled so had to send them back . I was very disappointed ; I guess mistakes happen , but ... No chance that I had wishful thinking about my waist size as I have two other Wrangler Jeans in this size and they fit fine , actually a little loose in the waist . The jeans seemed as advertised otherwise , but again , without actually wearing them , ca n't say much .
 After one wash and a few days of wear , the rear pocket started to separate from the seat . The waist seemed a bit larger than stated - I have to wear a belt to keep them up , which is something I did n't expect when I ordered them . Otherwise , the fabric and fit is ok .
 My jeans showed up labeled 34x34 - as I had ordered them - but the true length was closer to 36 . Other than that , I like the fit/style and the price is right .
 These are the jeans I used to love . They used to be rugged , well fit , well made . The last few purchases of these jeans have been very very sub-par . Very thin material . Weak seams . Generally unsuitable for my purposes . If Wrangler wants to maintain the `` Rugged '' label on these jeans , they need to re-think the lousy craftsmanship of recent versions . I know I am shopping around for better jeans .
 This jacket looks good from afar but the quality isnt all that great . The zipper broke on mine within 2 days of wearing and there are loose strings coming out all over . The sizing is very european and 3x really means 2x . I wont buy Kappa again Im goin back to addidas and Nike they are much better quality

 This was a nice bra but the sizing was off , If I hadnt have removed the tags before trying it on I would have returned them so I donated them to salavage army . If ordered order a cup size smaller than normal
 Granted , I did n't pay much for these , so perhaps for the price they were fine . But they are made of scraps of leather , and ours arrived with a hole in one of the gloves . We decided to ship it back and get a refund .
 We received the men 's glove which are suppose to be Giovanni Navarre Italian Stone Leather Gloves , but when we received them there was a tear or slit in the palm of the glove ... so the quality is questionable !!!!!
 I had great expectations for the SassyBax , but , alas , they were not met . The product was extremely uncomfortable after about ten minutes of wear . Too high under the arms and the bottom band rolled up . Does anyone make a comfortable bra ?
 Oh how I wanted this to work for me . However , since I have major boobage , I need major support . Somehow I thought the sassybax would offer more support since it has so much coverage . Not so . I sag and jiggle ... it does serve as a ` round the house bra . This is not a one-size-fits-all solution for those of us with bigger bodies .

 Disappointed with the product , because the gator clamps wil not hold . One clamp on the back will not hold and the adjustment clamps will not engage .
 The suspenders were terrible . The clip on the end is broke . I never got to wear the things ! I was gon na send them back but for ten bucks ... thats how much it would cost to ship it back . Not worth it in my opinion .

 They are already in the garbage . My daughter wore them once . Enough said .

 I ordered 3 of these , pink , yellow and white at a good price , and the material was great . My disappointment is in the inconsistency of the neck . Only 1 of the 3 fit right around my neck , the other two gapped and looked very bad . A turtleneck is to fit comforately snug around ones neck . I even washed and put in the dryer to see if that would make a difference , it did not . If I can not return the 2 , they will not be a bargan , but end up being a very expensive turtleneck .
 it wasnt the color it was suppose to be , the color was way to light it looked more like off white than yellow

 I was very happy with the way that the bag looked when I removed it from the package . Unfortunately the entire bottom seam ripped and packages fell out onto the ground before Santa was even able to get in the door ! Terribly disappointed with this product .
 Bag looked awesome from the start . Looked okay when I took it out . Was big enough for what I bought it for but as soon as I put two things in it the bottom of the bag seam started to tear . It is hardly put together at all . :-LRB- Just seamed it up myself .
 We used this for toys and when we started putting toys in each bag the entire bottom of the bag fell apart . Maybe it could be used for clothes or something that did n't have boxes ?
 The bottom of the bag ripped open the first time I used it . Stitching must be very weak and it was useless .
 This bag arrived and I put my Santa Costume in it to take out of town where I play Santa for family , and Friends children . The bag completely separated at the bottom and all the costume was lost out the bottom without my knowledge . Clearly there is no quality control or care . I should have taken note from the other reviewer stating the same thing about the bag bottom not being secure , and avoided ruining a great family tradition . This bag was a disaster , and should be sold as a wind sock . Horrible product and immensely disappointed . Amazon needs to cut this company .
 I bought this bag for use on two days to bring my nephews Christmas presents to my sister 's place , and then later to bring my girlfriend 's son 's presents to his house . Bear in mind all of these gifts were for 2 year old boys , there was no heavy electronics or anything of appreciable weight.I think the grand total weight of the presents may have been 15 pounds , yet after I loaded this bag , and went to pick it up it ripped at the bottom of the bag along the seam as if it just unzipped . There was no strain , no ripping sounds , nothing ! The bottom just opened up and all the presents fell on the floor the very first time!I was n't expecting much from this bag , one or two uses to haul Fisher Price toys and puzzles around for Christmas Day , but I did n't even get that!I mean come on ! Really ?!!? Ok , so $ 10 is n't a lot of money , but the bag was n't exactly cheap either . The stitching on this thing was horrible ! What do they intend you to carry around in it ? Cotton balls?This was a complete waste of money and I wound up using a cheap holiday bag I got from the Dollar Store which actually worked !!!
 I 've been using Atlantic luggage for years and even though the airlines have no regard for your bags , Atlantic seems to last quite some time , until I got this spinner . I had purchased the rolling garment bag , 25 in . suiter , a tote bag and now I have a carry-on . I love this luggage . Only one thing
 One wheel fell off on first short plane flight ! Contacted seller and they said to contact manufacturer . I suggested they replace or refund it as the quality is so poor , why fix something so poorly made ? They gave me the manufacturer 's number . Left a voice message first call with no response . Second call , spoke with customer service and they gave me a local luggage store for repair . The local shop said this bag would keep falling apart as it is poorly made and suggested I purchase a $ 700 bag marked down to $ 420 , how generous . Do yourself a favor and do n't buy this poorly made bag or purchase from this seller as they do n't seem to care about customers .
 I purchased two of these after seeing them in a local department store . My son is a North Carolina Fan and the blue was perfect . I was very disappointed . After washing it in cold water ... the XXL became a L. ... both sweater shrank ! VERY DISAPPOINTED ! IN THE PURCHASE ... WILL NOT BUY CLOTHES FROM YOU AGAIN ... BOBBI JO JOHNSON BARNESVILLE OHIO

 I have ordered this item multiple times and each time Amazon cancels the order saying out of stock .
 I knew it was faux military surplus going in , but I did n't expect a snap to pop off and a big hole to appear in the first week of use . Given this was not just a purse -- I was using it at Burning Man , but my last similar-sized actual military surplus bag lasted through years of daily use plus multiple festivals , including last year 's Burn . Disappointed .
 In retrospect , I should not have purchased this bag . The `` yellow '' lights were blinking in my head as I was completing the paypal process . Why ? It 's quite obvious . That is , obvious to me . The bag is taller than wide . Which means , digging around in the bag to find what I am looking for . The fact that it has a divider to separate the contents does not matter . The bag was also , in overall size , too small . Another concern , which I chose not to think about , was the fabric . Canvas fabric is `` tough and rough -LRB- rough to the touch -RRB- . '' What else would one expect from `` canvas . '' But for a purse ... well for me . No . Thank you.I will say this , the bag is well made
 my bag arrived without the snap closures on the front flap . there is no way to close it . now i have to go buy some velcro strips and fabric glue to secure the front . rather disappointed .
 After only my second day of using the bag , the strap broke . I had a tablet and 2 normal sized books in it . I was very disappointed with this product . It would have worked out great since everything fit inside perfectly .
 I 'd send it back but that is too much bother . The stitching is awful . It is just a single very thin thread stitched around the border . It is loose in several spots even before I have used it.It also still looks like a man purse even though it is canvas with black metal fittings . probably because it flares at the bottom.So if you want a canvas man purse that is badly stitched ... look no further .
 The backing of the bag that gives its nice shape is made of some kind of wood or other hard material or cardboard . I was excited to get a `` man purse '' to carry my cell phones instead of attaching them to my belt . I placed the phones and tried to close the snap button but the backing broke . It cracked . I did n't even use the bag yet and the backing cracked in half . The backing could not even withstand pressure applied to close the snap buttons . What a major disappointment . They could n't make it out of something less brittle ? Useless .
 This is not the old standard issue map case . It 's a canvas bag made in that style . . sort of . The length and height are about the same , but the width ... it opens up to about 4 inches . The quality is fair ... the stitching looks pretty solid , but not strong . The strap is pretty thin -LRB- just under an inch -RRB- with buckles bordering on flimsy . I would not try to carry anything too heavy in this bag.If you want a bag to carry documents or an ipad or some such , this will probably be too big to be convenient . The bag expands to a four inch width , so the contents are unlikely to be held securely . Filling it to capacity with books or papers feels like it would break the bag ... the contents would be too heavy .
 I was looking for a comfortable bra that I could wear under a camisole top , that would not show `` bra straps '' . I loved the idea of the clear straps and no seam cups.It turns out when I received my order , the bra cups were completely bent and lumpy so you do n't get a smooth look under your top . I wash it hoping the bra cups would smooth out , no luck . Turns out those clear bra straps are very uncomfortable and dig into your skin.For $ 28.00 this item was a complete bust . I would not recommend this item .
 Not as comfortable as advertised . This is a below par product by Lily of France . Construction seams a bit cheap . Amazon 's packaging was poor . They should put some kind of padding for the undergarments instead of tossing them in with everything else . Or place in separate smaller box . Mine came with one cup wrinkled . There were no manufacturer tags on the bra though ? The underwire was still in shape so decided it was not worth the shipping to return a 12.44 product . No original product tags so I was n't sure if it was a used and returned product . Just in case , washed out the product and that also helped with the wrinkled padding .
 The pajamas arrived timely and were as described . Style and construction seemed good . I had ordered my normal size but these pj 's were way too small and so I sent them back .
 I think this bra would work better for someone with a larger bust size than mine . I ordered a 32b , which fit ok , but the shape of the bra gives me a more pointy shape under a shirt than I would have liked . I think it is because it squishes my chest very close in . I ended up ordering another brand of sports bra that is on its way .
 I dont like this flimsy thing . The side zipper makes no sense because because you wrinkle your clothes trying to get them in and out . Will be returning for something different .
 This garment bag was junk.The zipper lasted ONE day.Not too convenient when it broke the first time I used it and was leaving town the next day.Do not buy this product .
 I 'm not sure where all the great reviews came from , but this bag was poorly made and the material is paper thin . All I can say is this ... I did n't expect much at a $ 10 price point and this bag still managed to disappoint me . Spend the extra $ 5-10 and get something that will last .
 This is a plastic bag container for your suit . ** Home/Car storage of your suit ? Go for it . If you buy it to store your suit at home or in your car , etc. go for it . ** Travelling on plane ? No ! If you are buying it for travelling your suit with you on planes , etc. . I think you better go with something sturdier which will much better keep your suit safe , and less wrinkled . Even carrying the suit with this is a bit hard , since it bends on the ends easily.Cheap in price , cheap in material . Suits are not that cheap , go for something that can protect your suits better ...
 I realize that this was not an expensive bag , but I thought it would at least have handles so as to make it easier to carry . If I had only looked a bit closer and realized that there were none . I can not recommend this bag to anyone except possibly to someone who will only use it to/from car , i.e. not while running through airports , and needs to save money . Poor product .
 This bag would be just what I needed , except that the stitching around the zipper has completely unraveled after less than 2 months ' use , rendering the product worthless .
 The product description lists `` multiple pockets for organization , '' but there is just a front ID holder on the bag . Would have never bought product otherwise and I will be returning it . I can pick up a plain garment bag without pockets for half the price locally .
 This is the exact same quality as the one 's you can buy at Walmart for $ 2 . Please just go to Walmart and get a $ 2 suit bag instead . It 's the same quality , this one was a waste of money .
 Big disappointment . I probably should have returned it , but did n't . The only reason that I did n't return it , was that I was too busy with a divorce situation . Yeah , it happens.Please consider my warning , before purchasing this Travel Bag .
 This is not bad for the price , but is lacking many niceties . I use this to carry my uniform in to work , pants and blouse . The bag is large enough to hold my uniform without crumpling . That is about where the function ends . I would have liked to have actual handles attached to top and bottom so that when folded for carrying the handles came together . Also , it would have been nice to have a means to keep the four corners , when in folded carrying mode , together-snaps would be fine . This would have made it look nicer and less of a mess when carrying.For the price , I ca n't complain , this does n't seem to be an item many people need , or Amazon just does n't carry many types .
 This does function just as it should but the zipper does not make it easy to open and put the clothing in .
 Bag has its only opening via a zipper on the side of the bag . The zipper does not reach far enough up on the bag -LRB- somewhere below where the shoulder of a suit jacket would be -RRB- . Loading and unloading clothing is very difficult and awkward . Would not recommend this bag .
 Bought this based on the good reviews . Not worth the $ . It is pretty flimsy . Not sure how long it will last . Better to add a few bucks and buy something better . The only good thing about it is the width -LRB- 5 '' deep -RRB- .
 This garment bag arrived with ample evidence of poor construction . The entire zipper strip detached from the bag the very first time that I tested the zipper . Hope that this information helps you to avoid this `` waste of money '' .
 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor
 The top of this is kinda cute but the bottom is made out of some older looking material and the bottom brown color is really blah . It comes about 2 sizes too small , so if you are like a 16 then order a 20 or 22 .
 Buyer beware , these tights might fit an extremely tall and thin cucumber , but not a human being.I 'm a plus size - but not all that plus - I ordered size 4 because my body , in addition to being overweight and tall , is quite mature and as other mature consumers know , we need to shop for bigger sizes . These tights are a waste of $ .
 Not a whole lot of support . Wish it had a tad more lycra . They get a bit saggy by the afternoon . I do n't recommend .
 Unfortunately ordered these a couple of months ago and just got them out to put them on . Great big hole where one of the big toes should be . Open and inspect in detail immediately if you buy these , I have missed the return cut off - so it 's a complete rip off .
 The tights are great but Amazon is charging $ 12.50 a pair even if you buy two pairs . The packaging says they are 2 for $ 20 . Amazon will charge you $ 25 for 2 pairs . Better off going to the mall . Customer service reps would not honor the price on the package .
 I do n't know of any other company that sells such a variety of opaque , colorful tights . I bought a large number of them and did n't discover that some were damaged before the return date had expired . When they are good , they are very , very good and when they are bad ... it 's a waste.I hope they will step up their quality control .
 I have a ton of HUE tights and I love them
 plz do smth . . i have not yet received the packet ... its been too long ...
 I ordered a dress ; I received a pair of paints . I have not returned it because I had so much trouble receiving the paints that I have just decided to keep it and give it to someone and take tax credit on it . I will never order from these people again.Linda Revels

 We ordered a red crumpler salary sacrifice , instead we got a black one , which is considered cheaper.When you buy this item , pay attention , although the page contains other colors , like red and blue , they probably have only the black color , which is available at a lower price in other e-shops .

I loved the idea of the clear straps and no seam cups.It turns out when I received my order , the bra cups were completely bent and lumpy so you do n't get a smooth look under your top . I wash it hoping the bra cups would smooth out , no luck . Turns out those clear bra straps are very uncomfortable and dig into your skin.For $ 28.00 this item was a complete bust . I would not recommend this item .
 Not as comfortable as advertised . This is a below par product by Lily of France . Construction seams a bit cheap . Amazon 's packaging was poor . They should put some kind of padding for the undergarments instead of tossing them in with everything else . Or place in separate smaller box . Mine came with one cup wrinkled . There were no manufacturer tags on the bra though ? The underwire was still in shape so decided it was not worth the shipping to return a 12.44 product . No original product tags so I was n't sure if it was a used and returned product . Just in case , washed out the product and that also helped with the wrinkled padding .
 plz do smth . . i have not yet received the packet ... its been too long ...
 I bought this dress for a trip I 'm taking in one week . Should 've known better . You get what you pay for , that 's for sure . This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag . It did n't look anything like the picture shown on this site , more like a slip , than a slip dress . And here 's the kicker - it was RIPPED ! Had two large `` snags '' on the back of the dress . I 'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping . I 'm PO 'd to the max and who knows if I 'll find a dress in time . Grrrr .
 After I FINALLY recieved my dress it was BEAUTIFUL until I seen the `` run '' in it all the way from the hip to the hem line ! I contacted the company , they said to send it back and I 'd get my money back , I sent it back and they claim they never received it ! So now Im stuck with no dress or money !
 This dress is cute in the picture ... but pretty thin and flimsy - so if it does n't fit right it comes off looking very , well , I do n't think I can say the word on this forum . I looked at the sizing chart before ordering , but it still was very snug and did n't lay right . If you have anything over an A or B cup - forget it ! Also , the underlayer does n't come down to the bottom of the sheer layer on top - it stops 6 or 8 inches short ... making it look less classy than trashy . I returned it ... a cute dress does n't do any good if you ca n't wear it !
 The material , specially the Clips are so low in Quality , it does not hold at all . Cost me $ 17 including the shipping . Does not worth $ 3 . Some time Things are not good as it looks in the Picture . I do not know what part of this item is made in the US . I learned my lesson . Do not buy things those are not 100 % guaranteed for full refund if sot satisfied .
 I do n't know of any other company that sells such a variety of opaque , colorful tights . I bought a large number of them and did n't discover that some were damaged before the return date had expired . When they are good , they are very , very good and when they are bad ... it 's a waste.I hope they will step up their quality control .

 Not a whole lot of support . Wish it had a tad more lycra . They get a bit saggy by the afternoon . I do n't recommend .
 Unfortunately ordered these a couple of months ago and just got them out to put them on . Great big hole where one of the big toes should be . Open and inspect in detail immediately if you buy these , I have missed the return cut off - so it 's a complete rip off .
 The tights are great but Amazon is charging $ 12.50 a pair even if you buy two pairs . The packaging says they are 2 for $ 20 . Amazon will charge you $ 25 for 2 pairs . Better off going to the mall . Customer service reps would not honor the price on the package .
 Buyer beware , these tights might fit an extremely tall and thin cucumber , but not a human being.I 'm a plus size - but not all that plus - I ordered size 4 because my body , in addition to being overweight and tall , is quite mature and as other mature consumers know , we need to shop for bigger sizes . These tights are a waste of $ .
 this bag is not good , though it looks the same as the pic ! Pay attention , it is made of leather-like material ! not leather !! and this company does not accept any return except damage in the delivery ! how bad this return policy is !! what 's more , this company looks only one person ! the compony contact method is a personal email box in gmail !!!!!!!!!!!! do not trust this kind of company !! No any return !!

 I love the look of the pin but it 's not very strong . I put it on my hat and it broke the second day I wore it . :-LRB- The decorative front just fell off the pin part . I know it 's an inexpensive piece but I was expecting a bit more even so .
 It 's not really ` winter weight ' or thick in any way.Order 1 or 2 sizes bigger than you think , my pants would be 32x32 , I ordered a medium , it 's too small . I will order a large though , since its otherwise a good product .
 The union suit arrived in a timely manner , but the suit is NOT `` winter weight '' . It is very light . The buttons are very small and the button holes are a bit too large , so it unbuttons itself just about as fast as you button it up . For what this suit cost , it should be better made and thicker material . Look elsewhere and save yourself the disappointment .
 This vendor , East Valley Apparel , is the first Amazon shipper I 've found to ship as fast as Amazon , which is quite a feat . I received the union suit in three days . Unfortunately , the suit did not fit my long , skinny frame and I found the material a bit scratchy so I sent it back . They received it back without issue . Wow ! I give the vendor five stars .

 I bought this bra based on the positive reviews that I read from various sites . The material , style and color are quite lovely . I was excited to try it on . Then my self-esteem fell through the floor

 I bought this bra because the ad says 100 % cotton . There is no cotton in this bra . It is 86 % nylon and 14 % elastane . If you want a cotton bra , this is not for you .
 The tights are nice color and thickness good . However , the fit are not fitted and when put feet inside ballet slippers there is extra material . I hate it when tights are made this way . I would not recommend . Also they run small .
 This product probably cost less than 50 cents to make . . It 's so overpriced for its material and functionality . I do n't see the point of wearing it . No nipple coverage , no shaping . For comfort ? Nah , I 'd rather not wear a bra at all !
 I bought these jeans for my husband . The stretch out way too much when he wears them . He hates wearing a belt , but if he does n't , these pants would fall down !! I do not recommend them at all
 well at 1st I was floored by this shirt but just after a few weeks the snap buttons started falling off ! The material is well made but what good is that if you cant button it ?

 These felt like normal dress tights . relatively thin . I 'm a waitress 7 days a week and decided to go with the thigh high compression . I knew these were n't going to be that comfortable . I just wish they felt more thicker like my other compression socks . I feel like these are going to tear very easily . I have tights that i paid like a buck for that feel like this.They did ship very fast and I am pleased with the seller . Just not the product .

 These gloves decimate in 30 seconds with lacquer thinner . If you use any compariable chemicals , these gloves are not for you . We needed small or medium gloves and these were advertised as similar to what we needed . However , they are probley only resistance to household chemicals . I called the company prior to ordering and they told me these are just the gloves we need . Caution if you use any chemicals similar to lacquer thinner

 Sold as women size , but really a junior ! Was not happy with fit or quality of shirt

 Crumpled . Gave to son . Wore one time at convention and left in hotel room as wife does n't iron , or do much of anything else .
 These shirts seemed to be a good buy , and I liked the cotton/synthetic mix since this usually means that they are easy care . However , once washed , these shirts require as much ironing as an all cotton shirt .
 ... and they were met . The material is extremely thin , but fortunately , I live in Florida . I do n't expect the shirt to hold up well , and I do n't think that I will be purchasing any more of this brand , but for a $ 5 shirt , it is about what I would expect .
 The shirt looked good , only problem was that it did n't fit . I ordered an XL and I have a medium muscular build , but the shirt was way too small . I could barely squeeze into it .
 This is no bargain . Its really poor quality . The sound volume changes on its own . Pay a few bucks more and get a quality product .

 These pj 's state they have a pant length of 41 '' . 41 '' sure , 28 '' inseam . They are at my ankle if the crotch is at my knees . The waistband fits comfortably at my breast , nothing like fleec capri 's for winter . My ankle 's are going to freeze .

 I bought these last year to bring with me on a cruise . They fit great and looked really cool . However , on the second day of wearing them , one of the seams along the outside ripped about 4 inches and the other side started to rip . Luckily I brought another bathing suit to wear . Because of the material , it does n't look like it 's possible to sew them.I thought maybe I just got a bad suit and was going to buy another , until I read that someone else had the exact same problem . It 's too bad that the quality of these is so poor , because they 're really nice looking .
 When I tried it on , it was tight everywhere , and I 'm a rather small person . I was bearly 3 months pregnant and the medium did not fit .

 The description is not the same as the picture . I do n't know what costume I 'm buying ! I 'll change my review when you change your picture/description .
 I ordered this for my 9 year old and thought a medium would fit her . She wears an 8 right now ... The body suit was wayyyy too tight . The pants could not even go down to her feet . We scrapped the outfit and are just using the belt -LRB- which was very big and had to rig to fit her waist ! -RRB- and the cape . Waste of money !

 The peter pan child costume is not worth the money . The Hat is too small -LRB- size 4 -RRB- and it ripped in two weeks . The material is like felt , very disappointed

 This is a nice belt . Not quite as shiny as they make it look in the pictures . Maybe not worth that much money either , but only time will tell with that . I like the belt just fine overall . At 50 bucks it would have been 5 stars.Edit
 I ordered this product and when it arrived it looked dark brown . No hint of burgundy in the leather color as the image would suggest . I have other allen edmonds products and this was a mistake . Needs to be seen in person .
 This item was a little disapionting for me . I ordered it thinking it was a truer , more peacock blue that would go well with other items I had . But as it turns out it is much more of a sky blue . Also the sizeing was a bit off and so I was n't able to wear it when I had hoped . I accually have n't worn it at all because untill I get it altered it will just fall off !
 This was the worst costume i 've ever purchased . I looked up the length of the skirt to make sure it would fit . Got it in the mail , put it on and the skirt did n't even go halfway down my behind ! The costume was cheap ! I could n't return it because of the policy in place ... NEVER BUY from this seller !
 I ordered this product and was reall excited abu how quickly it arrived . however when i recieved the product it was very damaged and a stocking was missing . It appeared to be someones USED costume . Also a button was missing . I sent an e-mail to the seller and have not heard back . I will never purchase anything from the seller again .
 I 'm a tiny size , but there is no way that the tiny little skirt was going to fit anywhere but around my waist , which would make it so short that it would n't even cover the top of my underwear ! Unless your waist is the same size as your hips , do n't buy this product !
 I 've been buying Leg Avenue products for years -- including Halloween costumes like this one , but I have never been so dissapointed in the design or quality . This outfit is frumpy in all the wrong places as well as including a skirt that does n't cover enough in the back for public usage . There are plenty of other lovely costumes by Leg Avenue ... you 're better off choosing something else . It 's not at all as attractive in person as it is in the pictures .
 Poor turn-around and customer service . Do NOT order from this vendor . Was not able to ship one week after placing order from this company . I suggest finding an actual harley location .
 I purchased this wallet for my husband & gave it to him for Christmas ... needless to say he wore it one night & the snap fell off where wallet attaches on belt loop ... this wallet sucks !
 This product contains 3 items
 I purchased the hat for myself and had expected a better quality of product then what I recieved . The material was snagged and it did not fit snugly on my head as advertised . I contacted the supplier and they said they were sorry and I could return the hat although they did not have any other hats to send me . They did not even offer a substitute product . I expected more from the supplier .
 The item had two slices in the left front pocket.We returned it to Fogdog and requested a replacement be shipped and that we did not want a credit.when I next heard from them they said they were issuing a Credit . We sent a e-mail and again said we did not want a credit . The next thing we knew we received a e-mail saying that a credit had been issued . We are NOT HAPPY!Mary Maskill
 On receiving the package , I thought they must have shipped me the wrong product because it was in an envelope . Really , this bag is so flimsy , it fits in an envelope . What else can I say .
 this product was as described , but is lacking in the durability department . It is pretty flimsy and the buckle is made of stamped sheet metal .
 When ordering this belt was expecting a little more . The webbing is not very substantial the buckle does not adjust easily and the measurement was off by about 6 inches . Not highly recommending it .
 Product is NOT 44 &#34; , you would be better off buying from a surplus store , not what I expected at all .
 The belt is so difficult to make work that it is useless . The buckle is cheap , as us the webbing . Do n't waste your money on this one . Seductively priced , but a waste of even a dollar .
 Was way smaller than what I orderd it said 44 inch and was about a 40 inch belt that is why I rated this a 1 star
 I bought this belt for my husband since his then-current canvas belt was getting a little worn and he ca n't wear this one . It might be fine for someone who has a completely flat stomach , but this belt does n't bend or give at ALL ; the stiffness is so bad that it does n't even take 15 minutes for it to loosen up to the point that it 's usefulness is just non-existent . I mean , the only other belts that I know of that are this rigid are brand-new leather belts . I 'm just going to have to really make sure we stick to canvas from now on , which is disappointing since they are so hard to find for less than $ 15 .
 Our civic association purchased this for our annual Easter fest . We were looking more at price than overall effect , and now I am searching for a replacement . The most common comment from the kids is the face is a little scary . Looking for a cuter more cuddly effect . This one also does not cover the back of the neck and the red cords that tie the costume at the back are conspicuous . I would not recommend this one . Spend a little more and get something that will make you very happy year after year .
 I selected this one over the others here because it was n't labeled as small like some others . But it also is too small for an adult head . Wasted my money .

 A `` luxe '' product should have better zippers . It could not stand up to the vigorous kicking of my 5 month old . The zipper broke .
 I bought this while I was pregnant thinking it was cute and practical . My daughter is 6 months old now and I 've still never used it . Its cute and soft , but thats about all . Its just a impulse buy . Swaddling your baby is just as cute , but safer .
 I was very displeased with the product I recieved . It came very late and was not the quality I expected .
 Yes , the 1st time I put this insert in I was amazed ... too bad the 2nd time I tried to wear it I got 1/2 way through dinner and `` pop ! '' the fastner , which is not shown that holds the 2 sides together for enhanced clevage pulled apart.My breasts looked deformed!My husband had to whisper for me to go to the bathroom and correct myself !!!! I tried to replace it and purchased another one -- same thing -- 2nd use and it popped!Would not recommend but for 1 use ! If you are looking for regular wear BEWARE !!
 These are thin and have a sticky back , not noted in promo . Also has a center clip not shown . Not what I expected
 The picture clearly shows two individual silcone pads . They are also very thick to give the appearance that when you wear them , your bust will appear larger.Th esteem I received was extremely thin and both pads were attached with a plastic clasp in the middle . Needless to say , I am extremely disappointed .
 They were not what I excepted at all . I was not pleased with these purchase . They didnt add any size or enhancement . I wont suggest these to anyone .
 These were a waste of money . For anyone needing a little extra help , these do not have much to them . They appear to be pretty thick in the picture but in reality they are very thin and they do n't add much to really even make a difference . I wore them on my wedding day and ended up taking them out 1/2 way through the day because they were just annoying .
 I have a very small frame and wear a 32D . I have a number of underwire Wacoal bras with foam cups that work very well for my size , but this bra is painful to wear . When I first tried it on , I thought I would like it . By the end of the day , I was regretting the purchase . The wires are sized for a much larger framed person than would be able to wear a 32 , so the wires dig up into the flesh under my armpits . The bra is very pretty and the band size is consistent with my other Wacoal 32D bras . The disproportionate length of the wires makes the bra too uncomfortable to wear . I may try to return it , but I do n't think I will be able to now that I have worn it .
 I was extremely dissappointed with this bra and consequently had to return it . The size was way off -LRB- very small -RRB- The quality was not what I am used to in a Wacoal bra .
 I bought this for a special weekend , ad states PLUS SIZE boy is that a lie ! It did n't even fit one breast and I am not that huge . Waste of money seriously !
 I should have listened to the other reviews but I did n't low quality should be 99 cents . Not happy with the BabyDoll I am a size 11-13 and a 38D top was too tiny and panties were as well def not plus sized I was worried it would be too big I was wrong !!!

 The product is way to big for the average adult head . I have a 7 1/4 - 7 1/2 size head . The Knit cap was way too big . It really looks funny . I never wear it because it looks silly . This is for the adult size . It seems others are happy with the youth . Unless you have a HUGE Mellon I would not suggest this purchase
 I was looking for a comfortable bra that I could wear under a camisole top , that would not show `` bra straps '' . I loved the idea of the clear straps and no seam cups.It turns out when I received my order , the bra cups were completely bent and lumpy so you do n't get a smooth look under your top . I wash it hoping the bra cups would smooth out , no luck . Turns out those clear bra straps are very uncomfortable and dig into your skin.For $ 28.00 this item was a complete bust . I would not recommend this item .
 Not as comfortable as advertised . This is a below par product by Lily of France . Construction seams a bit cheap . Amazon 's packaging was poor . They should put some kind of padding for the undergarments instead of tossing them in with everything else . Or place in separate smaller box . Mine came with one cup wrinkled . There were no manufacturer tags on the bra though ? The underwire was still in shape so decided it was not worth the shipping to return a 12.44 product . No original product tags so I was n't sure if it was a used and returned product . Just in case , washed out the product and that also helped with the wrinkled padding .
 3 SECTION MESH HOSIERY / PANTYHOSE WASH PROTECTORTHE PLASTIC TUBING HAS COME OUT OFF ITS CASING . IT HAS POINTED ENDS THAT CATCH ON THE ITEMS THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT . GOOD IDEA BUT NEEDS BETTER CONSTRUCTION AND QUALITY CONTROL .
 Beautiful dress ! Exactly what my daughter was looking for for her wedding . Unfortunately there is no sizing information so will need to go elsewhere .
 ALthough the item was shipped very quickly , I was very disappointed upon receipt . The picture of the item and name of the item indicate that it has dragons embellished on it . It does NOT ! It is plain black . The actual tag on the item depicts a corset with dragons but the name of the item is actually a `` metal boned lace up back corset with underwire cups . '' No mention of dragons at all . Possibly , the seller should consider using the proper name and show an actual picture of the item . At least then , I would have known exactly what I was purchasing . They have a very difficult return policy with restocking fees and no returns on lingerie , which normally I would n't care about and undertand except the item is not the item shown !
 While this costume looks really cute , it is not made correctly . I expected more from Leg Avenue . The top will not sit right on you , and makes the whole costume look funny . The skirt is ok , just really flimsy . The only reason I even put 2 stars is because the thigh highs are really nice and sexy .

 This a very badly made corset the front metal strips tear out cutting your skin not deep but it makes for pretty uncomfortable experance the satain tears out in the sides in genral its a total disapointment I really im dissatisfied
 The masks were sufficient for my purpose AND they looked good . However , they were packaged a a box that was too small so the snouts were smashed when they arrived . They are made of plastic and I was able to push the snouts back out to where they were supposed to be but there were crinkles in the mask as a result . Please note that they are made for children so they are too big to fit most adult heads.They masks arrived within a week of placing the order .
 I purchased one as a gift for my father-in-law . When I would use the software to download pictures to the device , the software would often just terminate and I 'd find myself back at my Windows desktop screen . It does n't happen on all photo folders and I ca n't understand why it does it on some folders , but not others . Brookstone has no real support for the software either . Took me hours to download 60 pictures to the device .
 The software for this device is awful . The manufacturer really needs to get on the ball and resolve these issues . The installation program keeps looking for drivers that are not on my system . I found several missing files by searching the internet but it was an excessive amount of work . The program still does not function correctly and causes our computer to crash . My wife is in tears , this was a Christmas gift from her sister .
 I received this as a Christmas gift . It sure seems like a neat idea to give someone , but I 'll never know because I have a Mac . Really odd that the company does not support a Mac compatible download to fix this -LRB- oversight -RRB- . I only hope my sister likes it : -LRB-
 Got it for grandpa , spent an hour setting it up . And it worked while connected to computer and outlet . but the power button did n't work . So when I went to turn it on it would not do anything.Then I had a second one , and my computer kept flashing warning signs and checking for viruses on an unsafe device . I just do n't trust it and will be returning them both very shortly .
 This wig was terribly made . Most of the hair came out by the time I brushed through it once . There was no structure to how the synthetic hairs were woven . It was a good color , but did not last past two uses . Also there was a huge bump in the back that would n't go down , as well as shortened hairs . It was my worst buy on this site .
 I was expecting a cheap wig when you pay 8 dollars for a wig you do n't expect anything high class however I have found some decent wigs that are cheap . This is not one of them the wig was frizzed out and had static to the point I could n't touch it unless I wanted half the wig to come off with my gloves , just plain nylon gloves mind you . never getting this again
 When it arrived , it was full of tangles and hair keeps shedding all over the place . I suppose the cheap price was a bit too good to be true .
 The wig came on time which made me very happy . But once I took it out and brushed through it once , hair was already falling out . It is a bit frustrating to style a wig when hair is falling in your face . Ca n't say i am pleased with this product . The quality is poor . A purchase that I should not have been made .
 This is a very light weight sweatshirt which is available in many colors , but if you want a quality heavy weight sweatshirt this is not it .

 Proof that you get what you pay for , these low-priced sweatshirts are thin and skimpy . Sweatshirts seem to have taken the same quality nosedive as jeans . Ribbing around collar is especially thin . I am still searching for the real thing .
 I orderd this shirt for my boyfriend in Canada . I knew it would n't get there in time for Christmas , but I did n't know this company would deliver it to the wrong address ! Hell , they delivered it to the wrong country ! When I tried contacting them , they did n't even have to courtesy to reply to any of my emails . I will NEVER buy from them again and I would n't recommend anyone buying from them if you want your items delivered to the right place . I hope whoever recieved it enjoys it , because my boyfriend never will . Nothing like paying good money for nothing !!!!!!!
 paid double what i found at another site outside of amazon/this store - NEVER AGAIN !
 First , the shipping and packaging . Very poor for both . Shipping was far too long . I waited almost two weeks to get the four sweatshirts that I ordered . The packaging was in a plastic bag which was okay , however the sweatshirts were just stuffed into the bag . All of them were dirty and needed to be washed right away . They looked like they had been stored in someones garage or worse ... in the trunk of somebody 's car . I would be very surprised if I discovered Fashion Rack was a real store and not some roadside vendor.Second , I ordered XL and glad I did . I normally wear a large , but after receiving four dirt and dust covered sweatshirts and laundering them , they shrunk to just about a Large size . I 'm not sure what will happen with the next laundering . If they shrink more they will be too small and unwearable.The material is very light . This is fine with me . Others may not like a light sweatshirt . It wo n't keep you warm in very cold climates.All in all , I got what I paid for . A cheap sweatshirt .
 Problem is - I do not know how I like this product because I received sweatpants and a sweatshirt . Can you help me with the return ? There was no paperwork mailed in the package received
 This is a beautiful case . The leather is buttery soft . It also matches perfectly with the lining and leather of my Coach Chelsea handbag . However , the case is extremely small . With five business cards in each side of the case , it does not close properly . I 'm not sure what this could really be used for effectively . Credit cards do n't fit at all ; they 're too large for the sleeve.So , unfortunately , while it is gorgeous , I have yet to find a practical use for it due to the size .
 I bought these for my 12 and 10 year old grandsons - for the beach this summer . The description did not say exactly how small they were ! They were way too small for their heads . Should have had in your supply and description - sizes
 I ordered the wrong product , too small for what I was looking for . Needed big butt cheeks for Halloween and this did n't do it . Also , you ca n't sit because the buns are hallow and will leave dents . It was n't expensive , so it was n't too much of a loss .
 Not very good quality and keeping them straight was a pain . I am guessing by plus sized they meant 3lbs overweight .
 The seller never notified me that the item was out of stock . They notified me that the item was not available when I called to check on the status of shipping ... 17 days after I ordered it . Very poor customer service . I do n't know what the actual product was like because I never received it .
 This jacket looks good from afar but the quality isnt all that great . The zipper broke on mine within 2 days of wearing and there are loose strings coming out all over . The sizing is very european and 3x really means 2x . I wont buy Kappa again Im goin back to addidas and Nike they are much better quality
 I had only two bucks in my account so i bought this . I broke it 5 minutes after i got it . and shipping was `` okay '' . You get what you pay for .
 I got this as a prop for a play and actually bought two because many of the reviews talked about them breaking . My first one broke during the first rehearsal , and the second one broke during the second rehearsal . And we were trying to be careful with them . I 'd hoped that we could get a few uses out of it , despite the bad reviews , but I was wrong . Try to find something else , if you can . Or plan on reinforcing it .
 This product lasted all of 10 minutes . I actually bought two just in case one did break and neither lasted more than 10 minutes . Really , you look at these things and they break . Very poor quality materials . I was very disappointed by the product , but they were very inexpencive and you get what you pay for .
 it 's just ... bad . It 's so tiny with such a huge handle . . its ... bloody useless . It has a spring in it . . which probably will break with enough use . I was going to use this for a film . It 's the most UN-intimidating thing I 've ever seen in my life .
 The knife blade snapped off after only three uses . Very flimsy and not at all what we expected it would be .
 This broke less than 24 hours after opening and we were not rough with it at all . Terrible . The seller was very fast to ship though ... product just was awful , in this case anyway .
 So flimsy and cheap dollar store type product . The FIRST time it came open for my lil grandson held it and opened it . Into the garbage it went . ; -LRB- JUNK !
 WORST KNIFE EVER IT BROKE AS SOON AS I TOOK IT OUT OF ITS CASE . THIS IS GARBAGE DO NOT BUY THIS . WASTE OF MONEY . WASTE OF MONEY .
 But I know it was cheap so I guess I got what I paid for . I was just hoping it would last more than a few days .
 My son merrily stabbed this trick knife for about ten minutes until I heard him shriek &#34; Stupid Dollar Store piece of crap ! &#34; Thankfully , we did not lose the spring and were able to Duck tape it together . Very junky , but still a fair add-on item for free shipping .
 What did I expect when purchasing this item at the price I bought them for ? Exactly what I got , but I figured they would n't break getting them out of the package . I used super glue and tape , but the spring gets stuck on something on the inside as well and quits working , but if you squeeze on the handle from the side , then that will reset the spring and it will work again for a few . I bought two for each of my boys and they do have fun with them until they mess up again and then I fix them . If you do n't wa n't to hassle with repairing all the time then I would pass .
 I did n't expect much with this item which turned out to be a good thing since I did not get much . It broke the second my son tested it out on his little sister . It was only supposed to go with his Halloween costume so we ended up returning it and not bothering to get another .
 It looks soo fake i hate it i should have noy bought it it sucks dont get it people no kid not worth it .
 Even though this knife was inexpensive , it was a piece of crap . Amazon should take it off site.Broke on first use , both of them .
 I understand this is a toy knife , there is no reason for it to be this bad . I only had it for a couple hours before this knife broke . The spring came flying out , I can see how this can be a choking hazard . Overall this is the worst gag toy that I 've ever bought . I do n't know how people are rating it like its the best thing ever since the creation of the internet , really people come on . The dollar store sells better toys than this . The only thing good about this product was that I got it promptly , shipping was quick .
 Pure junk . . do n't waste your money . My son was excited to receive this gift and it broke an hour after use . He is 15 and was careful with it and it just plain busted .
 after some time , this order was canceled by either amazon or the vendor . We never did receive it .
 I bought what I thought was 3 packages of gold toe socks from this website for $ 10 . What I got was 3 pairs of socks-that 's $ 10 per pair , when the retail price on the tag was $ 5 ! . When I complained to Amazon , I got an email back telling me that I was receiving a refund of $ 15 , so now I was paying exactly the retail price on the socks-but only getting 3 pair when I needed 9 pair . I wrote back and never got any response.Be warned ! Now I see that they are doing the same thing . $ 5 socks are being advertised at 3 for $ 7.50 , but if you check carefully when you try to buy them , you are really agreeing to pay $ 7.50 per pair for $ 5 socks.Since Amazon is refusing to respond to my follow up complaint , I guess I will have to buy the other six pair of socks from a different website or go to my local store to buy them . Incredible !
 These socks came with a manufacturer tag showing the price as 3 for $ 12 . The socks are fine -LRB- although a little thinner than I expected -RRB- , but there are surely better values around .

 just letting you know the eagle is facing the wrong way . I was in the 101st and I take that as a little bit of a insult
 This visor is square in shape instead of oval , I have never seen a square visor before . It looks very strange . Also , it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be , it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head . I will not be wearing mine .
 This visor is unbelievably bad . Most visors are actually curved to fit around your forehead and have soft terry cloth against your skin . Not this visor . This visor has the thin nylon fabric that covers the brim against your forehead , and under that , right in the middle of your forehead , is a raised hard block about 2 '' long by 1 '' high -LRB- with no curve what-so-ever to this 2 '' block -RRB- which is positioned and pushed right into the middle of your forehead . I have no idea what the purpose or reason for this block of hard plastic is . You really have to see it to believe it . It is absolutely the most uncomfortable visor , hat or other item that I have ever worn on my head . It is a total waste of money . How they can possibly call this a `` no headache '' visor is totally beyond me . It gives me an instant headache and is way more uncomfortable than the cheap visors from Target or Walmart that often feel too tight and uncomfortable after an hour or so . I ca n't wear this for more than 15 minutes without being in real , actual pain . It even leaves a clearly visible red indentation in the middle of my forehead . I would return this instantly if I bought it from a store . But having to pay for the shipping both ways makes it not worth returning . I 'm going to just through it in the trash . At least I got a few laughs when I showed it to friends on a recent cruise and let them try on my `` no headache '' visor . Would give it 0 stars if I could .
 The satiny fabric covering the visor is nice , but it is basically inexpensive plastic underneath and breaks easily . Additionally , under the fabric in the upper middle of the visor , there is a `` ledge '' of sorts , which leaves a very visible DENT in your forehead when you take the visor off . I do not recommend this product .
 It 's un comfortable and hurt my forehead . It 's stiff and unpleasant to wear . I would not buy it again . In fact , i had to buy another visor to repplace it .
 Bought a new one . It arrived falling apart at the seams and definitely causes headaches . Hurts to wear for more than 5 minutes .

 Beware the black model of this holder stains cards . I have to keep the top and bottom card in it at all times because the material -LRB- some sort of faux leather -RRB- rubs off on the white cards . Might not be an issue on cheaper cards , but on high end ones beware .
 Seems ok quality and all . Probably a good sorting hat . I was really disappointed that it did n't have a face though . It was kinda hard to tell it was a sorting hat . Looked more like a tattered brown witches hat . I would n't have bought it if I knew .
 Nice socks , great light weight , stay up well , but got a hole near the ankle about a week after purchase and one washing , which was disappointing . I thought they would be more durable .
 Product Description says Heavy Weight , but I 've seen many of these that are much , much heavier . More like a light-to-medium weight .
 The hat is nicely made except the feathers were not protected and are broken in half . Amazon does not allow for an exchange . Also the feather shown in the picture is not what is shipped with the hat . They are skinny and short . disappointing .
 This hat has several problems .1 . It is not as pictured in many ways . The green checkerboard band under the brim -LRB- which is fairly faithful to the movie in the product shot -RRB- is a solid , bright , kelly green on the hat I received .2 . The hat will not stand up , no matter what I try
 First thing the sizing of this company is UNIQUE !!! the size that the model is wearing in the pic . is probably a Medium ... because i got medium and it actully fits tight although i order small every where else ... and the material is very thin . . the fish net thats at the back got torn while i was tring to close the back !!! so ... dont recommend it
 seemed much smaller then I thought it would be . I ca n't use it but it would be great for a child .
 These T 's are a bit on the small side and the cotton is not as soft and does n't have the thread count I am used to in Hanes.Usually I like these T 's but they seem small and less comfortable than my past experience with these shirts .
 this t-shirt arrived squished/rolled into a ball put in a dry cleaners plastic and then boxed in a tiny carton . I had 2 steam iron it twice , then wash it upon which the pink faded then tried again to iron the wrinkles . . it looked like a rag which I am now using it as such
 Xl was more like a large . It was rolled up and shoved in a wrapper . The xxl that I bought separate was the right size and folded nicely .
 I have three very old Hanes black tees , two of which are now so worn they have to be consigned to the rag bin . Hate to do it ; I love those shirts . But after maybe eight years of wear I guess it 's time . So I ordered 4 replacements and they arrived today . Hanes should be pretty red-faced about continuing to call these Beefy-T shirts . Nothing beefy about them , they are pretty lightweight . Certainly not as heavy as the old shirts . But worse , and why I 'm sending them back , is the uneven stitching in the shoulder . One badly stitched shoulder on each of two shirts . The material does n't lie flat but appears to `` bubble '' up near the collar . Looks bad . Sorry , Hanes , you had it but you lost it . I guess a $ 7 tee shirt is too much to hope for anymore .
 I 'm an average build size medium ; not overweight nor athletic build . I used to buy a Hanes pocket t-shirt which fit just great ; a generous cut which allowed freedom of arm motion and a slight drape off the shoulder which did n't cling to the body , allowing some air space between the shirt and my skin . This size is not the same as the medium of these beefy t-shirts . These newer Hanes products are very form fitting and more of an athletic cut ; tight around the shoulders and chest and draping close to the skin . The chest width as measured at the armpit is 20 '' whereas the older version was 21-21 .5 '' , resulting in a big difference in fit . The old size is in between the new medium and large . The newer medium is too tight and the large is , well , too roomy for a good look . The color palette is super but the fit is not the same as it used to be for size medium ; the older size does n't exist anymore so be aware of that when you order .
 I ordered this shirt and it showed up rolled up into a ball and stuffed into a clear plastic bag . No original Hanes packaging at all . After opening there was a bunch of loose threads hanging off . Definitely makes me suspect of the whole thing . There is a Hanes logo screen printed in it , but since there 's no packaging , who knows if it really is Hanes or not . I also found the neck hole larger than other tshirts I own . Disappointed , but since it was only $ 10 I 'll just keep it for painting or something .
 Good loose fit and heavy material , But loose threads that pull out after first washing . Poor construction - made in Haiti .
 Nice socks , great light weight , stay up well , but got a hole near the ankle about a week after purchase and one washing , which was disappointing . I thought they would be more durable .
 Jeans looks good on the outside but lots of loose threads on the inside and holes in one of the pockets , large enough for my thumb to fit through.jeans is shoddy .
 I 've worn mostly Levi 's my entire life but have become frustrated with their new trend toward the lightweight cloth jeans meant more for the NY trendy crowd than Indiana working class people that actually use their jeans to work in . So , I gave these jeans a try and while they are still a lighter weight material its a lot closer to the old style jeans . On me at least , the size , length and waist were true to my sizes also.I do have one pet peeve though , who comes up with the color names for these things ? Autumn ?? And they are blue , since when is Autumn and blue synonymous ? I think Autumn I think browns or oranges!Overall , a very nice pair of jeans from Wrangler , just pick better color names.Update-05 / 06 I had to come back and change my rating in this product . I do n't like the fact that after a month two of the belt loops had come unstitched at one end making me cut off the loops to make the jeans look presentable . I do n't wear a belt so I dont get why this would happen . Very disappointing .
 The feel and fit of these jeans are just fine , however I have had 3 of the belt loops pull out of the jean material , with less than 2 months of wear . I sewed the first one back on but noticed after a few more washes that 2 more were pulling out . the part where the belt loops are attached at the bottom is not reinforced , causing this issue in my case . I would keep these jeans based on the material , but without the loops they are useless to me .
 These jeans fit well and look great , but I noticed when I first received them that they did n't seem to be made from the usual durable denim that Wrangler uses -- it was thinner and softer . It made for a very comfortable fit , but within 2 weeks -LRB- several wears -RRB- , I had caught the belt loop on something and tore out a chunk of fabric as the belt loop became dislodged . The stitching was much stronger than the denim . I 've had a number of pairs of Wrangler jeans for many years and never had the denim tear out like that before . So if you 're easy on your jeans and want a great , comfortable fit , then these are good . But if you want that and the typical durability of denim , then I recommend looking at other styles ... other Wranglers , even . Just not this version .
 I ordered this and another pair of the same style but different color . I am quite happy with the other pair , but this one has much to be desired . First , this pair fit much looser than the other one , and I almost returned it for that reason . Now I wish that I had because the corners of the back pockets now have holes that make the jeans only suitable for mowing the lawn . I have only had them about 8 months so I am not happy about it .
 It 's a shame for a brand with a worldwide reputation . They sent me jeans , without a button on the right pocket . ...
 Jeans were in great condition , fast shipping , nice color wash . However , we purchased them for my husband because of the &#34; Loose Fit &#34; . Fit him really well in the waist , but the legs were still on the tight side and not loose at all . So we had to return them . We were hoping they were similar to the Wrangler 's Loose Fit style we used to buy -LRB- not made anymore -RRB- but they were n't close .
 They are supposed to have room , but they seem extremely tight and crowd the sacred area .
 i ordered two Kufis -LRB- 1 white - 1 black -RRB- last year and have yet to wear them because the brim is short and does not cover enough of my head . if the brim were 1 or 1 1/2 inches longer , in my opinion , it would be a much better looking hat on ones head . also , are there other colors or designs available with the size stated ?? the kufis i received are too large and have to be made smaller to fit . i wear kufis exclusively that fit size 23 inches and want to see others ...
 The item quality is good but it is not the same bag as advertised . My review ; it is deceptive advertising and a major pain trying to return an item to amazon they fall very short in the user friendly website department .
 my 2 and 5 years olds do like this toy and to carry it around but other than that , the one piece fell off so it does n't hold the disks and the voice activated commands never worked
 My son got this for Christmas and it broke the next day . The little lion head that holds the disks in place broke off . He was n't rough with it , it just is n't constructed very well . It is still a fun toy , and he likes to carry it around .
 My daughter is 3 years old and 40 inches tall and around 40 pounds . All 4T clothes fit her but this was both too snug and too short . The design is very cute but the material is like tissue it 's so cheap . The worst part were the ears . I read a review that they were small , and I thought that meant that the ears were like pictured just teeny round ears . In fact , the ears look NOTHING like the picture . The are seriously two humps that are about an inch high . Not circles , more like flat hills . I 'm not exaggerating . Had to return it because it was $ 26 , but if I saw it in person first I would n't have paid more than $ 5 . I 'm really surprised that Disney sponsors this outfit . They must have forgotten to look at the ears , or else they wanted to make sure that parents would have to go to the store to buy ones that are n't as ridiculously inadequate .
 I ordered this costume for my two year old and it arrived today . I read previous reviews about the costume running small so I bought the 3T-4T size , this is a little big for her but the 2T would n't have fit at all . The costume is cute but I agree with other reviewers , the quality is pretty bad -LRB- threads hanging out in multiple places -RRB- and part of the costume is torn -LRB- the top part and the bottom part have detached -RRB- . I do n't have time to send this back and wait for a new one so I 'm going to fix it myself . The costume will do the job for this year but I doubt it 'll last longer than this weekend . I guess you get what you pay for . Also , not sure if it 's comfortable or not , my daughter wore it for about 5 minutes and then asked for it to be taken off .
 I edited this review after dealings with the seller . My son got this for his birthday and wore it for just under an hour before two holes appeared in the crotch area - 1 large , 1 small . I contacted the seller as the costume is clearly defective.Seller responded that they do not accept returns for items that have been worn ! However they graciously offered 10 % to cover cost of materials to repair . Yeah right - $ 2.40 ??? 1 - gas to a store for material will cost more than that . 2 - material will cost even more . 3 - I do n't sew so how am I going to repair it ??? Material is cheap and nasty , seller has NO customer service . I have filed a claim with Amazon.Buyer beware ...
 I feel the hat is too stiff even after washing . The photo shows a rounded hat whereas it 's -LRB- or at least the one I recieved ! -RRB- not really at all . Just okay - I probably wo n't wear it .
 It 's only a hat but it has no form like in the picture . I may wear it when I get to be old .
 I bought three tanks like this from the Danski site , and they did not fit well . As I try to return them by shipping them back , a woman who claimed to be the manager refused my claim because I did not have the tags on the items . I told her I had been shopping with various clothing companies and none of them requires tags . She says `` Oh , our product is made overseas . '' Then what company has their clothes made in the U.S. nowadays ? I told her that it is not acceptable that she refuses my return for this very reason . She went on , `` then ill just have to donate your clothes to the charity ! `` Need I say more?Oh , before this incident ever happened , I also got an invitation on my email to write a review about the product . So i wrote about how the tank did not fit me on their website . Guess what , they never make it public . only the good reviews go alive . What trustworthy company !
 I bought two of these bags after reading good reviews to give as gifts for my little brothers . Both the bags had dirt stains on the light blue part and they were very visible . At first I thought it was part of the design , but it was n't . It was clear that these were either old bags left in a place where they could accumulate dust or they were manufacturing defects . They looked like a good deal since they were cheap but ended up being a big disappointment . I could not return the bags because I only found out the defects after i had left the US and was in India . I could take them back and return them but it 's a hell of a painful process to take them back to the US . So , I guess I will just let the seller save some money and get away with poor customer service . :-LRB- I only wish the seller had checcked the bags before sending them , this experience has drastically reduced my trust on the quality of products on amazon or atleast by this seller .
 I was expecting to make a good deal but no . I received the backpack with brown stains on the light blue parts . It looks like the bag was stored in a dirty warehouse . I read a previous review saying that their bag had also those stains . I thought it was an accident but 2 customers receiving stained bags ... it 's not an accident ! -LRB- Note
 This backpack looked great , and it seems to have worked well for many others . Sadly , for us , it started to lose seams after just a couple days of use . My wife did n't put overly too much stuff in it , but it still did n't hold up . Anyway , while the item was n't very good , Amazon.com took awesome care of us and we were able to get a complete refund .
 The waist straps are simply too light wight to allow transfer of the weight of the backpack 's contents to one 's hips . What attracted us to this backpack was that it was designed to transfer some of the weight from the shoulders to the hips , but the backpack was not sufficiently sturdy .
 I purchased this backpack for my son 's senior year in High School . He has used the same one -LRB- a Nike brand -RRB- for the previous 4 years very successfully but I thought that since he now carries a laptop that he should have something more geared to that , for protection.He got less than 2 weeks of active use out of it before a strap completely broke off , and that 's being fairly generous with the time line.Horrible quality , will never purchase from them again.Off to look for something that will actually last for at least a year of schooling .
 after some time , this order was canceled by either amazon or the vendor . We never did receive it .
 i do n't care for this product . I already own a pair of Russell Athletic Sweatpants which fit this same description . The big difference is the blend of cotton/poly . In the first pair I purchased the blend was 65 % cotton/35 % poly , they were also labeled Premier . this second pair , which i purchased off of amazon , are 50/50cotton/poly , and they are n't nearly as durable and comfortable as the premier pair . i am trying to resell the 50/50 blend pair rt now on ebay .
 Reading the description , I thought they would be more substantial -LRB- more than likely good for light workouts -RRB- . DOES NOT RUSSELL MAKE THICK , LONG-LASTING SWEATS ANYMORE ??
 They are fine and just what I was looking for , but after the first wash and dryer exposure they shrunk a bit particularly in length . So , if you are a large probably should consider the X-large considering the shrinkage .
 As per usual the delivery time for most things through amazon is speedy , sometimes damn impressive even without paying extra for expediteted shipping ... As for the product though ... I 'm not sure if it 's just me , but when I think of `` sweatpants '' , I tend to have an image in mind of a fairly thick and durable material with a nice stretchy waistband ... What I got was basically paper thin medium quality pants , and the drawstring broke the second time I wore them ... I 'd pass on these unless you ca n't afford other leggings to cover you 're own arse .
 These sweats have a simple flaw
 These pants are THIN . No warmth whatsoever . Great on a hot summer day , but not in moderate temperatures . You 'll freeze ! Not worth the 13.99 for such thin material .
 Had I had know that these pants would be so big -LRB- I ordered a large -RRB- , I would have ordered a size smaller . Besides this , they are very thin and cheap ! No wonder they could not get retail price for them which is ridiculously expensive . I am sending these back immediately .
 These are 50 % polyester ... NOT all cotton . Ultra cheap construction , drawstring is not continuous , and broke in one day of use .
 They were so thin , I had to return them ! I bought them for my son , for the fall but they are way too thin .
 There a comfortable set of light weight sweatpants but there cheaply made . I had bought three pairs of there 's and with in a month the draw strings have come out the back off two off them . Only buy them if you plan on sleeping in them . Why ca n't they just make it a draw string and not a loop .
 I bought these sweatpants intending to use them as sleepwear and occasionally to hit the gym . I am an average white guy - 5 ' 11 '' , 195lbs - and bought my usual size . The good news is that the waistband fits and they are comfortable , the bad news is the pant leg is easily long enough for someone 6 ' 8 '' or larger . They drape over any shoes I wear and cause me to slip on my tile floors when I 'm getting ready for bed . Not at all what I was hoping for . If you are a taller guy in need of some light sweatpants , I would definitely recommend these . Everyone else should steer clear .
 Once upon a time , Russell was a good quality manufacturer of athletic wear but they 've gotten cheap like everyone else . The waists run very big on these pants , which is contrary to previous versions , and the drawstrings are much flimsier - I can see some people breaking them if they pull too hard . The stitching on the insides of the waists is very sparse and spaced far apart , and you 're able to see some of the waistband material after a few washes - I do foresee these pants falling apart in a relatively short time because I see holes by the pockets after six weeks . The pant legs are extremely long and people will step on the back of the pants and ruin them . The crotch area is VERY long and you have to wear these up to your armpits to get the crotch right and keep the pant legs from dragging . I believe these were a labeling mistake by Russell , that they 're considered a tall/long , and they sold them for pennies on the dollar to Amazon - Amazon , in turn , does n't say anything either and sells them for full price as regular length pants for amazing profit percentage - think about it - the legs are WAY too long , the crotch is WAY too long , and the waists are WAY too big - they both benefit - Russell gets rid of mistakes and Amazon makes a killer profit . Have stranger things happened ? Sure they have ...
 it 's taken me a while to write this because of my frustration . 1/2 of the seams are inside out which makes it look as if i 've gotten dressed in the dark ! these have to be among the worst exercise pants i 've ever purchased . i 'm embarrassed when i wear then . i would have appreciated knowing how poor the workmanship was beforehand - but that never would have happened
 Description says these are cotton . Says nothing about a blend . When received , discovered these are 50 % blend -LRB- that means 50 % polyester ! -RRB- . I need cotton . I need to send them back , unfortunately . What a waste of time .
 I just received these sweatpants 2 days ago and have worn them twice . I was looking for some light-weight , comfortable sweatpants with pockets , which is what I received . The fabric is soft and the picture provides an accurate representation of the item . The pants seem sized larger than expected -LRB- in both measurements -RRB- , although it 's possible they would shrink to the given size in the wash.Sadly , I forgot to include the basics , like quality of build , in my criteria . The first time I wore these sweatpants , the drawstring disconnected from the back of the waistline . After that , I was able to completely remove the drawstring from the waistband . I wish I could say that I unduly stressed the cord , but I was basically just re-positioning the waist.I will not be going with the same item again .
 Wrong color , order black and got all grey , wrong color ordered black got grey , wrong color , will be returning asap
 This is my first review ever . I 've always felt that Russell athletics made quality workout clothes at a good price , until those sweatpants ! These are by far the worse fitting sweatpants I 've ever tried , unless you tie them around your neck and stick your arms out of the pockets I ca n't imagine them fitting anyone properly .
 There not really want I was wanting and the strings break why to easy and they get wholes way to easy also
 like sandpapernot real soft cottongave me the heebee geebees
 These are listed as 100 % cotton in the description but the graphite and grey heather colors are 50 % and 52 % polyester respectively .
 These pants were so thin my husband refused to try them on and returned them . Held up to the light they were see-thru .
 This product indicates 100 % cotton . When received I discovered it was 50/50 cotton/polyester . Since i am allergic to polyester , I had to return the item/s as I ordered 2 pair . I have not heard from the company yet in 6 weeks for a refund . Do I pay shipping on a poorly described item?I hope not ...
 These are not the fleece sweatpants that you find in stores . They are thin and clingy and much more poly than cotton . I tried one pair and now both pairs that I bought are on their way to Goodwill .
 I called the Amazon rep. I just got my pants and the Oxford color is 58 % polyester and 42 % cotton and the Graphite color is 50 % cotton and 50 % polyester.I was looking for 100 % cotton track pants and were disappointed.So the description of the pants which says 100 % cotton is wrong and is to be corrected .
 Bought a whole bunch of these in black , grey , and blue . Loved the open leg , light material . HOWEVER , they are imports , and they must be produced in a country of midgets . They are over-generously proportioned in the legs and seat , but a medium pant ought to have a leg inseam in the 32 '' in range . These are about 28 '' after the first washing -52 % poly/42 % cotton . Steve Urkle would be proud to wear them , but I 'll be turning them into shorts - heck they 're already knickers . Additionally , Russell has no customer service to speak of . Their web site listed outdated phone numbers . An email to their sales rep , and a phone call to an answering machine at the corporate office for the Southern Division -LRB- since the northeast 's numbers were non-functional -RRB- resulted in no response . I always had good luck with their product , but I would n't buy from them again after this .
 I will re-affirm what a lot of other reviews said . I am an average sized girl 5 ' 5 130 pounds and ordered a S/M based on my measurements -LRB- 34-27-36 , size 6 -RRB- and the size chart . The skirt is not even close to being big enough to fit over my hips . I tried it on and the zipper broke as soon as I touched it . The top is alright , a little too big . If you still want to order this , size up . The top is way easier to adjust than the skirt . Hopefully I can somehow make it work with a broken zipper .
 I ordered this outfit because I thought it was fairly inexpensive , but also cute -LRB- in picture -RRB- . I ordered a size xs which is for sizes 0-2 . I got the product and the skirt was a perfect fit , but quite long . The bows and tie were pretty cute , but the tie is sewn the wrong way , so it 'll always look crooked . The top however , is just bad . It was waaay too big , which did n't make sense since the skirt was so small . The width of the top was just soo wide . I definitely ca n't wear the top . So I sewed the entire top myself , it 's a little better , but I still ca n't wear it out . I 'm just going to have to find my own schoolgirl top somewhere else .
 Skirt is extremely small . Top fits fine . This was a christmas gift and when I tried to return it they refused because it was out of the 7 day window . Who orders a christmas gift , gives it to someone and can get it returned within 7 days if it does n't fit .
 The top was 2x way too big on me , which , okay , I can manage around that , I am small up top , but the skirt was way too small . Shame , it is such a cute outfit , my husband would of loved it !
 Nice socks , great light weight , stay up well , but got a hole near the ankle about a week after purchase and one washing , which was disappointing . I thought they would be more durable .
 With so many `` free shipping , '' even `` free shipping and free returns '' offers out there , do n't make the same mistake I did by buying from Luggage Warehouse . Not only does the Luggage Warehouse make the customer pay shipping both ways ; they even charge an additional $ 5 if you 're unhappy with the product and want to return it . -LRB- To be fair , their $ 5 restocking fee policy is in the fine print , but I missed it . The `` customer service '' -- ha -- representative just told me I should feel bad for them , not the other way around , because they have to pay fees to sell their merchandise on Amazon and now , thanks to me , they 're going to lose money on this purchase . -RRB-
 Purchased this item 30 days ago and have it shipped to Singapore . The design is beautiful and user friendly . Unfortunately , for a leather product , I was surprised that the sewing of the leather around the key joint between the main case and padded shoulder strap was torn apart . That was my first usage after receiving the parcel from Samsonite . Would not recommend this product without a thorough look at it . Now , I have no idea how am I going to make a claim since this item is only available in the USA with a 03 years warranty . Waiting for Samsonite USA reply . Sad ...
 Could n't find the bag I wanted at Wilson Leather -LRB- great value briefcases -RRB- , so I bought this bag instead . The shoulder strap seam separated and the strap was not usable . Samsonite would not exchange it or fix it and I was told that they did n't warranty the bag and that I had to send it back to the manufacturer . They did offer to take the bag back if I bought another bag for 20 % off . Pay for 2 bags and get 1 ? I do n't think so . I had the bag resewn at a shoe repair store . The bag is poor quality - it has no structure to it . I could buy a similar quality bag for half the price . Stay away from Samsonite bags . Buy from Wilson leather - I have for 20 years . Too bad they did n't have my style case .
 I purchased this in size small , it has huge cups that are definately not for a small busted person . it looks ridiculous .
 I bought this so that I could tuck it away when not in use , so on the first rainy day , it was more like a shower , I thought I would give it a try , I must of received a defective one because mine would n't stay open , and when it did , it buckled under the smallest amount of wind and turned inside out , I am now attempting to return it but am having the hardest time trying to get the seller to email me a return code and hopefully a pre-paid label .
 Please change your model , it 's the lamest thing I 've seen in my entire life . I really want to buy these but I can due to the lameness of the model .
 The picture does not resemble the hat at all . It does n't even have a puffball at the end . The cotton is cheap but it still works with simple outfits and is fashionable . It just looks nothing like the picture .

 I paid $ 13.48 for it . It 's worth maybe $ 1.50 . Just a slight step above the birthdayparty 99 cent hat . I did n't expect a real fireman 's hat but for $ 13.48 I did expecta much better hat .
 this shorts are good but they are to tight i ware a 34w and that is what i got but they make these way deferent i would need a 36 or 38
 when i got this shirt i was happy , cause it is one sick looking shirt.two weeks later , today , and i am very dissappointed . the material is very thin , and it rips very easily . there is a fat hole under my right armpit . this shirt is cheap . DONT BUY IT
 Nice socks , great light weight , stay up well , but got a hole near the ankle about a week after purchase and one washing , which was disappointing . I thought they would be more durable .
 The concept is great and I used them on 1 trip , but after opening and closing twice during the trip , the seams came apart so the compression aspect was lost .
 OVer priced , can get equal product at local stores that will do the same for half the price.This product is way over priced and the functionality is still in question , I will know more after my trip .
 Lots of reviews warned this type of shoulder pad was too large under most fashions . Yes , unfortunately this is true . They are much too large and do not stay in place very well , so this was not a great purchase for me . But on the up side , the seller sent them very quickly !
 These shoulder pads are ENORMOUS ! I called to exchange and was put on hold for atleast 10 minutes . The seller , Lauren Silva , has a lousy return policy . They will not let you exchange your item which means you have to pay full shipping again , which is overpriced to begin with . Normally I do not do negative reviews however I would like to save you all from grief . I would not purchase from this company again !
 This wig is so bad !! It looks nothing like the picture , and the hair is n't even long enough to make it look like the picture.The wig is so small it does not even fit over my head -LRB- which is quite average -RRB- . Of course it ca n't be returned because it is a wig.I lost money on this wig , 'cause it went in the trash . Buy this one , and you will be sorry !!

 Okay , so maybe 50 pounds is a slight exageration but these jeans definately made me look chunky and figure-less . They did nothing for me at all . I am 5 ' 9 '' , have a 34.5 inseam , a short torso and generally wear a size 8-10 . I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size smaller because they are super duper stretchy -LRB- which I do n't like -- a little stretch is good -RRB- but it did n't help . I have a curvy figure and these jeans actually made my butt look flat ! Not Good . I 'm sending them back because even though they were $ 14 , they 're still not worth the price .
 If you take a size 8 get a 6 MINIMUM ... they run BIGNot my `` cup of tea '' -
 so thin , when it rains it may be a good choice if u do n't have a raincoat .

 The product in itself is great , good crisp picture not an iron on so will last through many washings , but my major flaw with this product is n't the product so much as the sizes . The seller of these shirts needs to better understand sizes and the groups they belong to . I ordered an Extra Large figuring it would fit me a woman who likes to breath in my clothes lets say and allow for shrinkage in wash . What they neglected to say was it was a Jr. . Ex Large . Something I have not been since 7th grade . The sizing button did not work something I wish had as I would have liked a chart explaining sizes . I think it should be with all clothing products , a size chart , even it it 's just chest measurements at least explain without going to a page that may not work , put sizes these clothes fit . I have resolved to keeping this shirt in hopes one day a grand child will wear it . Only have to wait oh 8 more years .
 Good quality for the price , just did n't like the fit . Odd seam up the back -LRB- center -RRB- of the leg/buttocks .
 Highly disappointed with this mask . The feathers appear to be hurriedly placed and are falling off . Glue can be seen at different places on the mask . The headband does not help the mask to stay on properly . It was also too big for my face . Not worth the money .
 It arrived with the feathers bent and placed funny ... the mask fit weird and the head band looked strange ... eh not much else to say ... this is the first item ive ordered from amazon that I 'm sending back
 The color is misleading as well . It looks like a very light gold from the picture but it is a very deep metallic gold in person . I would have been fine with that if the mask had come unbroken . This item came today with broken feathers due to the fact that it was not packaged correctly . It was put into a box with only the plastic packing the mask was surrounded by -LRB- which is too small for the mask in the 1st place -RRB- . When I opened the box and upon further inspection , 2 feathers were broken and quite a few were bent . My friend placed a similar order for another style mask which had larger feathers and they had put Storopacks around the mask to ship it safely -LRB- hers came unharmed -RRB- .
 This mask is too big for my face . The headband attachment does not look good . It is a thick black headband attached to the mask by clear strips of plastic . For the mask to fit on my adult sized head the headband had to be far behind my ears . Not pleased . Product would be better with elastic to hold on face .
 I really did n't like it at all . It was extremely big on me , and the feather 's kept bugging me and they were too big . It also looks really cheap in person .
 My head was to big for the mask . also the feather and beads kept falling off . besides that it was a nice design
 Although this product is inexpensive I still thought it would be better than this . The inside was dirty with white spots on the leather . Some of the slots for the credit cards were not large enough for a regular sized card . All in all it is a very cheap wallet . Looks like I bought it off the street .
 I washed it one time the white puma mark get darker and small white spot appears on the shirt.Do ' t buy this product . this is not original puma
 I think this bra would work better for someone with a larger bust size than mine . I ordered a 32b , which fit ok , but the shape of the bra gives me a more pointy shape under a shirt than I would have liked . I think it is because it squishes my chest very close in . I ended up ordering another brand of sports bra that is on its way .
 i bought this dress in a size meduim . it was sent to me at a size 38 . it was way to big and i needed it for an important event . not only that i sent it back and still have yet to receive a refund . i am very disappointed in this product . it was an awful experience and i will never shop with a foreign company again . -LRB- everything was sent in chinese which mad it even more difficult to send back -RRB- two thumbs way down !
 it looks like a cute dress in the picture but I bought it and I have never seen a more homely or more cheaply made dress . I would return it but they make it impossible to return .

 My husband purchased this for me in September as a anniversary gift . The slippers came in October . They are awful slippers . Very uncomfortable . The robe did n't show up until November after several emails and complaints . They sent the wrong color so the robe does n't even match the slippers . The color they sent was teal and very ugly . It was a size small but very big for me . It fit more like a medium . I kept the robe even though the color is awful and it 's a little big because it is comfortable . Since I wont be using slippers I suppose it does n't matter that they do not match . I would have sent the set back for a return but who knows how long -LRB- if ever -RRB- it would take for a refund or exchange . I do n't want to risk it . I highly recommend a down robe , they are very nice . Just find another store to order from .
 Strike 1
 Despite having a nice rich tone , these strings refuse to settle-in and maintain pitch even after 3 weeks , the G string seemingly the worst of the bunch . Just when things seemed stable , the G developed a buzz because of a breakdown at the 3rd fret , signaling its final demise . Some 30 pound monofilament fishing line would be a better choice .
 These are NOT all `` Clear Fluorocarbon '' strings as implied and printed right on the box -LRB- picture on Amazon differs from box I got -RRB- . The third and fourth strings are wire-wound and not even with the same color or type of wire . I did n't even attempt to put these on my uke . I threw them in the trash and ate the loss .
 I expected better from Martin . I bought my strings at a local store , and they put them on for free , so I 'm not going to return them , but in less than 2 weeks the G string at the 2nd fret started to unravel . It 's also starting to split and unravel down at the 4th and 5th frets too . I will never buy Martin strings again because of this . I realize that these strings are a little more frail than guitar strings , but honestly , 2 weeks of moderate play ? Unfortunately , these have lasted longer than the Aquilas , and that is WITH the unraveling . I went to play one day with the Aquilas on and the whole thing had just shredded about 5-6 inches down the fretboard . Is there any decent baritone uke strings out there ???
 Thought I would upgrade and get Martins . I have a half a dozen ukes of varying sizes and styles . Purchased 2 sets.Total crap . Buzzing , breaking . The two sets lasted a total of 17 days . Total waste of money.Went down to the local store and got some cheap plastic crap . Have had those on the big banjolele now for 3 months with no trouble at all . Will stick to those .
 I ordered the 0-6 month size for my daughter who is on the small side and will be 6 months November 2nd . This costume , planned for Halloween use , is sized very weirdly . The hat is on the big side , not a huge issue since the back extends down and this gives me the opportunity to safety pin it to the gown , preventing me from having to pick it up off the floor all night . It 's felt-ish material so the front molds well to her head and looks so so adorable.The dress on the other hand ... The size on the packaging says Newborn 0-9 months ... not 0-6 . The dress is oversized . The belt is attached , but the belt is way too small for her even at this age . My daughter is n't wide in the middle , she actually has good definition in her belly for a newborn . I 'm going to have to hem the sleeves and find some velcro extender for the back of the belt.I love the outfit , because it 's the perfect design for the party we 're going to , but after waiting 10 days for it to be delivered , I wish it would fit better . I 'm glad we tried it on my daughter today , at least I have time to make the adjustments .
 Ordered costume for my baby 's first Halloween ; item showed to be instock ; item never shipped ; had to email to find out what was going on ; emailed me back to tell me item was out of stock ; now my baby has not costume !
 Got this for my wife which is a natural C and the bra cups/shelf is so tiny and the inner cup fabric is so cheap they just fold under the breast . Still looked sexy , the lace is very nice but I would n't recommend it to anyone over an A , maybe a B cup . At C or D you are better off just cutting the cups out of an old bra leaving the wire , u would get the same effect .
 The fabric is very nice and the fit is good , however , the design is uncomfortable . Apparently whoever designed the the crotch area did n't give them a test run first . Hanes is a much better buy !
 ... not as good as Gilligan & O'Malley . The picture is much better than the actual product .
 I was hoping these would be my new favorite underwear but after wearing 1 time I will never wear these again . I wear a medium but these seemed slightly tight and boy did they ride up my butt . So uncomfortable . I will just have to keep searching .
 because it is alot larger then what it looked like , ... also its made to wear over your left shoulder ... someone goofed ...
 I was very disappointed with this product . The material it is made from is too stiff and has no flexibility . It is very cumbersome to carry , and I almost lost a $ 400.00 cell phone in one of the shallow pockets . I just do n't like the way it is constructed . I only use it when I am going a short distance to the beach . I am still looking for something softer and more user friendly .
 I ordered over 100.00 dollars worth of T shirts from this company and they cancelled my order with the explanationt that the shirts were no longer available or sold out . I look at the site again and the shirts are available only at a higher cost , this is very poor customer service , I am a reliable and frequent Amazon customer and feel offended by this type of bait and switch site . I will not purchase anything from this vendor and make sure I pass along my views to my friends .
 Was hoping that this would be similar to one I had , but it was not.This bra is pretty , but very thin and cheap.It stretches way too much , and has almost no support.It wo n't stay down and rolls up.Would not buy another .
 I NEVER RECEIVE THE ITEMS ORDERED -LRB- NOT IN STOCK A THAT TIME -RRB- . SO WHY THE COMPANY DIDN `` T COMMENT ABOUT THE AVALABILITY OF THE ITEMS SHOWS IN THE PAGE . TO FINISH , HOW CAN I RATE AN ITEM NEVER RECEIVED ?
 I would buy much more off the internet if I knew what I was buying ... Why do very few sellers share the specific information about the product !!! Tell me if it is 4 inches wide or 3 inches , data that I can not tell from a picture ... I am not returning products that do not match to what they appear or what I have been forced to guess at ... I will go to the local store where I can find these answers myself
 I was really excited to find good quality opaque queen tights . I read some of the other reviews and saw these run small so I ordered 3 sizes larger than what I wear . I wear a 3x and I bought a pair that were 5x/6x and they STILL do n't fit . I could n't even pull them up all the way up . They seem really thick but I ca n't put them on .

 The item is fine but the shipping and handling cost was $ 9.95 for a $ 25 shirt ! will not order from this vendor again : -LRB-
 I got a Large timbuk2 and from the rides i 've taken it on , it is n't very comfortable . I got a strap pad , hoping this would fix the problem but it still persists . When i bought the bag it did n't come with the strap pad or a cross strap but from carrying a chrome citizen messenger bag and this , the chrome definitely beats it in at area of comfortability . The one plus is that it definitely is very roomy .
 The Timbuk 2 Classic Messenger Bag is a very roomy bag . The large can fit a ton of Stuff . Unfortunately the strap is very uncomfortable.The 2 '' wide strap cuts my shoulder when the bag is loaded . The strap is also sewn on to one end which prevented me from replacing it with something more comfortable . So it sits in the corner ; looks nice but not very functionable .

 I was SO disappointed in this product . $ -LSB- ... -RSB- for a pair of baby pants and they did n't even make it through three washes before the elastic completely stretched out , and the pants just fell of my son . Really bad -LRB- and cheap -RRB- construction . Sure , they 're cute . Sure , they 're soft , but for $ -LSB- ... -RSB- bucks they should last the full 3-6 months .
 I have ordered sckoon items from both company and zullily and find its only worth it when there on sale . Items r soft however very flimsy cotton and to thin for new fall never mind winter . Cute designs and I have n't seen anyone else sell similar style
 Purchased the 0-3 month pants monkey pants navy stripe and loved them ! Purchased the SAME pant for 6-12 , and instead of this navy cream stripe they sent a larger stripe with navy and gray . Not satisfied with this pant color . The picture misrepresents the pant they actually sent .
 For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was ` nt worth it.Shipping / handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item . I will never shop Amazon or any online store .
 I will never know how good the item is , because I never received it . I was given a fairly speedy refund , however , so I will give the service at least two stars . Very disappointing , though , because it was meant to be a birthday gift . Doubt I will use any of Amazon 's third party distributors again , they just do n't communicate .

 Sorry to say this blanket is not very nice . I love the idea but the organic cotton side is a thin scratchy flannel , not at all soft or smooth . The other side is a synthetic satin that looks a great deal cheaper quality in real life than in the photo . The color is not silky smoky green but rather a very slimy polyester lining kind of fabric in spring green . I do n't get it at all . What 's the point of an organic side when the extremely unorganic satin side is the only one you 'd want next to your newborn 's skin ?
 Honestly , this dress made me look like a Nun , or a servant from the 1800 's . The part that makes it look weird is the white section of the dress , it looks exactly the same in the front as it does in the back . From the side , it just does n't look right with this pattern . I also felt it accentuated my `` pooch '' . I really wish this dress was designed better because it is very pretty in the front .
 Do not even try ... horrible costumer service trying to return this item . Finally contacted by a very rude person that kept on lying to me about their attempts to contact me . They finally did once I filed claim .
 the photo makes it appear solid . it actually has a pattern which everyone in my family of 7 finds hideous . My wife refused to let me wear it and threw it out .
 The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality . It does not worth $ 6 at all . I doubt if it will come for a single wash ! Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt .
 I ordered two for its low price.It arrived 2 weeks afterward -LRB- usually only needs 1 week -RRB- and when I opened them up , I was amazed by its stunning cheap quality and unapproachable bad workmanship.The threads are flimsy and cloth is coarsely fabricated and it 's only about 30 % cotton . The cuffs and collar are flimsy too and I wonder if it gon na deform after machine wash.I was wondering why Amazon sell such junk peices ... they may get it for free somewhere?Anyway , if you are looking for something you can wear more than one wash , keep away from it .
 I only bought this shirt because it carried a known brand name.you wo n't beleive how cheap its quality is.the fabric is too thin . Do n't try to pull any loose thrid because you will tear the whole thing apart . I think a paper shirt will be more durable !
 This shirt is just too thin . I 'm not real picky with my dress shirts but this shirt is thinner than my under shirt .
 I did not like the texture/material . The fitting was also loose for me . Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts , these shirts were disappointment .
 I bought this costume for my daughter for Halloween . It looks absolutely horrible . It is advertised as being purple . It is teal blue . The fabric is advertised as shiny purple , it looks nothing like the picture . It looks dull and cheap . It looks like my daughter is wearing a ugly nightgown . She crys when she puts it on and now we are throwing it away . A waste of $ 40.00
 I purchased this shirt and promptly returned this item . The shirt was constructed with the seams sewn on the side of the shirt that displayed the screen print .
 I returned the shirt . The quality of the image was good . However , the shirt was very , very thin . Also , I followed the merchant 's recommendations for sizing for myself and ordered a medium . The shirt was almost too small to put over my head . If you decide to get the shirt you may want to go a size up .
 I bought this and many more items for my wife , and only this one did n't fit . the size seems to be for a child .
 The lable stated that the package came damaged . Also , the slip was too big , gaudy and does not flow as the picture describes .
 I tried everything with this petticoat before returning it , but it 's just ... bunchy . It was certainly poofy , but would not give me the a line shape I desired , and some areas were much more full than others because one of the bottom layers of tulle is very voluminous , and likes to stick to itself . I 'm going to keep looking .
 When you buy Natori you expect the best . But this product just is n't up to their usual high standard . Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings . For 20 dollars they should be awesome . They are n't . My favorite panty right now is a Nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks . I have n't seen them online , but this is worth a trip to the store .
 The photo shows princess Jasmine but the product we received did not have Jasmine at all . Jasmine was the only reason we ordered these as our daughter is obsessed with her and specifically told Santa she wanted Jasmine big girl panties . She was disappointed when Santa did not leave her any Jasmine panties .
 I ordered this from ebags.Pro
 Japanese must have smaller credit cards , or something . None of my bank nor credit cards will fit in this thing . This is partly the fault of the ring of studs , causing the slots to not be wide enough , but even without them , the pockets would only keep a card about half-deep . Makes the wallet worthless ... Unless maybe you want to sew it onto something as a patch ... Even then the decal is so faint that it would n't make for much of a piece of d&eacute;core .
 The wallet itself is very cool , however it 's use is somewhat limited . It had a few missing elements that annoyed me , but which is not really the sellers fault though.First of , the space where you put your coins do n't have a zipper . So if you open your wallet the wrong way , all the coins will fall out.I also only has 4 slots for credit cards or whatever , which are very tight . Personally that makes it hard for me , as I normally seperate my receipts , bills , credits cards and other cards.The good thing is that it 's thin and easy to carry around . But of course , the best part is the design . You should obviously only buy this if you 're a Hellsing fan -LRB- though the cross may confuse some -RRB- . Overall very cool item , but not that good for regular use .
 I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with . I did this because of the price and it was money wasted . The bras fit as if it had been worn . Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right . So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist . Useless . Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill . Bad purchase . Bad fit . Pretty but not practical . I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well , this was not made for D + women .
 I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long . I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose . I 've probably only had that problem with 1 % of all the bras I 've ever bought , and sadly this was one of them . The cups run generously sized -LRB- which for me , as a D/DD usually is a positive thing , but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down -RRB- . The overall design was cute , but the odd sizing made it a no-go .
 I did not like the seam placement in the cups ... it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though .
 I almost liked this bra , but the straps wo n't shorten up enough . Even when I adjust them to their shortest they 're much too long for me . This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking ! Maybe I 'm just built strangely , but I was n't able to wear this bra . It is pretty though .
 I really wanted to like this . I put it on and looked great . I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already . Maybe be good for smaller chest but did n't work for my 36DD bust .
 I wear a 38C Bra size , and this bra fits the bill !!! Love it ! I just ordered another one . I would highly recommend this bra . It is very sexy , and comfortable.Update : After wearing this bra for a day , it 's NOT comfortable . I would not recommend it all , and I have returned the other one that was ordered , and the one I kept goes in the `` Not form fitting , and comfortable '' draw . I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead , so far it is very comfortable , and fits nicely to the breasts . I will be ordering another pair !
 I write this review for the DDD 's , this bra is pretty but no support for big bust , I guess that 's what you get for the price !
 The underwire fit well , but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive . I had to send them both back .
 I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross . This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night . Also it fit kinda weird . For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast . -LRB- It was probably only noticable to me , but still , did not make me feel sexy .
 The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to . They are a bit roomy , I 'm disappointed .
 unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt . : -LRB-
 Ok , it 's a pretty bra , the color is nice & it 's overall pretty . Here are my issues
 Quite flimsy . Doesnt give any support.The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt .
 This bra is gorgeous . Unfortunately it does n't fit terribly well . It 's an odd size that 's neither a balconet or a demi and pinches in weird places . Also , the underwire digs in painfully after about two hours . The wide lace band is wonderful but for the less chesty , I 'd recommend passing on this one .
 I read the other reviews and based on those purchased this bra with high hopes.I am a 36 full cup D.This bra didnt cover anything !!!! Every time you move or particularly bend over everything is out.Yes it is very pretty but not practical , wish I could send it back but I wore it for a few hours . . what a waste of money !
 The fit was okay , it is pretty , but not very soft or comfortable . I like the balconette -LRB- balcony -RRB- style because it flatters a larger busted woman . The straps on a balconette bra set further apart than other bras -LRB- straps are more toward your underarm than in the middle of the cup -RRB- which I prefer , but with this bra the straps set way too far over nearly at my underarms . The underwire on the sides is one of the most uncomfortable I 've ever worn and keeps poking me . I ca n't wait to take it off when I get home ! I should just throw it away . For the price it should have much higher quality -LRB- aka softer -RRB- lace . Hope this helped !
 This was a great product for about 2 weeks . Looked great , fit great , but the underwire poked right through the material on both sides and it is now simply unwwearable . I have n't attempted to contact the manufacturer yet .
 The fit is terrible . The narrow straps cut into my shoulders , but if they are loosened , the cups do n't provide the proper amount of support . You must be the exact right size to wear this bra ... comfortably .
 It 's comfortable and soft , but priced high compared to the duration of validityUsed only three times in the last time was outdated and very badI purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two yearsDislikes
 Online this Bra looks Delicious ! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable . The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old &#34; Felina | Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra . &#34; They , I , did n't feel comfortable , nor safe walking or playing around in it . I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies , cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady ! YOu dig ?
 At 34 '' around I just did n't feel like I was getting the support I needed . It feels like a cheaper bra and wo n't even stay flat against my ribs because it does n't seem to fit right -LRB- I recently just got a measurement done , so I know what size I should be wearing . To be fair , bras are all different and ordering online is difficult without being able to try them on . I would not buy this again and I wo n't be wearing mine .

 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .

 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 Just going to list the issues
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 I know Halloween costumes are supposed to be cheap , but come on ! For the price , I could have bought a real dress . This thing was ugly , scratchy and of awful quality . I could n't even stand to wear it for the duration of the Halloween party I went to . Luckily , I was wearing something under it . Do n't waste your money .

 I bought a shirt just like this from Timberland and will NEVER buy from them again . I wore it one time and washed it in cold water on gentle cycle , drying it on delicate -LRB- very low heat -RRB- . The shirt shrunk more than two sizes and was no longer wearable . I returned it at my expense , as I had done nothing wrong and the shirt was now useless to me . Timberland returned the shirt to me with a form letter stating that their `` inspection revealed that the item had been worn , '' duh . Of course I had explained all of this . Not only is their clothing of very poor quality , their customer service is even worse !!
 These are crazy huge on my 6 ' 2 &#34; skinny husband . He normally fits perfectly into size medium , but his undershirts end up getting untucked . These were too big all over to wear at all and they do n't shrink . The sleeves were so long it made him look like a child .
 Garbage - That is actually were they when after 6 months of use . Good luck finding a good quality tall men 's shirt , I am still searching !!
 In the photos they appear to be a thicker material that is not transparent -LRB- standard t-shirt weight -RRB- . These are probably the thinnest material/fabric t-shirts I have ever seen . No need for a wet t-shirt contest , these things are so thin they are nearly transparent . You can easily put a newspaper/magazine under them and read with no problem.For the cost , these should be made of better/thicker material . I would NOT buy these again .
 I have ordered these before and I have loved them . This latest batch was shorter and thinner . Weird . I am going to try a different vendor and see if possibly I just got a knock-off or something .
 These T-shirts shrunk 3 inches in their length and at least one size from just the first washing . I will not be buying anymore them .
 Pre-shrunk ? Not so much . Only one of six shirts purchased in longer than 30 '' and half are shorter than 28 '' . I 'm only 6 ' 2 '' and have trouble keeping these tucked in . What do real tall guys do ?
 I ordered -LRB- and paid more for -RRB- several packages of Hanes XL tall t-shirts . After one wash , these are not tall t-shirts . They are inches shorter than the equivalent shirt by Jockey . I will never buy the Hanes shirts again .
 I bought this with high expectations since i have bought tons of Hanes t-shirts before , however the L/T -LRB- Large Tall -RRB- that I bought this time was quite disappointing because the collar does n't lay flat after one wash . The length of the shirt was good though .
 These shirts shrank to a regular length after washing for the first time , so I would not recommend them . I tried these out and these : Tall Man Tag-Free Crew Neck T-Shirt - 2 Packto see which were going to be longer after laundering , and the Jockey ones are at least 3 inches longer and a slightly thicker and softer cotton .
 Just 2 washes and the t-shirts are unusable anymore . It was just a waste of money . They look good at first but the first wash ruined one of them and the second wash ruined all of them .
 One of the T shirts I purchased was defective . It was improperly stitched in the shoulder , creating a gap in the seam .
 I 've been wearing Hanes for years , both underwear and tshirts . I always found the quality to be very good , some of the tshirts I have are more than 2yrs old , and while not as white as they used to be still fit great . I particularly liked the no-stretch feature in the neck . Recently however I 've found their quality to be severely lacking . out of two new packs of underwear , half were seperated along one seem from the fabric being so coarse and bare that it could n't withstand the stitching . I 'm a large , tall guy -LRB- 6 ' 3 '' -RRB- and as such normal length tshirts will not work for me . I need them to be extra long to stay tucked in and avoid pulling out anytime I I bend over . Hanes has always done well in this area . Recently though I purchased 3 new 2-packs of their tallmans crewneck tshirts . Out of the 6 , 4 seemed to be regular length despite what was posted on the packaging and the tag.As such I will no longer be a Hanes customer . Their products cost too much to not get what you pay for.Classic Tall Men 's White Crew Neck T-Shirt 2-Pack
 These T Shirts were a disappointment and are on their way to Goodwill . They were n't long enough to tuck in and stay down properly .
 Purchased these XL Tall undershirts for my husband ... the same size and brand he usually wears except these were also branded `` Classics '' . After just one wash in a warm/cold cycle and dried on low they shrank and are now unwearable -LRB- for a tall man -RRB- . The new shirts shrank to about 3 inches shorter than his other Hanes undershirts that are a bit worn out and have been through several washes . I bought 3 packages and now have 9 shirts going to our donation pile . The packaging said they were tall but on the inside label -LRB- printed on the shirt -RRB- it does not say tall at all . Not sure if these were miss-packaged or just pour quality .
 These shirts used to be fantastic ... long , pre shrunk.I have ordered them 3 times.This time , they shrunk . Way too short . Poor job reducing the quality .
 Hanes ' tees are comfortable . But since I paid more for the tall tees , and they shrank in length significantly after a couple washes , I have to give Hanes ' tall tees a terrible review . I also noted that the lay-flat collar seems to not lay so flat after a few washes . I take the tees right out of the washer as soon as they are done and put them in the dryer , and when I remove them , the collars are wrinkled . When I put one on , they do n't lay flat , they are rumpled.Edit 18 MAR 2012Be absolutely sure that you check the package you receive . Make certain that it says these are Tall tees on the front . I got shorted -LRB- literally -RRB- the last time I ordered these .
 product was listed as ` tall ' , but when trying on this was n't so ` tall ' . seemed like a normal XL fit to me . also , noticed a small whole in seem at right shoulder by the end of my first day wearing .
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?
 Not correct size . I have several pairs of these sweats . Gave to friend . Will not order items from this store again , because they may be selling rejects . Do n't know for sure .
 I bought 3 sets of this . My son destroyed two in a month - the pants tore while he was trying to put them on . It is inexpensive - but still a waste of money !
 Just going to list the issues
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .

 It 's comfortable and soft , but priced high compared to the duration of validityUsed only three times in the last time was outdated and very badI purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two yearsDislikes
 Online this Bra looks Delicious ! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable . The problem?I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old &#34; Felina | Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra . &#34; They , I , did n't feel comfortable , nor safe walking or playing around in it . I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies , cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady ! YOu dig ?
 This bra is gorgeous . Unfortunately it does n't fit terribly well . It 's an odd size that 's neither a balconet or a demi and pinches in weird places . Also , the underwire digs in painfully after about two hours . The wide lace band is wonderful but for the less chesty , I 'd recommend passing on this one .
 I read the other reviews and based on those purchased this bra with high hopes.I am a 36 full cup D.This bra didnt cover anything !!!! Every time you move or particularly bend over everything is out.Yes it is very pretty but not practical , wish I could send it back but I wore it for a few hours . . what a waste of money !
 The fit was okay , it is pretty , but not very soft or comfortable . I like the balconette -LRB- balcony -RRB- style because it flatters a larger busted woman . The straps on a balconette bra set further apart than other bras -LRB- straps are more toward your underarm than in the middle of the cup -RRB- which I prefer , but with this bra the straps set way too far over nearly at my underarms . The underwire on the sides is one of the most uncomfortable I 've ever worn and keeps poking me . I ca n't wait to take it off when I get home ! I should just throw it away . For the price it should have much higher quality -LRB- aka softer -RRB- lace . Hope this helped !
 This was a great product for about 2 weeks . Looked great , fit great , but the underwire poked right through the material on both sides and it is now simply unwwearable . I have n't attempted to contact the manufacturer yet .
 The fit is terrible . The narrow straps cut into my shoulders , but if they are loosened , the cups do n't provide the proper amount of support . You must be the exact right size to wear this bra ... comfortably .
 Ok , it 's a pretty bra , the color is nice & it 's overall pretty . Here are my issues
 Quite flimsy . Doesnt give any support.The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt .
 The underwire fit well , but the cups were insubstantial and were not supportive . I had to send them both back .
 I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross . This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night . Also it fit kinda weird . For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast . -LRB- It was probably only noticable to me , but still , did not make me feel sexy .
 The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to . They are a bit roomy , I 'm disappointed .
 unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt . : -LRB-
 I almost liked this bra , but the straps wo n't shorten up enough . Even when I adjust them to their shortest they 're much too long for me . This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking ! Maybe I 'm just built strangely , but I was n't able to wear this bra . It is pretty though .
 I really wanted to like this . I put it on and looked great . I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already . Maybe be good for smaller chest but did n't work for my 36DD bust .
 I wear a 38C Bra size , and this bra fits the bill !!! Love it ! I just ordered another one . I would highly recommend this bra . It is very sexy , and comfortable.Update : After wearing this bra for a day , it 's NOT comfortable . I would not recommend it all , and I have returned the other one that was ordered , and the one I kept goes in the `` Not form fitting , and comfortable '' draw . I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead , so far it is very comfortable , and fits nicely to the breasts . I will be ordering another pair !
 I write this review for the DDD 's , this bra is pretty but no support for big bust , I guess that 's what you get for the price !
 I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with . I did this because of the price and it was money wasted . The bras fit as if it had been worn . Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right . So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist . Useless . Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill . Bad purchase . Bad fit . Pretty but not practical . I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well , this was not made for D + women .
 I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long . I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose . I 've probably only had that problem with 1 % of all the bras I 've ever bought , and sadly this was one of them . The cups run generously sized -LRB- which for me , as a D/DD usually is a positive thing , but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down -RRB- . The overall design was cute , but the odd sizing made it a no-go .
 I did not like the seam placement in the cups ... it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though .
 I appreciate the prompt delivery of this headdress , I grant you that . However , for the rather high pricing , this was the most horribly-constructed , barely glued -LRB- which the whole thing just fell apart the moment I put in on my head -RRB- mass-produced piece of excrement I 've ever seen and I regret ever buying it . Not to be mean , but this item SERIOUSLY IS NOT WORTH WHAT THIS COMPANY IS CHARGING FOR IT !!! FURTHERMORE , PLEASE SHOP AROUND FOR BETTER QUALITY NOVELTY HEADDRESSES , AS THIS COMPANY ALSO SELLS OTHERS THAT ARE POSSIBLY AS EQUALLY SHODDY AS THIS ONE !!
 OK this is the second time I have had to write this review . Please do not ask me again . The thing fell apart as soon as I removed it from the box . I literally had to sit for over an hour and re-hot glue almost every single feather into that thing . I would rather pay a higher price to be sure that it does n't all apart . Shoddy workmanship . If you do n't mind rebuilding the thing yourself go ahead and purchase it .
 It literally looked like somebody killed a bird and stuffed it into a box , What a piece of crap !

 These are OK , but when you first put them on you can see them slightly , but as your skin warms them up that disappears . They do move all around so they have to be adjusted throughout the time they are worn . I 'm looking for something that stays in place without adhesive .
 While I like the fact this is an all cotton fleece and its full-zip design , the cloth is too thin for a fleece .
 I bought 3 sets of this . My son destroyed two in a month - the pants tore while he was trying to put them on . It is inexpensive - but still a waste of money !
 The lace body shaper is pretty but holds absolutley nothing in it actually made me look worse in my clothes and added extra material I did not need if you are large on top this has alot of padding I did not need and made me flop out ... FYI I also ordered a mirclesuit and that worked great it took me down a whole size !!!!
 I have never seen such cheap manufacturing practice as in this product . I liked the feel and the color of these sweats but the ankle was a little tight so I decided to make them straight leg . Upon opening up the seam I found a rubber band on both legs . What happened to elastic ribbing ? About a week later the draw string came unstitched in the back and came out making me more irritated . I tossed these sweats . I remember Russell having good quality back in the 90s ! What happened ?

 Do not even try ... horrible costumer service trying to return this item . Finally contacted by a very rude person that kept on lying to me about their attempts to contact me . They finally did once I filed claim .

 Product never arrived and when I asked to have it resent ... it was on backorder with no idea of when it would be available .
 Arm thing is nothing like photo . Its a flat piece of foam with two elastic straps that loop on your arm . Portion that goes on head is flat . if you look at photo it appears to be real looking side burns . If you want this costume i would suggest you get it from a Halloween store where it will be cheaper and you can actually see what you are getting . Felt ripped off to be honest with you and did n't even wear costume . Lesson learned if you are going to buy a costume look at it in a store first before ordering on-line .

 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .

 This shirt 's quality is very poor and wo n't last you past two wears . The design is good but quality needs to improve dramatically . The color will fade very quickly and badly . Do n't recommend it .

 I have loved my HP 's in the past . I had numerous pairs and wore them often . I bought the big 5 pack because they were so great . I am 5 ' 5 '' and 125 lbs and they are just rotten baggy ... ugh , what a pain in the neck -- going to have to send these back ... why in the world they do n't offer sizes is beyond me ...
 Your sizes are totally screwed up . I thought size small is supposed to be small , not huge . the one -LRB- size s -RRB- i got was a little bigger even for me , and i am 6 feet tall and I weight 180 pounds . put there on the website actual measurements of sizes not s m or xl . i do n't even wan na know how big the XL is ... maybe for a couple of people to fit in ... :-RRB- . anyway ... Good product but size is totally off ...
 I purchased this for my husband for our 2nd wedding anniversary -LRB- cotton -RRB- . Was I ever disappointed when it arrived -LRB- on schedule - thank goodness -RRB- . But it has satin trim - very femine ! What a disappointment !
 I placed an order on July 18th for Mau Jim Ka'anapali sunglasses though HDO sport , your only option on Amazon for Mau Jim . On the 21st I looked to check the status of my order and got a message from HDO saying I 'd get a response in one working day and asking for my ticket number . You are not issued a ticket number when ordering through HDO . Long story short on July 30th I got the first of several messages thanking me for my inquiry but with no response to my inquiry as to the status of this item -LRB- I was in the unfortunate position of not having sunglasses which was the only reason I looked quickly to get an order status -RRB- . On August 4th I got the first confirmation that my order was being shipped . Having not heard from HDO since the 21st I 'd already purchased the same sunglasses at a local store paying the same online price . The HDO glasses arrived August 7th . On that same day Amazon sent a Rate This Product note . I responded about the poor customer service from HDO by this time I was well into the process of waiting to get return order information and getting the non-response , response that my inquiry would be answered in ONE WORKING DAY -LRB- do n't believe it -RRB- . Within hours of submitting my rating I got an online respone from Alasdair McClean-Foreman , who seemed well intentioned , then came a call . Mr. McClean-Forman apologized for the poor service and asked if he could correct the problem AND would I be willing that day to change my Rating as it poorly reflect on his company with Amazon . I relayed my concerns about changing my rating until the problem of returning the sunglasses for a refund had been finalized . Mr. McClrean - Foreman offered to refund the price of the sunglasses AND offered a 25 % discount on any item I purchased that day . He was going to hand the matter himself . Again long story short . The credit was applied to my cc . I changed my response . I ordered a pair of Serengeti sunglasses then got a call from Alasdair that even though this product was shown as instock online HDO in fact did not have Serengeti sunglasses in stock -LRB- the same problem with my original order -RRB- . He asked that I purchase another pair of Maui Jim 's which I did . As of today August 26th I have a full price charge for the second pair of sunglasses on my credit card and am still in possession of the original pair of Maui Jims because I can not get a response from HDO to my request for a prepaid return stamp nor instructions as to how to return the product . There online customer service site is lacking.My direct inquiries to Mr McClean-Foreman are now being returned as undeliverable . My last note was sent August 20th asking them to respond to their latest EZ Service note telling me I would be contacted within One Working day . As of today August 26th I have one pair of sunglasses -LRB- original purchase price credited but unable to return -RRB- a second MORE EXPENSIVE pair of Maui Jim sungalsses charged to my credit card without the 25 % discount Mr. McClean-Forman promised to handle himself -LRB- he specifically directed me to place the order directly to him so he could handle the matter -RRB- . I 'd like to return both pair of sunglasses from HDO but am getting no response to any communication.DO NOT BUY FROM HDO SPORTS ! In good faith I changed my rating against my better judgement before the problems were resolved . I should have trusted my gut.STILL LOVE MAUI JIMS
 The picture on the Internet Screen painted a better picture then the actual tie ...
 I ORDERED AND WANTED THE BEANIE FOR MY HUSBAND FOR XMAS . Instead they sent me the watchmans cap . Not impressed considering Christmas is Sunday . So I guess i cant give a review based on the product since I didnt actually receive what I ordered .
 i purchased the child small -LRB- the package says will fit 40-55lbs -RRB- . Which should have been perfect , but these tights are so short they would fit my 9 month old ! This review process was also confusing ... asked questions as if the item was a toy , and nowhere on the package or the amazon cite does it say that it 's a toy ; they 're suppose to be children 's tights .
 The purchased item , slimming jacquard tapestry strapless corset , was perhaps the worst item I have ever purchased online . The item actually felt like paper , and was very poorly constructed . I attempted to contact the seller a number of times over as many days about a quick return , and finally the seller responded after about a week , and authorized a return minus the shipping costs and a 25 % restocking fee . The seller obviously does not stand by their product in that regard . I paid about $ 55 including shipping and was refunded about $ 35 . An expensive return . I appreciate that the return was made , but it took quite some time for my credit card to be refunded after I had shipped the item -LRB- about 2 weeks -RRB- and quite some time to get a response . I hesitate to give 2 stars , but the return was made , if at least in portion . If I could give half stars it would be 1.5 Will not do business with seller again .
 my corset arrived with frayed lacing & the item itself was flimsy . i contacted the seller & they were extremely helpful & cooperative & gave me a full refund . their attitude more than made up for the condition of the product . it 's unfortunate that i was unhappy with the item seeing as the seller has such good customer service . they 've been incredibly generous in giving me a full refund . thank you .
 My son was initially thrilled to receive this costume as a present . However , he does not wear the mask . There is clear plastic for the eyes that can not be removed . He is unable to see because the plastic distorts his vision . He could never wear the mask for Halloween because he really ca n't see through the plastic . I would not recommend this costume to anyone due to the defective mask .
 I ordered a size of this costume to fit my 3 year old and the company sent a size better suited for a 10 year old . I was very disappointed and had to eventually cut it up and modify it myself so that it would fit . The only useful part that did not require modifying was the mask . Thanks for the extra work and disappointment guys .
 Do n't waste your money . The mask hurt my son 's face . It was n't even dollor store quality.Sorry , I usually do not give bad reviews .
 My boy use this costume and in less than 2 hr it started to ripoff the seems , do not waste your money is not good quality no hems not well done
 My seven year old son could not wait to receive this Darth Vader costume . He was so disappointed to put on the size medium -LRB- 8-10 -RRB- only to find it was several inches too short . As it turns out , the size 8-10 was actually `` one size '' on the tag - maybe meant for preschoolers -LRB- ? -RRB- . The whole costume was really cheap and the chest panel melted on low in the dryer . I would not recommend this costume .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Just going to list the issues
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .

 This product is horrible . It does n't fit right in many places , including with the underwire , which does fit against your chest but sticks out . The boning sticks out in strange places as well . The g-string is ridiculous . It 's made out of cheap nylon -LRB- as is most of the corset -RRB- and is nearly two inches wide all the way through and is high rise on the hips . Overall , it 's pretty cheap and ugly . The worst part ? It was n't ten seconds after I opened the package that a cheap , badly sewn , strap broke . Ten minutes later ? The second strap broke as I tried to adjust it to make it stay on my shoulder . In my opinion , do n't buy this cheap , poorly fitting product . It 's a waste of your time . ** Edit ** On top of all my other grievances about this product
 This is a very poorly made product . It 's made from cheap nylon and lace . The boning is bent and sticks out awkwardly in various places . It wo n't lie flat no matter what you do . The underwire also sticks out and does n't fit properly . It does n't give the push-up effect that you see in the picture.What 's worse than this product , is the fact that I returned it to the seller and have not yet received a refund !! It 's been over 2 months since I returned this item and now I have to fight for my money back . I did n't want to give this seller any stars in the rating system but it would n't let me submit it without at least one star.Not only do I recommend not buying this product , I also recommend NEVER buying from this seller !
 What a terrible design . There is just no support for your bust . It looks pretty on the photo but not in reality . Also bad quality . I threw it away !
 i never recieved the product.the order was cancelled by the sender
 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .
 I 've had this for over a year now . I bought it looking for wind protection and am very disappointed with the breathability of this product . It traps moisture inside and I end up with a visibly damp shirt and have to turn the jacket inside out to dry . That 's what happens in dry weather . The fit is comfortable and it 's otherwise conveniently designed . The fabric in white is quite see-through . Later I purchased Turfer 's `` Womens 's Light Weight Endurance Jacket '' for $ 14.95 and that 's been the perfect windbreaker . It 's now up to $ 19.95 and I 'm ordering another color .

 I ordered this so I would have some extra support while sleeping and lounging around the house . I am currently -LRB- because of nursing -RRB- a 40DD and this bra just does not work . While the material is soft it does n't fit snugly , the straps are WAY too wide and constantly slide off my shoulders and I pop out of the front when I lay down . All in all , it was a waste of 10 bucks and I would not recommend it to anyone .
 I had to return this item because it runs small to size . Order a bit larger . The material is comfortable .
 I searched online a lot for a sleep bra and ordered this one even after reading all the reviews here because many people said it was comfortable . I have to say it is a really badly fitting item -- I 'm 4 months pregnant and am now 38D . The cups fit OK but the whole thing fits really badly , also slightly itchy around the rib cage . Not really worth the 10 $ . Instead , I found these things by `` Barelythere '' called `` Barely There Microfiber Damask Crop Top Bra '' -- also on Amazon . They are way more comfortable , supportive , elasticised and work great for home and overnight .
 This bra does not work for small women with large breasts . I am normally a 40D but now a 42DD at 7 months pregnant and ca n't find anything that fits right ! The straps are too wide and wo n't stay on my shoulders and there is n't enough material to keep anything in place .
 UNCOMFORTABLE FOR LARGER BUSTS , TIGHT AROUND CHEST , ORDER AT LEAST ONE SIZE UP . I NEVER USE THIS , I LIKE TARGETS ' NURSING TANKS FOR SLEEPING IN .
 I bought this bra because of the design - no need to fiddle with clips etc to nurse , but pretty soon after I got it , the fabric lost its elasticity , which means I lost all the support I needed . Even if you 're only planning to wear it at night , it does n't do well with multiple washes , and I found the side-opening cups annoying
 This bra was not a functional nursing bra to use at night while sleeping . The cotton is too stiff and it needs flexibility in the material to be effective .
 It took forever to get the nursing bra -LRB- over 3wks later than stated -RRB- and when I did , it was the wrong size and wrong color !
 I am not sure if I would recommend this product . The material REALLY RIDES deep into your armpits making it quite uncomfortable . The front is very accessible though . If you are bothered by tight fitting items on your arms/armpits do n't buy this product .
 The size was not true to what it said . I got the Large and its way to small . I went to a local store and bought a new sleep bra and its a 38C and fits perfect .
 this bra is a waste of money . it offers no support and my breast fall out when i lay down . dont buy it , spend more and get more . i recommend the medena .
 I bought this according to the sizing chart but apparently it 's only built for football players . The elastic band around my ribs fit fine and was almost to maximum stretch yet the cups and shoulders were way too big . The cups extended past the elastic band so there was a lot of loose fabric under my arms and this left me unsupported in the middle . The straps were so far apart that they fit like cap sleeves and then fell down . Maybe this is cut differently in smaller sizes because the one I received did not fit like the picture .
 I had been greatly desapointed with this item . The quality of the print on the T-shirt is poor and fade away after the first wash . PLEASE note that the item picture is misleading - in the package it is only 1 T-shirt -LRB- 9months -RRB- - not 2 items as the picture suggested . conclusion - DO NOT BUY
 these pants are my size but the dividing line between each pant hangs way too low . . its like baggy pants style accept this is the way it was made . I can even make a full step without ripping these apart . . the only reason i am not gon na bother with returning it is because of all the shipping and waiting and basically waisting my time . But i highly suggest not to buy these , unless you have unnaturally/unproportionally short legs !
 The quality of the fabric and construction was good . However , the fit was horrible . The waist fit well , but the legs were so big around that I could have put both of my legs in one leg of the pants with room left over.I ca n't imagine who would have had proportions matching those pants !
 Very comfortable , but not a good value . Begins to shred , and seams seperate after 10 to 15 washings .
 Do not buy these unless you have money to burn . I bought these for a nice cool part of summer boxers and they fell apart after one wash . My wife bought me some silk `` Joe Boxers '' from K-mart and they have held up for two years . Buyer beware .

 Ordered a 38D for someone who has always worn a 38D and it does not fit . Plus the tags are already off so it ca n't be returned . Wo n't order from these folks again .
 The product was not quite what I expected , but I got a quick return to my satisfaction . Happy shopping .
 I purchased two of these less than a week ago . I was pretty pleased with their performance - but as I went to put one of them on this morning , I noticed that one of the elastic straps had halfway ripped off the actual pouch . I was kind of miffed , and went to put the other one on instead , and I saw that the actual elastic strips inside the straps themselves had torn and were starting to poke through the fabric.Let me remind you that I 've owned these for less than two weeks . All I 've done with them is gone running - no abuse whatsoever . And they 're both falling apart after a single wash.I knew Under Armour was overrated but I did n't realize they could screw up something as simple as a jockstrap . I 'll stick with my cheapo Target brand microfiber briefs from now on - they 've already lasted me over a year .
 Well , great for the short time I wore it and then the straps seperate from the pouch . One of the only poor quality items I have every got from UNDER ARMOUR . I wrote them and they will issue a credit .

 I purchased the pants and shirt from this store and they sent completely wrong sizes on both . I have emailed them to request to exchange them for the correct sizes , with no response from the store . I ordered an XL shirt and received size 2X . I ordered XLlong pants and received 3X pants . So I am just out the money I have spent and received unusable mechandise . The product itself would have been fine if they had sent the correct sizes . I would never order from them again .

 Simply put , it was almost as if I had not worn anything . This did not provide enough support even though it wrapped well around my breast .
 We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length -LRB- the 36 was more like a 34 -RRB- , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it `` mostly '' fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way .
 Not too sure if I like this bra.If you are over 60 and have a 38D cup , the support should be greater than a young person whose breasts have not fallen , do not think that this bra could perform this miracle of supporting so much flesh
 I bought this bra because of all the good reviews . I am returning it . It was too tight and the cup size was too small . I know my size , I bought another bra in it today at the mall . Besides being to small it was just uncomfortable and painful . I wear a 38D so I need support and this was not providing it.However , today I went to JCPennys and got a great strapless made by ambrielle . It 's comfortable and supportive I recommend it if you need a good strapless that is comfortable and supportive . Also the victoria secret bio fit is pretty good but more expensive .
 the bra is not true to its size and since there is no padding , it creates a see-through effect under the sun
 Ow.And ugly under clothes.The search for a really good strapless bra continues .

 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge . And for the record , I do not have a very small waist compared to the rest of me , in fact , I 'd say I am pretty square shaped.I exchanged the bra , -LRB- and had to pay the shipping myself and wait 4 weeks to receive the next size down -RRB- for a 32b hoping that the 2 inches would do the trick . The bust is now rather tight , but hey , push up is the goal here , so I can live with that part . And the waist mostly fits - at least it does n't fold over itself now . I 'm not sure it 's making my waist any smaller either though , which I presumed was half the point of the long line bra . The padding is rather thick in the front , so I am hoping it does n't actually add inches to my waist . I have yet to try it on with my wedding dress . I am not really thrilled with the final product , but I do n't have time to wait 4 + more weeks for a different one or pay for more return shipping . I would stay away from this product if you are at all petite .
 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly . When I returned it I was told they would not take it because it had been worn or washed . It had not ! I am appalled that I am now I have paid and have nothing to show for it ! This vendo is not reliable .
 This is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had . The side panels look like they are very thin , as others I have worn , but this one is not.It is sized down so I suggest buying at least the next size up to get a good feel .

 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly .

 This is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had .

 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge .

 The prada bag has very low quality materials . The nylon felt so cheap and terribly made I returned it . I had a guess brand bag that had better nylon than it by far . You expect the prada bag to have superior quality for the expensive name brand . I only paid $ 50 but it had a crooked prada logo outside of the bag and a bubble with chipped off paint of the prada logo inside of the bag . Because it was so cheaply made I question the authenticity of the bag since I had compared it to a real prada bag . However , if you 're looking for a small black prada bag that can fit a cell phone , wallet , keys , and a small pack of tissue that just has the prada logo slapped on but may not be authentic then this is a bag for you . The bag does come with the certificate of authenticity but I spoke to a prada representative at prada 's headquarters and was informed that you had to send it in their warehouse so they can identify if it 's authentic and the card was useless to authenticate it .
 I bought this bag as a gift for my friend that helped me out with my wedding . I was so excited about the gift and the cost . I quickly found out why it was name brand and so cheap . After the second time my friend used the purse the strap broke . We thought , no big deal it was only one side of the strap and then a hour or so later the other end pulled out . The nylon is fine , the look is trendy , the bag is real it 's just the stiching quality sucks . I have no odea how to return it so i have to take my friends bag to a seemstress . How embarassing , I look cheap .
 I think this is a good deal for a cute bag to go out drinking and dancing . However , I 've only used this purse about 5 times and the 4th time , the nylon tab that attaches the purse with the metal piece at the end of the braided handle literally ripped off.I sewed the little tab -LRB- and I 'm pretty good at hand-sewing -RRB- back and on the 5th time out , it ripped again . It seems the the nylon material was fraying even as I sewed it around the ends . I even reinforced the other side of the handle which looked like it started to fray as well.I know that my purse was not yanked on in any way and I did not overload it with anything since it could only hold my cell phone , gloss , and money.I think it fell apart bc the nylon started to fray . I guess it served its purpose for the short time , but I do n't think the materials are durable in quality . Then again , I did n't expect much with a nylon bag even though I have a nylon kate spade and with maximum usage , it has not once fallen apart.I would n't say the price is ` worth ' it , but if you think a $ 75 markup on the Prada tag -LRB- instead of $ 200 -RRB- is a good deal , then that is your right . I am personally disappointed .
 I thought wow a Prada bag for under $ 80 -LRB- the price has gone up since Christmas -RRB- . I was very disappointed . I ordered the purple color -LRB- I am sure it has a fancier name -RRB- . When it arrived , it looked like a cheap nylon bag I would find at Target for $ 10 -LRB- except Prada name -RRB- . Also , the handle is too short and not adjustable . Not impressed at all !
 Let me start by saying that the price of this bag is an insanely low price to pay for something you know is coming from a reputable seller of authentic merchandise . That is the plus of getting this bag

 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 Just going to list the issues
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .

 The first time I wore this busiter the plastic support wire popped right out in the middle of dinner sticking out under my underarm . Not good .
 I read some of the reviews about this product and most of them were positive and only one was negative so I thought I 'd go ahead and order this product . The product arrived quickly . I tried the QT bustiere on and found not only was it extremely uncomfortable but it did n't look the product pictured on the site . I doubt I will order from HerRoom , again !
 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge . And for the record , I do not have a very small waist compared to the rest of me , in fact , I 'd say I am pretty square shaped.I exchanged the bra , -LRB- and had to pay the shipping myself and wait 4 weeks to receive the next size down -RRB- for a 32b hoping that the 2 inches would do the trick . The bust is now rather tight , but hey , push up is the goal here , so I can live with that part . And the waist mostly fits - at least it does n't fold over itself now . I 'm not sure it 's making my waist any smaller either though , which I presumed was half the point of the long line bra . The padding is rather thick in the front , so I am hoping it does n't actually add inches to my waist . I have yet to try it on with my wedding dress . I am not really thrilled with the final product , but I do n't have time to wait 4 + more weeks for a different one or pay for more return shipping . I would stay away from this product if you are at all petite .
 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly . When I returned it I was told they would not take it because it had been worn or washed . It had not ! I am appalled that I am now I have paid and have nothing to show for it ! This vendo is not reliable .
 This is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had . The side panels look like they are very thin , as others I have worn , but this one is not.It is sized down so I suggest buying at least the next size up to get a good feel . I would n't recommend this item if you are looking for something to wear , other than very special occasions.QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra -LRB- 1100 -RRB- 38B/Nude QT Strapless Convertible Bustier Bra -LRB- 1100 -RRB-
 Not what I was expecting . It felt great but not the finish I was looking for.It was very ` old ladyish '' . Good service from this company .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .

 Ow.And ugly under clothes.The search for a really good strapless bra continues .
 I bought this bra because of all the good reviews . I am returning it . It was too tight and the cup size was too small . I know my size , I bought another bra in it today at the mall . Besides being to small it was just uncomfortable and painful . I wear a 38D so I need support and this was not providing it.However , today I went to JCPennys and got a great strapless made by ambrielle . It 's comfortable and supportive I recommend it if you need a good strapless that is comfortable and supportive . Also the victoria secret bio fit is pretty good but more expensive .
 the bra is not true to its size and since there is no padding , it creates a see-through effect under the sun
 Simply put , it was almost as if I had not worn anything . This did not provide enough support even though it wrapped well around my breast .
 We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length -LRB- the 36 was more like a 34 -RRB- , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it `` mostly '' fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way .
 Not too sure if I like this bra.If you are over 60 and have a 38D cup , the support should be greater than a young person whose breasts have not fallen , do not think that this bra could perform this miracle of supporting so much flesh
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .

 Just going to list the issues
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .

 I purchased this backpack in December . It was nice at first , but then stitching started coming loose and the inside pocket has a big hole in it -LRB- only lipstick went in that pocket -RRB- Due to Amazon 's return policy -LRB- 30 days -RRB- they were not able to help me with the bag . The Amazon Support was wonderful . They did help me find a number so I could call Prada.Prada would not honor their quality of the backpack because I bought it at Amazon . If I bought it in a store , they would fix it for me . The first person I spoke to at Prada Corp. was rude and condescending . The second person I spoke to was much nicer , but once she found out I bought the backpack on Amazon , she was a little bit condescending.The moral of the story is , I wo n't buy Prada from Amazon again due to being stuck with a substandard product and no way to ensure Prada will fix it .
 My fiance bought this bag for me . Within 2 weeks the straps/handles ripped off . Amazon would n't do anything -LRB- between purchase date and actually using it - it was past 30 days -RRB- . Prada also would not exchange or even fix it . Condescending staff . I had the bag fixed at a show cobbler . The interior lining also ripped very easily.Luxury good ? Not so much .
 I believe that these must be fake . Please take a look at the emblem on the inside lining . If the logo edges are not perfectly clear , then it is fake . Also in the genuine article , the nylon is thicker and more durable . The nylon does not wrinkle neat the leather trim . Also , the stitching is very durable .
 The fabric of the bandanna is very stiff , making it stick up on your head when you tie it . This bandanna is more suited for people who wear bandannas as scarves . Some of the stiffness is mitigated by serial washings .
 Compared to the same version I purchased at my local Wal Mart , these sweat pants did not measure up in the fit , comfort , or price departments . I do not recoommend them . All four pairs will likely be taken to Good Will ...
 The pants I purchased were 3X and labled 3X . When the waist was stretched out it was 48 inches . I have only a 30 inch inseam but the legs were short . On the package slip there is no return information and no way to contact the seller . Definatly not comfortable pants to lounge in .
 I bought two pair of these ... Yesterday , as I bent to tighten toilet seat bolts ... . THEY RIPPED OPEN at the crotch ... Today , I wore the second pair , and as I bent down to pick up a garden hose , this pair ALSO RIPPED WIDE OPEN at the crotch !!! First time worn both days ... This has happened twice to very old sweats AFTER they were worn , beat and washed and dried hundreds of times !!! If you do buy these cheaply sewn sweats , make SURE you are wearing clean underwear beneath them !!! I 'm sure my two pair were not the usual ... . Either the thread was bad , or the seams at the crotch area were just sewn too close to the edge of the fabric . . Since i have OLDER pairs of Jerzees sweats and they never split open , I 'm sure most pair will hold up for long wear ... Bottom line , . . These sweats should NOT have split open on me . . I was NOT doing anything that unusual . And it was the FRONT that split ! -LRB- I 'm not that well endowed either -RRB- Lol . .
 No pockets as advertised for these sweatpants , which is one of the things I wanted in my order . Otherwise they are what I expected .
 Ordered Jerzee 's 4850 sweatpants a short time ago -LRB- jan ' 10 -RRB- as a lounging garment for around the house . Within a few days the cheap , flimsy drawstring broke . I gave Jerzee `` benefit of the doubt '' and ordered another pair shortly afterwards . You guessed it , the flimsy drawstring broke , again . If Jerzee was a concerned manufacturer , that paid attention to customer satisfaction , they would have corrected this flaw before its offering . Customers , do n't waste your money on this product .
 I was disappointed in the fit of these sweats after washing . They shrink at least one half size so buying a size larger did n't help . The fit is below waistline especially during exercise , and the inseam is shorter than expected for the size . The pockets are the best feature ; I would not recommend these pants and will not buy them again .
 These are tight around the ankle and uncomfortable - returns are not friendly and restocking fees are applied . Not the customer service I am used to shopping on amazon.com
 Bought 2pr . in early ' 10 . Drawstring on each pair broke before having them for a month . The pants are comfortable , but useless for me without the waist support . For pennies Jerzee could 've made a better product . Customer , beware !

 The first time I wore this busiter the plastic support wire popped right out in the middle of dinner sticking out under my underarm . Not good .
 I read some of the reviews about this product and most of them were positive and only one was negative so I thought I 'd go ahead and order this product . The product arrived quickly . I tried the QT bustiere on and found not only was it extremely uncomfortable but it did n't look the product pictured on the site . I doubt I will order from HerRoom , again !
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 Just going to list the issues
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge . And for the record , I do not have a very small waist compared to the rest of me , in fact , I 'd say I am pretty square shaped.I exchanged the bra , -LRB- and had to pay the shipping myself and wait 4 weeks to receive the next size down -RRB- for a 32b hoping that the 2 inches would do the trick . The bust is now rather tight , but hey , push up is the goal here , so I can live with that part . And the waist mostly fits - at least it does n't fold over itself now . I 'm not sure it 's making my waist any smaller either though , which I presumed was half the point of the long line bra . The padding is rather thick in the front , so I am hoping it does n't actually add inches to my waist . I have yet to try it on with my wedding dress . I am not really thrilled with the final product , but I do n't have time to wait 4 + more weeks for a different one or pay for more return shipping . I would stay away from this product if you are at all petite .
 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly . When I returned it I was told they would not take it because it had been worn or washed . It had not ! I am appalled that I am now I have paid and have nothing to show for it !

 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .
 Good quality sweatshirt , but I agree with the reviewers who commented that the sizes seem to run large . This was true for my order and it was returned .
 I just got two clothes one week ago . I am extremely disappointed . One cloth has very sharp cuts on the front and the logo color is different from the image on the website . The other cloth has the same problem of logo color which makes the cloth looks very ugly . I have to return the two clothes which cost me 9 dollars . Be very aware !
 Item was HUGE , not suitable to wear to the gym for a workout . Item was returned .
 I normally wear a large size sweatshirt , but after reading several reviews which indicated these run large I ordered a medium . Apparently I should have ordered small , as the medium is too large in the chest and shoulders , and the sleeves come nearly to my fingertips . They 're 4 '' longer than a size large Izod sweatshirt I own . I 'm 5 ' 11 '' and weigh 175 , so unless you 're larger I suggest you order the small size . Other than that it 's a decent sweatshirt for the price .

 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge . And for the record , I do not have a very small waist compared to the rest of me , in fact , I 'd say I am pretty square shaped.I exchanged the bra , -LRB- and had to pay the shipping myself and wait 4 weeks to receive the next size down -RRB- for a 32b hoping that the 2 inches would do the trick . The bust is now rather tight , but hey , push up is the goal here , so I can live with that part . And the waist mostly fits - at least it does n't fold over itself now . I 'm not sure it 's making my waist any smaller either though , which I presumed was half the point of the long line bra . The padding is rather thick in the front , so I am hoping it does n't actually add inches to my waist . I have yet to try it on with my wedding dress . I am not really thrilled with the final product , but I do n't have time to wait 4 + more weeks for a different one or pay for more return shipping . I would stay away from this product if you are at all petite .
 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly . When I returned it I was told they would not take it because it had been worn or washed . It had not ! I am appalled that I am now I have paid and have nothing to show for it !

 The first time I wore this busiter the plastic support wire popped right out in the middle of dinner sticking out under my underarm . Not good .
 I read some of the reviews about this product and most of them were positive and only one was negative so I thought I 'd go ahead and order this product . The product arrived quickly . I tried the QT bustiere on and found not only was it extremely uncomfortable but it did n't look the product pictured on the site . I doubt I will order from HerRoom , again !
 this sports bra did not work for me mainly because the shoulder straps have no means of adjustment otherwise it 's very nice .
 The underwires in center create a bulge at top edge between the boobs , with the bulge visible when wearing a T shirt . Possibly the wires being on the outside create a more prominent bulge than wires would do if inside . I ordered a cup size larger than usual , as recommended by other reviewers here . The cups fit well and smoothly . The overall bra design seems to be the problem . Also there are pills on the fabric under the arms after I 've worn it five times . I have skinny arms and upper body , so there 's no unusual rubbing that would create the pilling . I wonder whether the 35 percent polyester makes it more pill prone . To determine my band and cup sizes , I followed professional fitter guidelines , except that I ordered a cup size larger than I usually do . The fit on me is fine , with no excess fabric . I wanted this bra for support , less shoulder strain because of its wider straps , and the naturalness/softness of high cotton content . The support and shoulder comfort are not as great as I would like but I will probably wear this bra around the house when I 'm alone .
 I love this bra , but I had to cancel my order after waiting a month and a half for my items . They sent one note about it being on backorder after 3 weeks , but there was no more communication after that.Not cool .
 First when I got it -LRB- really quickly by the way -RRB- I could n't figure out how to wear it ... the wires for the underwire were on the outside of the bra ? Huh ? Yeah , super weird ... plus the sizing was totally wrong . I had to go to a store and buy one , this just did n't do it at all . Gave it to a friend , maybe they can use it !
 This bra had the weirdest shaped cups I have ever seen . I am a perfect 36 D , and this bra squeezed me out the top , and had a pointy little cup . Reminded me of a pre-puberty shaped breast . It was terrible ! The structure seemed like it would be great for support , but it misshaped your breasts when you put it on .
 they made this bra smaller and the cups smaller and the cups also make my boobs look pointy , what happened and why have they changed ? and mine is not 95 % cotton either so the material has changed too !!! Do n't buy these , I think I am returning them for false claims , the cotton content is not the same and the bra is not as comfortable !! It gives that uni-boob look , it is very comfortable and holds the girls in place so they are not bouncing along but I sure wish it was made so it would separate instead of forcing them together .
 This bra did not fit well at all . It 's been a while now since I purchased and I can not recall the exact details . You should only buy a bra online if it 's a model you already own and know it fits .
 I did n't have high expectations for the price but I think it was false advertising . The picture shows something that was not true . It showed feathers . They do n't exists . The head dress was much nicer in the photo than in fact . Please be honest in what you are selling . Show the true product and let us decide if we want to spend the money for it . I will think twice before I order on line again , for fear all products are not as shown . Sham on you .
 I ordered this costume because I LOVED the black feather boa around the neckline and around the bottom of the costume / When I received the costume I was SO upset because there was NO black feather boa or anything that even resembled black feathers on this costume . It was some little cheap piece of fur that might have been 1/2 inch wide . The middle piece that tied around your waist was missing , the choker was way too big and the feather on the headpiece was broken . A complete waste of money , I could n't even wear it . I was very upset by the whole thing and ended up having to run out and buy another costume to wear to my Wild Wild West party .
 Just going to list the issues
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it

 The product was advertized as leather suspenders . The only leather , is the tips where they connect to the paints . . So there for the suspenders are not leather . this is definetly a misleading advertizment and also it says -LRB- NO returns -RRB- wonder why ?? John Eanes .
 I would n't have bought the skirt had I known from the description that it had a slit , especially since the slit was in the front and so could n't not be concealed .
 I thought it was made in the U.S.A. . Material manufactured in the U.S. but `` assembled in Mexico '' . This is NOT made in the United States of America .
 Guess my gut is bigger than a size 40 Levi or Wrangler jeans because I have to wear these with the buttons open on the sides even though I wear size 40 Levi 's and Wranglers . I also do n't like that fact that the straps connect to a piece that is sown on the front at a place lower that the edge of the material . So the material tends to roll inward and is uncomfortable . Bummer .
 I ordered these one size larger than I take in Levi 's or Wranglers , but they still did not fit .

 these simple shoe trees were exactly what i was looking for but was very disappointed when i tried to use them on most of my shoes which are not triple `` e '' wide . these shoe trees/stretchers do not fit into normal width and tapered-toe shoes .

 I have a Denali jacket that I LOVE and have been wearing it all the time for the past 2 years -LRB- can wear 3 seasons in New England ! -RRB- ... that 's why I decided to purchase another one . Buyers be aware that the new Denali jackets are `` recycled '' materials . If you had an old version , you will notice the difference ... if not ... maybe not ? The jacket seems `` cheaper '' and not as plush , thick , soft , or warm . I was n't sure if it was a defect or a fake or what ? But , it has all the North Face tags . This was my favorite jacket and it is unfortunate that they cheezed out on it . I will not purchase another .
 My mom brought me this jacket for Christmas in hot pink since she knows that 's my favorite color . I 've seen lots of girls wearing them and heard things about it being the best jacket and having an insulator that keeps you warm . I was very disappointed when I put it on and felt how thin this jacket was . I wore it outside in the cold winter as well as the breezy spring now and it has not kept me warm ! I 've had to wear a jacket underneath it and yet I was still cold , but than again I am cold blooded , but for a $ 100 plus jacket , it should do what it says and keep a person warm for Gods sake . - __ -
 I open the package.It smells terrible.I try it on ... it is not what i expected for a jacket that goes for over $ 100 in North Face stores.I thought it 'd be amazing and the warmest jacket I own as everyone rants and raves.Thinner than authentic jackets.Tags are real , but I researched this and one thing that commonly happens is when factories get the design , they make authentic ones , but at night when most go home , some untrustworthy people make the same ones using cheap , non-authentic materials and that 's what we call FAKE .

 I actually like the material and cut of the shirt . However , I have had it for 2 weeks and have had 4 buttons fall off each of the two shirts I purchased . While its not a big deal to sew them back on , it is very annoying . I would recommend this with the caveat of add tacking to the buttons before wearing .

 I bought this belt less than a year ago , and have worn it pretty constantly since then . Normally I wear the -LRB- dark -RRB- brown side out because most of the time I wear the belt with the khakis I have to wear for work . Four or five months into wearing the belt , I started noticing that the leather on the brown side is starting to crack . That side has completely cracked through to the next layer , and now I have to be pretty careful not to stress the belt too much when I put it on.It was a good-looking belt to begin with , and the buckle itself is very solid and nice , but it will not stand up to everyday use .
 This is easily the worst belt I have ever owned . The leather is stiff and difficult to bend around into the buckle . The `` brown '' is so dark it is barely distinguishable from the black . Worst of all , the three layers began to separate at the point where it goes through the buckle on the first wearing . Not to mention that the bends at the buckle have set in so severely in just a few wearings that it will look awful if I gain or lose enough weigh to move to a different notch . All I can say for it is that the buckle is quite attractive .
 First , just like 99 % of all clothes and apparel sold in USA it is made in China . Second , after just 2 weeks of wear the pieces of leather started to come apart and the hole tore and very noticeable marks developed . Do n't buy this piece of crap .
 This belt is a nightmare to use . It is so thick that you can not insert it in the metal belt slot next to the buckle . The space provided is too small to allow this thick belt to be bent and slid into the metal slot . Thus you can only hope to insert it into the belt loop on your trousers provided you have sufficent length.This was a waste of money and I wish I had returned it before starting to use it . Of course your advertising description was too vague and photos did not show these short comings.Anybody at Amazon want a belt?How about my money back ??

 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .
 These shirts are a great price . My husband is a 4xlt and with one wash they shrunk drastically . Mostly shrunk in length . While they were a great deal - with only wearing them one time . . they have now become too short for him . I followed the instructions for washing also ...
 The shirt I bought was XXL for a reason ... I am fat . While it fit just fine in my chest , The stomach area was narrow .
 I have never got such a bad purchase from Amazon . Offcourse I was attracted by the brand and the price . The shirt was having a real bad sizing . It was not large or medium while ordered for a large one . It still is haning in my closet and is useless.The design looks as if at the first look itself it can be identified as a discontinued model or design or something.Do not waste your money on this .
 I received two of these shirts of the same size . Both were too small for the indicated size and were incorrectly cut.Avoid .
 This shirt is too long to wear inside or out . Not Ralph Polo quality , just style .

 The jacket itself its well made . BUT they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture ...
 I bought 2 of these least year . First the ID info came off enroute , then the green rollup part came off coming back . Will not purchase again .

In addition , when I changed my address , unlike other luggage tags where oyu simply insert a new card , this one I had to scrub the old marker off and it did n't all come off , and then try to re-write on top of it . Furthermore , taking it on and off the luggage is extremely difficult and I needed to use a pliers to get it off and back on . I would recommend sticking to a more traditional -LRB- flat -RRB- luggage tag . I really do n't like this one

 I read some of the reviews about this product and most of them were positive and only one was negative so I thought I 'd go ahead and order this product . The product arrived quickly . I tried the QT bustiere on and found not only was it extremely uncomfortable but it did n't look the product pictured on the site . I doubt I will order from HerRoom , again !
 I am normally a 34b in bra sizing and I am a pretty standard size 4 in clothing . When I got the 34b bra , the bust fit , but the waist was HUGE - ruffling , rippling , could have fit another person in with me , huge . And for the record , I do not have a very small waist compared to the rest of me , in fact , I 'd say I am pretty square shaped.I exchanged the bra , -LRB- and had to pay the shipping myself and wait 4 weeks to receive the next size down -RRB- for a 32b hoping that the 2 inches would do the trick . The bust is now rather tight , but hey , push up is the goal here , so I can live with that part . And the waist mostly fits - at least it does n't fold over itself now . I 'm not sure it 's making my waist any smaller either though , which I presumed was half the point of the long line bra . The padding is rather thick in the front , so I am hoping it does n't actually add inches to my waist . I have yet to try it on with my wedding dress . I am not really thrilled with the final product , but I do n't have time to wait 4 + more weeks for a different one or pay for more return shipping . I would stay away from this product if you are at all petite .
 Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns ! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly .

 This is the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had .

 Ordered these because I prefer a sweatpant without a pocket , however that is the only good thing about them . They are thin and lightweight with a very cheap feel to them . The drawstring is very weak and breakable , unusable actually . They are very undersized also , a large is more like a medium or medium small . These are comparable to the cheapo sweatpants you see in big box stores that sell for $ 5 . Unfortunately I paid much more than that .
 i ordered these sweatpants because walmart was out and when i got them the size i got didnt fit and they wouldnt take them back there were for a boy size
 I 'm pretty short . . about 5 ' 2 '' I guess ... and these were superrr long on me . Great comfy fit . . not too tight in the waist . . just how I like it . But it was just really long . . so I 'm hoping with a few washes . . they shrink just a bit . : /
 To start off , these are replacing an older pair of jerzees . My original pair were made in the US . these are not . Second , the new ones have an inferior and cheap elastic waistband compared to my original pair . The cut is odd also with an unusually long crotch . The search continues .
 good weight to the pant but the sizeing is bad , too long and very big in the leg and backside department

 I ended up googling these type of panty hose so i could try and find a size chart in order to make sure i got the right size and did n't just guess . I 'm almost 5-7 and 135 and I got size 1-2 . Ya , that was too small and i ended up ripping them trying to shretch them up higher so the crotch was n't midway down my thighs . I mean , they are n't a bad quality for the price and i probably would have liked them if I had gotten the right size ... . just make sure you get the right size !
 I did not want panty hose with control top . The item does not state it has control top . I returned it the first time as it was the wrong size . It was replaced with control top panty hose and when I called the company I was told they do not make hose that is not control top . Strange , as the first batch did not have control top . The fit was very odd . The hose top had what appeared to be more of a thong than a French cut panty and the thong part was not in the correct place . I returned two of the three pair .
 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .
 This item has a great quality in itself but has a great sizing issues . The one size fits too tight and one size plus the garter band almost reaches your chest besides this a great made item . What a dilemma !
 Great product ! I was hoping for a way I could insult fat people and trans women at the same time , and this really did the trick .

 I ordered two of these bags - one to keep and one to give as a gift - and they 'd do n't even match each other . They seem to have authentic looking logo labels and authenticity card , but the zipper/hardware seems horribly cheap . The zippers are two totally different colors on the bags I got . I 'm not sure if they 're `` real '' or not , but they are n't consistantly constructed .

 I was very excited to see this bag on Amazon . It 's a perfect shape , by a very fashionable designer , and available at an incredibly affordable price . However , even though it is sold directly through Amazon , once I received the bag and took a good look at it in person , I doubted the authenticity of the bag.I understand that it 's Amazon 's modus operandi to send these bags without dust covers and simply with the authenticity card included inside the plastic bag -LRB- or whatever other packaging they choose to use -RRB- . That I know and that I expected based on a previous Prada bag purchase . Since the authenticity of the Prada bag was fine , I thought that Amazon would not steer me wrong with this Fendi bag.Upon receiving the bag , I immediately noticed the strap of this bag looked very cheap . The edge of the strap did not have stitching and instead was just a glazed sort of leather-look finish . It actually looked like a plastic strap . That made me suspicious , but then I thought that perhaps this particular style did not have a stitched handle . However , when I saw an indisputably authentic one in person , I saw there should indeed have been stitching on the strap.I plan on returning my bag . I know $ 150 is a very tempting price to pay for a Fendi bag , but since I doubt its authenticity , I 'd much rather spend that money on a Kate Spade or Coach bag that I know is authentic .

 It is a cute handbag . But too easy to get dirty and you can do nothing with that . I tried to clean it , but messed it up . And I can not longer use it .

 I purchased these bibs fairly recently since my 4 month old baby drools a lot . The Velcro is so razor sharp it that if becomes in contact with there skin it will cut there neck . Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra to buy good well made bibs . These are cheap garbage quality bibs .
 I got these thinking that they were just like the 5 pack I-play terry bibs that I bought -LSB- ... -RSB- , but they 're not ! The 5 pack is three ply , with the plastic sandwiched in the middle of two terry cloth covers , so drools and spit ups will not soak through . These just have the two layers with the plastic on the back , somehow it soaks right through leaving my son 's chest all wet . It seems like the company is trying to save money or something by skimping on an extra layer of terry cloth . I ca n't recommend these , they did n't work for me . I suggest going to Babiesrus.com and buying the I-play 5 pack bibs , they are far superior , I depend on them every day and two months later , they 've stood up very well to -LRB- almost -RRB- daily washings .
 As of July 2011 these bibs are NOT made with any plastic between the 2 layers of terry , and the terry is so thin that you can practically see through it ! I would n't buy these again , nor would I recommend them .
 The Velcro on this product scratched the back of my baby boy 's neck . Unlike other bibs that we have , this product 's Velcro is located directly in the back of the neck and not off to the side . There is a large Velcro patch in the back that scratched my baby 's neck on 3-4 occasions before we figured out what was happening . The final straw was when taking off the bib it scratched him so bad that he cried and had a viable wound for days . Save your money and buy a higher quality bib .
 I was very disappointed after using the first one for 30 minutes . My 10-month old son is teething and his drool soaked right through to the back after only 30 minutes , making his clothes all wet . I do n't understand how they can sell these as waterproof . Also the color ran from the bib onto my son 's white onsies . Total waste of money .
 I bought this product based on the rave reviews and they were terrible ! My 3-month old twins are not drooling yet , just using them for regular bottle feed and it soaks thru so quickly . Unless I got a batch of defected bibs , they really are no better than paper napkins ...
 These bibs are ok . They are really thin , so on extra drooly or spit-up days they do n't hold up well . They will soak straight through to my son 's clothes . The pack comes with 10 bibs , so I always have a fresh one to change him into . But I wish they would work better so I do n't have to change them out multiple times a day.The price is reasonable , but you get what you pay for . I would n't buy these bibs again .
 I bought these bibs for the ` waterproof ' nature . My son was still SOAKED !!! The liquid soaks right through these bibs ! Waste of money !!! DO NOT BUY !!!
 This bib is not waterproof . It has a little plastic in between the fabrics but that doesnt do anything . I think this listing should be removed for false advertising .
 On the packaging , the buyer is advised -LRB- evidently with some pride -RRB- &#34; Designed in Asheville , NC and Made in China . &#34; I initially thought &#34; design &#34; is a pretty lofty word to be using with regard to a flap of cloth to keep the puke off my son 's clothes . I was quickly proven wrong , as these bibs demonstrate just how poorly designed a simple bib can be.As noted by another reviewer , the velcro that holds the straps together behind the neck is made of some sharpened abrasive material more suited to scrubbing baked-on food from dirty pots . Unless you take it off carefully -LRB- or if your baby is enterprising and/or mischievous enough to tear it of himself -RRB- , it will leave a nasty scratch on the back of his neck . It caused an abrasion bad enough that the collar of his nightshirt was left bloodstained.Maybe the geniuses in Asheville should have sourced the design to China as well ?
 Only 75 % cotton surface -LRB- 25 % polyester -RRB- with polyurethane inner liner . Seems 100 % cotton terry bibs are hard to come by .
 I was expecting a plastic layer on the bottom side of the bib but it is just terry cloth so it is not waterproof at all . My daughter 's shirt was socked right away from her drool and on top of that the color leaked onto her shirt and skin ! That is extremely dangerous for her delicate skin and irritating that her shirt got all dirty and stained . I would not recommend these bibs !
 I bought these because I was tired of changing the baby every 10 minutes . Spit up and drool is a normal thing . These are marketed completely wrong .1 -RRB- They are NOT waterproof at all2 -RRB- They are NOT absorbent at allWithin 5 minutes of wearing these after feeding baby , the clothes are completely wet and the entire bib is drenched . It seems that one area that is wet seems to spread out throughout the entire bib.The terry cloth also keeps the wetness feeling icy cold against baby skin and even if I touch it.Also be careful , the velcro is verrrry scratchy -LRB- more so than usual -RRB- and is only stitched down with fabric covering the edge of the velcro on 2 of the 3 sides . I 've sliced my finger on more than 1 occasion from that stupid velcro -LRB- it 's like a paper cut -RRB- , so imagine what it can do to the baby if you 're not careful.Not worth it ...
 These bibs are perfect for a 3month old but did not fit my 7month old . He is only 16lbs . The colors are great , but I wish the sizing was clear in the description .
 These are advertised as being waterproof but unfortunately they are not . The colors are beautiful but if you are looking for something that will keep your little one dry , this is n't the solution for you .
 I 'm beyond sad . I love these bibs . They are the only ones I 've found that do n't leak drool onto my LO 's clothes , but I just discovered the red one bled all over one of my LO 's best white outfits . -LRB- I did prewash the bibs and he wore it one other time over a black shirt so it 's been washed at least twice before bleeding -RRB- I 'm hoping it will wash out , but I 'm not holding my breath . I have n't noticed a problem with the other colors and I have the boy and girl color set . -LRB- I have n't used the pink girl ones though . -RRB- I 'll still continue to use these bibs , but I might look harder for another waterproof absorbent bib if I were to buy more . -LRB- Though , I 'm not sure if there is anything else out there . -RRB- My other complaint about these is that the velcro closes in the middle . I much prefer bibs that move the velcro over to the side so it is not right behind the baby 's head and it 's easier to get on and off .
 I like the bib but the Velcro is very had/tough and leaves scratches all over the back of 4 month old baby 's neck . Would give four + stars if they were buttons or softer Velcro .
 Although I usually love Green Sprouts products , these bibs are poorly designed . As others have mentioned the velcro closure is VERY scratchy and irritates my baby 's neck , even though I 'm careful when putting them on and taking them off . Also , the washing instructions say to line dry . With the amount of laundry I do , I ca n't be line drying bibs .
 My 5 month old twins are drool factories ! I was having a difficult time finding waterproof bibs , so I ordered these . They fit well , and also had some room for growth . However , the bib still needed changing after an hour . The reverse side of the bib would become wet , so the reversible option is not very useful . The only feature I did find useful was the terry cloth fabric , which dried quickly .
 When the product states that it 's waterproof , I expected my son 's shirt to stay dry at least 1-2 hrs . but it was very disappointing to find out within 30 min . his shirt got wet . even though it has plastic layer in the middle , did n't feel like it . it was n't absorbent at all.according to the packaging , it 's for 3 to 12mo olds . amazon 's product description does n't say anything about suggested age range . my son is 16months old who drools constantly . maybe this product should only be used for kids under 12mo . and does n't really work for heavy drooling toddlers . very disappointed in the product and amazon lacking product description .
 I bought these bibs for my grandson because the price seemed fair & I liked the idea of the plastic `` sandwiched '' in between the 2 cloth 's . The quality is nice but the sizing is incorrect . My grandson is only 5 months old , -LRB- average in size -RRB- & the bibs are supposed to be for the ages of 6 to 12 months but he is outgrowing the bibs already ! Does n't seem fair that `` Green Sprouts '' is n't advertising everything correctly . So be leery of ordering these bibs because they are for a size NB to 4 months of age .
 These bibs are a great value however after first wash they lose their softness and is n't very aborbant . Go for the more expensive bibs , its worth it .
 I generally wear a 38x30 , and that 's what I bought in these , they are sized quite a bit smaller in the waste . I 'm going to go ahead and keep them and see how they wear in , but you may want to get a waste size up . I 'll be wearing them in a dress office setting , and I 'm surprised how good these look , hopefully they last a long time too .
 for no apparent reason these are humongous . my bf currently wears 32x32 which are a bit short and a bit tight on him so we tried to go a size up - but for some reason these were ginormous !
 my boyfriend currently wears 32x32s that were getting a bit tight and a bit long on him . for some reason these in 34x34 were ridiculously huge ! Returned
 These pants are fake no tags fake packaging.the zipper was broke.I work in 874s for over 25 years an I know how they look an feel an these look an feel &#34; FAKE &#34;
 Just going to list the issues
 Waist is not true to size just like many dickies products , its better if you just go to a store and try them on first
 These pants , for me , where a bit tighter than I thought it would be , also stiffer and smaller than I had hoped .
 My husband always wears 36 30 . He has several Dickie pants ... I got 874 which were the wrong ones . They were stiff and small . I had to return and now pay postage beause they were part of another order making over $ 25 . Also had to go to UPS and post and will have return postage taken out of refund ... My mistake and I paid for it
 i ordered gray and they sent green . GREEN , come on guys really ? at least they were the right size . well done
 I remember when I was a teenager Dickies would last forever ; nowadays they fall apart pretty quickly . I think they must be cutting costs on quality control ...
 I had a pair of Dickies fall apart after a month . Then they would n't honor the warranty . Shady company and now making crap products .
 The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them .1 . -RRB- CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard .2 . -RRB- They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM !! 3 . -RRB- They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . -RRB- They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc. ... STAY AWAY .
 Be aware that these run small - At least by a size or more . And they 're straight leg , not boot cut , so there 's a bit of a taper at the ankle .
 I 've been buying Dickies , particularly the 874 's for over 20 years and I was n't impressed with these ones at all . . While the item was clearly marked as a Dickies product , it did n't look or feel like any pair of Dickies I 've ever bought before.The material seemed very thin , and the pants had no factory crease . . Live and learn . .
 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .

 The Bra squeaked loudly until after multiple washings . Now the wire has poked through and I can no longer wear it , after only several months . I would like to return .

 The fabric feels fake and it makes me itch , and the the inside material sheds for numerous washings -- I will never buy 50 50 blends again , 80 cotton 20 polyester is my new minimum -- The hoodie looks good but feels terrible .
 Perhaps that was my choice buy this item in amazon , because is my favorite store for everything , I belive convenient buy one complete custome and the '' HAT '' in the picture looks good , but you must to buy this in party city is just $ 9 and here I paid 31 because the HAT , Belive me this is a cheap , weak , fabrique horrible hat , big mistake do not worth that I pay $ 22 more for this . : -LRB-
 What junk . Gross substance that I guess was supposed to be fabric except felt to cheap to even qualify as fabric . Very small for the size range . Difficult to put on so it wo n't have any life after Halloween . Shirt ripped when my 2 year old put it on , straight through the aforementioned gross fabric . No hat . Could n't even return it . Bah.Creative Education of Canada makes a good easy on pirate vest . Try and find it instead .
 I just received my package and I am really upset because the costume was open and missing the eye patch . They probably got a return from another client and just put the product back in stock without checking . Now I have to hurry up to a store and try to find something . Another complain is that the costume DOES N'T INCLUDE A HAT ... they should n't show a kid with a hat as the product picture , if it 's not part of the costume .
 I bought this based on reviews and a fairly cute picture ... BIG MISTAKE !!! It is CHEAP and CHEEZY !!! I would NEVER let my son wear the shirt or pants - they are made of some horrible , nasty , flimsy polyester . In short , the under part of the costume is worthless ... it is nothing but an atrocious looking fire hazard !!! The hat has velcro that wo n't stay put , the boot things are completely lame and look like weird bear feet , the eye patch is cheap ... the only almost redeeming thing about the costume is the coat because it looks good and contains some trace amount of cotton fabric.All in all , one star for the fact that I did n't pay the $ 70 list price !
 I bought a 12 pack of these black `` Gold Toe '' socks on August 2nd 2K5 . Let that sink in for a moment . Here is a guy who bought socks TEN months ago , and went through his Amazon history to track down this product.The fabric of the socks is a very thin material . Which I guess is pretty standard for black socks.However , these Gold Toes develop holes at an alarming rate . I have thrown 9 -LRB- out of 24 -RRB- socks in the garbage because of holes or tears . While the Gold Toe corporation might interject `` Hey , thats not even 33 % ! '' , what they did n't realize is I only wear black socks 1 day a week!Time for some math ! 40 uses / 12 pair = 3.3 washes to failureCan that be right ? I 'll be the first to admit I have no idea what the average life expectancy of a sock is , but it has to be greater than 3 washes to be worth purchasing .
 Bought 4 pairs , all have holes within 8 months . Completely ridiculous considering the ` premium ' price . They used to be much better , I 've bought them off and on for 15 years , but no more .
 Tried these and then sent them back . They will not stay up , they end up around your ankle . When washed they shrunk almost 20 % in length . Also they `` Are Not '' Fluffie , not even a little bit . They were not worth the special low price .
 I ripped three new sox in a week . Tears right below the ankle . poor craftsmanship and material . Does anyone have a suggestion for a great pair of sox ?
 I 'm 5 ' 6 ... and these are just an inch -LRB- barely -RRB- above my knee ... and thats really stretching it ... just for show , not really for much production if you get what i mean .
 The item looks amazing , but the fit is rather poor . It was ordered for someone who is a size M , but without a shapely rear end , the item kind of sags .
 I purchased a 2nd set of Harbor Bay beach pants after liking the 1st set of pants so much . I ordered different colors and expected the same pants . When the order came in a note was in the box that they had changed vendors and these were an equal quality . The pants seem to be of a lighter material than the original and were longer in the legs and shorter in the seat . I have to take the new style pants to shorten the legs or end up wearing them out from stepping on them . Since pants of this size are hard to find I will most likely buy them again but will change to the ones with the elastic band at the ankles . If I could have worn them out of the box I would have given 3 1/2 stars !

 This would be a great wallet if it was constructed of better quality materials . The outside nylon has held up fine , but the thin inside lining started tearing and shredding after about 3 months . Now 7 months later , it 's unusable . I 've replaced it with a leather Packers logo wallet from another source

 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .

I have to take the new style pants to shorten the legs or end up wearing them out from stepping on them . Since pants of this size are hard to find I will most likely buy them again but will change to the ones with the elastic band at the ankles . If I could have worn them out of the box I would have given 3 1/2 stars !

 Just received a set of the camo pro action mossy oak breakup XXL yesterday . They look OK . -LRB- I like the camo pattern -RRB- I normally wear XL size , I can tell you that the XXL Jacket is not what I would consider a generous cut -LRB- like some of the others may have implied -RRB- . The stuff sack that comes with it is totally useless since it is far to small to accomodate the XXL jacket and pants -LRB- it might be OK for a small or even a medium -RRB- the zipper appears to be plastic -LRB- at least it wo n't rust -RRB- and the snaps do pull apart very easily in the vertical plane . They seem to be a bit more sturdy in the horizontal plane.I think if you are looking for something for very occasional use in light winds they will probalbly be OK .
 I purchased this rain suit after doing a lot of comparison shopping . I decided that for the price , it was a great deal , but it turned out to be a great disappointment . First of all , the material is very unusual looking for being waterproof . Think fortified paper towel . I did n't even bother to test how effective it was though because the jacket fit like a hot air balloon . The chest area was fine , but the sleeves were large beyond reason . Generous fit is one thing , but I probably could have fit my body through the sleeves . I had to send it back .
 The very first time I took mine out of the package and tried it on , two of the seams separated . I used the contact form on Frogg Toggs ' website to request a return authorization . They did n't respond . I then phoned the company . They gave me a second number to call . I left a message there . Once again , no response . I wo n't be buying any more Frogg Toggs products .
 The jacket is too short . Needs to be longer , even a parka style with cinching waist would help , just to provide extra coverage . An XL on a 5 ' 8 '' male and ca n't sit down with out the jacket lifting in the back leaving an area to get wet . Ca n't lift arms over head for any normal activity with out jacket raising up as well . Cinching does n't help either . No pockets in jacket or pants , which stinks but is probably for waterproofing purposes . The jacket on the zipper also seems to leak pretty bad , left a wet spot all the way down the front of my shirt . The compactness and weight are great .
 My husband had a pair of these and the zipper broke . I got ready to buy a good rain suit and thought it was probably just a fluke about the zipper . BUT - the third time I wore mine , the zipper on MY jacket broke.Loved them at first - they were lightweight and did n't make me sweat inside them , and they blocked wind and water . Shame about the zipper because it negates all the benefits!I wo n't buy anything made by them again .

 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .

 This tote is much larger than indicated more like 22 `` by14 '' . The design on the tote by the artist Sara Henry is really cute , however the company that manufactured the tote besides making it almost grotesquely oversized also did a very poor job with the color dyes used . The colors in the picture of the tote online look much nicer to me than the tote actually looked when I received it and the tote has a funny odor . Although the workmanship and detailing on the tote is very well done the wood handles seem dwarfed by the large size of the tote and the detachable shoulder strap does not sit the purse comfortably next to one 's body . It 's too bad because this could have been a really cute fun tote . I do n't think the arist , Sara Henry has control over the manufacturing of the tote only the design and the design is darling . Hope the manufacturer makes some changes in the size and dyes used on this and the other Sara Henry totes .
 I purchased a 2nd set of Harbor Bay beach pants after liking the 1st set of pants so much . I ordered different colors and expected the same pants . When the order came in a note was in the box that they had changed vendors and these were an equal quality . The pants seem to be of a lighter material than the original and were longer in the legs and shorter in the seat . I have to take the new style pants to shorten the legs or end up wearing them out from stepping on them . Since pants of this size are hard to find I will most likely buy them again but will change to the ones with the elastic band at the ankles . If I could have worn them out of the box I would have given 3 1/2 stars !

 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .

 I bought this for my daughter for Halloween . It seems true to size . The outfit was not sewn properly at the seams , so therefore has small openings where there should not be . Also the Spiderweb collar , velcro 's onto the inside of the outfit . I do n't know how they got it to stand up in the picture , but I ca n't seem to figure out how to get it to stay like that . It just slumps backward and pulls the neckline apart . I am highly disappointed with this costume !
 I am sooo frustrated with Halloween costumes that do n't look like or perform like their pictures . I would like to know how they made the collar stand up for the picture ! I ended up painting wire black and then hot glueing it to the back of the collar and dress to get it to slightly stand up like the picture . Otherwise it just looks like a sailor collar because it velcros onto the inside of the dress . The costume is true to size and of decent quality material , just poor poor collar !!
 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .
 I ordered two pair of blue jeans and one black . Same size , same style . The black fit perfectly and the blue were way too tight . They fit my two sons , but not me -LRB- and we do not wear the same size -RRB- . This was very dissapointing , I expect more out of Lee , but I guess quality control does not apply to sizing . It 's hit or miss with these pants .
 These jeans are not quite as good as the Rustlers jeans at Walmart , which are ten dollars cheaper . I think the Rustlers are a bit heavier denim . Save some money and head to Walmart .
 Item was marked at a size which normally fits me . These were very , very large.They were not what I expected at all . I was trying to get a standard or slim fit jean .
 Beware , they are cut small.I am a 38 and these do not close.They are at least 2 sizes too small.All my other 38 's fit fine with room to spare.These are going back!I always love Lee jeans but these are no good .
 1 ` st time dissapointed by a product ordered online from Amazon.These jeans I ordered had a right hand pocket that had not been properly sewn .3 inches of the upper seam of this pocket had to be sewn shut -- after I discoveredI was losing a few things from this faulty pocket . Had to repair this seam.I have been buying these jeans locally and have an entirely better fitting jean , they aretruly 34W x 29L -- Amazon 's are more then 34W x 29L and also DARK BLUE JEANS INSTEAD OF PEPPERSTONE.The Salvation Army now has this disapointing Amazon order.C . B.
 This item is being returned . The rise was extremely short and the waist on a 33 was about and inch too small .
 I ordered two pairs of these pants for my husband in the size and style he always wears in Lee jeans . They looked to be the same quality as I expect and I almost removed the tags and just hung them in the closet . Luckily he tried a pair on and discovered the waist was really snug . The hips and legs fit perfectly so I 'm afraid to order the next size up . I returned both pairs . Amazon made this easy and free . Sizing has gotten to be a big problem lately . This is not the first time I have reordered a product and found the sizing changed from the original .
 Ordered these is 36 x 29 -- however the length was at least 2 inches off . Have purchased these in the past and did not have this problem
 Do n't know why it 's so baggy . It seems slim on the image ' Disappointed because the jeans feels great and durable . Just too baggy on the leg ' Lee 's jeans always feel great , that 's why I choose them . P.S. I choose the right size .
 I purchased these based on one of the other reviewers stating that these jeans sit on your waist . I do not like low rise jeans , I want my jeans to come up over my hips . When I received the jeans , I opened the first one and put it on , before I even got it pulled up , I could tell they were not right , once I got them up , the top of the jeans hit me in the middle of my hips , not my waist , needless to say I was not happy about the fit and immediately sent them back . I would n't call them `` low rise '' but they definitely do not come up to my waist . I ordered my waist size and they would not button up , I measured myself before ordering just to make sure , I would have had to add several more inches to the size in order to zip them up . I have the exact same size in another brand of jeans and they fit perfectly , I understand that different brands fit differently , I just wish the description here would state where these fall -LRB- high , mid or low rise -RRB- , I would put them between the low and mid rise . If you have purchased these exact jeans before and you know your size in them , then order , otherwise be aware that the waist size is not going to fall on your waist , but several inches below this.Wretha
 I have been wearing Lee standard fit straight leg jeans for decades . But Lee changed the pattern for their standard fit straight leg jeans in fall of 2011 . So unless you have a butt the size of a bus and thighs like utility poles you might want to reconsider . You can call Lee and complain that we do n't all want the gangster look . Ask them to bring back the old standard pattern . I am still looking for another brand until they do .
 My husband has a 32 &#34; waist , so I ordered 32x30 and they fell off of him ! I have a very difficult time finding his size in the retail stores , so thought ordering these would be the perfect solution . Color was great but fit was a disappointment !!
 back pockets are radically different . not the same as it showed on the picture . it 's a great pity ! i do not like the color
 size of the pants is very different from levis ' 1 . i am wearing levis oringnal , w32l32 , but this one , i also chose w32l32 , woo , it ; s too long , and maybe i should wear lee w33 or w34 , the waist is very narrow .2 . relaxed means fat ass , and relaxed legs ` very relaxed ' 3 . after i try it ' i ggave it to my friends ~ ~ PS ` made in mexico ` very thick
 they are too big and I have to find someone to buy them or return them ... . and i do not know how to do that
 It seems that there was a change in the style of the jeans . They have a lower rise than previous Lee jeans I have purchased and the pockets seem to be set lower . It looks like the pants are being worn low when they are not . It seems to be a younger style rather than something for a mature man .
 My husband has been wearing lee jeans for decades . This is the same name and the same description but not the same jean . The waist is enormously wide for a 34 and the whole style is more like ` no style ' and no defined waist . On top , the legs and seat are also much wider than the earlier models and we do n't even want to mention the material ... Ours are going back .
 I ordered the Pepperstone , and they developed two holes at the top of the back pockets . I got good , prompt return service from Amazon , but the replacement jeans developed the same holes after one wearing . Rather than go through Amazon again , I am working with the manufacturer -LRB- Lee Jeans -RRB- to investigate this flaw , as it is obviously not just a one time issue .
 Purchased Lee Regular Fit Jeans on 3/8/2011 . After 6 days of wear time , loose change started falling out of my left pocket.Further inspection showed the pocket -LRB- where I keep my keys & change -RRB- had worn to only a few threads on the bottom portion . I was stunned ! How could this have worn-out in such a short period.Unbelievably poor quality ! These were made in Mexico . Not sure if other mfg. facilities also show similar defect -LRB- s -RRB- . Yes , these were some of the cheapest jeans.Kind-a teaches me a lesson
 I 've been wearing Lees regular fit straight leg jeans for many years now.I assumed that these 2 pair would be the same fit as all the other Lee regular fit straight led jeans that I already own.These are relaxed/loose fit.If these ar n't relaxed fit I hate to see what realxed fit are like ! I feel like I ` am wearing potatoe sacks.I already washed then before wearing them so I guess I can not return them.Try them on first !
 They did not fit well , the fabric was inflexible and too heavy . My husband will not wear them anymore
 I ordered 1 pair - they came and were tapered - I liked them so I ordered another pair . Well the 2nd pair came but were not tapered - baggy type . It 's better to order Levi 521 jeans . Whick I did from Dillards .
 The description states that these are button fly ... They are NOT , they are zipper fly .100 % cottonButton Fly closureEverything about this jean feels just rightAn everyday fit that 's not too tight & not too looseIf you are looking for buton fly do n't waste your time with these.http : / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008EOH9Shttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008EOEV4http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XDQH4K
 I am not happy in giving one star for this lee jean , i am a lee jeans customer , i have like 12 pair of lee jean.I ordered the dark stone 38W * 29L and i got it , the leg was not 29 it was 27 !! and that is very strange ! i have the Pepperstone & Pepper Prewash colors from this model and they fit great , so i ordered the Dark Stone one and the leg was not 29 at all.Not only the Leg was n't 29 , but also the whole shape of the jean is wrong , as if its shrank-ed !

 I am writing from Georgia . I 've got my order from your site but I would like to tell you that an amount of details of the belt that I 've ordered to you are not enough . Besides back pockets are absolutely different from item that was uploaded on your site ; lines are not straight i.e. they have low quality . Moreover quality of the material is not corresponding to that brand -LRB- Lee -RRB- .
 Yes , I know stonewashed is supposed to be faded . However , the stonewashed versions are very poorly done . The Classic Stone is overdone to the point of being unwearable outside of working in the yard . Dark Stone is a standard jean that 's been washed twice . Awful execution .
 I went to a local brick and mortar and bought 3 pairs of Wranglers as it was ` time'I wear 34W x 29L but the store I went to did n't have them , so I got the 34x30 and to me they just seemed baggy at the legs . However , they fit fine in the waist , so the 34w is the correct size . I 've always bought 34w jeans and never had a problem . Wranglers , Lee 's , Nautica , Levis etc. . . I checked Amazon and they had these 34x29 ! Great , I bought a pair.Too tight , like I do n't have a gut , but this sausage wrap makes my skin squish over the waistband so it looks like I do . They feel like size 30 or 31 . I think even 32 would fit tight , maybe let me put a few fingers in my waistband , but these are too tight.If you are going to purchase these jeans , get the next size up.These Wrangler Jeans have the same issue in that they are way too tight for the size indicated.Genuine Wrangler Men 's Regular Fit JeanI got theseDockers Men 's Classic Fit 5-Pocket JeanDockers Jeans at 34 x 29 and they fit perfectly .
 I did not like the internal finish of the front pocket of low quality , expected better . As to the shape of the rear pocket is not the original LEE . I am disappointed with this pant .
 The pictures presented differ absolutely from what I have received
 I ordered two pair of jeans . 1 pair was used merchandise . Worn cuff was noticable . Tags removed . Would not order from vendor again .
 I was surprised by the bad quality of the jeans . But Unfortuntaly I did not discover that until you try it on and you can it return it . I did not recommended even for free .

 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .

 I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .
 I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China . I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered . They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed . I received the pants and they were made in China and did n't fit anything like the other 3 do . I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS . The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it . This was emailed from Zac . I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number . I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon . I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account . Fortunately , I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June . If you have an REI or Academy sports in your city , I would encourage you to purchase from them as you can check the country they are manufactured in . I refuse to purchase anything made in China due to them arming the enemy or a war I participated in .
 If you want to look stupid , ugly , and mean , then buy these mittens made from the skins of killed rabbits . Despite what the fur industry would like you to believe , animals killed for fur are treated cruelly , whether trapped or farmed . These days anyone who chooses to wear killed animal fur looks either ignorant , self-centred , or both .
 I purchased the pants and shirt from this store and they sent completely wrong sizes on both . I have emailed them to request to exchange them for the correct sizes , with no response from the store . I ordered an XL shirt and received size 2X . I ordered XLlong pants and received 3X pants . So I am just out the money I have spent and received unusable mechandise . The product itself would have been fine if they had sent the correct sizes . I would never order from them again .

 Well the shorts looked good and fit well , but I had to re sew every button on the shorts as the buttons were all about to fall off and one did i guess in shipping
 I ordered this item because in big bold letters it said will ship HALLOWEEN DAY !! But now I find out it wo n't be here until the 2nd of Nov. . Now why would I need it then ? Very stupid !!! And I wo n't ever buy from them again .

 I was so excited to get this item and now that i got it I am so mad . This is horrible the fabric is just hard to look at and the little bows and things just awful . I wanted what she had on in the pic . SAVE YOUR MONEY
 Does sound like a chime . Chain is too long , but if you use it without the chain straight onto the keychain , it will break . Now I might just drill a hole straight through the metal to get it `` working '' again . Other than that , looks GREAT !
 I only had this item for three days before it broke . Too big to be a keychain , it always poked me in the leg when ever I sat down with the keys in my pocket . Also when driving it would hit the other keys on my keyring and it would constantly make this annoying noise for the entire car ride.Overall a cheaply made keychain of a great movie , but it wont last you more than a week .
 My teenage daughter loved the shirt . The deliver was quick and the product as expected .

 These socks were much inferior to the previous ones I have purchased . They were ultra thin and very tight , no give to the fabric !
 The photo is quite deceiving . This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap , shiny , and is horrible to the touch . My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness . Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit !
 The suit is made of very poor cheap material.I wasted so much money on this suit.I should have read the review before I bought the suit .
 because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening . Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable .
 I would not purchase this hat again . I bought it as a gift for my husband and could n't even give it to him . It just seemed too cheap to give it as a gift .
 My son received this as a gift for his 4th birthday in the Child size Small which is meant for boys ages 4-6 . He is tall for his age , but this costume is huge on him . It is too long and there is no way to realistically make it smaller for his size . Also the belt falls off of him because it 's so big and there 's no way to make it tighter.He is so disappointed because he wanted to wear it for Halloween this year , but it bunches up at the knees . I 'm disappointed by their sizing standards and wish that I could figure out a creative solution for him .
 I purchased a clone trooper costume for my grandson ... It came as discribed and was in wonderful condition . It was a brand new costume and was the costume he wanted . As for me . . I feel it was very cheaply made and not worth the high price I paid ... but then again . I 'm an old woman and what do I know about costumes ... except that i 've made several of my own for many years and was very dissapointed in the cheap quality of the product . And he will have a terrible time being able to see through the slit they have on the mask of the costume ... Which he 'll probably end up having to take off to see and then he wo n't look like a clone trooper . But a kid in a one piece pajama outfit ... but welcome to 2008 ... As long as he was happy and does n't know the difference ... so be it ...
 We sent this back the day after receiving it . Cheaply made , yes , but we expected that . We were disappointed mainly in the fit , which was not even close . Size runs much smaller than stated . Helmet is poorly done . It is more like a mask which was uncomfortable and did n't fit properly either . My boy could n't see out of it . Amazon was excellent about taking the costume back . You can get this at Target too . Go check it out and see for yourself . This is n't worth half the money they 're charging . Wish we could find good star wars costumes that did n't cost a ton . That would make a lot of little boys happy .
 Too short and too trasparent , does not cause the desired effect , it will be better to invest in a more expansive model .
 HUGE ! Like the other reviewers said , the mask is flat on the inside and pushes on their nose , so my son did n't wear the mask much .
 because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening . Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable .
 Mom had one pair of these identical pajamas that we bought her fifteen years ago . Now that she is 94 and in bed much of the time , we wanted her to have the same comfortable pajamas . We bought her five pair so she would wash them only once a week . Very thin fabric and raveling seams make it hard to believe that these five pair will last ONE year . Save your money ! The brand counts for nothing .
 I purchased this for my middle-aged wife and she very kindly informed me that it just was n't her style ... it is more of a style fit for a grandmother ! She really likes pink ... hot pink ... but this is &#34; pepto-bismol &#34; pink . Oops ... hard to tell online .
 Material is extremely comfortable . Length is not too long for a petite woman . Color is beautiful and flattering . Fits well in all areas . Rubber around waistband should have been covered by material for more comfort .
 top fits fine , but pajama pants are way too skimpy to be size 1X - I am used to Vanity Fair products being well made , would have wanted to know that product was cut on the small side .
 I would say , unless you are long-legged , do n't order medium or small sizes of this pajama ; unless you do n't mind cutting off and re-hemming the pants part . Had the pants not been much too long , I would certainly have kept this Vanity Fair pajama .
 I assumed this pajama would be the same quality as the many I have purchased over the years . However , while the fit is still right , the quality of the fabric is not the same as previously manufactured . For the price , I was disappointed . If I had to pay this price , the quality should have been the same or better than what was available before . I should mention the price was almost double what these pjs cost a few years ago .
 Pj 's are very think and you can see thought them . Have to wear socks and gloves to protect the material for nicks . Will not buy vanity fair again and will return the pair I bought .
 Fabric is cheap flimsy and tacky . I feel embarrasses to wear this . I thought the fabric would have been better .
 The sizing is not even close . ordered as a last minute gift for Christmas , and was unable to to give , as was not even close to a 1x !!
 I chose 2 stars because of the poor quality fabric . Not only was it too sheer , when held to the light the fabric had variations in the quality .
 These pajamas are mich thinner material than I have seen with Vanity Fair before , and the Vanity Fair label was `` yellowed '' as if old , leading me to think maybe they were knock-offs . And worst , no tags attached -- why not?I plan to return them ; would n't dream of giving them as a gift !
 The material was so thin and see-through and snags on everything . It reminds me of cheap Halloween costumes . I 'm very disappointed with them .
 The material is much thinner than I thought it would be . I ordered a pair in rose and black . The rose is see through , but the black is okay . You can tell if you look closely at the images of the lighter colors that you 'll be able to see through them .
 I was very disappointed in these - the black is almost sheer and the fabric is so thin that it 's impossible to get rid of the static cling ! The pictures made it look more satiny , but it 's so thin I would n't even call it that !
 My 80 + mother wanted new pajamas so I told her I would locate and order for her , which I did . She has worn Vanity Fair pajamas just like the ones I ordered so , although I did see some reviews complaining about current quality of the pajamas , I ordered without too much question . She has washed and worn them a few times and they are horrible ! There are so many strings that appear after each washing that she says there may be nothing but strings soon . I would definitely not recommend these pajamas . Not sure what has happened , because Vanity Fair used to offer great quality .
 These pajamas are horrible ! Paper thin with huge gaps between the buttons . I 'm usually happy with my online purchases but not this time ! I 've kept them only because I do n't want to pay shipping to send them back . But do not waste your money on these &#34; tissue paper &#34; like PJ 's !
 In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable , but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear , so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome . It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top , which is why I bought it . If you were a size 34d or above , beware !
 This specific Bra is not true to size , been wearing it for a few years . The band is narrow in comparison the the original and it does not have the white tag as all maiden fom bra 's do .
 I have purchased this brand and model bra many times before from retail stores . I jumped at the chance to get it at a lower price and bought two on -LSB- ... -RSB- . After one wearing each , the tab where the strap hooks onto came apart making both useless . I am very disappointed with the workmanship . I am wondering if they were defects or seconds . I wo n't order this product again .
 Have worn the same size Maidenform bra for years . They discontinue styles constantly , so I have to keep switching . Figured I 'd try this one - but the fit is TOTALLY different . Way , way too snug around the chest , very uncomfortable . Order UP in the `` number '' if you must order ... cup size seemed OK .
 I ordered a 36dd which is my true size , only to be disappointed with a strange fitting bra , that is VERY uncomfortable . The bra appears to have the appropriate cup size , but the fit is bizarre and I am very squished . The underwire leaves huge red marks on my sternum and I feel like it is meant to spread and smash your chest . It definitely didnt do miracles for me !
 Amazon will add additional shipping charges that will not appear during the checkout process ! By the time you find out - it will be too late to cancel your order . Take your business elswhere , unless you like costly surprises .
 I 'm not crazy about the feel of the material . They make my feet sweat .
 While these Jockeys are soft and comfortable , they lack other qualities I think most men want in underwear such as a firm waistband and snug support . To each his own . If you prefer underwear that is just a covering with little support , this may be your new favorite . If you want good , snug , comfortable support , look elsewhere .
 Been wearing Elance biknis for 20 + years . The last I purchased have started to fray at the top , esp at the label . The inside right seam has gotten so large , that they are painful by the end of the day.Cheap is cheap and junk is junk . I have purchased my last pair!Hello , are you listening , Jockey !?
 I am buying same type and size of this underwear for years , this one feels like size smaller , the fabric is nice
 These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini . However , as another reviewer noted , there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin . I 'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size , medium 32-34 . Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam , but I 've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this . Maybe buying the next size up would work , but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home .
 I used to wear Jockey Elance Bikini Briefs exclusively , but in the past year they have changed their design . I am a larger framed man with a 48 inch waist and I have always worn the XL size . They have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them . But the last few times I bought this product , they have a smaller , tighter fit . Very tight in the pouch and between the legs . They also have a lower cut , both in the front and back . I 'm constantly pulling them up in the back . My junk is popping out of the top and the sides ! These might fit a woman comfortably , but not a man . There 's no stretchiness or room in the front for `` the boys . '' This bikini would be better if Jockey offered it in other facrics such as Modal , Tactel or Nylon . I do n't know why Jockey changed their design , but I do n't like it and I will not buy this product again until they change it back . Sometimes change is a bad thing ... and this is a bad thing!May sound odd , but Jockey makes women 's panties that are FAR more comfortable compared to Elance bikinis for men !
 I bought some of these - I find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable . Other than that they are OK , but because of this I mostly wear these inside out .
 I 've used Jockey men 's underwear for many years and I have favored the Elance bikini design as the most comfortable , but the last few times I 've bought them they have had a terrible acrid chemical smell which is very difficult to wash out . I 've now seen other buyers ' complaints about the same problem . I 've twice emailed the Jockey International Corporation in Kenosha , Wisconsin , about the problem , but have received no response .
 Look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs . The Elance is poorly made and designed , Jockey is barely evern trying . Look on the web guys , there are better choices ... . Jockey 's Elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame .
 Worse of what i was expecting , very cheap fabric , i will never buy this men brief -LRB- under wear -RRB- again , i did n't like it
 I ordered this hat for my wife 's birthday , or so I thought . We ended up getting a TOTALLY different hat , in silver colour.When we tried to complain & / or get a refund or new hat we heard the square route of Sweet Fanny Adams . No apology , nothing , na da.I know that the hat was not sold directly from Amazon , but by the hat manufacturer . All I can say is `` DO N'T BUY A HAT FROM THIS COMPANY . '' All that will happen is that you loose your hard earned money . I am giving it zero stars , for obvious reasons.J . Brooke

 Very bad , there is no trademark , no name , no site , do not know where the production , rough work , very much regret buying this thread . Concurrent post is fraud .
 I 've reviewed many money clip style wallets and decided to order this one . After receiving it I 'm not sure if I 'm going to throw it away -LRB- since packaging , driving to the UPS store , and processing is way more than the $ 20 it cost -RRB- or throw it in a drawer forever.It 's really no thinner than my old wallet ... seriously . I emptied my wallet and set it next to the Dopp and the Dopp was no smaller . With the leather wrapped money clip and magnets + the wallet portion , it was actually a bit thicker than my old thin wallet.So I 'm giving it a 2 star rating because I wanted something minimalist , but it did n't deliver . It 's possible my expectations were not in line but you should be the judge . It 's NOT smaller or thinner than a thin wallet ... just be warned.BTW ... the money clip did n't hold 18 bills . Now ... it 's not common that I have that many bills but sometimes you just have a wad of $ 1 's that take up space , but what 's the point of a money clip if you have to keep some bills elsewhere until you spend them to get to a more manageable quantity . I wound up rubber banding the money clip together for the time being ... what 's the point . Now I just use a rubber band for my bills and cards ... ca n't get any thinner than that .
 Very low quality . Stitching was loose , leather was thin . Does n't feel like it would hold up longer than a month .
 OK , first it took forever to arrive . . Then the magnetic clip was so weak that it could barely hold 1 note ... I have returned this product and requested an exchange . . I 'm still waiting for it ...
 Good luck holding more than one hundred dollars . why do I have to write more than this . bad product . bad
 Cheap piece of crap !!! Think it was made of vinyl . Do n't buy this product . Not worth twenty bucks . two more words required ? Its garbage . Wish I could give it negative stars .
 It does not hold many bills in the magnetic clip , which is a bummer . Otherwise , it is a well made little wallet and attractive .
 Unfortunately this product was very cheap and lacking good quality . It was very thin and am sure it would have fallen apart very soon . I was disappointed .
 It arrived with a loose thread hanging out that I had to cut off . I do n't have much faith in the stitching holding out for very long , although I 'm capable of restitching it myself-but I should n't have to . My main beef is the price , something like 15-20 $ . This is a cheap piece of junk that should cost $ 5 . At $ 5 , I could live with them lasting 2 months and I would buy a couple of them as replacements . There are n't many low profile wallets like this listed and the magnet is sturdy enough to keep the bills in place . My main issue is really the durability , which does n't seem to be there , although I 've only had it a couple of days .
 The wallet is not as good as it looks and is made of a cheaper material . Not worth the money asked for it .
 I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific Vacation Cruise . It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed
 I was hoping to buy this wallet based on the good reviews from Amazon , as I usually do . Unfortunately , I 'm going to have to take this one back . I do n't know if it 's because I come from brands like Tumi and Bosca that make me feel like this wallet is very cheaply made . I was hoping to get a cheaper replacement for the Bosca front pocket wallet I lost and decided to try out this Dopp one.Right away I noticed that it is slightly bigger , slightly thicker , and slightly duller in appearance . The magnet was noticeably not as strong as Bosca 's . Still , I was willing to give it a test run with 3 cards in it . As soon as I started fiddling around with it , I started hearing some paper ruffling . I thought maybe I left some of those sample cards that come in the pockets . Double checked and it was empty . It turns out that the inner pockets have some sort of paper lining instead of being leather all the way through . Very cheap ! Every time the wallet bends or you try to put a card in/out , you will hear this nasty wrinkling sound of paper . It just feels so cheap . Definitely do not recommend if you like quality .
 I bought 4 of these dopp regatta 's from 2 seller Tapp Collection Inc and Direct Premium Buys LLC.Turns out the black one was a fake , and the 2 mahogabny ones i bought from Direct Premium came in actual proper boxes.I do n't think i can return the products anyways and i bought these 2 gift my relatives.Its surprising to see how Amazon allows these sellers to advertise them as genuine Dopp products and then sell fakes.I was really upset , the mahogany and black are made of totally different types of leather.And the black one from Tapp Collection feels cheap.However , the brown -LRB- mahogany -RRB- ones from Direct Premium came in a nice Dopp box and the quality of the leather is also different and not cheap like the black one from Tapp Collections.So buyers better be careful when buying this product off Tapp Collection
 will erase cards held in the middle pocket . It erased 2 of my gift cards that ca n't be used . I ended up cutting out the magnets
 Magnetic clip simply does not hold bills as is intended . It is too weak and ... wallet should be redesigned . The leather is very nice , size is great . But BOTTOM LINE
 So sad ... I was hoping that this would be the perfect stocking stuffer for my brother , but the quality was very poor . Went to Macy 's and found a much nicer one for almost the same price .
 This was suppose to be a gift and was not able to give it because tree was a tear in it . Stitching loose . Very disappointed .
 This was not as it was pictured . It is cheaply made , stiff and not functional . This was a gift and I was embarrassed to give it .
 The design is cool and it looks great . Very neat but it does not hold many bills is place . Hold a bill or two perfectly if fold one time . If you carry 5 or bills its a waste of time . The magnet does not hold and your money might fall out if you do n't hold it is place when you pull out your wallet
 Not the best quality ... after I washed it -LRB- on the gentle cycle -RRB- , the little legs on the side got messed up , the wires moved , and the one antenna on the hat was hanging on by a thread - it would n't stand up like it was supposed to . I got my son 's pictures done in it , and could n't pick certain ones because the costume looked funny . Plus , the hat was a little too big for his head -LRB- he does not have a small head -RRB- Do n't waste your money .
 it 's very poorly made . zipper did n't work when it arrived , and when I tried to pull it , thread was torn apart and beads fell ... cheap stuff , should n't have ordered it .
 Ordered three bras . Two from Amazon , and one from one of their vendors . I received my bras from Amazon a week and a half ago , and worn them both . I still have not received this bra . It has been more than three weeks now since I placed the order . Too bad cause its so pretty !
 We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length -LRB- the 36 was more like a 34 or 32 -RRB- , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it `` mostly '' fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way .
 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .
 The product would have been great , but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes . I requested XL Long pants . They sent size 3X pants . So they are completely unusable , and do not respond to my emails . I would never order from them again .
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .
 Actually I do n't despise tartan - I just despise these boxers . I 'm very active - I bike , workout , study martial arts - but these boxers are woven so they do n't stretch along their inseam , and I find them to be uncomfortable and kind of stiff.Hanes makes an excellent KNIT cotton boxer which is very comfortable . I encourage you to try that one out .
 I bought this for my size 0 daughter for halloween . These were adult size items that cut her wrists they were so tight . The lace was low quality and itchy .
 Size is great , but the money clip is flimsy . Do n't trust it to be secure enough to hold bills .
 The reason I made this purchase was that my friend has a coat with similar design . However the quality of this one is much worse that my friend 's . Not recommend it .
 There are n't many simple laundry bags out there that have a shoulder strap . My old one finally bit the dust and I have no idea where it came from so I got this one . It 's pretty lame . Yes , the fabric is good and sturdy but I have to agree with the other review , the strap is too long . Not just a little too long , I 'm talking 2-3 feet too long and it 's not adjustable . It totally defeats the purpose of having a laundry bag with a shoulder strap . Yes , grommets would be good and how about a plastic stopper so that the cinch remains cinched on the way to the laundromat ? I 'm changing this from a 2 star to a 1 star , it 's a useless bag and it was a waste of money even at $ 6 .
 The hat is exactly what I wanted ... almost . The flag that is embroidered on the back is messed up . It has gray where there should be white and the blue is not where it should be either . Most people wo n't notice . That 's why it 's so cheap though .
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .

 Do not recommend this product . Material very rough and smells like petroleum.Buttons fell off with first wearing . Material pills and gets very linty . Very dissapointed with quality .
 The website states that this jacket has an interior pocket but it does not . This feature is was very important to my son and he is quite dissapointed . You can buy this same jacket for much less if you shop around . The only reason that I spent the extra money was because of my son 's desire for the interior pocket . This is classic bait and switch , you will not receive the product advertised .
 Within a week of receiveing the coat , 2 buttons had fallen off . After 2 weeks 4 had fallen off and another 2 were loose . The fabric also began to pill . I would n't recommend this coat .
 I usually like Rothco items , but I have to give my first ever 1 star rating to an item due to the poor quality . EVERY button has fallen off this coat so far after about 4 times being worn . I am not exaggerating when I say every single button has come off . The material also has a shedding quality that shows how poor the fabric is . My son loves the look and actually treats his stuff very well so we have been surprised by the issues . I would advise you to stay away or at the very least strengthen the thread for the buttons when you receive it .
 This coat looks great in the photo ; however , it fits huge on my son . It also balls up as others have described . I sent this back and received a credit .
 The colors are great and it held up well in the was but I ordered 27x27 and got something smaller . No time to contact seller due to travel schedule .
 received the wallet quickly , and it looked very nice . The problem was the clip fell off after about 4 days of use
 Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money , without requriing that I ship the product back . For that I am thankful and appreciative , and can recommend the seller . I have no idea what was up with the product.As I noted earlier , I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum , literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home . I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them . I am contacting the seller to request a refund . If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating .
 Cheaply made ... . Of course , I knew that when I bought it due to the price . I ended up hanging it on a wall because I knew the strap would break if I tried to use it as a purse .
 Very comfortable . Not a good value . Begins to shred , and seams separate after about10 to 15 wash cyles . In the future will stick to cotton .
 The boxers are comfortable but lack the standard button in front to keep everything secure while you 're wearing them . The open gape is fine for sleeping , but you probably woul n't want to wear them out .
 Very unhappy with the fact that this is a headband rather than traditional mask as advertised . It is of decent quality but it is more masculine than feminine and looks quite devilish in person .
 the mold of the Jason head looks great , the rest is garbage . the covering mask is cheap super thin plastic that does n't even fit to the mask underneath it . the hair is stuck on the head with ugly looking blobs from a glue gun . I ended up just using the head as a decoration instead of a costume part . Over all this is just poorly made junk .
 very poor ratin for this item it was huge n couldnt possibly fit on anyones head i know ? ... but it was cool lookin just not for average human heads : -LRB-
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .

 My son changed mind about this costume , wound up returning it . The mask was VERY tight and uncomfortable ... but you get what you pay for , right ?
 My son loved the costume but the mask was way too tight on his eyes .
 I had to send this item back because it was to small . The sizes run small , so beware .
 I 'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased -- I will admit that I have n't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time -- I had no idea how low the quality has gotten . First , the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily , 2 . The canvas material is not what it used to be either , my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same . 3 . The sizes are so different , I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear , but when they were delivered and I tried them on , it was as if they were two sizes smaller . The material is thin , and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be . I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product , to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases . The quality is very low , but the prices are way too high for the quality .
 well as soon as i got it i noticed that one of the drink holders was already broken . also the drink holders do n't rest on the hat , they rest on your ears . it 's like the drink holders were put on there upside down .
 I got this Beer hardhat thingy and was absolutely excited as I opened the package and anticipated my wearing of the item to the Metallica concert . Well , as I put in a couple of PBR 12 ozers I figured I would head over to the mosh pit and hang out to watch the mayhem as they played `` Master of Puppets '' . I was then beat up with a black jack and someones boot . They even took the liberty to beat me down with my own hat with beer and all . They kicked me as I was laying on the ground ... I will NEVER wear this product to Metallica concert again .

 The pants are probably pretty nice but the seller STINKS ! Very `` loose '' about shipping and communication . CAVEAT EMPTOR !
 I bought this specifically for the gym . It really looked good and felt good at first but only to shrink about 4 inches after the first wash . Now I am no longer able to wear it . as it is just too short . I was expecting a quality product but I guess I was wrong .
 I do n't know why these pants are so expensive , cheap material , they will shrink cold cycle or not , not impressed at all
 I bought it but i sent it back because the package came with just 2 shield , the frame and another shield was missing , I got my money back later on

 Its just a packet of three undies , but it was packed in a ridiculously huge box and with `` balloon protector '' . Because of that , I was made to pay a huge sum for shipping from US to my home country ! Please use common sense , it is NOT a fragile item , just a normal plastic envelope will do !

 These shorts were bought because they advertised a 5 '' inseam . The inseam is 6.25 '' , a 25 % longer inseam . I have always had good dealings with Amazon but these shorts are misadvertised .

 I was very disappointed when I opened the box . They are VERY stiff and are not adjustable whatsoever . I bought these to use a studio prop and havent had a chance to try them out yet , but I have a feeling they will not photograph as realistic-looking . I have a 22 month old and the straps are WAY too big for her , so if you are thinking of using these for a Halloween costume , you should probably take that into consideration . The wings i received were missing a lot of the little feathers on top , thus showing the cardboard .
 Wings look a lot more realistic and beautiful in the pictures . Maybe my expectations were much higher . Was a bit disappointed when I opened the box . It seems so flat and did not look as pictured . For the price I guess its pretty decent . Depends on what you 're looking for . For photo opts - its a great addition -LRB- will look good in pictures -RRB- .
 this wings have the perfect size for my 8 month old baby , but the material is so so so rigid , but perfectly done ... love the finished
 I ordered these for my two year old son to wear on a parade float with the theme of `` Little Angels . '' The wings are rigid construction and they fit him well , unfortunately they arrived with about one third of the feathers badly frayed . A couple of feathers are missing the tips as if they have been chewed on . I am very disappointed with the quality of the feathers .
 I 'm not happy at all with these wings . They are not the same shape or proportion as in the advertised picture . They look like a rectangular piece of cardboard covered with feathers instead of the pretty , curved wings in the picture . Three feathers had already fallen off inside the box it was shipped to me in . They are also not 15 inches across , they are only 13.5 inches across . I am very disappointed .
 part of a halloween costume for a 4-year old . The feathers starting coming off/not laying flat early on in the day . Never used .
 I had these wings out of the package for about 10 seconds before they started falling apart . Talk about cheaply made ! Awful product worth about 1 $ . Do n't bother with these .
 The feathers that protrude are about half the length of the displayed picture . My wing came with a missing edge feather and cardboard showing at the lower left tip which made it look pathetic .
 These wings DO NOT look like the picture . They are simply cardboard arches with feathers stuck on , they are not shaped like the picture but rather straight up/down from top to bottom not flared as shown . They have to elastic loops in the center for the kids to put their arms through and they continuously slide down their arms . My 3 yr old hated these and took them off half way through trick or treating . For the price I thought they would be a little better construction .

 Bought this for my husband 's birthday . I was appalled to find out , by reading the warning label , that it contains lead and can cause cancer , birth defects and reproductive problems . It also says to wash your hands after handling . I returned it but had to pay the return fee myself . Not feeling too warm and fuzzy about this purchase !

 In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable , but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear , so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome . It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top , which is why I bought it . If you were a size 34d or above , beware !
 This specific Bra is not true to size , been wearing it for a few years . The band is narrow in comparison the the original and it does not have the white tag as all maiden fom bra 's do .
 I have purchased this brand and model bra many times before from retail stores . I jumped at the chance to get it at a lower price and bought two on -LSB- ... -RSB- . After one wearing each , the tab where the strap hooks onto came apart making both useless . I am very disappointed with the workmanship . I am wondering if they were defects or seconds . I wo n't order this product again .
 Have worn the same size Maidenform bra for years . They discontinue styles constantly , so I have to keep switching . Figured I 'd try this one - but the fit is TOTALLY different . Way , way too snug around the chest , very uncomfortable . Order UP in the `` number '' if you must order ... cup size seemed OK .
 I ordered a 36dd which is my true size , only to be disappointed with a strange fitting bra , that is VERY uncomfortable . The bra appears to have the appropriate cup size , but the fit is bizarre and I am very squished . The underwire leaves huge red marks on my sternum and I feel like it is meant to spread and smash your chest . It definitely didnt do miracles for me !

 -LRB- ... -RRB- This is the worst toy I 've ever had ! It does n't have a full color in the light ; the light does n't glow strongly all the way to the end of the saber . I wasted my money and I was sad and disappointed . The blades do n't go all the way in the handle either . The company should make this better . -LRB- ... -RRB-
 Toy makers are becoming increasingly lazy ... and everyone loves it . No longer will toy makers assemble toys before they give them to you . . but they expect you to assemble them . . and expect you to have fun doing it . If you want something customizable i guess this will work . But if you want to hit things , people , objects with it , just buy a $ 13 one from your local wal-mart . peace out
 this is the worst toy I have ever gotten . I hate it !! It breaks in two seconds and you lose all of the parts .
 This `` build your own lighsaber kit '' may seem like a pretty nifty idea but hasbro did not pull it off very well . This product is a piece of junk . First of all , I thought I overpayed for this heap of garbage . Too much $ 's for something that is not worth it . Secondly when I brought it home and began to assemble it I realized that it was a time consuming , and worthless effort . It is a much better idea to buy a premade Yoda , Darth Vader , Count Dooku , Luke , Anakin , Mace Windu , or Obi Wan Kenobi lighsaber off Wal-Mart . com , Hasbro.com , or Toys R Us.com . Not only are the pre made ones pre made , they are much more sturdy and will last longer . I was satisfied when I was done building it all though I noticed the filters where poor . Red - Okay , Green - Bad , Blue - Terrible and Weak . With my satisfaction I went to show my friends and challenge them to a lightsaber duel with there pre-made lightsabers . It worked , all though I did sense some weakness of the blade . It seemed to wobble occasionally . I liked to change my lightsaber since it was customizable , but it was hard and took long while my friends where already having fun . Soon out of switching all the parts allot they got worn out . And later , a couple of weeks or so my parts began breaking . It may be good if you want to try to create a discontinued lightsaber , but overall just get a premade one .
 These are the cheapest thigh highs I 've ever purchased . They got snagged as I was simply and gently removing them from their package . The material is not soft ... it 's actually a bit itchy . Would not purchase these again . The rhinestones are sparse and would more than likely fall off if I were to hand wash them . Bottom line
 These were HUGE on me . To the point where they 'd fall down , besides that the legs are really flared out at the bottom .

 This cowboy hat came super fast , and the price was great . I loved the idea of the tea staining . However , when I pulled it out of the box , it was SPRAY PAINTED brown . The description and title of this item are false.The hat is a cute little style , but the spray paint is a joke.The seller , Andrew Christian , responded quickly to my email and offered a full refund and return shipping . This is a good company to deal with , but this hat is not what Peter Grimm claims !
 I was very disappointed with the quality - the sweater was very thin , poorly constructed . I would not purchase again .
 This bra was great looking and fit nicely when it was new . But I washed it in the washing machine on delicate to get the sizing out -LRB- like I do with all my bras -RRB- and then do n't put it in the dryer just let it air dry . For some reason , the foam padding transforms upon washing and the cup of the bra looks like a it is crazed or cracked all over the place . If you are wearing a thick shirt , it wo n't shoe through , but I 've never had this happen before . If you have to hand wash to prevent it , -LRB- because it gets ruined with machine washing -RRB- , then it should stress that in a big bold warning . I was disappointed too , since I liked the fit and look of the new , unwashed bra .
 These are way undersized - not even close . And , they do n't look that good . If you want a nice looking cashmere sweater , you 'll have to pay more
 Please order a size larger than you usually wear . Even the XL was too small , so I had to return it . As it happens the green I ordered was not a teal , as it had appeared on my screen , but more of a leaf green .
 I 'd read the reviews on the site , so I knew to order a larger size . But my husband 's gift sweater arrived with a small hole in the middle of the back . I do n't have the wrapping materials now , so I guess I 'm stuck -- but this serves as a useful reminder that you get what you pay for , and if a deal seems too good to be true , it probably is .
 because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening . Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable .
 I have several different `` weight '' of the `` Darn Tough '' brand socks , and NONE of them are as fragile and thin as these smart wool socks . They do not cling onto you very snug , yet the foot size seems a bit small . The product is very thin and I had wool felt coming off on the heel after walking about half a mile in some good broken in boots . These are a loose , sloppy sock . I will be sticking with Darn Tough socks , they are WAY worth the 2 extra dollars per pair .
 Rib Caps are fine as long as they stay on the head . The problem occurred when the conditions were heavy snow and the Ribcap became very wet . I crashed twice and the Ribcap fell off both times . Not only did the Ribcap not protect at all as it flew off , I then had to retrieve the Ribcap from down the slope.Some Ribcaps have ties to secure them but I feel that the non secured Caps are very dangerous as they expand when wet and give a false illusion of protection.I believe that these products should be withdrawn immediately before someone seriously hurts themselves .
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .
 I purchased this umbrella , and on the first use it completely feel apart . I walk to work in downtown Chicago , and have used cheap drugstore umbrellas for years . I upgraded to this product hoping for something that was sturdier and had a larger canopy . This umbrella fell apart in a light wind during a light rain . I will never purchase a ShedRain product again . I firmly suggest that no one purchase this product , you will be very disappointed and very wet !
 We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length -LRB- the 36 was more like a 34 or 32 -RRB- , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it `` mostly '' fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way .
 Ordered three bras . Two from Amazon , and one from one of their vendors . I received my bras from Amazon a week and a half ago , and worn them both . I still have not received this bra . It has been more than three weeks now since I placed the order . Too bad cause its so pretty !
 because of the thick straps they have very limited tightening . Because of this the straps are too loose and it was uncomfortable .

 These shirts do look great , but the material is incredibly delicate and prone to damage . It will snag on anything , from a callous on your finger , Velcro , a small chip on the edge of a wooden table . Once it snags , it will all too often pull , ruining the shirt instantly . I just to two throw away because I was playing catch with my daughter , and the Velcro covered baseball we were playing with stuck to the shirt . When I removed it , it pulled a string straight out leaving an actual gap in the fabric where the skin showed through . I had only worn the shirts 2-3 times each . Very frustrating , as the shirts have an excellent look , fit , and feel . But the material is not friendly to daily wear . If you plan on using this for even light work or play , stay away .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .

 While the shirt looks fantastic , it is way undersized . I ordered a 2XL and the product I received was a M at best .
 This shirt does not feel silky . I was expecting a cool , smooth feeling shirt against my skin . This is not what I received . This will be my first return ever . Do not buy unless you like scratchy shirts ! Also , I have a pot belly and the XXL wo n't fit .
 Product was fine , however , problem with the sizing itself . This product was undersized -LRB- i.e. , and did not fit well -RRB- for how it was promoted by the saler . If you purchase this item , recommend that you buy at least one or two sizes larger .

 This specific Bra is not true to size , been wearing it for a few years . The band is narrow in comparison the the original and it does not have the white tag as all maiden fom bra 's do .
 I have purchased this brand and model bra many times before from retail stores . I jumped at the chance to get it at a lower price and bought two on -LSB- ... -RSB- . After one wearing each , the tab where the strap hooks onto came apart making both useless . I am very disappointed with the workmanship . I am wondering if they were defects or seconds . I wo n't order this product again .
 Have worn the same size Maidenform bra for years . They discontinue styles constantly , so I have to keep switching . Figured I 'd try this one - but the fit is TOTALLY different . Way , way too snug around the chest , very uncomfortable . Order UP in the `` number '' if you must order ... cup size seemed OK .
 I ordered a 36dd which is my true size , only to be disappointed with a strange fitting bra , that is VERY uncomfortable . The bra appears to have the appropriate cup size , but the fit is bizarre and I am very squished . The underwire leaves huge red marks on my sternum and I feel like it is meant to spread and smash your chest . It definitely didnt do miracles for me !

 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 I want blue Levis with no fake creasing and wear . It is SO cheesy and sloppy - my kid will break them in just fine on his own .
 Purchased this for my son . Too stiff of a denim even after washing . May return ... not happy with this pair of jeans .

 This is a cute outfit . It is like all of the other halloween costumes out there in that it is not the best construction of all time , but fine for a day . I ordered it big . If one was a true 12/14 it would be on the small size and likely very short .

 I recieved ths item in a timely manner , however it could not be worn because the belt loop and the tin on the bace was backwards . if i wore it the the way it was made the flag and name of Guyana would be upside bown . when i sent an e-mail to the company there was no responce from them . i called and lefa a message and still no resposefrom them .

 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .

 The shoulders were very wide and the length was a little on the short side . We were not happy with the overall fit of this vest .
 The front belt loops are too far apart which makes the front hem droop over . I ca n't wear tuck in shirts with these pants . JC Penny pants fit better .
 Too small ! same size as Dockers 44 inch . . Will donate not worth returning ! !!!!!!!!!!!!! \ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return . . do n't knowDon
 It was a good fit for the size but too short a rise . It looked good but was n't comfortable . Had to return it .

The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .

 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette .

The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart .

 I bought this shirt because my family wanted to wear black shirts for our family portrait . Black shirts for babies are super hard to find . The shirt looked like it would work for a boy or a girl based on the picture . When the shirt arrived it had some gathering on the neckline . I felt this made it look girly . I did n't have time to order another shirt and I figured I would just make the best of it since he would only need to wear it this one time . The shirt was super short on him . He is an average size in both height and weight and is still wearing a size smaller than I ordered . I just think this shirt is made poorly .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .

 Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful . However , the quality of the material leaves much to be desired , making it appear cheap . Regretfully , I can not recommend .
 The slacks I viewed online were not the described product . The material was so thin , you could virtually see through the dark blue material . I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price . This resulted in approximately $ 5 to ship each pair and then $ 6 to return each pair . Total of $ 22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks .
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall 's in Florida . However , when the mailman took it from my mailbox -LRB- I am 83 and no car -RRB- he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . There was $ l. 71 due . So , I put -LRB- 5 -RRB- 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . However , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it . I called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed I was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . He was n't a happy camper , but I did send it back , and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... they were okay , but by that time , I had changed my mind about them , too.Also , I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.Jeanne Allen

 Wigwam used to make great socks that fit properly and were true to the size on the package labeling . Even though my husband is a size 10-1/2 , the 9-11 size is way too large for him . The heel area goes all the way up to his calves . The socks bunch up in his shoes and start turning on themselves . Also , the inside stitching has more than 4 inches of loose , untrimmed thread just sticking out . Wherever these socks were manufactured they obviously do n't believe in quality control or workmanship . Another company goes down with the times !
 First time putting the socks on they were loose and after a couple hours wear they were falling down . Comfortable but the elastic is weak and I 'm not convienced about its odor resistant feature . Walmart socks have worked out better , not as much cushion but at least they stay high on the leg like they are supposed to .
 I ordered 2 packs of these socks because of the high rating , but on this one , most of the reviewers got it wrong . These are the worst socks I 've ever owned . They are way too big for a size 9.5 and retain all the sweat . They were incredibly uncomfortable all day at work . I thought things may change after a washing , but still , amazingly uncomfortable . I am going back to Hanes as quickly as possible .
 I was specifically looking for XL socks for work.OK , so I have big feet , shoot me.These are the tightest socks I have ever had . And I do n't mean `` tight '' as good or cool either.Give me a break ! My feet were so sore at the end of the day from these boaconstricters.Double checked the package , and says they are XL . Washed them with plenty of fabric softener thinking that might loosen them up a bit . Still too tight.It is a real shame too as I read on the packaging they are made right here in the USA ; Sheboygan , WI.Guess what , went to Wal-Mart and picked up some XL socks that actually fit , and sadly , these were made in Pakistan .
 I purchased a couple of these socks based on the reviews everyone has written . These socks are not worth the money or the reviews given to them . After wearing one pair of socks , they already have a hole in the heel and they have n't even been washed yet !! They were falling apart after wearing them once and they make your feet sweat . I 'm not sure what kind of socks everyone else was given , but mine were not the quality everyone else was raving about .
 The large says 9 - 12 . Amazon send me 12 - 15 . This socks are for giants . I hope Amazon will fix this problem .
 The fabric feel is rough , when I walk I can feel air going through them and to my feet , and I 'm a size 13 & the x-large size is a tad too big .
 Not impressed with these socks . $ 10.01 for 3 pairs -LRB- including Prime shipping -RRB- is n't bad , but pilling after only 1 wash?I have bought ` work ' socks from my local dollar store @ $ 4.00 / pair that are still holding up after 2 years . Maybe I should have spent a few dollars more and purchased the higher end Wigwams .
 These sox appear OK . But I never had a pair that shed so badly . The fuzz is on the carpet , bathroom floor , in the shower etc. . I went to the foot doctor and was embarrased with black fuzzy feet . It seams to bother my wife and that gets me into trouble . I will stick with a better grade nextime .
 These Wigwam `` at work '' socks sounded like exactly what I wanted , after reading all the amazon reviews . They 're supposed to be soft -LRB- they are NOT soft - they feel like the fuzzy side of Velcro inside -RRB- they 're supposed to be warm -LRB- they 're not - they make my feet sweat instantly , and then they get clammy , even in boots ! -RRB- . They are fairly evenly cushioned -LRB- not very thick , but not a dress sock thin -RRB- . I would n't want to walk more than a few blocks in these socks , unless I were also wearing very comfortable sneakers . They feel like I 'm wearing plastic bags on my feet - instantly soggy , synthetic feeling , socks . Gross . Would never buy these again , unfortunately .
 I wore these socks ONCE and they developed a hole in the toe . I bought a few pairs , it happened with every pair . I DO cut my toenails . I DO wear good shoes -LRB- Nike , Reebok -RRB- , and I also bought two other brands of socks at the same time as these . ALL the other socks are still great after many wearing and washings . I am not exagerating when I tell you that ALL the pairs of these socks are in the garbage . They look sturdy , feel great ! One would NEVER imagine that each and every pair fell apart in ONE or two days in use.I have no idea how others gave these socks a good rating .
 I did not like to product . This product does not give the breasts a natural smooth shape . I felt like I was wearing my grandmother 's bra .
 I purchased these thinking I 'd get what was in the picture . Navy is actually Royal and what they sent me . The color shown is more like cyan . There is no sizing chart , and it 's impossible to get the right size without it . XL does not fit size 40 . So I 'm out the shipping both ways . I might as well donate it to goodwill ! So I feel like a dog took a doo doo on me . I really despise companies that do n't put up sizing charts . Also , this is America and large Chinese is not large USA .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .

 I returned it . It was sleepwear and not a camp shirt . Should have been listed as sleepwear .
 Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful . However , the quality of the material leaves much to be desired , making it appear cheap . Regretfully , I can not recommend .
 The slacks I viewed online were not the described product . The material was so thin , you could virtually see through the dark blue material . I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price . This resulted in approximately $ 5 to ship each pair and then $ 6 to return each pair . Total of $ 22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks .
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall 's in Florida . However , when the mailman took it from my mailbox -LRB- I am 83 and no car -RRB- he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . There was $ l. 71 due . So , I put -LRB- 5 -RRB- 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . However , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it . I called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed I was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . He was n't a happy camper , but I did send it back , and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... they were okay , but by that time , I had changed my mind about them , too.Also , I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.Jeanne Allen
 I never wear this top after having purchased it . The stripes have awkward stitches that irritate the skin touching them . The shirt itself hangs very awkwardly . I prefer fitted shirts for working out and this one kind of flares out at the waist on me and , therefore , is n't very flattering . I think I 've worn it once and will probably donate it soon . Generally , I have been pleased with Adidas products , but this shirt did not work for me personally .

 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful . However , the quality of the material leaves much to be desired , making it appear cheap . Regretfully , I can not recommend .
 The slacks I viewed online were not the described product . The material was so thin , you could virtually see through the dark blue material . I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price . This resulted in approximately $ 5 to ship each pair and then $ 6 to return each pair . Total of $ 22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks .
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall 's in Florida . However , when the mailman took it from my mailbox -LRB- I am 83 and no car -RRB- he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it . There was $ l. 71 due . So , I put -LRB- 5 -RRB- 39 cent stamps on it , which would have been $ 1.95 . However , the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I had put on it . I called the post office , and fortunately , the postmistress believed I was being honest , and told me to send it back with the mailman . He was n't a happy camper , but I did send it back , and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me . I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange . Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips ... they were okay , but by that time , I had changed my mind about them , too.Also , I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it.Jeanne Allen

 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 when read the details , it only says that the colar is the same as the shirt , not like picture.the whole shirt is not like picture , very Huuuuuge as mentioned by Edward F. , it has puffsdo not recommend to buy this shirt online , in store you can try and check what suits.online is a fraud -LRB- they send you by mail something different that they mention here -RRB-
 First of all , this is not large , it 's HUUUUGE.Second of all , the t shirt has tiny cottonpuffs all over it .
 The shirt is pretty big for a LRG . It 's almost like a dress on me . I hope it shrinks in the wash .
 Black Skull & Wing , is way too big ! Even the size small is ridiculously large . I mean , Im 207 pounds at 5 ' 8 . I have 17 inch arms ! Im a big guy , and this thing looked like a plastic garbage bag over me - its ridiculous . This size small would easily be a XXL in the malls . Enough fabric to make a blanket out of . Not cool

 The shoulders were very wide and the length was a little on the short side . We were not happy with the overall fit of this vest .
 They are actually very large i believed that they would be for small children and they really swallowed my baby girl whole
 The jacket is warm , really smart looking , and sporty . My problem is that the yellow dye got all over what was being washed . Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting . Upon rewashing -LRB- minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket -RRB- the yellow dye came out . Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy . In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected , especially , with a product such as this . As a precaution , wash by hand separately and let it hang dry , you still have to be careful with the &#34; drip dry &#34; in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip . Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time . One as a gift , and the other for me . Learning ing how these jackets &#34; wash &#34; was a disappointment , however , wearing this jacket does feel exactly as described .
 Maidenform 's bra was labeled the correct size , but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length , and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .
 i was dissapointed with this bra , it was 1 of 2 that i ordered the other bra -LRB- wacoal -RRB- fits extremely well , however this one is not comfortable to wear because the underwire comes up too high under the armpit and tends to dig in , most uncomfortable . the top of the cup also cuts into cleavage slightly .
 I owned other bras with this style number , and assumed this one would be the same . But somehow the cups are cut lower . Otherwise it 's fine . Also the picture does n't show the leopard print .
 I had purchased a bra of this same exact model and size in the store , yet the one I ordered online did n't fit me well . Also , withina month , the wire circles that attach the straps to the bra became crooked .
 This is definetely not for the medium to big chested . Very uncomfortable , almost no support .
 i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size . when it got here i was about two sizes two big . just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast .
 I have purchased Maidenform Bras for years and lately it seems that the underwire breaks within a few months of purchase . Total waste of money , in my opinion

 This product fit more like an XL than a 3X . It was a total waste of money and to send it back would be a waste of even more MONEY , so I just gave it away !

Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 The jacket is warm , really smart looking , and sporty . My problem is that the yellow dye got all over what was being washed . Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting . Upon rewashing -LRB- minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket -RRB- the yellow dye came out . Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy . In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected , especially , with a product such as this . As a precaution , wash by hand separately and let it hang dry , you still have to be careful with the &#34; drip dry &#34; in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip . Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time . One as a gift , and the other for me . Learning ing how these jackets &#34; wash &#34; was a disappointment , however , wearing this jacket does feel exactly as described .
 Does not iron well at all . Will try the cleaners to see how it will look after that i may have to get another one in a different material

 I purchased these thinking I 'd get what was in the picture . Navy is actually Royal and what they sent me . The color shown is more like cyan . There is no sizing chart , and it 's impossible to get the right size without it . XL does not fit size 40 . So I 'm out the shipping both ways . I might as well donate it to goodwill ! So I feel like a dog took a doo doo on me . I really despise companies that do n't put up sizing charts . Also , this is America and large Chinese is not large USA .

 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not .

 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 Maidenform 's bra was labeled the correct size , but when my wife compared them to another bra that they sent her you could see that it was an inch and a half shorter in length , and the cup size was smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support .
 i was dissapointed with this bra , it was 1 of 2 that i ordered the other bra -LRB- wacoal -RRB- fits extremely well , however this one is not comfortable to wear because the underwire comes up too high under the armpit and tends to dig in , most uncomfortable . the top of the cup also cuts into cleavage slightly .
 I owned other bras with this style number , and assumed this one would be the same . But somehow the cups are cut lower . Otherwise it 's fine . Also the picture does n't show the leopard print .
 I had purchased a bra of this same exact model and size in the store , yet the one I ordered online did n't fit me well . Also , withina month , the wire circles that attach the straps to the bra became crooked .
 This is definetely not for the medium to big chested . Very uncomfortable , almost no support .
 i have always had a problem getting a 32 c . i was so happy to find them in my size . when it got here i was about two sizes two big . just one more reason companys should use the same size scale.i was happy that it was so easy to return andthen the credited my account pretty fast .
 I have purchased Maidenform Bras for years and lately it seems that the underwire breaks within a few months of purchase . Total waste of money , in my opinion
 Does not iron well at all . Will try the cleaners to see how it will look after that i may have to get another one in a different material
 This bra was great looking and fit nicely when it was new . But I washed it in the washing machine on delicate to get the sizing out -LRB- like I do with all my bras -RRB- and then do n't put it in the dryer just let it air dry . For some reason , the foam padding transforms upon washing and the cup of the bra looks like a it is crazed or cracked all over the place . If you are wearing a thick shirt , it wo n't shoe through , but I 've never had this happen before . If you have to hand wash to prevent it , -LRB- because it gets ruined with machine washing -RRB- , then it should stress that in a big bold warning . I was disappointed too , since I liked the fit and look of the new , unwashed bra .

 The cap is of good quality , but the seller is terrible . The item arrived 3 weeks after I ordered it ... 10 days later than when I needed it . I tried to contact the seller several times by e-mail and by phone , but never received an answer .
 Bought this for my husband 's birthday . I was appalled to find out , by reading the warning label , that it contains lead and can cause cancer , birth defects and reproductive problems . It also says to wash your hands after handling . I returned it but had to pay the return fee myself . Not feeling too warm and fuzzy about this purchase !
 I should know you get what you pay for . But these guns are so cheap ! The holster was cracked in the package and I did n't sent it back because it was too close to Christmas . One gun broke quickly out of the package , the trigger stopped clicking . The other gun lasted a little longer then the barrel snapped off .

 I read the reviews before buying and a lot of what they said it correct , but I have to question the size . As soon as I opened the box it came in , it looked VERY big . I checked the dimensions and it is too large to have as a carry on with any airline . This is what I wanted it for . It is even larger than the dimensions listed in the product description . It is well built and attractive , but will have to be checked if on air travel . I 'm a little disappointed with the product description .
 Ordered this item for my Gym . It looks good , high quality but just is too big for Gym purpose . It is also heavy .

 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .

 I purchased these hats for a friend 's toddler son 's birthday present and was going to purchase one for my nephew for Christmas . I 'm glad that I waited on ordering the second . My friend 's were disappointed by the shipment time , quality of the material , and sizing of the hats . The hats swamped the toddler and were even big on his father 's head . Very embarrassed to have given this gift . Cute idea , wrong company to buy it through .
 The photo shows princess Jasmine but the product we received did not have Jasmine at all . Jasmine was the only reason we ordered these as our daughter is obsessed with her and specifically told Santa she wanted Jasmine big girl panties . She was disappointed when Santa did not leave her any Jasmine panties .

The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .

 Purchased these shorts and first time I wore them the seam in the crotch chaffed me raw . My wife sews and was able to put tape over seam but one should not have to do that . Would recommend finding another short .
 Very cheaply made , One Washing , and the seams are already developing holes . Threads hang loose . They are comfortable and inexpensive , and ships quickly . Better to buy a higher quality all cotton short . LL Bean makes a much better pair of athletic short !
 I was not made aware that this short hs a grey stripe down the leg.That is not what I wanted
 I did n't received my T-shirt . I bought it in November 17 , the maximum delivery estimate was in December 3 . I want my T-shirt our my money back.Thanks .
 I ordered three and got them today . I ordered the following , all size small . Black , White , and Royal Blue . This is what I got ... Black - `` 100 % Polyester . Made in China '' . White - `` 100 % Nylon . Assembled in Mexico . `` Royal Blue - `` 90 % Nylon . 10 % Elasthan . Made in China . `` That was on the labels sewn into the back of each.Although they were thongs and the size and color were correct , they were different styles and NOT as pictured in addition to not being made of Lycra .
 ok the packed said XL . order said XL i got lager . same color shipped late was n't happy . hand wash if got the time . was n't happy .
 These are NOT `` double wall '' as described by manufacturer . The support is very very light . There are other varieties at less than half the price that are better . . Nancy Ganz , Donna Karan and a sears line called `` subtract '' which are fabulous . . if you can find them!Spanx makes some nice stuff . . their Target line of camis are great and inexpensive . The high waisted body slimmers roll down even on small people . . do n't bother .
 This skirt is nothing but a large piece of cheap felted material . It was thin enough that I could see through it in places . The material was horribly itchy . This is by far the worst thing I have purchased on Amazon , and I buy A LOT of items on Amazon . Worst part is I am out about $ 12 in shipping to return this item .
 We bought a packet of these glow-in-the-dark Nerf darts for our sons ` Nerf Nite Finder EX-3 . The glow darts do n't fly as far nor do they fly as accurately as the micro darts that were included with the Nerf gun.Do these darts glow in the dark ? Yes . But for the price - almost a dollar each - the negatives outweigh the gimmick . I recommend theHasbro Nerf Mega Micro Dart Packif you like to use suction cup tips for target practice . For tag players , try theHasbro Nerf Dart Tag Refill Pack
 These are just weak , flimsy , old-style darts -LRB- which works terribly in new guns -RRB- with a cool glow in the dark fea ture . They fire terribly in the Nerf Firefly Rev-8 and fire terribly in other guns . Get the Nerf M icro Dart -LRB- orange foam , blue tips -RRB- Refill Pack or the Tagger Darts , but the tagge r darts have trouble firing in the Maverick and the Firefly , which is ridicilous and a crue l way to force you to buy the more expensive Micro Darts
 These do not work with a many `` N-Strike '' guns . It only works with N-Strike guns that have the clip system . It 's easy to look at these and think they will work with any Nerf gun -- the size is about the same . But it wo n't . I have all non-clip N-Strike Nerf guns and they work with none of them . Hasbro does have on there that they are for the Clip system , but there is no warning they wo n't work with the other N-Strike guns . If you are n't aware there 's a difference you may end up buying a lot of these like I did and then find out your out of luck .
 OK well you have to apply the stickers that make them glow in the dark . And of course they get lost . They were WAY too expensive in my opinion . We do n't even know where they are anymore and I know I 've thrown some away . The boys just play with the guns without any darts in them . I would not repeat this purchase .
 I am continuously looking for bargains on clothes since I need large sizes and there is n't much of a choice where I live . The shirt ordered seems to be what I want and I ordered one to test it out . Right size , right material , reasonable price . I have n't even received this shirt so I ca n't say anything about it , but what bugs me is the shipping cost . The shirt listed at $ 11.69 and shipping is advertised on the web page for $ 4.35 . Sounds good , I 'll try it . Bang ! The Final Charge is 11.69 for the shirt -LRB- ok -RRB- , AND $ 12.78 for shipping ! Whaaaat ? You got me once . Do you think I 'll order from you again ?
 Think twice before ordering . Although they are quite comfortable and lightweight , they are poorly made . The third time I wore them my nail when right thru the pant leg and put a huge hole in the pants . And no I do n't have long dagger nails either . Put it this way if you can put your finger thru the pants and tear them , they should be sold as disposable wear only .
 I had to contact them 2 weeks after my order never arrived . I had n't received my pants because they were out of stock but did n't contact me , I had to reach out.Won ' t try ordering from them again .
 I wear a medium in pants . I ordered this pants in a large because I wear a lumbar back brace . I could n't even get these pants up to my knees . They were like a size small . The sizing is so off , I would not know what size to order . I have several other pairs of pants like these and I wear medium or large in them with brace . Totally disappointed .
 Ordered these yoga pants because they were supposed to be over 95 percent cotton . Unfortunately they feel as if they are more than 5 percent synthetic stretch fabric . I can wear them for a short time , but I 'm allergic to these pants and I could n't find a label anywhere that SHOWED me the actual fabric content . I considered sending them back , but they 're a perfect fit , look great and I can wear them for a short period of time . Since they were n't too expensive , I decided to keep them . I would n't buy them again .
 I got these in May and now it 's January I think I started wearing them in October and they already have holes in the legs . I got an XL but I definitely could have gotten a smaller size . These things always fall down . I do n't suggest buying them . They are comfortable just cheaply made .
 These worked well the first couple of times I wore them , but unfortunately the waist stretched out . Now I am constantly pulling them up . I will be looking for a replacement .
 I washed them on cold , and did not dry them . The pants are now a whole two sizes too small .
 I thought these were supposed to be long but they were definitely too short for me -LRB- 5 ' 9 &#34; -RRB- . I had to return them .
 I like the pants though as others have said they run a tad small . However , the sizing chart and description say they will have a 32-34 inch inseam , the pair I received has a 38 '' inseam !! If I were a fashion model who was 6 feet tall I 'd be thrilled ! Well , I 'm neither one . Sorry Christian , I 'll have to return these !
 These rip easily and they 're so thin they 're see through . You can see your underwear through them , not just the lines but actual design . I got complemented on my hello kitty underwear when I wore these to class . In certain lighting , you can even see my very small amount of cellulite through them . Spend a little more and get the `` So Low '' brand yoga pants , they 're so much better and will last longer .
 I wore them and they were super comfortable . Since i am 5 ' 3 '' , they were LONG on me . They rip very easily and are rather cheap , I do NOT recommend them .
 I am thin and although I am not super tall , I have long legs and so I have a very hard time finding pants that are long enough for me , especially these type of pants that generally do not come in `` tall '' sizes . After reading other reviews where several people said these were too long for them , I decided to try them . They were about as long as capri pants !!! A good 6 '' shorter than I needed . Other than that they fit well , and I 'm sure for people who are regular sized they are great , but not for me . Beware if you need longer lengths !
 The fabric is quite lightweight , so be aware of that . The fit is perfect for a person with long slim legs . If you have more typical proportions you 'll need to hem them and might find the fit through the thighs too snug .
 I 'm usually a XS in american apparel , so I was surprised -- when I removed them from the packaging , I could instantly tell they were going to be short . I 'm 5 ' 6 and the inseam on these must have been around 28in . I tried to not roll the waistband , but then it just looked silly wearing it lower like that , it did n't fit . Will have to return , super disappointed . $ 20 wouldve been a steal for these .
 these pants looked cute in the photo , but when they arrived and I tried them on , I realized they were made of such thin material that they were see-through . if you buy them , DO buy a size up from your normal size and DO N'T buy white .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 The shorts are a nice fit and wear well , however as a warning , the color of the shorts are actually army green , not brown .
 Despite the title of the advertisement and the seller 's adamant description these are indeed olive drab and NOT brown . My department specifies we use brown slacks/bdus/shorts and I thought I had finally found some brown shorts that looked decent -LRB- the shorts themselves are worth more than the price just realize , they ai n't brown , no not at all and do NOT look like the item advertised herein -RRB- but alas they are Olive Drab and looks like I have to use Amazon 's A-Z return as no response back from seller : -LRB-

 I had bought this jacket this winter in the red . The nicest thing about teh jacket is that it is reversable . The fit may not be extra-ordinarily good though . It 's a light jacket good for spring .

 I bought the reversible cashmere cape recently and tried to return it because it left lint on my clothes . The black side left black lint and the white side left white lint . I called Cashmere Pashmina and they said their products do n't shed . I have been wearing cashmere for years and have never had this problem . But they said to send it back , which I did , but they then sent it back to me saying that they will not refund my money because it was worn and I had taken the little sticker off it and it had a perfume scent on it . Of course I had to try it on . Most people will try on clothes before they buy or before they decide to keep something they 've ordered . I do n't know if this cape is 100 percent cashmere as they claim because of the shedding . A Wall St. Journal article recently found that a lot of inexpensive cashmere from China , which this is , is mixed with other kinds of wool . Anyway , if it did n't shed , I would n't have minded it . Also , they have a 20 percent restocking fee for returned items so keep that in mind before you order something .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .

 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-

 First off the product itself is great , that is if you get the other finishes . It 's this powdered black finish that makes the product essentially useless . And I know because I have a friend 's stainless steel finish to compare side by side to.I 've ordered this particular finish twice ; the first time it arrived it was highly blemished and the `` clip '' portion was off-center . But the worst part was that the method they use to apply this powdered black finish actually ADDS a slight thickness to the metal body -LRB- no idea what metal lies beneath -RRB- . The manufacturer DID NOT compensate for this increased thickness , so what happens is the tapered portion that `` pinches '' the cards is WAY TOO tapered causing a large bend in any card you try to slide in . This makes it literally impossible to slide in the advertised 5 cards -LRB- I could barely get 4 in using more effort than should be necessary -RRB- . So I exchanged it for another one hoping my first was just a defective unit . The second unit was just as bad , although the blemishes were gone . So unless I 'm extremely unlucky , it seems like all units with a Graphite finish are horribly constructed and will not function as advertised . This is shameful QA on Storus ' part . I will email them about their product and see what they have to say.Bottom line , it is a great product if you get the other finishes . I have used my friend 's Polished Stainless Steel unit and it works just as advertised and I love it . I just ordered a Gun Metal finish after returning my second Graphite unit ; hopefully the Gun Metal finish does n't have the same problems .
 I ordered a clip and did not ever receive it . I did get my money back through Amazon and do appreciate that .
 Although I did not like the look of this money clip on the internet , I ordered it as a Christmas present for my boyfriend who said it was `` exactly '' what he wanted . I could not be more diappointed in this item , which I am now stuck with since I was stupid enough to have it `` laser '' engraved by the company . I am so horrified and embarrassed by this worthless piece of garbage that I am trashing it rather than embarrassing myself by actually giving it to him . You have to struggle to get folded bills in it , and sliding cards in it is truly an exercise in futility . Totally disappointed in my complete waste of money . Should have gone with my instincts . If it looks like crap , it probably is .
 I rated this product 2 stars for the idea and fast shipment . However , this is solid metal money clip , and has no elasticity . When you try put your CCs , you actually need to make your cards bend to be able to fit 4 cards at the same time . BTW , there is no way that you can put 5 cards without damaging your cards . Product has bad quality of finishing . Plastic cards can actually make paint to chip ! This would be a great product if the material were carbon or a similar kind of plastic mixture.Honestly , I have no idea how come people `` loved '' this item .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .

 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny .

 After reading the two reviews i decided to give these a try . They are way too small fitting for one size fits all . They are like an extra small in size . Do not waste your money buying them if you are not an extra small in size .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .

The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-
 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .

 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .

 I bought this for a father 's day present . It says one size for men , and when I recieved the apron it looked more like a children 's apron than for a man . The loop for the head was so tiny my niece who is 16 could n't get it over her head . Very dissappointing .
 This bra was very disappointing . I was hoping that it would be comfortable but it was n't . It is well-made , pretty and of good quality but that 's about it.It did distort the way I looked .
 too padded and make the breast look like they 're pointing somewhere lol , did n't like it at all ... . i wo n't even be using them ...
 Through my own fault I selected the wrong size so the fit is n't as perfect as the other one I bought which was the same brand and the perfect size .

 These under-ware are cute , but they have tags in them that are uncomfortable and make my son itch . I tried cutting the tags out but the area where the tags were is still rough , and as my son says ; `` gives him a itchy butt . ''

 I 've been on the unending search for Over-the-Calf -LRB- OTC -RRB- socks for years and was thrilled when I found these on Amazon . Since it was close to Christmas , I put them on my wish list and received two pairs . The socks were everything I wanted - extremely comfortable , attractive , AND -LRB- my holy grail -RRB- they stayed up all through a 14-hour work day!After a single trip through the laundry , though , both pairs shrunk by more than 4 inches . Instead of being almost to the knee , they were below my calf . Of course , they now do n't make it through my first meeting of the day without sagging.I went to Amazon and bought a single pair from my wish list to confirm I had the right thing -LRB- could n't tell my mother-in-law that the gift she had given was a bust -RRB- . The new socks , too , were heaven for the first wearing . One wash , and the same results - no longer long enough nor would they stay up.I do have decidedly hairless legs , so have a lot of trouble finding socks that wo n't droop . These were perfect , however , until they went through the wash and lost more than 25 % of their length . If they need more special treatment than panty hose , they are certainly not what I need . I ca n't endorse such a product and must restart my years-long OTC search .
 After wearing and washing 8-10 times the elastic at the top gave up , and I now have ankle socks . I expected better from Gold Toe . Really disappointed .
 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-

 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I ordered 2 bras at the same time , one from another brand and this one - both the same size . The other one fit perfectly , this one was about 3 cup sizes too small . I ordered an F cup and probably got a D or maybe DD .
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I bought these for my husband for sleepware . He finds the material is too heavy and coarse . He , also , does n't like the waiste band as the rubber lining rubs against his stomach . I do n't plan to get him another pair .
 These under-ware are cute , but they have tags in them that are uncomfortable and make my son itch . I tried cutting the tags out but the area where the tags were is still rough , and as my son says ; `` gives him a itchy butt . ''

 I was really hopeful that this bra would fit well and be supportive . I wear a 30F so comfort and support are important to me and also hard to find . The original one that I ordered was tiny . It looked more like a DD , so I went up two cup sizes . The second one I received fit , I suppose . There was no side support and only two clasps in the back . It did not provide a very natural or flattering shape at all . More like a kinda pointy shape with some extra shoved under my arms . Just disappointing . I 've had two children and nursed them both , and besides unless they 're fake a 30F ai n't standing at attention without some help . This bra just did not live up to the hype the other reviewers gave it and i really wanted it to because it is really pretty : -LRB-

 The ad displays a tan purse.After I purchased it then I found out it only comes in BLACK.My wife has decided she will use it this fall/winter .

My breast did n't ` stay ' when I slept on my back and they actually felt constricted like I was wearing a too tight sports bra . The arm holes were too high so it rubbed against my arm pits . I wore it for about 2 hours and have never put it on since . Very disapointing for such an expensive bra .

 Product arrived promptly but was not as pictured . I was very disappointed . Specifically , the product that was received did not have the bright blue elastic or the designs that were pictured , instead a more common Thomas product that my son already owns was received . Very disappointed buyer . I would not have paid this price for the item received .
 the product is nice quality , but you could probably find them at target and save the shipping costs . you are not saving any money when you order these underwear through amazon !!
 These were too tight around the waist and too long in the in the downseam . They hang down so low past his butt that they make shorts uncomfortable to wear over them . Just too saggy in the bottom area and too tight in the waist

 This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .
 Remember Madonna 's early 90 's look ? Not very flattering . I felt like I had ice cream cones on ! I will be returning this product .
 While this bra offers support it 's seems cause so much irritation and the top of the under wire on both sides rubs against the skin a lot causing tons of soreness and redness . I was fitted by a bra boutique as well so improper size is n't the issue .
 I 'd love the bra if only it had fit . I bought an 38F , which should be my size . This lovely bra fit in the back . The lift is great . I was disappointed to find it way too small in the cup .
 ok I bought this bra hoping that it would be comfortable and fit perfectly . I 'm a 44f and I was falling out of this bra my breasts are heaving and they just weighed the bra down . When I bent over the wires would jab into my armpits . Also the middle of the bra between my breasts would rub me and it was very uncomfortable .
 Have bought this size bra before from other bra makers -LRB- 34 G -RRB- , but this one was way too small . Extra disappointment on returning it unworn and within one day of receipt and being charged close to $ 20.00 from Amazon for the privilege of ordering this on a special offer plan .
 This is a pretty and well made bra but definately not true to sizing . Many bra makers make `` fashion '' bras it seems and they have some kind of formula for anything over a C cup . Well , they do n't work . I 'm average-to-small build but with natural large cup . Did n't even begin to come close to the right cup size . My sister who is 3 cups sizes smaller than me -- fit perfectly ! She looked great in this bra . Bras will say that they are for the larger sizes -LRB- C and up -RRB- but are not . Bali is true to sizing for me , but everyone is different . This one is being returned .
 I have a love and hate relationship with Panache bras . I wear 40hh and there are not alot of bras in my size . I usually wear the Panache Tango plunge but I thought it was the balconette . This bra is cut way too high to be considered a balconette . The bra fit was horrible . It gave my breasts a horrible shape . I would love to describe it for you but it is not normal . The wires under the arm are high but not as high as alot of the Panache bras . The wire between the breasts is as high as a full cup bra and they spread the breasts unnaturally far apart . The cups are awful if you are heavier on the bottom part of your breasts . I have never really seen an extremely large breasted woman who has top fullness . The cups pucker at the top . They do not lay flush with breast . I would definitely not reccomend this bra . If you are looking for something a little sexier and low cut go for the Tango plunge . It is a much better fit .
 This bra is not recommended for those with a a small frame and large chest . I ordered a 28G and it stabbed , did not hold , and hurt my shoulders . After 20 minutes I was in pain and set it back ! Cheap material , scratchy , and overall not able to support a heavy weight !
 I ordered this bra based on the many people who seemed to like it . I was prepared to be shocked if it worked out . Sadly , it was not to be.In fairness , I ordered a bra that was too big , simply because I really did n't know what was going to work . After trying all of the several bras I ordered in some different sizes , I can say that I am probably a 42J -LRB- US measurement -RRB- . Which means I probably needed a 42H in this particular bra.Unlike some of the other underwires I ordered , this one hits my ribcage in a strange way that is not especially comfortable . The wires are also not as protected by a band or very much cushioning.The straps are useless . This bra is made as though it 's for a linebacker . Whatever frame they modeled it on had huge very wide shoulders . I predict on many women the straps will slide off constantly . I 'm a medium to large frame , my shoulders from point to point across my back are about 18 inches , and this bra 's straps want to be out there off my shoulders by another inch or two at least.I suspect this bra may run a little bit large , compared to others . The cups are outrageously large , and they are large in places that naturally large women are typically not . The pretty lacy material at the top was flapping around and folding over there was so much of it . Obviously the bra is made for women that have much of the breast tissue on top , rather than underneath . It might be a good bra for any woman who has had an enlargement , since the breast is usually fuller on top afterwards.This bra seems a little more cheaply designed than the other bras I purchased . The material seems a bit more flimsy.Overall it is not a bra I would order again . I wo n't return it , but it wo n't be a bra I wear often . It will probably be my laundry day bra .
 Out of all the bras I ordered size 32F , this is the only one that actually fit . Unfortunately , the look was totally unflattering . It made my chest look like two squished cones . Had to return .
 I must echo the sentiment of the other reviewer who mentioned that she has gotten much more wear out of much cheaper brands . This is my second pair of Spanx - the first time I bought full pantyhose and they ran in the toe within 3 hours of my first wear , so I decided to try the footless and I got a run in the leg just putting them on for the first time ! I am better off with cheaper control top hose and/or cheaper hose with separate control top panties . I really think that Spanx has become too popular and quality has gone out the window for the sake of mass production .
 I heard about your product on OPRAH and was impressed so I ordered 2 pair even though they are pretty pricey . I thought they would be worth it if they were the quality I expected . Well , I loved the way they felt when I put them on and also how my clothes looked ... but I had only been at work 2 hours when I was showing them to a friend and noticed a RUN right down the front !!!!!! I was so disappointed to find that they are n't made any better than regular panty hose even though they cost more ... they would really be a great product if they were made of stronger fiber to resist runs ! Needless to say , I waisted my money.Linda McCollumMadison , Ms.
 After placing this order , I waited several weeks for its arrival to no avail . I received an email telling me that the product would arrive late in an untimely manner . While awaiting arrival , I found the same product at half of the price I paid this company in a local store .

 The hat has a funny shape . It 's not my head , as other hats fit just fine , but I ca n't seem to get this one to conform to the shape of my head . Consequently I do n't wear it very often . It looks even sillier on me since my hair is so short . Ah , well , at least I like what it says .
 Zipper broke within first few uses :-LRB- It 's fine for cash and a credit card but does n't easily fit keys or anything that is n't flat ...
 This item states 54 on tag but it is really a 42 or 44 . The pants might be a 32 '' . Either way it is to small and should a average junior high student . Do not buy .
 I honestly never felt comfortable in the bra . Maybe if I had the right size I would n't complain . It did n't fit properly -LRB- I 'm a 36 C and that 's what I purchased -RRB- so the cups dippled in the front . Also , it was very uncomfortable to sleep in . My breast did n't ` stay ' when I slept on my back and they actually felt constricted like I was wearing a too tight sports bra . The arm holes were too high so it rubbed against my arm pits . I wore it for about 2 hours and have never put it on since . Very disapointing for such an expensive bra .
 This pant is a little old-school . It fits high up on the waist , and is really tight in the waist , hip , and bum area . The legs are fine and slim throughout . I am not rating this high because the waist is too small . A 14 should be 26 or 28 inches in waist , and this was 24 . I believe this product should be labeled with the waist size as well . Although the legs were fine in length and fit , I could barely fit into the top part of the pants . I would recommend going with the slim-skinny type of pants by Dickies . They fit at the hips and are hip to boot !
 The dickies pants are made of good quality durable material , however the zippers are are of poor quality.The zippers were hard to zip after 1 wear and did not zip at all after that.I would not recommend purchasing this pants .
 bought 3 pair , they do not run true to size even between the three pair ... need to return these and try another brand !!!
 The actual size of the slacks received were WAY TOO SMALL for my son . Ordered a 12 slim , and actually seemed to have received an 8 slim . Would be nice to actually have the waist and leg lengths on the selections so those interested in purchasing a pair of slacks can make an INFORMED decision . Various manufacturers/sellers seem to have differing views on measurements . To help others considering purchasing an item - I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that unless ALL THE INFORMATION -LRB- hint

 Do not order this item unless you have large feet . I believe these are women 's socks and most women do not have that large a foot . When it said one size I thought it was the standard 6-9 like most . I ca n't wear them at all , too big .
 This shirt runs extremely small . I ended up giving my size large shirt to my daughter who wears XS in tops . So , beware !
 Wish I 'd read all the reviews before I purchased this item . Ordered my normal size , a medium , and could n't even get the top on it was so small . I see that the product description now says that it runs small , but I do n't remember seeing this when I ordered it in October . Have to send this one back , I 'm afraid ... Recommend you order two sizes up .
 I should have read the other 1-star review . I ordered a large , tried it on , and barely got it off ! It fit more like a small ! I generally take a medium or a large shirt . Make sure you order a few sizes bigger than what you normally wear!Buyer beware !

 Product purchased was never shipped because Galaxy accepted the order knowing the item is out of stock never to be replenished .
 Duct tape is one of my essential travel , camping or backpacking items , but it 's amazing anyone can charge so much for so little ! In a minute or two , you can roll 20 + feet of your own duct tape around a short pencil and have your own ` travel duct tape ' for pennies . Better yet , roll it around an empty Rx bottle , and fill the bottle with a homemade sewing kit.Also , I prefer 3M 's clear duct tape , especially when traveling . It 's strong and it blends in better .
 i live in a pretty laid back community.all the people are retired or semi-retired . so we tend to dress comfortably.old jeans and old faded rock t-shirts rule the day . so when i got my new army special forces shirt from amazon , all my friends wanted to know where i purchased it.the patches are really funky , and the more i wash it the better it looks and feels . this is surly one of the more smarter investments that i 've made .
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 My boys , ages 3 and 5 , LOVE the Disney Peter Pan movie . I thought they would enjoy this hat to play pretend Peter Pan , but they have not worn their hats since receiving them 5 days ago . The hats do not stay on their heads well at all .
 I have been wearing these Weatherproof jackets for years . This one , ordered through Amazon.com , is junk . After the first washing , both the collar buttons fell off -LRB- needed to be re-sewn on -RRB- . Also , peculiar markings in the fiber near shoulder sleeve appear some how . Washing the jacket removes them , then they magically reappear . Beginning to wonder if this jacket is counterfeit .
 I 've owned three of these Weatherproof jackets , purchased at retail stores . The jacket I just received from this online source is not the same quality . The construction , fabric , lining , elastic wrist and waist bands are not as good . Also the jacket differs somewhat from the photo . I 've really liked these jackets , so I 'm disappointed having to return this one .
 Although there is nothing wrong with this -LRB- navy -RRB- jacket , I have another one similar in Willow , what they are showing on the website is not what you get . The one shown on the site is `` lined , '' what you get is not `` lined . '' Got the same from Macy 's . Apparently they are using last years artwork . Come on Amazon , get with it . Too much trouble to send back this late in the season .
 When I got it and tried it on , it did not fit very well . The sizing of jacket and sleeves seemed funny to me . Not comfortable so I returned it . Amazon was GREAT about the return .
 I was first disappointed in the stiffness of the so called soft fabric , Compared to Faconnable jacket I bought years ago it is like paper compared to velvet . I also notice the XL seemed a little smaller . The finish of the fabric had scratches on it too . But for only 60 dollars it 's an OK jacket but I probably wo n't be buying cloths online anytime soon again . I was hoping for a bit better than this from Amazon .
 I bought this exact jacket around 6 years ago , and I loved it so much , I 've been wearing it all this time in spite of the fact that it 's worn out . So I was thrilled to see it was on sale again on Amazon . Ordered it and got it yesterday only to find that the sleeves are too short ! I have to send it back now . Great !
 I ordered this for my 9 year-old son , despite reviews that said that the hat ran very small . I figured it was n't likely to be a problem , since the description said it fits adults and kids 12 and up . But it does n't fit even a teeny 9 year-old head . I would not recommend ordering unless it 's for a very young child .
 The hat you get is not like the photo . They used a stock photo of the fancier -LRB- and now hard to find -RRB- quality McGonagall hats that came out when the first movies came out . I had seen one in person once and it was totally different . The hat is poor quality like it was meant for a child 's Halloween costume , it does n't fit an adult head , and is sewn funny so that the tip flops down and to the side in a weird way . It is deep black instead of dark grey like the original hat , and does n't look like this photo at all . It is made of rather cheap-looking material and has that `` costumey '' look about it - not authentic looking at all . I feel like this was false advertising and I hope they will let me send it back ... if not , Amazon will get an earful . I do n't know if the more genuine , higher quality hats are still available anywhere ... I think to get what you want , you must have to make your own . Bleh .
 In the product description said It has metal frame , It did n't it 's very light wight and the glasses are not good ... I was very disappointed
 I liked the look of these sunglasses , but I dropped a pair and they exploded when they hit the ground .
 The Suspenders are fine except one of the tongues or the buckles was put it the wrong way and the fastening of this one is not as secure as the correct buckle and the tongue sticks awkwardly out . I will have to take it to a leather shop to have the problem fixed . Other than that product is fine .

 Yes , these are a great buy , however , if you dont want to look like a throwback form the 70 's / 80 's do n't buy them.Good product overall , but I think I 'll just use them for yard work when no one is around !

 when this arrived I was disappointed on sight . It is not made very well , the material is itchy and uncomfortable . When I washed it , it fell apart . I would not recommend this to anyone . I felt it was pricey enough to be of good value , but I did not like anything about it . Even my hubby commented that I have many others that he liked so much better . The color of this was the ONLY thing that was good about it .
 I gave it to my daughter for dress up because there is no way I 'm wearing a bra that ties in the back . Not a good buy .
 This luggage is not well designed since the left latch broke upon first use . Anyone who purchases this piece should also buy a luggage strap to make it secure , since the flimsy latches will not hold up . If they open , which they do easily , even when you do n't want them to , they will be broken off if they come in contact with other luggage . I have requested a repair or replacement from EBags and will follow up this COMMENT if I do not receive satisfaction . Samsonite needs to redesign this luggage .
 It 's been two months and I still have n't received this item , even thought my credit card was charged ! No response from customer service . Do n't buy from these people !!

 Nice looking pair of glasses but unfortunately we must have gotten a defective pair . One side of the glasses -LRB- where it wraps and hooks around your ear -RRB- . This was significantly higher than the other . You can notice this by setting the shades on the table - it did not lay flat . This caused the shades to sit uneven on your face . One side touched my cheek but the other side did not . One of the joints where the frame bends was screwed on way too tight , it made it hard to fold the glasses . Had high hopes for these pair too .
 The arms wereto tight . I do not have large arms and they fit like skin
 I have purchased Under Armor products in the past and enjoyed them . However , I was completely dissatisfied with this product . The only thing I like about it is the length of the capri pants . The waist line is too short , and the fabric is flemsy and not what I expected . I would have returned the product , but unfortunately , I threw the receipt and packaging away before I had an opportunity to try the product on . $ 31.00 plus dollars wasted !
 This bra runs incredibly small . I am between an F and G , so I ordered size G cup and it was as small as DDD . The band size was okay and it does technically fit . The support is average at best for my size . Somehow , it manages to give the pointed torpedo shape and uniboob at the same time . The band rolls up and there is only about 1/3 inch of adjustment in the band . I 'm incredibly disappointed and will never wear it again , let alone buy another one .
 I bought two Glamorise bras , they fit well and at first I was delighted . I treated them extremely gently , washing in gentle cycle and with cold water only . Within just a few months , the hooks on the bra literally began to disintegrate . You could n't get them to go through the eyes.Another drawback is that the fabric is cheap and scratchy and becomes more so with repeated washing . Despite the stiffness and scratchiness , the fabric does not hold it 's shape -- the great fit deteriorates along with everything else.The bras were great at first but became progressively less so with each washing and became completely unwearable when the fasteners disintegrated.Sorry , I really wanted to like these bras . I wish somebody would take the basic design and use good materials -- that ought to make a great bra .
 since I have arthritis and it 's difficult for me to hook a bra in the back , thought I would give this one a try . It does not fit well ... cups are loose and the band is tight ... it actually cuts into the flesh . I bought it a size bigger than I normally wear because I had been told by a friend that Glamorize is cut small . I hate this bra and it is going into the donation bin at our local thrift shop in the hopes that someone will like it and get some good out of it .
 Have other Glamorise bras that I love . This one was thrown in the trash the 1st day . It was a poor fit and actually pressed my breast like I was having a Mammogram . Was n't worth the effort to send back . Sorry Glamorise , hope you can do better than this .
 I heard such great things about this bra , and its a really nice bra but did n't fit right . I even tried exchanging a different size but no luck . It gives off a ` pointy ' look if you know what I mean !

 I ordered a pair for my spouse in his normal size and they were a tad bit to small . so , I went back and ordered the next size up in waist . When they came they were the same waist size as the previous pair but longer . Both pants have the same size for length , so this is n't my ordering mistake . Rather they are several sizes to small !
 Much smaller than measurements would indicate . I ordered the same size that I order from Land 's End and Levi -- ended up with something much smaller than expected in the waist and little short in the inseam.Wouldn ' t buy this online without trying on in a store . Sizing was definitely off other brands .
 I ordered a34x32 and I got a 36x32 . I was out of the country when the order was placed.I need the correct size
 These fit nicely in all areas except one . These are high-risers
 The weight of the material was what I was looking for and the waistline was fine , but the fit around the lower abdomen and buttocks was way too tight.No , I am not fat but rather slim .
 Do n't plan on wearing this under anything that is even remotely clingy ... it shows everything ! The size is pretty true but not a lot of give so do n't think that you can order a size smaller and squeeze in !
 I am a big fan of Chantelle bras -- but this one is embarrasing to wear because it makes this squishy noise when you move . Strangest bra I have ever owned ... it fits well , but I do n't wear it much because of the noise ?? Anyone else have this problem ? All my other Chantelle bras are great .
 Especially for the price , this bra is just terrible . The descriptions reads `` Molded underwire cups '' . Not only are the cups not molded , on the one I got , they are not padded or even lined . The construction is bad & the material is cheap . I have purchased bras for half this price that are constructed better . Maybe I got one different from the other reviewers because I just ca n't give it more than one star . I have heard this brand is good , but this particular one is not & is going back . Do n't waste your money .
 A product is only as good as its weakest point , and in this case that was the zipper.The zipper began to fail after 6 months and became useless after 18 months . This bag did not get hard use , but the zipper was an inferior grade
 Not bad , but i old version from a couple years ago was lighter and better .
 I intended to switch from another bag to this one . I find it far to complicated to use even though it has more room . Sorry I bought it .
 I bought this for a trip . I wanted room for my cell phone , sunglasses , chapstick , plus all the credit cards , cash , id , etc. . I wanted to wear it across my body for safety but the strap was extremely irritating to my neck . I wanted to wear it as a fanny pack but the strap would not stay cinched , so it would just slide down my hips to the floor . Since the fabric was soft , it became a strange fat lumpy shape as soon as a few things were thrown in . I have n't used it since returning from the trip , and am now in search of something similar but without the problems this one had .
 I like the concept of this wallet . It seems to have a place for everything I needed . However , the bag is very soft and I wanted something with a more solid construction . I would also have liked the credit card compartment to open fully for easier access which it did not . So , reluctantly , I returned the bag and will continue my search for the perfect wallet .
 The fanny pack is great but the waist band is sized for very large people .
 I PURCHASED THE MOCK TURTLENECKS THAT WERE ADVERTISED AS A HEAVY 7.4 WEIGHT COTTON I ASSUMED THE NECK AND SWEATER WOULD BE HEAVY DUTY ... NOT ... . THE ITEM WAS MORE OF THE WEIGHT YOU WOULD WEAR UNDER A SHIRT AND THE NECK HAD A SAG IN IT EVEN BEFORE WEARING ... VERY DISSAPOINTED
 Ill-fitting , oversized , cheap material . Waste of money.Can buy similar but much better items elsewhere including Lands End.Terrible tailoring .
 Due to a skin sensitivity , I 've had to wear genuine 100 % cotton fabric for years . I can tell almost immediately if some fabric is real 100 % cotton , or not . This fabric feels ok at first , but after a while I start getting a skin reaction.Upon closer examination , true enough , there are non-cotton fibres and other artificial materials that have been inserted into the shirt.There should be a law against these `` Fake 100 % Cotton '' advertising .
 I ordered two shirts . Both arrived over packaged and took two days for overnight shipping.After reading some reviews , I expected something like a Tshirt with a mock turtleneck . The shirt is thicker than a Tshirt . I find it similar to a very thin sweat shirt without that fuzzy stuff on the inside . I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues . I ordered a medium and this thing is huge . I washed it in hot water , dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big . After washing and drying , I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes ' longsleeve pullovers . The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches . I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing .
 I laundered this shirt once and it now looks a year old . I recommend you find another manufacturer of mock necks .
 I ordered a women 's 2X mock Tneck . It is definitely a man 's shirt . Shoulders are huge and sleeves are at least five inches too long . Will not order again .
 I 've worn the shirt just 4 times , and after normal washing it has the dreaded `` bacon neck '' look . The turtleneck looked great at first , but now looks terrible .
 Received the Mock Turtleneck and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shirt until I put it in the wash . The shirt began &#34; pilling &#34; and the color seemed a couple shades lighter than I remembered before putting it in the washing machine . Long story short , I am disappointed and would not recommend this product or brand . The vendor shipped on time but shipping sub-standard products does n't warrant a high rating .

 While the shirt was the correct size and my wife loved it . The shirt started coming a part at the bottom after being washed one time . It continues to do so every time it is washed/dryed . So i 'm not happy with the quality of the product i got .
 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is highly disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped me the panty only , with no explanation as to the missing bra . Over the next three days , I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates , receiving no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty -LRB- even though its packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are dishonest . Stay away from them .

I am pleased with the quality.I should have listened to other reviewers when they discussed size issues . I ordered a medium and this thing is huge . I washed it in hot water , dried twice with superhot air and it is still way too big . After washing and drying , I held the shirt next to one of my medium Hanes ' longsleeve pullovers . The shoulder points of the turtleneck were approx 21.5 inches compared to the Hanes at 18 inches . I did not measure before washing.Three stars were deducted for the Shrek sizing .
 I PURCHASED THE MOCK TURTLENECKS THAT WERE ADVERTISED AS A HEAVY 7.4 WEIGHT COTTON I ASSUMED THE NECK AND SWEATER WOULD BE HEAVY DUTY ... NOT ... . THE ITEM WAS MORE OF THE WEIGHT YOU WOULD WEAR UNDER A SHIRT AND THE NECK HAD A SAG IN IT EVEN BEFORE WEARING ... VERY DISSAPOINTED
 Ill-fitting , oversized , cheap material . Waste of money.Can buy similar but much better items elsewhere including Lands End.Terrible tailoring .
 Due to a skin sensitivity , I 've had to wear genuine 100 % cotton fabric for years . I can tell almost immediately if some fabric is real 100 % cotton , or not . This fabric feels ok at first , but after a while I start getting a skin reaction.Upon closer examination , true enough , there are non-cotton fibres and other artificial materials that have been inserted into the shirt.There should be a law against these `` Fake 100 % Cotton '' advertising .

 Received the Mock Turtleneck and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shirt until I put it in the wash . The shirt began &#34; pilling &#34; and the color seemed a couple shades lighter than I remembered before putting it in the washing machine . Long story short , I am disappointed and would not recommend this product or brand . The vendor shipped on time but shipping sub-standard products does n't warrant a high rating .
 I laundered this shirt once and it now looks a year old . I recommend you find another manufacturer of mock necks .
 I ordered a women 's 2X mock Tneck . It is definitely a man 's shirt . Shoulders are huge and sleeves are at least five inches too long . Will not order again .
 I 've worn the shirt just 4 times , and after normal washing it has the dreaded `` bacon neck '' look . The turtleneck looked great at first , but now looks terrible .
 It says these `` one size fits all '' tights should fit someone weighing 90-160lbs , I weigh about 130 -LRB- give or take a few pounds -RRB- and am about 5 feet . My thighs buldge out the top of these tights -LRB- not cute -RRB- . I do have thick thighs so might work if you have skinny thighs -LRB- like the girl in the picture -RRB- . Also if you are short they will be way too long . They are cute and cheap but its too bad they only come in one size .

 This seller , `` In the Mood Intimates , '' is highly disreputable . I bought a matched bra and panty set , same color , as a gift . The bra was at a great sale price , the matching panty was at full price . The total , in excess of $ 100 , qualified me for a $ 10 discount and free shipping.Twelve -LRB- 12 -RRB- days after receiving my credit card remittance , they shipped me the panty only , with no explanation as to the missing bra . Over the next three days , I left eleven -LRB- 11 -RRB- detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates , receiving no response . Finally , another nine -LRB- 9 -RRB- days later , I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock , and indicating their refusal to accept a return of the panty -LRB- even though its packaging is unopened -RRB- owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile , they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $ 10 discount.These people are dishonest . Stay away from them .
 I ordered these about two years ago and they were great . Solid , comfortable , well-made . Devoid of ridiculous patterns and colors . So just recently , I decided to get a few more , and to my shock , what came were a much thinner material . I do n't expect the new ones to last more than a year . It 's a shame to see a good product be ruined by short-sighted management trying to cut corners .
 I already own a baggalini small wallet and wanted one for my friend . I ordered it from Amazon , paid for it , received my confirmation , and several days later was notified that it was no longer available.I did receive a refund for the full amount , but I really wanted the item . Very disappointed .
 I would give this no stars if possible . It is totally aggravating . Idea and size perfect . I got used to the zippers not opening smoothly but the deal breaker is the card slots !! They are totally useless everything falls out of them . Regardless of how it 's oriented or if the slots are stuffed or not , they will not hold your credit card , grocery card , drugstore card , etc ; everything the bag was built to hold . Definitely would not recommend and wish I could return .
 The dress was cheaply made . The hat required many extras to even make it wearable . This product was not even worth a third of what was charged .
 The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart . I could n't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims . Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF . I tried this bra on in a 38 DD . I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support . Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all . That is not the effect I want when I go strapless . Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety .
 I cancelled my order for this product , therefore , I do not have anything to review .
 The print was glossier than the first one I received . It was also off center .
 I recieved this costume today . For the price I expected much better quality . The fabric is cheep poly and is poorly sewn . I will know better next time .
 fabric is flimsy and looks as if will fall apart easily . not worth the price at all .
 The costume is terrible quality and it does n't come with a mask as pictured . It was also missing all the straw and one of the black straps . Not sure what happened with this transaction , but it was a big fail on Amazon 's part . I returned the costume .
 The product was sent very quickly and arrived in new condition , so I have no issue with the service . However , the costume was VERY cheaply made . The elastic in the waistband failed immediately buy coming detached from the pants and also it was completely stretched out and had no elasticity . The pants were so long they fit my 16 year old son , so they were not `` child-size . '' The headpieces which were a hat and bag-like part were both WAY too small for my 7-year-old daughter , so it was toddler-sized . The image displayed here did not accurately match they item sent at all . We tried to make it work with buying straw and other parts , but we ended up using NO part of this purchase to use as her scarecrow costume . She ended up with her own jeans , her own cowboy hat , her own flannel shirt and brown boots . She had a great time in the costume with our own make-shift supplies , so if I had to do it over I WOULD NOT have purchased this item .
 I just recieved my skirt in the mail . From the picture and discription I was expecting a slightly thicker nicer material to be used . It is realy a thin satin like material . I also expected the skirt to be ankle length !!! It was definatly not !!! Not even close !!! I am averaged sized , so I did n't think it would be so short . My third complaint is the size . According to the description a small is a 6 to 8 , and I was worried about it being big . It is smaller !! The true size is close to a 2 to 4 on the small . Buyer beware .
 The print was glossier than the first one I received . It was also off center .
 So I ordered this about three weeks before Halloween and we are quickly approaching December and I still have not received it . Maybe one day I can give it as a gift to someone , if it ever arrives !!!

 I have never received this product that I ordered more than an month ago . Three times this company sent me the wrong product . I returned all three and have asked that my money be refunded - I no longer have time to deal with their errors . I have still not received a refund oreven a response to my request .
 I never saw these products . They were allegedly shipped on August 15 due to arrive on August 20 . By August 25 I wrote to find out what had happened . Amazon asked me to wait until August 31 . Finally , I asked that the order be reshipped , and Amazon asked me to cancel and reorder . When I reordered , the product was listed as no longer available . Whatever ?
 I ordered the Loopies `` Sneaker Brights '' but instead received some musical theamed version . I was very disappointed.The box was labeled Sneaker Brights so I wrapped it up and went to a baby shower . When the expectant mother opened my gift I saw that there was a mix-up . Regards , Dee Biscamp
 These are definately cute , but for the price , I expected something more . They are just baby socks , not extra warm , or anything like that . Just cute socks .
 The print was glossier than the first one I received . It was also off center .
 This is a very handsome tie and I ordered it nearly three weeks ago in order to have it in time for the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows premiere . Unfortunately , it has n't even been shipped yet . Poor service indeed .
 I love this bag for its storage , lightness and look . The straps sit well on my shoulder and it is very comfortable to carry . I have been using it for LESS THAN a month -LRB- got it for Christmas -RRB- and today when I went to pick it up - the metal buckle that holds the handle to the bag snapped . I do n't carry anything but a laptop and my ipad in it so I know i did not over load the bag . Seriously disappointed .
 This hat is on the thin side for a major name but most importantly it is very small in size even though it is marked LG/EX LG IMHO ...
 Began to rip at the seams after less than a year of use .
 I could n't figure out how to shape the actual wig to match what the picture looked like . The wig came bunched up and it was not clear how the hair was supposed to be parted . Also , after trying it on a couple of times , the fine black mesh that was inside of the wig seemed to come out and I could not figure out how to get it back in .
 I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their customer service , and the quality of their product . I received a pair of gloves as a Christmas gift , and after light wear for about a week - the gloves looked weeks old . They were discolored and the leather had begun to crack . After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period . Their reason for refusing to exchange the gloves is the exact reason for my wish to exchange them!Leather Gloves Online has officially lost a customer .
 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them . I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves -LRB- great color choices -RRB- Now I 'm glad I only lost money on one pair . Regretfully , I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini .

 I have not found any materiel that is really waterproof except rubber . That includes gore-Tex . My feet were moist after using for only 1 hr in semi wet conditions .
 These are not bad wading socks other than the fact they will start smelling really bad after about the third or fourth use . I wash them regularly after each use also to no avail . They retain a horrible mildew stink no matter how long you soak them . I would not reccoumend just because of this problem . I am a clean person and wash all my clothes regularly and can not believe how horrible these socks stink .
 I used these socks once for a ten mile run in snow . By the middle of the run my feet were sloshing from the acculumated sweat . When I took them off , I could literally squeeze water out of the socks . Not only that , after one use they smelled that something had died in them.Don ' t depend on these for long sporting activities .
 They are not waterproof at all -LRB- well they do n't leave the water get out in fact -RRB- . . i bought them for canyoning . . water came in and them i have to walk with an extra pound of water in my shoes . . do n't buy this .
 This is a really flawed concept . The problem is that even if they do happen to work they do not release sweat . So your feet maybe water free but what good is that if your foot is soaked in sweat . If this were n't enough water does come through the fabric .
 these people are horrible i orderd wool socks and they sent me nylon and i paid more money for wool nylon would have been cheaperit says odor proof on the box almost every day i got a complain that they smelli wash them and the same day they smell they have a horrible odor that comes
 Bought 3 pairs of these in 3 sizes for me , wife , & mother . Took them on a 4-day rafting trip w / light/moderate rapids . Even on the lightest day , our feet were still soaking wet & cold by the end . Tried 'em with cuff below and above wetsuit -- did n't work in any configuration . Great idea -- just does n't work .
 I have 2 pair of gloves , 4 pair of socks . Out of the 12 items only 1 is water proof . If you only dip it in water for a second it will be water proof , anything over 1 second it is going to leak . I wear the socks under my water shoes while I get into my kayak , I am in water just below my ankle for about 3 seconds , that all it takes to make them leak . They seem to be ok for a few wearings but after that-wet feet . Same for the gloves .

 When they say filament , they mean filament . These are just a bit too thin for me . If your looking for a silk like very thin base layer , then they are fine .
 Very disappointed in this product . The shirt is thin enough to see through , more like a stocking than a shirt . Also pilling badly around the collar , though my husband has worn it only a couple months . He has similar apparel in other brands that he likes much better .
 Too thin . I wanted some lightweight winter undergarments for my husband , I was thinking cuddle-duds for men , but these are see-through . They really do look like black pantyhose when on . He has n't worn them yet so I have no idea if they get the job done .
 Ok , the shirt is comfortable enough , but it is so thin that it adds less &#34; thermal &#34; insulation than a standard t-shirt/undershirt . Not a nice choice for the price .
 We bought the Ninja costume for our 7 year old son . He normally wears size 8 clothes . Even though this costume is marked as Medium -LRB- 8-10 -RRB- it is way too small . Even though he is thin , he can barely fit into it , and even that requires assistance , making it impossible for him to take to school for the halloween parade . The costume looks pretty cool over all , but since it does n't fit it 's worthless . If your child is smaller it may work . I 'm not sure what size it would actually fit . So now I 'm off to the local costume store to find a replacement . I do n't want to disappoint him . So wish me luck at this late date .
 Seriously cheaply made costume , maybe ONE STEP above the plastic ones I wore as a kid . The ties in the back tore off when trying to tie it , the legs were uneven , with one being longer than the other , and the mask eyeholes were in a weird place , and no my kid is not some weird mutant , just a normal , six year old boy . Not worth the money !
 My son wanted this costume over all the others , and treasured it right out of the package - ripped seam and all . After a day of loving this costume despite the constant problems , he had to admit it was not going to be able to last another day . I watched it fall apart within a couple hours from nothing more than normal dragon slayer activities .
 We got this for my son as a halloween costume and had to ship it back and get a larger size -LRB- would have bought a different costume but he was set on this one -RRB- the opening for the back is the most flawed design ever my son would have fit the size small but it was impossible to get the hooded part on unless he had the next size up which was quite large on him . the back of the hood is closed and fully attached so the opening in the back sits below the hood enough for your body to get in but somehow you have to manage to get your head into the hood through the body hole if that makes sense . the material was n't even stretchy so you could n't even try to pull it up .
 I was sent the wrong ninja costume . Was unable to reach anyone to rectify the problem . The costume says size 8-10 , but actually fits a child of about size 5-6 . Not well made . Had to sew on the velco on mask and fix a hole in the seam as it is so poorly made . All around bad experience .
 I got this in and the Dragons that are on the shoulders in the picture looked like my four year old took some paint and just slapped it on . I guess that is what you get for 19.99 . I sent it back with no problem and went to a costume store and purchased a costume for my son .
 This costume was way TOO small for my eight year old ! He 's a regular size 8 so it 's not like he 's a big boy and I could barely get the thing on him . Sent it back over two weeks ago and still do n't have my money back . Very disappointed .

Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange .

 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open .

 I bought the Love A Lot Carebear outfit for my daughter 's 1st Halloween . The sizing says from 0 to 6 months . My daughter was 2 1/2 months old when she wore this and it was too big on her ! You should really break the sizes down . If it had been a 0 to 3 size it would have fit her perfectly . It did look really cute on her , but that is about the only good thing about it .

 I recieved the costume with missing parts . It looked like the bag had been opened before it was shipped to me . I was missing the parts that held the hat up and the hat itself . I had to buy another hat and find a metal rod to replace the one that i didnt get.I emailed the company and got no response back .

 The sizes for this coat run really small so my husband , who normally wears a large , had to return it for an Extra Large . The only problem being that there is no Extra large . The return was handled efficiently , however , and the customer service was good .

 It 's a nice , cute hat & all ... but it does n't fit me ! Not that my head is huge or anything considering I 'm a 5 ' 2 female & pretty petite , this apparently was meant for kids . Oddly enough , there was nothing in the item description or anywhere else that mention if the sizing was meant for kids or adults . Fortunately , I do have a toddler son whose head this definitely fits . In fact , I just happened to buy my son his own beanie visor a week before at Old Navy & compared them & they are exactly the same size , so all is not lost.All in all , the hat was cheap , it appears decent , but it did not fit it 's intended wearer -LRB- an adult -RRB- & neither did it mention any size limitations so for the latter I marked it with 1 star . & & & & & On another , I also left feedback with the seller -LRB- Gravity Trading , Inc -RRB- & they quickly contacted me by email twice to resolve the issue . I did n't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I did n't respond back but after 3 days of no response on my end they finally called me to resolve the issue in which they just sent me a different black beanie visor with a cuff to compensate for my experience -LRB- I ordered 2 beanie visors , only one of which fit so the representative made sure it was the same size as that -RRB- . Although unrelated to the actual product , I just wanted to explain my better experience after purchasing this product . The other hat I ordered was awesome by the way : White Cuffless Beanie Visor Jeep Cap - Skull Cap - One Sizewhich the representative tried to find in a black color from the same maker -LRB- Magic Headwear -RRB- but they had none . The original black beanie visor I ordered did not have a tag inside to list the manufacturer , merely a generic tag saying it was made in Vietnam . This hat was a VERY tight fit ; meaning it did fit but with effort in which I was obviously on the brink of overstretching it just to wear . I can only hope if anyone experiences the same as I did that they receive great customer service too -LRB- THEY CALLED ME ! & just 2 days before Christmas , then started the process of sending me the no-charge hat the next day ! -RRB- . Unfortunately , while I was browsing other similar hats I noticed similar feedback of the hats being too small for adults so I would suggest if you see feedback like that to try to contact the seller for more information on the hat -LRB- like exact measurements -RRB- in case you are worried you might miss out on a comfortable fit .
 This item was purchased for my girlfriend , a Ms Beverly Kelly for a project she was doing at her school -LRB- she is an educator -RRB- . I was upset to see that you could barely see the images on the shirt . When I purchased it , there was NO mention of it being faded on purpose.I was , and am , very disappointed.RegretfullyLuis G Hernandez Jr

 this shir is so thin that after you eash it it will fall apart . I purchased it brcause of the rhinestones in the center , they arent even beads this is worth 9.99 if you are a large this will not fit , if you are a small get a medium
 This is a good pair of capris but they run very small for size Order larger than normal size !!!! @
 I bought a pair of these about a week ago and so far I 'm just not that impressed . The only good thing I can say is that they do feel like real breast tissue . I must admit it took me a little while to figure out how to align them . I put them on the way they 're laid out in the packaging but it seemed that too much silicone was hanging out of the bra , which someone could easily see if you bend over . I figured out that if I turned them into a more diagonal position then the bra works very well in covering them up . However , no matter which way I turn them -LRB- even purposely wearing them upside down ! -RRB- I always end up with a pointy look which I 'm afraid will be a red flag to someone else that they 're not real . Another issue I have is comfort ; they 're so sticky that I find myself taking them off at least once an hour to allow my skin to breathe . By the end of my work shift I 'm literally counting down the minutes to come home and take them off . They 're hard to keep clean too . I do n't know how but I 've ended up with a lot of lint and fuzz from my bra and clothes that got trapped in the sticky adhesive all along the edge and I ca n't get it off . Finally , my biggest complaint of all is the smell . Once they warm up the silicone smell is almost unbearable and I 'm so paranoid that anyone standing near me can smell them too . I 've tried body spray , perfume , anything I can think of to spray my bra and nothing hides this smell . I really am trying to convice myself to like these things because I spent the money but I 'm going back to my padded bras . Either way , the product 's intentions are good ... and I applaud the manufacturer 's effort !! ** June , 26 , 09I am definitely done with these . Cleaning them is a pain . It takes at least 10-15 minutes to thoroughly clean off all the crud -LRB- lint , fuzz , etc -RRB- that accumulates on them . The adhesive is starting to break down . They hardly even stick anymore . At first , I complained that they were too sticky . Now since they barely stick they do n't stay directly on the skin , which creates a gap for air and sweat to accumulate . The adhesive is breaking off in little bits , I keep finding little balls of adhesive glue on the inside of the inserts . Since it 's coming off so much more , the adhesive is left on my skin when I peel the inserts off , exactly like when you remove a band-aid that you 've been wearing for days and there 's that annoying adhesive line that you have to scrub/rub off . Also , the clear plastic like coating that surrounds the silicone is peeling . I had to cut away a piece that was stabbing me -LRB- it looks like a small flap , I guess there was supposed to be a clasp that attaches to both pieces to create cleavage , but I did n't receive it -RRB- . For less than 20 dollars , you get what you pay for . Mine are going in the garbage tonight .
 This was a total waste of money ! I tried it on and threw in the trash immediately . It was really thin and the sticky stuff to adhere to your body was really slimy . It did n't feel sanitary too , like someone had used it before . I had to shower after trying it on . I do have to say this company had super speedy shipping . But I think it was only because they wanted to get rid of this crap quickly . Be careful , if you still want to try this out , this item is non-returnable .
 they didnt stick and just looked way too fake !! my husband swore it was chicken and it just makes u that much more self consious .
 My friend also has a one , but hers is much more comfortable than mine . and also , because there is no hook between them , so the actually make my breast look flat in this way .
 I was very disppointed when Amazon advised me that my order for this Prada bag is lost in transit . Therefore , I am not able to provide feed back on the product but rather on the after-sales service.I am a customer residing outside America and had paid a hefty sum for shipping charges of this light weight bag which was packed in a 30 lbs volumtric weight carton . This is my second order for Prada bag which led to non receipt at my end.However , I was thankful that the purchases were made through Amazon and they had resolved the issues amicably.I made online purchases rather frequently and must comment that among all merchants , I must grade Amazon as one of the best . Keep up Amazon !!!
 Item barely fit when I got it and then I washed it to take out the wrinkles and it SHRUNK REALLY BAD ! Even in the arms where something does n't normally shrink !
 Good looks , but not the bag for a pro . Not padded well , comfortable or ready for production elements . Better ti use for a day bag with your single body cam and a trip to Disneyland . Take this thing international and your in trouble !

 Very soft , clingy & drapey fabric - great feel . Too clingy for my lumpbody . Would recommend ordering 1 or 2 size up for a loose fit to be more flattering for the not so perfect body .

 I think it 's a little more expensive for what it is ! I could get one from Walmart for half the price . When I was buying this T-Shirt , I was looking for a white soccer shirt , but , it was n't it ! It was a waste of money .
 This is really a British camouflage face paint kit . The paints are very hard to put on . Neither a rag , sponge , or brush can be used to apply it . The face paint is very hard in the case and one has to press hard with a thumb to get it out of the case . Then it is hard to apply to the skin . It took an average of 20 minutes just to apply it to a face . The green comes out very light although in spots it will be dark . The brown does n't give a good color easier . When I was in the service , camouflage paint came in tubes and it easily squeezed out but that is not the case with this kit .
 This falls into the category of not worth the effort to send back since the shipping is almost as much as the product . This hat runs VERY small . My 6 year old son has a smallish head and it fits just barely on top . Yes , it looks a little stupid but he likes it anyway . The zorro costume , however , is pretty great .
 Good product but you ca n't return or exchange items easily therefore I would not buy another product from this seller .
 Socks are not waterproof as advertised on amazon . The packaging does not actually use the word waterproof . Packaging says `` blocks water '' , and `` water-hating '' . When I place the socks in running water , water penetrates the seams easily as they are not sealed . The packaging claims to seal in heat , but I have n't tried it while wearing , so I 'm not sure if it 's a valid claim.It seems to be water repellent and pretty good if not in standing water , but I would think if your shoes are wet , the water will eventually wick into the socks.Also , Medium is too small for me as I wear size 9US shoes .
 I do not know what happened . When I got those socks , they were very good and seemed ro repell all the water out , preventing anything form going in . I do not know what happened , but it has been two weeks and the socks are no longer water proof ! I only wore it once prior to this ... I put them on today and water was going in like it was cotton . The only possible explanation I have is that I must have streched when putting it on -LRB- they fit in very tight if the sizing guide is correct -RRB- causing the pores to open -- but still !!! I have n't washed them or anything like that . I plan on calling seirus but I doubt customer service will have any answer . With that said , buy it at your own risk . They would definitely be worth it if they remained functional . In my case , $ 30 was a waste .
 I use these on cold , windy , wet days when riding a bike in Western Siberia . I put it over a wool sock . I got the XL and it 's a good size and easy to get off or on but looks like it might tear eventually.Not sure how long they will last , but at the price , I hope for 12 years at least . Stiching wear/tear might be an issue . Waterproof is an issue for me since I need protection from the cold , wet , wind.Update
 I ordered these socks thinking they would be waterproof . Once I received them , i put them on and dipped my foot in water . To my dismay , my foot was wet . I tried to return them but there was a restocking fee of $ 10 . I paid $ 22 . So you get back only half the money .
 I work as a grip on movies rain , snow , sleet , and shine . I used these for 1 , 12 + hour work day that just so happened to be a rainy one . These supposed wasterproof socks did not hold up within 5 minutes of down pour . My feet were soaked the entire day and man was it miserable ! The seams are just a single stich so I 'm not sure how Serius expected these to last . Do n't waste your money ! In terms of waterproofing for the outdoors , the best thing is to buy Gore Tex boots that rise above the ankle . I 've tried everything and this is the only resolution to this problem in my experience .
 I have put on these socks and walked during the rain to check . Both of them were full of water . At some level of rain it does not work very well .
 I had to return these as they were not flexible enough to fit over my high arch on my feet . They were also much thinner than I thought they would be . Just did not work for my application where I needed thermal protection against cold lake water .

The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them . I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves -LRB- great color choices -RRB- Now I 'm glad I only lost money on one pair . Regretfully , I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini .
 This bra is comfortable , however , not very supportive . I would use this bra for walking and weight lifting . I do not recommend this bra for running or any high intensity sports .
 Did not like this bra . I was looking for support without squashing , but found it to be too bulky overall and did not fit well in the cup size . I returned it for a refund . Straps were comfortable , but overall the underwire area was too bulky and uncomfortable .
 while it is a quality coat and my husband is OK with it ... I specifically looked for a NON-BELTED RAINCOAT ... there were reviews about the `` no-belt '' coat and everything ... YET ... the coat most certainly has a belt ... I will not order clothing again , I 'm afraid ...
 Very dissatisfied with product . They are cut very short in the rise and if one has a belly of any size they will not stay up .
 I really liked the strap latch , but it was way too small . I ordered 3 bra 's from this company and all 3 were too small . I ordered another one from a different brand and company that was the same size and it fit just fine . The company called and was very nice asking to change a color that they ran out of . So that was something , but I was not impressed with the bras .
 It seemed to be well-made but it was not labeled correctly , because it fit like a B cup rather than an E.I should have listened to the other reviews .
 This was n't even close to the size ordered . It was at least 2 cup sizes smaller than indicated . I barely fit into this , my pre-pregnancy bras fit better than this one does . I do n't like that it has no under wire . At the size ordered under wire would be very beneficial , however , the description did indicate that there was no under wire on this bra . I would not order another bra from this manufacturer .
 I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their customer service , and the quality of their product . I received a pair of gloves as a Christmas gift , and after light wear for about a week - the gloves looked weeks old . They were discolored and the leather had begun to crack . After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period .

 So silly me I read the other reviews that this product was n't good but I figured for the price I 'd try it since I was n't looking for a dramatic decrease in my waist line . Ever siller is that I purchased both the medium and large since I was n't really sure which size to get and Amazon had a package deal so I only paid $ 12.99 for both . Did n't seem like a big deal . Honestly it 's not about the money . The fact that neither the Meduim or the Large proved to `` Trim my Tummy '' proves that this product is garbage . It did nothing maybe just a little shaping so that the love handles did n't look so unflattering . The one good thing about this product is that it does n't have bones like most shapers , which if you have tried you know that after a while it starts digging into your sides and makes it very uncomfortable to wear . This product is very comfortable however it does nothing to trim your tummy like the name suggests . I 'm not stupid I knew that I would n't look like the model but I thought that it would provide some difference . None what so ever . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & SAVE YOURSELF THE FRUSTRATION .
 I bought this with the hope that it would just hide the `` Muffin Top '' and love handles i had . The problem with this product is that it rolls up everytime you try to sit . I was having to readjust it all day long . I would reccommend purchasing a one piece tummy trimmer that you wear like a bathing suit . I threw this in the trash !
 You have to struggle and pull this on over your hips and butt to get it over your tummy . Cheap material that doesnt even hold you in ! I wore it once and put it in the trash after .
 This product is not like they described on TV , it 's not supportive , but I guess thats what you get for it being so cheap !
 Do n't buy this . Hard to put on and does n't really hide anything . Waste of money .
 This was not worth buying . I am sorry I bothered to spend any money on it at all , i would recommend trying a different product instead -LRB- which one I do n't know since now I kind of think it may be that none of them really work which makes me glad I decided to start excerising instead -RRB- .

 The dress could be quite stunning but is not made with usable proportions . The band that goes around the waist is exxtremely small while the rest of the dress fits nicely . I am a petite 5 ' 5 weighing 115 lbs and the waist is uncomfortably tight on me . I am having it altered .

 Very thin , no tummy control at ALL . Lace is `` itchy `` and the worst part is they run WAY to big!Size 5 is more like size 7 !
 I ordered this product because it was supposed to be for a 40 inch waist.However its really only 32-33 inches long . How Squeem marks their products is a mystery . But it is not by any method I know of . I bought an earlier item from the Squeem product line , and it was too big . It seems they just put any old size number on whatever comes down the assembly line , regardless of what it is . Buyer beware with this companies products ... they are good quality ; but its anyone guess what size you will get.By the way

 I ordered this because I was attending the Barbarian themed weekend at the Renaissance Festival . It did not fit correctly and ripped when I tried to tie it . Had to return to Amazon
 I love this bag for its storage , lightness and look . The straps sit well on my shoulder and it is very comfortable to carry . I have been using it for LESS THAN a month -LRB- got it for Christmas -RRB- and today when I went to pick it up - the metal buckle that holds the handle to the bag snapped . I do n't carry anything but a laptop and my ipad in it so I know i did not over load the bag . Seriously disappointed .
 This jean I expected a different color and as it says on the ad , it 's not low rise at all .
 we ordered this on the 18th and have just been told that it will not arrive until well after christmas . delivery information is misleading and their customer service is essentially nonexistant -LRB- and uncaring -RRB- so there 's no way we can modify our order.do you want to give a company like that your business ?
 This is an ok bag but the `` Heavyweight Canvas '' is a very loose weave , that is to say it wont hold back anything stronger than a light fog and wont suffer much abuse . The lining is 3rd rate thinner than paper nylon . In short a good bag if you are buying for fashion , a poor choice if you are actually going to use it . Look out for inflated shipping costs .
 I was happy with the color but disappointed that is wrinkles so easily . So , I Would not order again . Might use it for housework
 I 'm not saying that everyone in the world needs to know everything about Trinidad and Tobago but if you 're going to try to make money from us at least spell `` Trinidad '' correctly -LRB- Check out the picture of the T shirt -RRB- . Unless of course I 've missed out on a spelling change for the World Cup ?
 Amazon , unless this is another country , Trinidad is spelt with two i 's not three ! Please do not sell or support vendors that sell products below Amazon 's standards ! I almost bought one were it not for DouglasinLondon 's review !
 Pull this product off of Amazon . Trinidad is spelt incorrectly on this T-shirt .

 ordered this and was not the right size as stated and the material is garbage wouldnt recommend to anyone . . returned it for refund and still have not recieved credit back to account for over a month . i would never but this again ... buyer beware
 I ordered the camo mini in a large size for women and it is more like junior sizing . Will keep it becos I do n't to hassle with a return for one item .
 These t shirts are a real let down . For so long I have been a Hanes fan , until now . The shirts do not feel comfortable after washing , the fit is binding . The sleeves and bottom curl up , and to make matters worse , they sewed a white tag on the bottom , so when it curls up , the tag is exposed . I have ordered several Russell Atheletic t shirts that have a higher custormer rating . They should arrive soon .
 They switched out the order . This is clearly a short sleeved tshirt but they sent me two sleeveless shirts . What 's up with that ?
 I ordered a 3X t-shirt that turned out to be the size of a large ! The price was great . It was n't worth mailing back so will give it to a smaller person for a present .
 I bought two of them , in Large size , but when I opened the package i see two super xtra wide tshirts that says `` LARGE '' . I hate it . The colors is worst , different than the images that you see in Amazon .
 I ordered 7 of these shirts for my husband , and only 3 of them were 100 % cotton .
 My husband likes a tighter neck and this was quite loose . Also the ones I got were very lightweight by comparison to onehe already had which was quite heavy and the neck was snugger .
 I thought I was ordering a poly/cotton blend and it 's not . It is a 100 % cotton , thinly made , very short t-shirt .
 Sure its your average shirt , maybe I got unlucky . I washed mine once and the thread started to unravel on the bottom seam .
 I have worn Russell Tee shirts for years and found them to be well made from a fairly heavy material and they always lasted years . The `` Russell '' Tee shirts I recently purchased via Amazon , were cheaply made of a thin material that looks horrible after 1 or 2 washings . The shirts have the Russell name on them but they are like a cheap imitation .
 Having purchased both , it is well worth the extra five dollars or so for the cotton performance tee . The performance tee is soft and comfortable . The basic tee is unpleasant .
 The material is really bad and it does n't fit good . The sleeve are too big and it is short and is really no good . Do n't buy it ! WASTED MONEY
 First of all , UPS delivered a previous Amazon order to someone else other than my brother and it never showed up . I had ordered a sleep set for my brother and his wife . They stayed home waiting for the package that never came . I had especially wanted my sister in law to have the products that I ordered . That was a bummer . So I called Amazon and said that they were out of what I had ordered for her but they would send me another set for my brother . Well , UPS delivered it to the wrong address again to a neighbor . The neighbor opened it and then decided to take it to my brother several days after it was shipped . Well , the shirt I ordered was supposed to be Xlarge . The box his neighbor brought over several days after it was shipped contained a 2X shirt -LRB- I orderXL -RRB- . What happened Amazon ? Think you need to change from UPS to a company that can find the correct addresses . Very upset about all of this .
 I ordered these because they are cotton/poly blend . The three shirts I received are 100 % cotton . I am not a happy camper .
 Not as heavy as I 'd like , and not very good to wear under a dress shirt -LRB- logo is too prominent , and the sleeves are longer than a short-sleeve dress shirt -RRB- . To wear as your only shirt , it 's definitely not as heavy-duty . I got a great sale price on them , so it 's a fair deal ...
 Hi there , I still hav n't recieved this order . Please could you follow as to where it is . Thanks very much .
 You get what you pay for with these shirts . If only Russell had invested more money in quality instead of their fancy sleeve logo and lousy stamped neck tags . These shirts are 2 '' shorter than other T-shirts I own and thinner in quality . They wrinkle worse after drying than my other shirts . Overall , not terrible but was expecting better based upon the reviews here .
 Disappointing . The seller needs to do a better job of letting the customers know that the T-shirts sold on the same page are not all the same material . I wanted 100 % cotton . Two shirts were , the two others were cotton/poly blends . I also wanted size medium . The tent-like proportions of their mediums are ridiculous . It 's at least a size large , edging towards XL . They 're cheap so I 'm keeping them but I wo n't be buying this brand again .
 I wash all of our clothes in cold water to avoid shrinkage , but after a few washes this shirt lost a couple of inches and looks ridiculous .
 Russell made nice 100 % cotton t-shirts at one time.Not so anymore.This 100 % cotton tee that it claims to be is the thinnest tee I ever purchased.Fits lousy too.I attribute this to products being made in other countries instead of the USA.As long as corporate America keeps exporting jobs to people who do n't care about quality and cutting back on solid material to make the product this is what you get.I will never purchase the brand Russell again , period !
 I ordered this shirt in size 2XL , which is my normal t-shirt size . The shirt was 2XL , but was HUGE . Soft material , but so big it is awkward to wear . Very long for its size as well .
 these tee shirts just do n't seem the same quality as the Russell tees you buy at Sears , etc. . I bought them here because I am 6 ' 3 and it is hard to find the tall ones in the stores . These are too long - down below your butt . And the necks feel too tight . I would n't buy again .
 I 've worn Russell shirts for years and my last two are showing their age and need to be replaced . Unfortunately these shirts were not up to the quality of my past shirts . These shirts were made with a much thinner cheaper feeling cotton fabric and it did n't like it would stand up to the rugged beating my current shirts have taken over the years . Very disappointing , and I returned them . If only I could find the same type of Russel shirts as I 've purchased in the past .
 These are not the thick Russell T-shirts that I originally had and expected to get . Instead these are much lighter and a longer size . Very disappointed . I would return them but not sure how to order the thicker T-shirts that I was really looking for . If anyone knows please let me know !
 The shirt is ok for the price . I would not purchase it as a great quality shirt ! So that is what you are looking for do n't hesitate in purchasing it !
 If you 're looking for the good , thick Russell Athletic T-shirts , do not waste your time with these . These are not them . I have a drawer full of R.A. T shirts , they 're getting old . I wanted to replace some of them . I researched as best I could before buying these through Amazon.com . They came today . They 're no better than the run-of-the-mill , thin , budget T-shirts that you can buy at Walmart . I 'm sending the three I bought back .
 The most important thing about a cotton tee is that it NOT shrink in the vertical.Russel tee 's did n't used to and that 's why I buy them.This latest batch pretty much joins the pantheon of cheap crappy tee shirts that after the first wash are unwearable because they shrink until they do n't tuck into my pants and get so wide in the body they feel like wearing very short tent.Guess I 'm looking for a new brand .
 I have been buying Russell tees for years and they had the best High Quality thick cotton tee shirt for any price around . This is a company that has lost its way . I was very disappointed in this tee shirt and would not buy another one . Very thin !! Do not waste your money.Does anybody make a thick 100 % cotton tee shirt anymore ?
 Cloth was kind of rough to the feel so I washed it and it shrunk to a shorter size , so badly I will be sending it back
 Very dissatisfied with product . They are cut very short in the rise and if one has a belly of any size they will not stay up .
 The headband broke on most of the halos the first time the girls put them on and there were even a few that came broke . Disappointed .
 When puchasing halloween costumes I do n't expect much . . but I do expect something a little better than this . It 's made of the worst , itchiest , wrinkle filled material . There is not an ounce of stretch to the material so it looks like you 're wearing a brown paper bag and the sleeves and bottom do n't even have a finished edge . So imagine cutting felt like material and then wearing it as a turtleneck .
 This product SUCKS ! It was not the same pattern . SIZE is very deceiving . U have to b 300 lbs to wear this outfit . Anyone a size 18 and down and under 5/5 , DO NOT PURCHASE . Also , this iteam was to be shipped in 1 day and it did not arrive until 4 days later . I was charged for next day delivery and I am still waiting for my refund 10 days in .
 Very dissatisfied with product . They are cut very short in the rise and if one has a belly of any size they will not stay up .
 I needed a Jamaican winter hat so got this one . I do n't like it at all . I thought the yellow stripe was the same as the flag colour so to me it throws off the whole thing .
 Rolls up in the front and pulls up in the back so that I have to keep pulling it down . Also , the shoulder straps sit too wide on my shoulders and keep falling . When will bra makers realize that `` full figure '' DOES NOT mean the woman has the shoulders of a linebacker ? This bra is irritating .
 I was looking for good support that also provided a nice shape , so I ordered the Playtex Women 's 18 Hour Airform Comfort Lace Bra . Unfortunately , this bra did n't stretch to my shape nor provide a nice bust shape . It was too tight around my rib cage -LRB- I was expecting it to stretch more -RRB- and forced my breasts into a strange pointy shape , flattening them across the top and mashing me down in the middle . I did n't need a minimizer bra , but it would be great for that purpose . I cut off the non-stretchable lace on the front surface , leaving only the stretchable material underneath and it was tolerable that way , but I would not order it again .
 The name of this bra is a contradiction . Not comfortable , gave me an extra breast and made them sag .
 I had to return this bra because it was so small that I could barely get it on . The straps were adjustable but very inflexible . It 's also very stiff and non-stretchy . I was looking for something really comfortable and this definitely was n't for me .
 The last time I was at my mom 's she had just bought one of these . It looked very comfortable and pretty so I ordered one in my size . I wear a 34D in other brands , but Playtex does n't carry that size , so I buy a 36D and wear it on the tightest hooks . This band seems to run small , the 36 fit me like a 34 in other brands , I could wear it on the last hooks . The cups , on the other hand , run big . The foam lining also makes them a little stiff and pointy , so under a t-shirt it looked like my breasts were aiming off to each side , really not flattering ! A very odd fit , which is too bad because it seems like a comfortable bra .
 I bought this bra in a pinch on a trip to the in-laws . I thought I could use it as a sleeping bra , hahaha . I bought the size I have been measured . It lifts great but the seem over the nipples itches.It made them poke out like a Madonna video . Are you kidding ? I did n't know they still made bras like this . My husband asked was I going to leave the bedroom like that with the material protruding out like missiles ? The cost of the bra w/o tax was $ 20.50 , ca n't Playtex make a more flattering bra for this price . I believed they used the same stitch pattern from the 20 's . . I do n't think they used female fit models .
 this one ok so far ... last one the hook in the back came out of bra and twisted . . so ca n't wear bra . .
 The sizing on these is way off . Not even close . They run large , compared with other Playtex bras . I think I even went a size or too smaller than usual , after reading other reviews , and they were still too big -LRB- & super pointy ! yuk -RRB- . Do yourself a favor & try these in a store first . Thank you Amazon for free shipping & return on this product ! Make sure if you DO order this , that you choose one with the free return policy , because you 're going to need it !
 I had to return , the lace was bothering to me and the cup size was more Madonna and me ... Amazon was great , quick return and I bought another 18 hour smooth which I love .
 I bought several bras recently to accommodate my growing body -LRB- I 'm 5 months pregnant -RRB- . I 'm usually a strict Victoria 's Secret shopper but did n't want to spend a fortune for `` maternity '' periods . This bra was a disappointment . It 's bigger than the Playtex bras I 've bought in the same size . It 's MASSIVE so I have to be careful what I wear over it as you may see some of the massive panel/cup , and it 's just plain uncomfortable . The band at the bottom cuts into my skin and starts to fold over and bend . Maybe I 'm just too used to wearing underwire that I ca n't handle the method of `` support '' of non-underwire bras . Either way , I would n't recommend this one . Go with the Playtex Women 's Side Smoothing Underwire Bra or the Playtex Women 's 18 Hour Active Lifestyle ... those are much more comfortable .
 My bra is a C cup , I am a D cup -LRB- I buy smaller to hold em in better -RRB- , and the cup of this bra is too big for some reason .
 This bra looks comfortable in the catalog . It is not ! The cups are like cardboard , and the sides do n't stretch . I would never buy another one .
 Cups too large . Fabric is too stiff and upper part creeps too far into the armpit , making it not too comfy . The support is okay even w/o a wire , but the other issues negate that fact . Also , it does NOT put your pair into the best shape/silhouette for under clothing . I 'd skip this bra but if you must , I 'd suggest ordering your normal band size but 1 cup smaller . And then I 'd only wear it for around the house , not under clothes .
 I received this bra and was very disappointed . The fit is awful , the seam that crosses the cup does n't lay correctly and it 's just ugly on your body.Generally I like playtex bras for everyday wear , but this one is just awful .
 This bra is itchy in between the breasts and underneath . It also looks like a fifties torpedo bra . I feel uncomfortable and self conscious when I wear it and I doubt that I 'll ever buy a Platex bra again .
 The bra is really pretty but the fit is not right . The cup size is larger than normal and the placement of the cups are too close together .
 I can usually find something good to say about most products , but not this bra . I ordered my regular size , and the fit is way off . The band is too tight , the cups are too large . Not only are they large , but they 're too pointy . I 'm not a fan of cone-shaped boobs that stick out in opposite directions . If you decide to order this , I would consider going up a band size and down a cup size . Then again , I just would n't order it .
 Shirt was not the same length as the other 14-16 size shirts of this type that my granddaughter has . Somewhat shorter and does n't stay tucked in as she would like .
 I bought this costume to wear for a school event , I am a teacher and thought it would look cute . I am very disappointed in the look of the costume compared to how it looks in the picture . The picture online makes the red bow look very big and appears to stick out from the material . Not so . It is made of paper-thin material that is sewn down to the costume . It looks cheap and tacky . The hat is much too tall and does not stand up . I also think it is silly that the white gloves are not included , you have to buy them separatly . I am strongly considering sending this back and finding something else to wear for school .
 Ad clearly states `` Made in USA '' . You can imagine my disappointment when I received the shorts and the tag on them says `` Made in China '' . The shorts were promptly returned .
 FIRST OFF THE SELLER WAS GREAT AND REFUNDED OUR MONEY RIGHT AWAYTHAT HAVING BEEN SAID THESE THINGS SMELLED LIKE DIESEL OR SOMETHING THEY ALSO HAD REALLY BIG BUTTONS ON THE FLY NO ONE MENTIONED THAT IN THE DESCRIPTION OR I DID NOT SEE IT
 Very dissatisfied with product . They are cut very short in the rise and if one has a belly of any size they will not stay up .
 I guess for the price this is what I should have expected . It was cheap plastic material . And the shoulders were so wide on it . Did n't even use it . I ended up buying a new one .
 The product description says `` TAFFETA '' and when I received the cape -LRB- 1 day later than the tracking promised -RRB- the cape was VINYL.It is thicker than my rain coat . I would have dealt with it if the fabric were not taffeta , but a flowing material , but it is very rubbery and stiff and has creases from folding that I can not iron out since I ca n't iron vinyl . Also , the red and the black colors are not vibrant or bold -LRB- as the picture indicates -RRB- at all because of the shininess of the vinyl . This item would be great for anyone that wants to be Dracula in the rain , but not for me . I wish somewhere in the description or picture I could see how rubbery and stiff the cape actually was .
 Very dissatisfied with product . They are cut very short in the rise and if one has a belly of any size they will not stay up .
 The product was sent to me in terrible condition . Not due to packaging issues , but there were threads hanging off the ends of the fingers as if someone cut them off and called them fingerless . Had a hole in the middle of one of the fingers . Scared that if I wear them , they 'll fall apart on me . Absolutely terrible !!!
 The quality is pretty poor on these . They are thread bare in the thumb area and the hem on the finger part is n't solid so there is already fraying . You get what you pay for . It 's not worth the effort of returning them since they were so inexpensive to begin with .
 I got a pair of these for 3.55 . They were cheap and it shows . 3 of the finger holes have stray threads hanging out . One glove had a half-inch hole between the thumb and first finger when I took it out of the bag . I 'm quite disappointed .
 Not worth ordering online . Go to a discount store and find the same thing and you wo n't have to pay for shipping . Which , by the way , was double the price of the gloves .
 The gloves I recieved had yarn sticking out from 3 out of the 5 fingers on each glove . Within two weeks it started to become undone and the strings got caught on things.For the amount I paid I guess I got what I paid for .
 As others have said , these fray quite a bit , even after the first use . i worked in a warehouse typing away all day on a computer , so i preferred to have fingerless gloves . They are comfortable , but obviously not very warm as they are essentially the same as any dollar-store gloves.Save some money on shipping and just buy these locally . I still have my original pair , somewhere , but i doubt i 'll use them again
 I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type -- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures . These gloves seeemed perfect -- because many fingerless gloves - do n't have fingerless thumbs -- but these gloves do . The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves . I ordered the black pair . Well , the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing - there are many stray strands at the fingers -- they snag easily . They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily . But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it 's a case of you get what you pay for .
 Both thumbs had small rips at the base and the fingers had threads that were already unravelling . Spend a little more for better quality .
 The product was rich in color but the quality is horrendous.The lace that comes with it is sturdy but the holes to put this lace through are flimsy.It fits nicely but not one of my preferred investments.Do not recommend this item at all .
 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 might be OK if it did n't roll down from the waist all the way down ! Under your clothes ! not good
 Very dissatisfied with product . They are cut very short in the rise and if one has a belly of any size they will not stay up .
 This jean I expected a different color and as it says on the ad , it 's not low rise at all .
 I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their customer service , and the quality of their product . I received a pair of gloves as a Christmas gift , and after light wear for about a week - the gloves looked weeks old . They were discolored and the leather had begun to crack . After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period . Their reason for refusing to exchange the gloves is the exact reason for my wish to exchange them!Leather Gloves Online has officially lost a customer .
 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them . I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves -LRB- great color choices -RRB- Now I 'm glad I only lost money on one pair . Regretfully , I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini .

 One star is too many , absolutely the worst quality I 've ever seen ! Showed significant wear in heel area after 2 days . Also sheds inside and leaves your feet filthy with fibers . Total ripoff !!
 I have been purchasing primarily Gold Toe socks for some time now as I found their quality to be better than their competitors . However , I have come to question that with my recent experience with these socks . I purchased two supposedly identical packs of socks , and yet the socks in one pack are a full 2.5 '' shorter than the socks in the other pack . The labels on the pack are the same , and both sets are clearly the Nassau design -LRB- same cotton and weaving -RRB- . Maybe they were short on cotton one day . It unfortunately make sorting socks when doing laundry even more of a pain . I contacted the company and they wanted me to ship both sets of socks to them at my expense so they could inspect them to decide whether I deserved a replacement.Even worse , these socks showed significant wear and pilling after only one use , which is not something I would have expected from Gold Toe socks .
 But the sleeves are unusually short . I did finally get my return authorization after 2 weeks & a bad review .

 I 've noticed that Jos A Bank Sweaters are always paired in such a way that there 's ambiguity in what exact pattern of sweater one is ordering . You like one pattern but when you order you get the other one on the ad that apparently does n't move as well business-wise . I got burned once , last year . They count on folks not sending the items back . They are deceptive advertisers , at least for sweaters ! Potential buyers beware ! This particular ad is a classic example .

 I agree with the previous reviewer . This is way too green to be called teal . And it does n't even match the image color , which would have been ideal .
 Not good advertised that the sock were 27 inches . They are not . It is absolutely necessary that my husband has very long tube socks . He has braces on both legs . These were not as long as advertised . Waste of money for me .
 I needed socks that are actually over the calf . I have some old tube socks that fit like that and from the tip of the toe to the hem , they 're 28 inches . I did n't even have to try these on to see they were too short but I measured them anyway and they 're only 23 inches . I 'll have to give them to my nephew .
 The socks are very lightweight , probably would be ok for summer use but not for work or books . They were just ok . I would not purchase again
 These socks kept sliding down the first day they were worn . They 're not worth buying .
 Got these because of the reviews but as it turns out the socks are too short . I wear a size 12 and they are too short for over the calf
 The socks are good quality but only reach over ankle , might reach over the calf for a very short person .
 My last over the calf sox where bought at Wal-Mart about 3 or 4 years ago . Just some off brand , not hanes or FTL or anything like that . A 6 pack has lasted me a good long time . The heels started to rip recently in most of those so I decided to throw them away and get new ones . These Hanes on Amazon looked like the perfect sock for the perfect price . FIRST WEAR THE HEELS SPLIT ! again ... FIRST WEAR THE HEELS SPLIT !!!!!
 The material got stiff after the first wash . Not what I had hoped for . Was hoping for something more flexible .
 They are over the calf , at least for the first 10 min . Fabric is very thin and cheap . I 'm figuring these socks will last 6 months . If you bleach your whites , possibly only 3 months .
 I needed some socks to stay up and not fall into the abyss of my boots . These did not even come close . I was still getting ready to leave and these were rolled up around my ankles .
 I was looking for tube socks , which no on seems to sell any more . I like the ones that are over the calf and although most advertise that they are , they are n't and this one was no different . Half way up the calf . It was n't was I was looking for or promised from the advertisement as usual .
 The body of the socks is thin . The elastic top small . They are not long enough ; they come to mid - calf . The worse part is the do not stay up .
 Hanes briefs are fine , okay , good.Hanes sports socks are barely worth one-star . The crew socks fall down and wear out , 1-2 , bang , bang . The over-the-calf-socks generally stay up , but barely last one wearing . Okay , rough heels
 I bought a package of these tube socks for my husband within the past couple months and they 've already worn holes in the heels . I 've bought this same type and brand of socks before and they 've usually lasted a year or more , but these have started wearing holes in them within a couple weeks . It 's like the knitting comes undone and forms holes in the stress points . Usually you have to wear through them . Anyway , I 'm not pleased with them and very hesitant to try even buying them locally now . Very disappointing .
 you buy hanes socks you will be buying again in two months because there will be holes in the heels .
 6-Pack Hanes Over-the-Calf Tube 180/6 10/15 in WhiteThey said they do not carry this size and sent 6/12 instead which there was no way I could wear . They argued with me over the sizing saying they were the same sizes and that the small size is what I ordered . After going back and forth via e-mails for a while they accepted them back and refunded my money .
 Socks did n't hold up after a couple of washing cycles . Must continually pull up to keep above my boot tops .
 I like the shirt and it 's design , but unfortunately the latex print is starting to seperate after only a few washes . I would recommend finding one that has a better quality print .
 I love BB products , one could say i 'm even a fan , but this item is of cheap quality , overpriced and not very practical . You are truly better served with a usual bib over the carrier side ! It 's made of very thin and sort of worn-out cloth , which stops as much drool as a sieve would . The bib itself sort of fits the carrier , but not really . The baby moves , the bib moves with her . You take the baby out of the carrier , the bib comes along . You end up constantly adjusting it and you better hope your baby does n't start playing with it . It 's also very expensive for the quality it provides , so i 'm disappointed in my purchase .
 Not wild about the Synergy carrier and definitely do n't like these bibs that are supposed to go with it . The thinness of the material is a non-issue beacuse , they do have a non-permeable membrane to keep the drool from penetrating to the carrier , but a simple -LRB- and more cost-effective -RRB- plastic lined bib will do the same job . I do n't like these overpriced bibs beacuse they fall off every time you put your baby in or take your baby out of the carrier . I hate to pay for something that is suppose to make your life easier and only proves to provide more frustration . I have found that a simple , plastic-lined -LRB- or not -RRB- baby bib works better for my baby in -LRB- and out of -RRB- the carrier and costs much less !
 I was disappointed that this did n't fit my active bjorn better . It also has a rough feel to it . It honestly works better just to put him in a bib and then tuck it into the front .
 this product has got black bits of towel/terry falling off right out of its packaging . i had to be picking up all the bits . . everywhere . on the carrier and even on my baby too.I wonder if it only happens for black ?
 Wayyyy over priced ! Should have just used a cloth diaper tucked in . Material is kinda rough . Small and skimpy . But does do the job . Would n't purchase again . Two does come in a pack , but for $ 16 it should be 6 !
 The material is so hard it rashes baby 's cheeks . It often gets dropped from the carrier.Doesn ' t worth the money spend . A normal bib will do better than what this does .
 Every single time I unlatch the carrier , this thing falls off . I 've had to use a safety pin to hold it in place , which means I might as well just safety pin a burp cloth to the carrier . Oh , but that would cover up the BabyBj&ouml;rn logo . We would n't want that !
 Thin fabric . Pain in the neck to keep in place . Have to reposition or replace every time you take the carrier off . Better just to use a burp cloth .
 I rarely used these you can just wash the baby bjorn when it is dirty and dont really need to spend your money on these .
 not super easy to put on with the baby in it and they fall of while you 're putting the baby in it if you try to put it on before ... not really necessary
 I regret this purchase . These things are annoying to use - they are kind of hard to put on and always fall off when I put a baby in or take them out . I just end up sticking a burp cloth between the baby 's face and my shirt .
 my kid loves to suck on the bjorn . I guess alot of kids do and that 's why baby bjorn made this bib and decided to charge $ 8 a piece for a terry cloth . Their marketing team must be pretty smart since they figured out there will be parents willing to spend that money to decorate their baby carrier ... So it 's a thin piece of terry cloth , just as thin as the cheapest burp cloths you can buy in bulk . The reason we bought these is because we 're doting first time parents who spend money on the top of the line baby items -LRB- orbit baby , etc. . . -RRB- and as a dad who is wrapped around the pinky of my daughter I thought a pink bib would be cute . We also bought the bibs since she sucks on the bjorn and we did try putting a burp rag between her and the bjorn , only to have it fall out . Well , I lost one of the bjorn bibs in a parking lot , it fell off when i removed the bjorn . Go figure .
 I was very excited to get the pink bibs for our baby bjorn comfort carrier . I ordered these because it states that they fit ALL bjorn carriers . As soon as I received it there was big bold print across the front that says `` Does NOT fit Comfort Carrier '' . I 'm wondering why that is not shown in the advertisement for this item ? I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who has made this mistake . Now having to ship it back and go through the return process AND purchase a new one . Waste of my time .
 Fortunately , we did not pay a lot for the actual Bjorn carrier as it was a hand me down . But with a baby that loves to suck on the red -LRB- and fading fast -RRB- bib , I thought this would be a great purchase . Not so . Its fit is less than perfect . It 's thinner than paper , and it constantly falls off - EVERY TIME you take the baby in/out . Really , I could have just lived with the fading .
 I was hoping that these would be thicker . They 're super thin ... much thinner than a cheap hotel washcloth . I think I 'll be better off folding a burp cloth over the Bjorn front flap so our little one can chew on it without the saliva soaking through . I was expecting the bibs to be more substantial than this , especially for the price .
 I recently ordered this item along with the Baby Bjorn Comfort Carrier . The bib product description states that it fits all Baby Bjorn carriers . Amazon , please update your product description . It clearly states on the outside of the bib product packaging that it DOES NOT fit the Comfort Carrier . I ca n't honestly review this product because I was not able to use it , but I wanted to get the attention of others with the 1-star rating . BUYER BEWARE !
 I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their customer service , and the quality of their product . I received a pair of gloves as a Christmas gift , and after light wear for about a week - the gloves looked weeks old . They were discolored and the leather had begun to crack . After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period . Their reason for refusing to exchange the gloves is the exact reason for my wish to exchange them!Leather Gloves Online has officially lost a customer .
 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them . I had originally planned to purchase 3 pairs of leather gloves -LRB- great color choices -RRB- Now I 'm glad I only lost money on one pair . Regretfully , I would not consider future purchases from Fratelli Orsini .

 Shorts seemed OK initially , but on the 2nd wearing the zipper pull tab fell off . Unfortunately for me , I did n't get around to wearing them until just outside the return window .
 I purchases 6 items for my first Amazon purchase all other items perfect . My dickie 36 inch short are not 36 inch . I think they are 38 inch . I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same . It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off .

 I would not recommend these pants . I ordered the mediums -LRB- based on other reviews -RRB- . The waist fit pretty snug , but the length was whacked . I estimate they were 33 '' inseams . Could not be hemmed because the pockets would be at knees and the knee pads would be at my shins . Bottom line , these are cheaply made pants . I would -LRB- and will -RRB- spend the few extra $ and get Propers or 5.11 's .

 I ordered the biggest size and yet the shirt was so short the sleeves barely made it past my elbows . The bottoms were a different story they were long enough to pull up almost to my arm-pits . If you regularly need a `` long '' size then defiantly pass on these !
 And on the Amazon website , the product description says can be machine washed , but the label says hand wash only .
 Bought these for my husband last year . He 's worn them a few times , likes the feel . Unfortunatly I got him red -LRB- go Rutgers ! -RRB- and when he wears them he ends up with a nice pink pair of underwear . I 'd think for the money they would n't bleed .
 The Buttons are in the way and take up half the wallets interior . The emblem looks like a poor after thought stay away from this garbage .

 On 11/29/2011 , I ordered 5 Dickies brand work-shirts for myself from The Fashion Rack . I received an email on 12/1/2011 that the order had shipped , and I received the package on 12/10/2011 . Unfortunately , the package only contained 3 shirts and not the 5 I had ordered . I checked the packing slip , and it showed that 5 shirts had been shipped . I tried to call Customer Service at the numbers listed , but no one ever answered . After 2 days -LRB- 12/12/2011 -RRB- , I sent an email and received a reply that The Fashion Rack would be sending the 2 outstanding shirts the next day , and offering to refund my shipping costs . I replied that I just needed the shirts , and refunding the shipping costs was not necessary.On 12/26/2011 , I sent another email as I had not received shirts or an email that they had been shipped . I received a reply the next day that the order had shipped from their warehouse on 12/14/2011 , and that The Fashion Rack was checking with FedEx to find out where the package was . According to their email `` an investigation of this nature takes 2-3 business days to be completed . '' This time , they offered to cancel the entire order and refund the cost , and I again declined . I asked for the FedEx tracking number , but never received one.On 1/5/2012 , I sent an email as I had n't heard from The Fashion Rack , and again asked for the FedEx tracking number . They replied that they had sent me an email on 12/30/2011 which explained that they had checked with FedEx , and unfortunately the package was `` lost in transit '' . No tracking number was provided . Again , they offered to cancel the order and issue a full refund , or ship the outstanding part of my order . I replied -LRB- again -RRB- that a refund was n't necessary , and that I just needed the shirts . On 1/10/2012 , I finally received the last part of this order.I have ordered dozens of products from Amazon.com , and this is the only order that has ever been a problem . The shirts were fine and just what I expected , but the amount of time it took and the hassle of ordering from The Fashion Rack has soured me on this particular company . I wo n't be back , and I hope they realize they lost thousands in follow-up business .
 The shirts are Dickie and that is always a five star product , but the description was 2-pk long sleeve work shirt , which I took as 2-pack ... and thought I just happened upon a truly good deal when the sale price of just over $ 14 popped up , but then it had $ 10 shipping when I ordered 2 items , so when I got the order for 2x2pk and only had 2 shirts , I ended up paying $ 19 per shirt . I think it is a deliberate misleading product description .
 I wear these shirts for my job -LRB- they are given to us , and must be tucked in when worn -RRB- and I would love to meet the person who decided these were long enough to be tucked in and that the enormous fit around the stomach area was appropriate . They come untucked way too easily and the bunched up look in the waist when tucked in is unavoidable unless you 're very fat ... it looks sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer fit or athletic fit and with a longer tail I would buy a lot of them .
 The sizing was wrong . Normally wear a Medium shirt but this was way too big , and once you try it on you ca n't return it . stiff and uncomfortable material .
 I ordered the biggest size and yet the shirt was so short the sleeves barely made it past my elbows . The bottoms were a different story they were long enough to pull up almost to my arm-pits . If you regularly need a `` long '' size then defiantly pass on these !

 I ordered the biggest size and yet the shirt was so short the sleeves barely made it past my elbows . The bottoms were a different story they were long enough to pull up almost to my arm-pits . If you regularly need a `` long '' size then defiantly pass on these !
 And on the Amazon website , the product description says can be machine washed , but the label says hand wash only .
 Bought these for my husband last year . He 's worn them a few times , likes the feel . Unfortunatly I got him red -LRB- go Rutgers ! -RRB- and when he wears them he ends up with a nice pink pair of underwear . I 'd think for the money they would n't bleed .
 I like the shirt and it 's design , but unfortunately the latex print is starting to seperate after only a few washes . I would recommend finding one that has a better quality print .

 I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their customer service , and the quality of their product . I received a pair of gloves as a Christmas gift , and after light wear for about a week - the gloves looked weeks old . They were discolored and the leather had begun to crack . After reading about their company 's self proclaimed ease of return and exchanges , as well as their commitment to quality , I wrongly assumed I would have no problem exchanging these gloves for a replacement pair.I sent an initial email inquiry about how to return these gloves January 4th , and did not receive the merchandise return label until January 18th . For a company with a time limit on returns and exchanges , it seems clear that they are trying to make it so that customers miss the imposed deadline . Furthermore , as I had previously explained - these gloves were received as a Christmas gift , December 25th , and therefore should have been accepted as returned within the time period . Though they may have been purchased `` 3 1/2 '' months ago , I , the wearer , did not receive them at that time . The company sighted this as a reason for exchange refusal.All of this is nothing compared with the complete lack of respect in the return letter enclosed with my gloves after their refusal to exchange . The hand written note was accusatory and sloppy . Again - as discussed in my initial email inquiry - the reason for the return was that these gloves looked as though they had been worn many times - though I had worn them only lightly for a short period . Their reason for refusing to exchange the gloves is the exact reason for my wish to exchange them!Leather Gloves Online has officially lost a customer .
 I was quite disappointed in the quality of the leather and the workmanship of these Italian leather silk lined dress gloves . The gloves seemed perfectly beautiful but after 3 -LRB- count them - 3 -RRB- wearings , the stitching at two fingertips has ripped open . The quality of the leather is poor and they already look shabby . I have passed the 30 days since purchase so I ca n't return them .

 I have bought a lot of bras and this is the worst.Notflattering and it was the right size but just a lousy style and comfort .
 Did n't hold up like i thought , and do n't fit Narrow at the bottom , although it appears that support excellent but it is not .
 This bra will not help your posture . I tried three different sizes and they did not fit . All were returned to Amazon . Playtex should be required to take `` posture bra '' out of the name of this product , because it 's false advertising .
 Did n't hold up like i thought it would lost its shape afer only two hand washings will not buy this product again
